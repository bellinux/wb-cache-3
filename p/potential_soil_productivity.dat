40|$|The soil {{resource}} {{is one of}} the most influential factors in determining the manner in which agricultural land is used. However, external factors such as culture, economics, and market demand also contribute to land use decisions and in some cases may disproportionately influence utilization of the {{soil resource}}. History has shown that the result of allowing land use decisions to be disproportionately influenced by external factors may result in the misuse and consequent over-utilization of the soil resource. Alternatively, the underutilization of the soil resource may inhibit the ability of the land owners to fully realize the economic return available from their land. This dissertation compares land use patterns on two politically and culturally disparate, yet geographically adjacent land areas. Land use is evaluated on the Standing Rock reservation in North and South Dakota, and compared with the land use patterns in the area immediately surrounding the reservation, for the purpose of identifying whether land use decisions are influenced by location with respect to the reservation. In addition, the potential productivity of the soil resource within both study sites is evaluated and correlated with land use to determine whether the two sites utilize productive soils in the same way. Finally, the various land ownership categories on the reservation are correlated with land use and also with <b>potential</b> <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> to identify any differences in land use and potential productivity within the reservation. The results of this research indicate that land use patterns as well as potential productivity are significantly different on the reservation in comparison to the land surrounding the reservation. In addition, land use and potential productivity within the reservation vary, depending upon whether the land is under Indian or non-Indian ownership. ...|$|E

We carried out the study to assess the effects of chicken manure on soil chemical properties and the response of application rate on the yield of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) {{as well as the}} uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. To quantify these effects, we added chicken manure to samples of Calcisols, Arenosols and Luvisols at application rates: 5, 10, 20 and 40 % chicken manure. The addition of chicken manure irrespective of application rate did not change the acidity or pH of Calcisol, suggesting its hypo-buffering capacity. While the results reveal increases of EC with increasing rate, at rate above 40 %, the ECs were above the critical salinity level of 4 mS/cm indicating <b>potential</b> threat to <b>soil</b> <b>productivity.</b> The exchangeable bases increased with application rate, suggesting the positive effects of chicken manure in enhancing soil fertility. Similarly significant increase of nitrogen and phosphorus were observed following the addition of chicken manure. Initially the spinach yield increases up to optimum rate of 0. 06, 0. 07 and 0. 16 g/plant for Luvisol, Arenosol and Calcisol, respectively and subsequently drops after critical threshold values; 15, 5 and 1 % for Calcisol, Arenosol and Luvisol, respectively. Interestingly above the rate of 40 %, the yield was almost zero for all soils, suggesting the ineffectiveness of chicken manure in enhancing <b>soil</b> <b>productivity...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} and survival or disappearance of civilizations {{has been based}} on the performance of soils to provide food, fibre, and further essential goods for humans. Amongst soil functions, the capacity to produce plant biomass (productivity function) remains essential. This function is closely associated with the main global issues of the 21 st century like food security, demands of energy and water, carbon balance and climate change. A standardised methodology for assessing the productivity function of the global soil resource consistently over different spatial scales will be demanded by a growing international community of land users and stakeholders for achieving high <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> in the context of sustainable multifunctional use of soils. We analysed available methods for assessing the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> function. The aim was to find potentials, deficiencies and gaps in knowledge of current approaches towards a global reference framework. Our main findings were (i) that the soil moisture and thermal regime, which are climate-influenced, are the main constraints to the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>potential</b> on a global scale, and (ii) that most taxonomic soil classification systems including the World Reference Basis for Soil Resources provide little information on soil functionality in particular the productivity function. We found (iii) a multitude of approaches developed at the national and local scale in the last century for assessing mainly specific aspects of <b>potential</b> <b>soil</b> and land <b>productivity.</b> Their <b>soil</b> data inputs differ, evaluation ratings are not transferable and thus not applicable in international and global studies. At an international level or global scale, methods like agro-ecological zoning or ecosystem and crop modelling provide assessments of land productivity but contain little soil information. Those methods are not intended for field scale application to detect main soil constraints and thereby to derive soil management and conservation recommendations in situ. We found also, that (iv) soil structure is a crucial criterion of agricultural soil quality and methods of visual soil assessment like the Peerlkamp scheme, the French method "Le profil cultural" and the New Zealand Visual Soil Assessment are powerful tools for recognising dynamic agricultural soil quality and controlling soil management processes at field scale. We concluded that these approaches have potential to be integrated into an internationally applicable assessment framework of the <b>soil's</b> <b>productivity</b> function, working from field scale to the global level. This framework needs to serve as a reference base for ranking <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>potentials</b> on a global scale and as an operational tool for controlling further soil degradation and desertification. Methods like the multi-indicator-based Muencheberg Soil Quality Rating meet most criteria of such a framework. This method has potential to act as a global overall assessment method of the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> function for cropping land and pastoral grassland but needs further evolution by testing and amending its indicator thresholds...|$|R
30|$|It was {{not unusual}} for the {{respondents}} to associate perceived existence of good soils with forage availability. This is because pastoralists have robust knowledge of soils and soil quality; their soil classification is often based on the <b>productivity</b> of such <b>soils</b> on a given landscape. In {{a study conducted among}} the Maasai, Oba and Kaitira (2006) documented classification of degradation based on soils as one of the indicators, and a perceived variation of forage availability and grazing patterns depending on soils in a given landscape. Similarly, among the Orma, the Afar and the Karamojong (Turkana and Karamojong of Uganda), forage availability and quality has been documented to be consonant with the soils and soil moisture of a given landscape (Oba 1998; Notenbaert et al. 2007; Oba 2012). Similarly to a study by Oba (2012), we found, through informal interviews and focus group discussions, associative existence of landscape grazing <b>potentials</b> to perceived <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> and forage availability patterns. For example, the sandy landscapes (eketela) were perceived to experience heavier grazing than the black soil (arro) landscapes. This is because the arro is grazed during the dry season, thus associated with better forage availability compared to the eketela.|$|R

Here, we focused on the Yunnan province, a typical mountainous region in southwest China, where <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> {{plays a key role in}} agricultural development. The objectives were to assess spatial variation and sustainable utilization of <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> in the Yunnan province. We constructed a soil database based on 706 soil profiles collected from China's second national soil survey, and assessed <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> with a <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index model. We found significant differences in the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> indexes among <b>soil</b> types; the indexes ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 85 and averaged 0. 47. Higher <b>productivity</b> <b>soils</b> generally occurred in forest areas within the west and northwest sub-regions of Yunnan, while lower <b>productivity</b> <b>soils</b> tend to be located at low or extremely high elevations. The <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index was lowest for barren land, followed by dry farmland, grassland, paddy fields, horticultural land, and forest lands. We found the productivity index to increase significantly as latitude increased and to vary with altitude at lower elevations. The <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index ranged from 0. 32 to 0. 61 generally from the southeast sub-region to the northwest sub-region. Conversion of forest land or grassland to dry farmland may seriously degrade <b>soil</b> <b>productivity.</b> Local governments should consider <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> conservation practices when seeking to exploit land resources in mountainous areas.

40|$|Biochar {{application}} to <b>soil</b> has the <b>potential</b> to increase <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> while reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. However, techniques for conditioning this material for maximizing its effects as a soil amendment require elucidation. We examined changes {{of organic matter}} associated with two biochars after 175 d of composting and the resulting effects on GHG emissions during a 150 -d incubation period. Composting decreased the amount of organic compounds that could be thermally released from the biochars and affected their molecular nature. These thermally desorbable organic compounds from initial biochars likely stimulated the oxidation of CH 4 and inhibited the production of N 2 O in soil–biochar mixtures. However, these reductions of GHG emissions disappeared together with thermally desorbable organic compounds after the composting of chars. Instead, addition of composted gasification coke and charcoal stimulated the formation of CH 4 and increased N 2 O emissions by 45 to 56 %. Nitrous oxide emissions equaled 20 % of {{the total amount of}} N added with composted biochars, suggesting that organic compounds and N sorbed by the chars during composting fueled GHG production. The transient nature of the suppression of CH 4 and N 2 O production challenges the long-term GHG mitigation potential of biochar in soil...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstractSoil loss {{tolerance}} (T) is {{a widely}} used concept for assessing <b>potential</b> risks of <b>soil</b> erosion and is a criterion for assessing the effectiveness of {{soil and water conservation}} projects. However, current approaches for calculating T values lack a strong scientific basis, and few practicable methods are available. Many questions remain regarding which parameters, such as planning periods and offset damages, should be included in calculating T values. Here, we developed a new method to calculate soil loss tolerance {{as a function of the}} <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index (SPI) for farmland. To achieve sustainable <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> in farmland, erosion rates leading to SPI values lower than the lower boundary of <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> (SPI 0) are not tolerable and must be controlled by soil conservation measures. We applied this method in the Red River Basin of China based on the investigation of typical soil profiles and crop yields. Our results show that the T values in the Red River Basin ranged from 0. 91 to 10. 24  t ha− 1  a− 1. The SPI 0 and the lowest limit of soil loss tolerance (T 1) were 0. 4 and 0. 91  t ha− 1  a− 1, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that, when determining T values in farmland, (1) the soil formation rate and offset damage should not be core items, (2) the “planning period” concept should be replaced by “sustainability”, (3) the management objective of T should be the sustainability of the soil resource, and (4) the T values of farmland should be determined according to <b>soil</b> <b>productivity.</b> We provide a reasonable and feasible method to determine T for farmland, which will help maintain the sustainability of <b>soil</b> <b>productivity...</b>|$|R

In 2012, this cropland was divided in three equally sized blocks. Three treatments {{were performed on}} these blocks with different simulated rainfall intensities and farming methods: (1) high rainfall intensity (1. 5 - 1. 7 mm min− 1), no-tillage operation; (2) low rainfall intensity (0. 5 - 0. 7 mm min− 1), no-tillage operation; and (3) low rainfall intensity, tillage operation.

In the theoretical part, legislation of protection of agricultural land, spatial planning and land cadastre in Slovenia are presented. They are crucial for understanding the implementation {{and use of the}} land productivity index for the determination of agricultural land use. The focus is on current “Agricultural Land Act”, which was introduced in 1996, with amendments, in particular the amendment from 2011, which has brought a new categorization of agricultural land with two categories: prime agricultural land conservation areas (TVKZ) and other agricultural areas (OKZ). The thesis presents analytical studies of the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index in thirteen municipalities in Pomurje region in order to determine whether the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index of agricultural land is a suitable criterion for determining the areas of TVKZ and OKZ. For each municipality the average value of <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index and distribution of agricultural land considering <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index classes was determined. Furthermore, the analysis of the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index of agricultural land in drainage areas and in areas of permanent crops (plantations) was conducted, and the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index was analyzed considering the slope of the terrain. The thesis provides results of three versions of TVKZ and OKZ areas for all thirteen municipalities, which are than compared with the areas of the old agricultural land classification, i. e. with the best agricultural land (K 1) and other agricultural land (K 2). The results of our research confirmed the suitability of the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> index for determining the areas of TVKZ and OKZ.

Soil has always been important to humans and their health, providing a resource that can be used for shelter and food production. Higher heavy metals concentration within soils has beenshown to be toxic for human bodies, since they might be broken out easily via dust or direct contact through trophic levels.

Inorganic-N concentration in the tree hedge plots was {{higher than in the}} control and napier barrier plots after 20 months. Napier grass barriers were the most effective in reducing erosion losses across the two seasons. The effectiveness of napier grass to significantly reduce soil erosion was detectable in one year old napier barriers. Soil loss from all the other one year old vegetative treatmentswas similar to soil loss from the control. Seventeen month old combination hedge plots recorded lower soil losses than tree hedges of the same age (P = 0. 012). Maize crop yields throughout the trial period were high and similar for leguminous and combination hedge plots, but lower in the napier grass and control plots. Overall, we observed that the combination hedges seemed to provide a win-win scenario of reduction in soil erosion combined with improvement of maize crop yields and soil fertility enhancement. We conclude that vegetative hedges have a <b>potential</b> for improving <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> in arable steep-lands of the central highlands of Kenya, and that in adoption of vegetative hedges for this purpose there are trade-offs between soil conservation, soil fertility and maize crop yields to be considered...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: China's food {{production}} has increased 6 -fold {{during the past}} half-century, thanks to increased yields resulting from the management intensification, accomplished through greater inputs of fertilizer, water, new crop strains, and other Green Revolution's technologies. Yet, changes in underlying quality of soils and their effects on yield increase remain to be determined. Here, we provide a first attempt to quantify historical changes in inherent <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> and {{their contributions to the}} increase in yield. METHODS: The assessment was conducted based on data-set derived from 7410 on-farm trials, 8 long-term experiments and an inventory of soil organic matter concentrations of arable land. RESULTS: Results show that even without organic and inorganic fertilizer addition crop yield from on-farm trials conducted in the 2000 s was significantly higher compared with those in the 1980 s - the increase ranged from 0. 73 to 1. 76 Mg/ha for China's major irrigated cereal-based cropping systems. The increase in on-farm yield in control plot since 1980 s was due primarily to the enhancement of soil-related factors, and reflected inherent <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> improvement. The latter led to higher and stable yield with adoption of improved management practices, and contributed 43 % to the increase in yield for wheat and 22 % for maize in the north China, and, 31 %, 35 % and 22 % for early and late rice in south China and for single rice crop in the Yangtze River Basin since 1980. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, without an improvement in inherent <b>soil</b> <b>productivity,</b> the 'Agricultural Miracle in China' would not have happened. A comprehensive strategy of inherent <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> improvement in China, accomplished through combining engineering-based measures with biological-approaches, may be an important lesson for the developing world. We propose that advancing food security in 21 st century for both China and other parts of world will depend on continuously improving inherent <b>soil</b> <b>productivity...</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to having long residence times, char {{has been shown to}} contribute significantly to long-term <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> (Lehmann 2007, DeLuca and Aplet 2008). Char matter adsorbs nutrients in plant-available form (cation exchange capacity) more so than other soil organic matter due to its greater surface area, greater negative surface charge, and greater charge density (Lehmann 2007). The porous structure of char also contributes to lower soil bulk density and higher water retention capacity (DeLuca and Aplet 2008). These properties may sustain <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> even under prolonged weathering or agricultural use (e.g., wet tropical environments) (Lehmann et al. 2003).|$|R

That is the key message of the author as he builds upon a technical study of factors entwined with <b>soil</b> <b>productivity.</b> Integrated fertiliser management including a keen use of organic and mineral fertiliser, an appropriate soil management strategy and effective water management are key elements when dealing with harsh and erratic climatic conditions. Finally, he calls {{for a range of}} institutional measures: active environmental pressure groups in every country to monitor activities related to environment, and effective international linkages among research institutions.
