25|$|Impatient to {{complete}} his epic cycle, Wagner began work on the <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> of Götterdämmerung on 2 October 1869, {{while he was still}} at work on the third act of Siegfried. There was to be no fair copy of this the final opera in the cycle, so the three acts passed through just three stages: <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> (Gesamtentwurf), orchestral draft (Orchesterskizze), and full score (Partiturerstschrift). Wagner had altered his modus operandi once again while at work on the last two acts of Die Meistersinger: now it was his practice to finish both complete drafts of each act in turn before beginning the full score of the entire opera.|$|E
25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1871 both drafts of the Prologue and Act I were {{finished}} and Wagner had begun the <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> of Act II. The orchestral draft was not begun, however, until 18 November of the same year. Act II was completed {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E
25|$|When Wagner came {{to compose}} Siegfried, he made three {{significant}} alterations to his modus operandi. Firstly, he wrote (in ink and {{on at least}} three staves) a developed draft between the <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> and the full score; this intermediate draft included most of the orchestral details of the final score; this procedure, Wagner hoped, would facilitate {{the writing of the}} full score, obviating the difficulties he had encountered during the composition of Die Walküre. Secondly, he composed one act at a time, carrying the composition of the music through all three stages from <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> to full score (but not necessarily fair copy) for the first act before proceeding to the composition of the second act; this way he ensured that as little time as possible elapsed between the initial drafting of a passage and its final orchestration. Thirdly, he frequently worked on the various drafts at the same time, orchestrating the earlier scenes of an act while still drafting the later ones.|$|E

25|$|Orchestral Draft (Orchesterskizze) – in the {{composition}} of the third act of Siegfried and all three acts of Götterdämmerung, the <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> was followed by an elaborate short score written in ink on two or three vocal staves and as many as five instrumental staves. These Orchesterskizzen, as Wagner himself styled them, are even more detailed than the developed drafts of the first two acts of Siegfried.|$|E
25|$|Work on the <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> of Act III {{began on}} 4 January 1872, {{followed}} shortly thereafter by the orchestral draft. The former was finished on 9 April {{and the latter}} on 22 July. In April of that year, the Wagners left Tribschen and settled in Bayreuth, the small town in Bavaria where a festival theatre was to be constructed for the premiere of the Ring. A year later, on 28 April 1873, they moved into Wahnfried, Wagner's new mansion in Bayreuth.|$|E

25|$|As we have seen, Wagner {{sketched out}} {{the theme for}} the Ride of the Valkyries on 23 July 1851; other than this, the {{earliest}} musical sketches for Die Walküre date from the summer of 1852. But {{it was not until}} 28 June 1854 that Wagner began to transform these into a complete draft of all three acts of the opera. This <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> (Gesamtentwurf), which was completed by 27 December 1854, was written in pencil and shows a greater degree of orchestral elaboration than the corresponding draft of Das Rheingold.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} said that twelve years elapsed between {{the second and third}} acts of Siegfried, but this is an exaggeration. While it is true that eleven years and twenty-nine weeks passed between the {{completion}} of the developed draft of Act II {{and the beginning of the}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> of Act III, Wagner devoted more than a year of this so-called hiatus to the composition of Siegfried, completing the fair copy of Act I, drawing up both the full score and fair copy of Act II, and making sketches for Act III.|$|E
25|$|Instrumentation Draft (Partiturerstschrift) – in {{the case}} of the four scenes of Das Rheingold, the <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> was {{followed}} by what Wagner termed an Instrumentationsskizze, in which he worked out most of the orchestral details. This draft was written in pencil and on as many staves as were required by the instrumentation. It is thus but one remove from being a full score, and in WWV both are referred to by the same name. The instrumental prelude that precedes Scene 1 was not included in the instrumentation draft, however, but was written out in ink in full score without any intermediate stage, as is explained below.|$|E

25|$|This hiatus, however, did {{not last}} as long as Wagner had anticipated. On 13 July 1857 he took up the work again and {{finished}} Act II within four weeks, the <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> being completed on 30 July and the developed draft on 9 August. The full score of the first act was now complete (in pencil), and a fair copy had been made (in ink) of the opening scene; the developed draft of the second act was finished, but the full score had not yet been begun. At this point Wagner once again put the opera aside to concentrate on Tristan und Isolde. Seven years would pass before he took it up again, during which time he completed Tristan and started Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.|$|E
25|$|With Wagner's exile from Bavaria in December 1865, a third hiatus ensued in the {{composition}} of Siegfried, during which Wagner completed Die Meistersinger. Work on Siegfried was resumed at the start of 1869 and on 23 February the fair copies of Acts I and II were finally completed. A week later, on 1 March, Wagner began {{the composition}} of Act III. Working from sketches dating from around 1864 and thereafter, he proceeded to make a <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> of the entire act, as was his usual practice. This was completed fifteen weeks later on 14 June. The second complete draft – the orchestral draft (see above) – was finished on 5 August. The full score was begun on 25 August and completed on 5 February 1871. As explained above, Wagner never made a fair copy of the third act of Siegfried.|$|E
25|$|The <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> plan of 1992 envisaged {{speeds of}} 250km/h with a journey time between Nuremberg and Erfurt of 75minutes. The planned costs were DM 8 billion (about €4 billion). Already in 1993, before the {{beginning}} of construction, the route handled 80passenger trains during the day and 200freight trains at night. In 1992, five options were developed that would have passed through a 20kilometre-wide corridor, one of which was immediately rejected. A route through Coburg that would have required the demolition of existing buildings was also considered. At first the use of the existing line south of Coburg with a new line commencing on its southern approach had been considered as the favoured option. The Thuringian Forest would have been crossed at its narrowest point, but {{there would have been no}} stop in Coburg. In a citizens’ initiative, Coburg citizens collected 13,000 signatures against the route.|$|E
50|$|A law {{went into}} effect in 1790 {{requiring}} prints to bear a censor's seal of approval to be sold. Censorship increased in strictness over the following decades, and violators could receive harsh punishments. From 1799 even <b>preliminary</b> <b>drafts</b> required approval. A group of Utagawa-school offenders including Toyokuni had their works repressed in 1801, and Utamaro was imprisoned in 1804 for making prints of 16th-century political and military leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi.|$|R

5000|$|In 1561, upon Vermigli's recommendation, Frederick III, Elector Palatine, {{appointed}} him {{professor in the}} Collegium Sapientiae at Heidelberg, where in 1562/63, having been commissioned by the Prince elector, he supplied the <b>preliminary</b> <b>drafts</b> for the Heidelberg Catechism and participated in the final revision of the document alongside other theologians and church leaders. Caspar Olevianus (1536-1587) was formerly asserted as a co-author of the document, though this theory has been largely discarded by modern scholarship.|$|R
25|$|The {{composition}} of Das Rheingold occupied Wagner from 1 November 1853 to 26 September 1854. He began {{by developing a}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> (Gesamtentwurf) of the entire work from his sketches. This 77-page draft, which was written in pencil and on two (sometimes three) staves, was completed by 14 January 1854. The following month (1 February) he proceeded to make a second complete draft. It seems that his first intention {{was to make a}} composition draft in ink, just as he had done for Lohengrin, but as such a draft of the opening Prelude – which consists of little more than an arpeggiated E♭ major triad – would have been to all intents and purposes a full score, he decided to skip the intermediate stage and draft the full score in ink right away. This he proceeded to do with the Prelude, significantly revising some of its details in the process. When, however, he reached the beginning of Scene 1, he found that the remainder of the opera required too much revision and elaboration to allow him to develop a full score without first making a second complete draft. He therefore abandoned the full score in ink and proceeded to develop instead an instrumentation draft in pencil, in which he worked out most of the vocal and orchestral details of the four remaining scenes. This Instrumentationsskizze, as Wagner himself styled it, was completed by 28 May 1854.|$|E
500|$|In September 1877 {{he began}} the music by making two {{complete}} drafts of the score from beginning to end. The first of these (known in German as the [...] and in English as either the <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Draft</b> or the First Complete Draft) was made in pencil on three staves, one for the voices and two for the instruments. The second complete draft ( [...] , Orchestral Draft, Short Score or Particell) was made in ink and on at least three, but sometimes as many as five, staves. This draft was much more detailed than the first and contained a considerable degree of instrumental elaboration.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>Draft</b> (Gesamtentwurf) – {{the first}} {{complete}} draft in pencil (later traced over in ink) {{of the entire}} work (in {{the case of the}} first two Ring operas) or of an entire act (in the case of the last two). There is generally only one vocal stave and one or two instrumental staves. Instrumental interludes are sometimes elaborated on three staves. The <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> for Das Rheingold was similar in detail to the one Wagner composed for Lohengrin, but those of the following three Ring operas were as detailed as Lohengrin's second complete draft (the so-called [...] "composition draft").|$|E
5000|$|Valerio Baldassari (c.1650 - after 1695) was an Italian {{painter of}} the Baroque period. He {{was born in}} Pescia, and trained with Pietro Dandini. He {{is said to have}} labored with such [...] "speedy flair" ... that his works look rather like <b>preliminary</b> <b>drafts</b> that {{finished}} paintings" [...] ("lavorava ogni cosa con quella tale sprezzatura... di modo che le sue opere sembrano piuttosto abozzi che pitture terminate"). He is also known as Baldissari.|$|R
25|$|Developed Draft (Orchesterskizze) – in {{the case}} of Siegfried (Acts I and II), the <b>preliminary</b> <b>drafts</b> were {{elaborated}} before Wagner proceeded to develop the full scores. In these intermediate drafts, he worked out all the orchestral details, including instrumental doublings. The developed drafts for the first two acts of Siegfried are in ink and are written on one vocal and two instrumental staves throughout. In WWV these developed drafts are called Orchesterskizzen, a term which WWV also employs to describe the more elaborate second drafts of the later acts of the Ring.|$|R
2500|$|The idea of Túrin {{changing}} {{his name to}} escape his doom is present already in the original versions of the tale, although to a lesser extent. The name Turambar goes to <b>preliminary</b> <b>drafts,</b> where however it was taken by Túrin at his first encounter with Glaurung after the latter had [...] "revealed" [...] to Túrin that he was cursed. Blacksword also appears there, as a side-name; in addition Túrin {{is said to have}} called himself [...] "Turambar son of the weary forest" [...] when he returned to Dor-lómin, with Quenya form Rúsitaurion and Gnomish bo-Dhrauthodavros.|$|R
2500|$|Almost {{two months}} elapsed {{before he began}} work on Act II; the prelude, Fafners Ruhe ("Fafner's Rest") was sketched on 20 May 1857, while the <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> was begun on 22 May, the composer's forty-fourth birthday. On 18 June, he began the {{developed}} draft while still working on the preliminary draft; but later that same month he dropped the work (at the point where Siegfried rests himself beneath the linden tree) to concentrate on Tristan und Isolde. The <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> reached this point on the 26th, and the developed draft on the 27th. It seems that Wagner was tiring of the Ring and he considered putting it aside for a while: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{advance of}} the 1969 {{decision}} on {{the form of the}} revision of the liturgy, a <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> of two sections of the Roman Missal was published. The section containing the unvarying part of the Mass is called Ordo Missae (Order of Mass) since at least 1634.|$|E
2500|$|Discounting {{the earlier}} {{sketches}} {{he had made}} for Der junge [...] Siegfried (summer 1851), the composition of Siegfried was begun in Zürich in September 1856. The developed draft was begun on 22 September, almost immediately after the (undated) <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft.</b> The full score was begun on 11 October, so Wagner was working on all three stages at the same time. On 19 December, however, he began to sketch some themes for Tristan und Isolde; {{from this point on}} there were to be many interruptions in the composition of Siegfried. Nevertheless, by 31 March 1857 the full score of Act I was finished. Sometime thereafter Wagner began to make a fair copy, but he abandoned this task after just one scene.|$|E
