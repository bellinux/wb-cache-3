The main idea underlying {{the paper is}} to exploit {{the fact that in}} signed digit arithmetic the carry operation is confined to neighbor digits. The usage of a “carry free ” adder implies some advantages in terms of error detection, fault localization and repair. For the detection standpoint a <b>parity</b> <b>checker</b> can be easily applied to detect errors caused by faults belonging to a the considered stuck-at fault set. Regarding the fault localization the “carry free ” property of the adder ensures the confinement of the error due to a permanent fault only to few digits.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{methodology}} {{for the development}} of fault-tolerant adders based on the Radix 2 Signed Digit (SD) representation is presented. The use of a number representation characterized by a carry propagation confined to neighbor digits implies interesting advantages in terms of error detection, fault localization, and repair. Errors caused by faults belonging to a considered stuck-at fault set can be detected by a parity-based technique. In fact, a carry-free adder preserving the parity of the augends can be implemented allowing fault detection by using a <b>parity</b> <b>checker.</b> Regarding fault localization, the “carry-free ” property of the adder ensures the confinement of the error due to a permanent fault to only few digits. The detection of the faulty digit has been obtained by using a recomputation with shifted operands method. Finally, after the fault localization, graceful degradation of the system intended as the reduction of the performances versus a correct output computation can be obtained by using two different procedures. The first one allows obtaining the correct output by recomputing the result performing two different shift operations and using the intersection of the obtained results to recover the correct output, while the second one is based on a reduced dynamic range approach, which allows us to obtain the result in only one step, but with fewer output digits.

D. thesis dissertation, essential mechanisms related to the semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) based device such as the gain and phase dynamics when a short pulse in propagating inside SOA, and, all-optical Boolean function, XOR, AND and OR have been studied. ^ In order to realize the all-optical logic using SOA, the nonlinear gain and phase dynamics in SOA need to be studied first. The experimental results of 10 [...] 90 % gain recovery curve have been presented. The recovery time is related to the carrier lifetime of the SOA and it varies with gain compression and bias current. For pulse width of a few picosecond, intraband effects need to be considered. In the SOA, phase change is also induced when a short pulse is propagating inside SOA. Unlike the conventional way of estimating the phase shift using alpha factor, the maximum phase shift is obtained first, then the effective alpha factor is calculated. ^ The experimental results of all optical Boolean function XOR and OR at 80 Gb/s are presented using SOA-MZI-DI and SOA-DI respectively. These are the highest operating speed that has been reported. The all optical AND operation at 40 Gb/s using SOA-MZI have also been reported here. The numerical simulation shows that the performance of these all-optical Boolean operations is limited by the carrier lifetime of the SOA. ^ The Boolean functions are the first step towards all optical circuits.

40|$|A high {{throughput}} scalable decoder architecture, a tiling {{approach to}} reduce {{the complexity of the}} scalable architecture, and two low power decoding schemes have been proposed in this research. The proposed scalable design is generated from a serial architecture by scaling the combinational logic; memory partitioning and constructing a novel H matrix to make parallelization possible. The scalable architecture achieves a high throughput for higher values of the parallelization factor M. The switch logic used to route the bit nodes to the appropriate checks is an important constituent of the scalable architecture and its complexity is high with higher M. The proposed tiling approach is applied to the scalable architecture to simplify the switch logic and reduce gate complexity. The tiling approach generates patterns that are used to construct the H matrix by repeating a fixed number of those generated patterns. The advantages of the proposed approach are two-fold. First, the information stored about the H matrix is reduced by onethird. Second, the switch logic of the scalable architecture is simplified. The H matrix information is also embedded in the switch and no external memory is needed to store the H matrix. Scalable architecture and tiling approach are proposed at the architectural level of the LDPC decoder. We propose two low power decoding schemes that take advantage of the distribution of errors in the received packets. Both schemes use a hard iteration after a fixed number of soft iterations. The dynamic scheme performs X soft iterations, then a <b>parity</b> <b>checker</b> cHT that computes the number of parity checks in error. Based on cHT value, the decoder decides on performing either soft iterations or a hard iteration. The advantage of the hard iteration is so significant that the second low power scheme performs a fixed number of iterations followed by a hard iteration. To compensate the bit error rate performance, the number of soft iterations in this case is higher than that of those performed before cHT in the first scheme...|$|E
40|$|Preface This volume {{contains}} a tutorial on the HOL system. It {{is one of}} three documents making up the documentation for HOL: (i) TUTORIAL: a tutorial introduction to HOL. (ii) DESCRIPTION: a description of higher order logic, the ML programming language, and theorem proving methods in the HOL system; (iii) REFERENCE: the reference documentation of the tools available in HOL. These three documents will be referred to by the short names (in small slanted capitals) given above. This document, TUTORIAL, is intended to be the first item read by new users of HOL. It provides a self-study introduction to the structure and use of the system. The tutorial is intended to give a `hands-on ' feel for the way HOL is used, but it does not systematically explain all the underlying principles (DESCRIPTION, explains these). After working through TUTORIAL the reader should be capable of using HOL for simple tasks, and should also {{be in a position to}} consult the other two documents. Getting started Chapter 1 explains how to get and install HOL. Once this is done, the potential HOL user should become familiar with the following subjects: 1. The programming meta-language ML, and how to interact with it through an editor. 2. The formal logic supported by the HOL system (higher order logic) and its manipulation via ML. 3. Forward proof and derived rules of inference. 4. Goal directed proof, tactics and tacticals. Chapters 1 - 3 introduce the first two of these topics. Chapter 4 then develops an extended example (Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes) to demonstrate how HOL is iii iv Preface used to prove theorems. This example is intended to demonstrate HOL's capabilities and to explain some of the issues at a high level. Chapters 5 and 6 then describe forward and goal directed proof in much greater detail.

40|$|UnrestrictedAs CMOS scaling continues, {{feature size}} {{approaches}} molecular dimensions {{and the number}} of devices per chip reaches astronomical values. It becomes more and more difficult to reach desired yield levels. This motivates new models of design and test. One of such models is called error-tolerance, which permits defective chips with acceptable performance to be used in systems. One key issue of error-tolerance is how to justify the acceptability of a defective chip.; This thesis considers two of many metrics of acceptability of defective chips. One is error-rate, which indicates how often on average an error is seen at the output when random input patterns are applied. The other is significance-based error-rate (SBER). SBER is also about the frequency of the occurrence of errors, but it only counts those errors whose error-significance is greater than a threshold. The main work of this thesis is developing techniques based on built-in self-test (BIST) architecture to estimate error-rate and SBER, and to classify chips by error-rate and SBER.; This thesis consists of three main parts. In the first part, we present the technique of error-rate estimation based on signature analysis. For this technique, we develop the estimator and investigate the statistical characteristics of the estimator. We further develop procedures of estimating error-rate and classifying chips by error-rate, and discuss the selection of test parameters for both procedures.; In the second part, we revisit the technique of error-rate estimation based on ones counting. A new estimator is developed. Similar to the estimator based on signature analysis, its statistical characteristics are investigated, and the selection of test parameters is discussed for the procedure of estimating error-rate and classifying chips. We also extend this technique to multiple output circuits. By using <b>parity</b> <b>checker</b> and mod- 4 circuits, we are able to estimate the error-rate of multiple output circuits excluding errors in which the number of ones in the observed output minus the number of ones in the correct output is a multiple of 4.; In the last part, we identify three scenarios of SBER estimation, namely when (1) there are multiple copies of the target circuit and at least one defect-free copy exists and is known, (2) multiple copies of the target circuit exist and all can be defective, and (3) a single copy of the target circuit exists. We develop different SBER estimation methods for the above scenarios.; Experimental results have shows that all our estimation methods use much less storage than the method using Bernoulli process, assuming the latter requires the storage of correct signatures...|$|E
