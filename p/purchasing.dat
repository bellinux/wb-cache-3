5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Oslo Sporveier was {{in need of}} new trams to operate on their network. Except for 40 {{articulated}} SL79-trams that had been delivered between 1982 and 1990, the company had several series of non-articulated trams with trailers that were built before 1960. The largest series were 13 SM53s, 11 rebuilt SM83s and 28 trailers, in addition to 34 SM91s that had been bought used from the Gothenburg Tramway in 1991. Oslo Sporveier considered several possibilities for new trams, including ordering additional SL79s, <b>purchasing</b> motorized trailers for SL79, <b>purchasing</b> new low-floor trams, <b>purchasing</b> trams from ÄŒKD Tatra, <b>purchasing</b> the 11 used TT Class 8 trams from Trondheim, rebuild the SL79s with an additional section or <b>purchasing</b> used articulated trams from abroad. <b>Purchasing</b> used material and rebuilding the SL79s was quickly rejected. A non-articulated Tatra tram was tested in Oslo during January 1991.|$|E
5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate <b>purchasing</b> power. Low <b>purchasing</b> power {{means that}} the real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low <b>purchasing</b> power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the costs associated with}} staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during the shutdown. The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during the shutdown, which meant the state could have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would come to a halt by mid-August if no more tax stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing liquor <b>purchasing</b> cards, which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their liquor <b>purchasing</b> cards before the shutdown. However, the <b>purchasing</b> cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} the shutdown, July 1. Liquor <b>purchasing</b> cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the decision-making process}} of customers focusing on how <b>purchase</b> intention is transformed into actual <b>purchase.</b> Specifically, we investigate 1) how <b>purchase</b> intention is formed, 2) how <b>purchase</b> intention drives action, and 3) what factors stand between <b>purchase</b> intention and action. After reviewing literature on <b>purchase</b> intention and action, and the product evaluation mechanisms employed by the customer, we propose the following hypotheses. First, product value has {{a positive impact on}} <b>purchase</b> intention (H 1). Second, <b>purchase</b> intention increases the probability of <b>purchase</b> (H 2) and third, the relationship between <b>purchase</b> intention and <b>purchase</b> will be moderated by uncertainty levels in product valuation (H 3). To validate, we conduct a survey regarding four types of products and collect data from 300 respondents. Regression and Probit analyses methods are used for validation. H 1 and H 2 are supported while H 3 is partially supported. This study challenges the conventional notion that customers with high <b>purchase</b> intentions will necessarily move to the <b>purchase</b> stage. To this end, we examine the relationship between <b>purchase</b> intention and <b>purchase,</b> and find that uncertainty in valuation moderates the relationship...|$|R
