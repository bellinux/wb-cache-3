25|$|There are {{proposals}} to construct monorails in Penang, Johor Bahru, and Malacca but opposition has been vociferously expressed by Penang and Malacca residents {{concerned about the}} system being {{out of place in}} the historic downtown areas. Malacca has since focused on the less intrusive Aerorail. The federal administrative centre of Putrajaya was also supposed to have a monorail network and the main station and several metres of track have been built. However, the project has been postponed because of costs and the Malaysian government felt {{that it was not a}} <b>priority</b> <b>project</b> for the time being even though good public transportation would attract many Malaysians to re-locate to this new underpopulated city.|$|E

In {{a combination of the}} public polling and feasibility ranking, the Boathouse project was selected as the top <b>priority</b> <b>project</b> for the funding. Based on the public support and strength of the proposal the Boathouse was chosen to be funded. The Boathouse was allocated $3million from the state. The City Parks Foundation will oversee the spending and construction of the Boathouse. As of 2014, negotiations are being made for 6,500 square feet on Ash Street.|$|E
25|$|The recent decade saw a rapid {{spread of}} {{information}} technology in Russia. Over 42% of population in Russia have personal access to the Internet, and all schools and universities were provided Internet connection by 2007 {{as a part of}} the National <b>Priority</b> <b>Project</b> in Education supervised personally by Dmitry Medvedev, then vice-Prime Minister. Russia is a leading developer of software and the country enjoys a large amount of IT talent. Russian youth dominate international technology competitions like the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, where Russian universities have won five of the last ten contests. Despite this, Russia faces a shortage of IT specialists due to high demand. In 2009 Russian companies employed more than 1million IT specialists, making up 1.34% of the country's workforce. However, the figure is lower than in some other major economies, such as the United States (3.74%), United Kingdom (3.16%), and Germany (3.14%).|$|E

25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a <b>priority</b> <b>project</b> throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E
500|$|When Nintendo {{launched}} its digital distribution platform, Virtual Console, for the Wii in 2006, IGN expected EarthBound {{to be among}} Nintendo's highest priorities for rerelease, given the [...] "religious" [...] dedication of its fanbase. Though the game was ranked the most desired Virtual Console release by Nintendo Power readers, rated for release by the ESRB, and able to be published with little effort, the Wii version did not materialize. Fans commonly believed that music licensing or legal concerns secretly impeded the rerelease. (Nintendo later confirmed that the music licenses were not {{a factor in the}} rerelease.) English localizer Marcus Lindblom instead hypothesized that Nintendo did not realize the magnitude of the game's popular support and did not consider it a <b>priority</b> <b>project.</b> By 2008, Nintendo of America appeared to show little care for a rerelease.|$|E
500|$|Route64, after {{designation}} in1953, {{remained a}} short bridge along the highway. However, {{the need for}} an expressway from Trenton to the Jersey Shore remained, and in the late 1950s, the State Highway Department brought about plans for the PrincetonHightstown Bypass, a four-lane freeway that would head for [...] from U.S. Route 206 in Montgomery Township to New Jersey Route 33 in Hightstown. In the length, the freeway was to interchange with U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 130 and New Jersey Route 27. The route was re-designated as Route 92, and remained a high <b>priority</b> <b>project</b> for several decades. Even after changes in alignment, Route 64 was still an alternative. However, Route 92 was shelved on December 1, 2006 in favor of widening the New Jersey Turnpike mainline, and only New Jersey Route 133 was constructed for the proposal.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{economic}} {{justification for the}} selection of <b>priority</b> <b>projects</b> defined {{under the auspices of}} the Trans-European transport network. In analyzing the current list of 30 <b>priority</b> <b>projects,</b> we apply three different transport models to undertake a cost-benefit comparison. We find that many projects do not pass the cost-benefit test and only a few of the economically justifiable projects would need European subsidies to make them happen. Two remedies are proposed to minimize the inefficiencies in future project selection. The first remedy obliges each member state or group of states to perform a cost-benefit analysis (followed by a peer review) and to make the results public prior to ranking <b>priority</b> <b>projects.</b> The second remedy would require federal funding to be available only for projects with important spillovers to other countries, in order to avoid pork barrel behaviour. ...|$|R
