The embedded systems are electronic systems constituting electronic devices which are specially built to facilitate certain processes such as the human interaction with an environment. These systems {{play a vital role in}} an electronic application systems such as  medical diagnosis, geological investigation, surveillances, cash records, play stations and etc. The Mobile Adaptable Surveillance System for Critical Areas (MASURCA) is an embedded system wireless sensor network application system that embodies both the hardware (node) and software. In this thesis project, Development of Hardware Platform for Mobile Adaptable Surveillance System for Critical Areas, the design and development of the hardware platform for the system is built. The project deals with building the smart system comprising of radio frequency (RF) radio, global positioning system (GPS) sensor module, Accelerometer, Temperature sensor, and Ultrasonic sensor.  The design focuses on designing the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>stage</b> from a single AA battery in such a way that the entire connected components and sensors get a required supply source with best possible extended battery life. The design of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>stage</b> includes EMC, signal integrity, thermal and efficiency design considerations, and prototyping and testing of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>stage.</b>  First the sensors and the necessary design components are selected with more emphasis on their power/energy consumption, size of footprint and signal output (I 2 C-bus protocol interface capability). Then the system schematic will be designed and simulated for signal integrity and design rule using the Mentor Graphics design entry Dxdesigner and hyperlynx Analog simulator. The designed schematic is also packaged and the part is listed and the bill of material is generated so as to be able to annotate to the PCB layout and later component placement.  Likewise, the PCB layout is designed according to the Saab Training Systems AB’s standards, regulatory guidelines and standards, and the MASURCA main node system specific requirements. The project will also design and provide the mechanical enclosure kit and software development kit for the MASURCA main node hardware platform. Finally testing and evaluation of the system is done to make the hardware ready for the application implementation...|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1950s {{both the}} West German state {{railways}} (DB) and the Belgian state railways (SNCB) started planning for electrification. Belgium was committed to a 3 Kw DC network while the Germans had opted for a 15 Kw AC <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> At this <b>stage</b> dual-voltage and multi-voltage locomotives were far from mainstream in Europe, which imposed a greater level of inflexibility on decisions about where to change <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> systems and locomotives. In the end the decision was taken that for trains operating along the line from Liege to Aachen, switching of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and locomotives should be centralised some distance inside Germany, at Aachen, where the equivalent switch would also be made for trains coming from the Netherlands. An added advantage of choosing Aachen was that many international passenger trains were already held up there while being reconfigured, as blocks of carriages from the directions of Rotterdam and Brussels were split or merged for the next part of their journeys across Germany. Where this happened there was little or no incremental time-cost involved in switching locomotives at the same time. Work began on electrification of main lines in 1961, and this immediately involved some of the international trains headed towards Brussels and Ostend being rerouted onto the Montzen Route to the north, thereby avoiding Herbesthal completely. Passenger services along the branch line to the east, via Eupen to Raeren in Germany had already been ended on 28 March 1959, so that by 1961 Herbethal had also lost its function as an interchange station.|$|R

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently.

Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time.
