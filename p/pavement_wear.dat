The term 'surface course' is sometimes used, however this term is slightly different {{as it can be}} used to describe very thin surface layers such as chip seal. In rigid pavements the upper layer is a portland cement concrete slab. In flexible pavements, the upper layer consists of asphalt concrete, that is a construction aggregate with a bituminous binder. The wearing course is typically placed on the binder coarse which is then laid on the base course, which is normally placed on the subbase, which rests on the subgrade. There are various different types of flexible <b>pavement</b> <b>wearing</b> course, suitable for different situations.

40|$|In {{several large}} cities in Norway the traffic volume is high. The use of studded tires and other {{friction}} enhancing measures during winter leads to significant <b>pavement</b> <b>wear,</b> {{which in turn}} leads {{to an increase in}} the amount of airborne particulate matter, often exceeding the limits set in the ambient air regulation. This represents a nuisance or health risk for people being exposed to the pollution. According to regulations set by the European Union particulate matter is measured and regulated through mass concentration of particles less than 10 μm in diameter (PM 10). However, studies of health effects related to exposure to particulate matter have shown that particle properties like morphology and composition are essential regarding toxicity and in considering risk of developing disease. There seems to be a more complex relationship between dust pollution and health effects, which cannot be explained with just the mass concentration alone. This makes it necessary to characterize the physical and chemical properties of the road dust. Characterization of road dust particles is important to provide basis for {{a better understanding of the}} <b>pavement</b> <b>wear</b> and production of road dust and its influence on human health in urban areas. The overall purpose of this study has been to characterize particles generated from <b>pavement</b> <b>wear</b> qualitatively and quantitatively. Five papers are included in the thesis. Paper I and II present field investigations of road dust sampled in the vertical direction close to an urban road in Trondheim, Norway. In Paper III different laboratory methods have been used for simulation of <b>pavement</b> <b>wear</b> and road dust generation by studded tires. Paper IV and V describe how aggregate size, driving speeds and vehicle tires affect <b>pavement</b> <b>wear</b> and particle properties. The main conclusions from the study are: Studded tires used in the winter season in Norway are the main cause for generation of road dust from <b>pavement</b> <b>wear.</b> If studded tires were not used, there would be much less suspended particulate matter originating from wear of pavements in urban air. Studded tires produce much more dust particles from wear of pavements compared to nonstudded tires. For instance, at 60 km/h studded tires produce 30 - 40 times more TSP compared to non-studded tires on an SMA 8 pavement measured in an indoor test facility. The airborne road dust is composed of almost 90 % by weight of mineral particles under winter conditions, and approximately 50 % of the particles have size smaller than 25 μm (D 50). Based on all samples analyzed, D 10 is 3 μm and D 90 is 60 μm. However, agglomeration of particles seems to make the measured particle size distribution coarser than it really is. Studded tires generate dust with finer particle size distribution than non-studded tires. The main fraction of the particles can be described as rounded particles, with average roundness value around 0. 6. The specific surface area of the sample is dependent on the amount of organic material present in the sample and the particle size distribution. In general, field samples have higher specific surface area than dust particles generated in laboratory because of higher organic content. However, finely ground particles produced in laboratory may exhibit even higher surface area than field samples of road dust because of finer particle size distribution. Surface area is an important factor in health considerations since the reactivity of particles increase with increasing surface area. Other factors affecting the generation of particles from <b>pavement</b> <b>wear</b> are the driving speed and type of rock material used in the pavement. Test results show that the PM 10 concentration measured under laboratory conditions is reduced by 32 - 49 % when reducing the driving speed from 70 to 50 km/h, 52 - 83 % when reducing the driving speed from 50 to 30 km/h, and 76 - 89 % when reducing the driving speed from 70 to 30 km/h. The driving speed affects the particle size and the particle shape distributions. Increasing driving speed generate particles with finer particle size distribution and more irregular particles. The rock material used in the pavement affect the amount of dust generated, the composition, the particle size distribution, the shape distribution, and the specific surface area. Some mineral types are regarded harmful to health, for example quartz and asbestos which are classified as carcinogenic. The total amount of airborne dust (TSP) and PM 10 can be very different; a high TSP does not necessarily lead to a high PM 10 concentration and vice versa. This study has shown that it is possible to produce dust comparable to studded tire wear by use of simple laboratory techniques. This has significance with regard to cost because it is not necessary to build expensive test sections when the purpose is to generate and characterize the dust from <b>pavement</b> <b>wear.</b> The small scale asphalt testing procedures, Prall and Tröger, are the methods best suited to give fine material which is comparable to particles generated from the Pavement testing machine (PTM). It also seems that one can test the aggregate alone to get reasonably good samples for analysis of dust from wear by studded tires. Among the aggregate testing procedures, the Los Angeles (LA) method gives the best correlation with the PTM. The dust produced by Tröger and Prall is more similar to the dust produced in the field because the dust is generated from asphalt mixtures, while the dust produced by LA, Nordic ball mill (KM) and micro-Deval (MD) comes from the aggregate only. However, none of these methods include/simulate the effect of the car tire, only the studs. The results have shown that apart from the use of studded tires, the rock material used in the pavement has a significant influence on the airborne dust generated. It is therefore important to carefully select the rock materials for use in urban road pavements. The aggregate type affects both the amount of dust generated and the particle properties. Existing knowledge shows that the finer the particles, the greater will be their potential effects on health. Since driving speed influences both the amounts of road dust generated and the particle size distribution, one may have to consider the use of speed restrictions in urban areas in winter time to reduce the potentially hazardous effects of road dust. However, this has to be balanced against other traffic conditions such as congestion. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical <b>pavement</b> <b>wear</b> in the Nordic {{countries}} is essentially {{influenced by the}} use of studded tires during long winter seasons. The abrasive effect of the studded tires is the cause of significant damage on the pavement and a contributor to rutting. In addition, the mechanical aggregate removal due to the studded tires is the reason for significant changes in the road surface texture. At traditional dense asphalt pavements, the mechanical wear is initiated by the abrasion of the mortar, which leads to a protrusion of coarse aggregates. Regarding the noise characteristics of asphalt pavements, those texture alterations will have a negative impact. Several methods to reduce the noise emission have been investigated. However, in the Nordic countries, the reduction of maximum aggregate size in the mix design of asphalt pavements is considered {{the most efficient way to}} develop satisfactory pavement noise characteristics. The challenge is to find the right balance between the wear of the mortar and the wear of the coarse aggregates to produce a limited worn surface with positive acoustical characteristics. Within this study, common Norwegian asphalt mixture types, including different rock materials and binder types were investigated to study the effect on <b>pavement</b> <b>wear,</b> the resulting changes in surface texture and the road's noise properties. Laboratory tests were carried out to simulate the wear by studded tires. The texture characteristics were measured on the test specimens, both initially, during and after testing. In addition, <b>pavement</b> <b>wear,</b> surface texture and tire/road noise was measured on several full-scale test sections. A reduction of the maximum aggregate size causes an increase in mechanical wear by studded tires. However, by reducing the maximum aggregate size, both the initial surface texture and the surface texture of the worn pavement have a positive effect on the acoustical characteristics of the asphalt pavement. The characteristics of the rock material used for the aggregates in the asphalt mixture is crucial for the pavement service life and the development of the surface texture. By using a rock material in the fine fraction that is more resistant against the wear by studded tires than the rock material used for the aggregates in the course fraction, the wear of the pavement surface will be balanced and result in a surface texture that is favorable for little noise generation. To reduce the wear and keep positive acoustical characteristics, a gap graded asphalt mixture type is preferable...|$|E

Recent proposals to improve the efficiency of the road transport system have included options to raise the axle load limits as well as the GVM and GCM. Although the fourth power law predicts an effect, the true impact of these higher axle loads on the performance of the pavements is unknown. To determine the impact on <b>pavement</b> <b>wear,</b> an accelerated pavement test was undertaken at the Canterbury Accelerated Pavement Testing Indoor Facility (CAPTIF) to compare the wear from a 10 tonne axle with that from an 8. 2 tonne axle. The two loading units at CAPTIF were configured to be the same in all respects except load. They trafficked parallel paths on four different thin-surface pavements for approximately 1 million load cycles. The pavement was extensively monitored throughout the test. From the data collected a new empirical model of the relationship between load and vertical surface deformation has been developed. This predicts a quite different relationship between load and wear to the fourth power law and has major implications for pavement management, particularly if the mass increase is implemented, and for the road user charging regime...|$|E

Considering the predicted doubling in the road freight task by 2020, the introduction of high productivity vehicles (HPV), {{there is a need}} for developing improved analytical tools and approaches to quantify the likely impacts of these changes on <b>pavement</b> <b>wear</b> and associated economics. The development of improved tools will also assist road agencies in supporting Council Of Australian Governments reforms relating to route access/asset utilisation and full implementation of High Mass Limit. This report describes an approach/method for assessing and quantifying the economic impacts (costs and benefits) of changes in heavy vehicle fleet on road pavements at network level. The application of the approach is demonstrated by an example simulating the impacts of migration to HPV. The economic and functional impacts of HPV were quantified at national composite network level using a life cycle costing approach. The assessment involved comparative analysis of the changes in agency and user costs associated with a scenario relative to a base case. The base case included the current fleet, operating under GML and related pavement loading. The scenario included a combination of HPV and their associated pavement loading. In developing the scenario, it was assumed that the new fleet will perform the same transport task as the current fleet it is replacing. Growth in the freight task was applied for the base case and the scenario. Considering the fleet scenario tested and the assumptions made, the assessment results at network level indicate that migration to HPV has a net benefit due to the productivity gains. This scenario is associated with savings in both agency and user costs due to the reduction in the number of heavy vehicles and <b>pavement</b> <b>wear.</b> The reduction in the number of vehicles required to perform the freight task would also have social, environmental and economic benefits, which were not quantified...|$|E

Large areas have to be allocated for the disposal of this waste.

The estimate for Interstate routes includes those sections now open to traffic and those planned for completion by November 1974. The estimate for other Primary routes includes rural and municipal sections open to traffic as of November 1970. The estimate was prepared by computing the cost of expected pavement and bridge resurfacing costs for the twenty-five year period assuming continued use of studded tires, then subtracting from this the expected resurfacing) cost for the same period assuming that the use of' studded tires is prohibited. The total figure, $ 95, 620, 000, should be regarded as a conservative estimate of the cost which may be avoided by prohibiting the use of studded tires in Iowa. The conservative nature of the estimate may be demonstrated by the following examples of the guidelines used iri its preparation. 1. Only mainline pavements were included in the cost estimate for the Interstate routes. The connecting loops, exit ramps and entrance ramps at Interstate interchanges contain many additional miles of pavement subject to wear by studded tires. This pavement was omitted from the estimate because reliable ' information about the rate of <b>pavement</b> <b>wear</b> at such locations is not available. As a result, the Interstate resurfacing costs are underestimated. 2. Several other costs were also omitted from the estimate {{because of a lack of}} sufficient information. These include the cost of repairing damage caused by studded tires to city streets other than those designated as Primary routes, the damage to pavements and bridges on the more-heavily travelled Secondary roads, and the damage to pavement traffic markings on all highway systems. Experience indicates that portland cement concrete pavements in Iowa have a normal service life of twenty-five years before resurfacing becomes necessary. The service life for asphalt pavements is thirteen years. In making this cost estimate, the need for resurfacing was attributed to wear from studded tires only when the normal service life of the pavement was shortened by that wear. Consequently, this cost estimate does not account for the reduced safety and convenience to Iowa motorists during the time when <b>pavement</b> <b>wear</b> caused by studded tires is significant but less than the critical amount...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked and}} leant on her harder than ever, since amazement made me weak. We {{were in some}} vast place whereof the roof seemed almost as far off as the sky at night. At least all that I could make out was a dim and distant arch {{which might have been}} one of cloud. For the rest, in every {{direction}} stretched vastness, illuminated {{far as the eye could}} reach by the soft light of which I have spoken, that is, probably for several miles. But this vastness was not empty. On the contrary it was occupied by a great city. There were streets much wider than Piccadilly, all bordered by houses, though these, I observed, were roofless, very fine houses, some of them, built of white stone or marble. There were roadways and <b>pavements</b> <b>worn</b> by the passage of feet. There, farther on, were market-places or public squares, and there, lastly, was a huge central enclosure one or two hundred acres in extent, which was filled with majestic buildings that looked like palaces, or town-halls; and, in the midst of them all, a vast temple with courts and a central dome. For here, notwithstanding the lack of necessity, its builders seemed to have adhered to the Over-world tradition, and had roofed their fane.|$|R
60|$|Then {{came the}} reaction. Henry VIII., little able to endure such a saint as Becket, sent the {{spoilers}} to Canterbury. Lord Cromwell burnt his relics, and carried off the treasures {{of gold and}} jewels, which filled two chests, so heavy that six or eight men were wanted to carry each of them. Henry wore Louis VII.'s diamond in a ring. The costly shrine was destroyed, and the <b>pavement,</b> <b>worn</b> by the knees of the pilgrims, alone remained to show where Becket's tomb had been. In London, the house of Gilbert à Becket, in Southwark, where the Saracen lady had ended her toilsome journey, and where Thomas had been born, had, in Henry III.'s reign, been made a hospital; Edward VI. granted it for the same use; and thus it still remains, by its old name of St. Thomas's Hospital, which perhaps would not so generally be given it, if it were known after what saint it was so called. His likeness was destroyed in every church and public building, so that but one head of St. Thomas à Becket is known to exist in England--namely, one in stained glass, at the village of Horton, in Ribblesdale--and even in missals and breviaries it was defaced.|$|R
40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{guarantee}} an improved durability of Porous Asphalt Concrete for road <b>pavement</b> <b>wearing</b> courses in terms of structural and surface characteristics, and drainage performance. This need has long since prompted researchers in the road sector to seek new design solutions, aimed, among other things, at the optimization of maintenance operations. The rapid deterioration of draining power and noise reduction properties of porous asphalt layers has been mainly attributed to the premature clogging of pores and the inherent difficulties in selecting suitable porous asphalts, especially for urban applications, where such problems are more anticipated. These failures have contributed to the development and experimentation with the “Twin-Layer” porous asphalt concept. In this paper, a performance related approach is proposed for different types of Twin-Layer. Underpinned by a rational mix design method, the technique aims to provide a high safety standard on roads where traffic moves at high speeds. The mix design study has been conducted for the porous under-layer and for the surface filter. Three types of filter porous asphalt mixtures have been studied. This, together with the admixtures incorporated into the supporting asphalt concrete, has enabled an optimal mixture to be identified. The performance comparison between the different mixtures has been conducted on the basis of mechanical, hydraulic and superficial characteristics exhibited by the different Twin-Layers adopted...|$|R
