The main buildings were laid out to the west: villas for working patients, pavilions for the infirm, administrative buildings, recreation hall, kitchens, and stores blocks providing segregation of male and female blocks. Workshops were provided on either side for the employment of capable patients. To the rear a combined power house and water tower provided a central focal point, with the laundry constructed on the female side. Parole villas were built at the northernmost areas behind the main ranges, providing a degree of freedom to suitable occupants. A large sick {{hospital was}} provided directly opposite the administrative block, combining wards for physically sick patients, those with tuberculosis, an operating theatre and staff sick bay. Finally, farthest west, Boundary House, a large block for disruptive chronic patients was built, providing two male wards, four female wards and a separate dining hall. The former farm was relocated to the north of the main site.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two key {{measures}} {{of high school}} performance in Texas public schools are performance on the exit-level Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) and performance on the SAT I and ACT. Between 1994 and 2002, TAAS scores increased substantially, whereas SAT I and ACT scores remained essentially stable. This report reviews differences between the TAAS and the SAT I and ACT examinations that contributed to differences in performance trends, namely (1) <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of test; (2) examinee population; and (3) academic proficiency level assessed. Because of these differences, the assessments are valuable, but distinct, measures of high school performance. The gains in exit-level TAAS scores indicate that an increasing percentage of students were mastering the academic skills required to obtain {{a high school diploma}} in Texas. The essentially stable SAT I and ACT performance indicates that high school students in Texas maintained a stable level of college readiness, relative to the mean performance of the national norm groups for the SAT I and ACT...|$|E
40|$|The {{perimeter}} of a wildland fire {{can always be}} split into different sections (i. e. head, flanks and back) according to their particular behaviour. The way to delimit the different sections of a fire perimeter depends firstly on the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of the analysis {{that is going to}} be carried out and secondly on the type of information available for that, but in summary we have observed that there is no bias-free and precise definition on the literature to delimit the head and the flanks of a fire perimeter which could be confidently used for scientific purposes.

To assess the spatial and temporal variation of fish assemblages and their response to the hydrological changes caused by {{two different types of}} flow regulation, we selected three sampling sites in four rivers with different levels of regulation, two in a permanent river system and another two on a temporary one, which we sampled in four different annual seasons. In the permanent system, hydroelectrical regulation decreased hydrological variability, which affected fluvial specialist species, benefitting the generalist ones, and created a more homogeneous community that presented less intra-annual variation. In the temporary system, agricultural regulation caused an inversion of the hydrological cycle, maintaining a moderate flow volume throughout the drought period that benefited the introduced, generalist and more tolerant species. Monthly volume was recognized, in a temporal scale, as the most important hydrological feature for assemblages’ structure, predicting the intra-annual variation of several ecological guilds.

40|$|Abstract Expatriates are an {{increasingly}} important part of global organizations. As multinational corporations establish new subsidiaries, they require an individual or group of individuals to setup and oversee the proper operation of these companies {{in accordance with the}} global strategy. Expatriates allow parent organizations to transfer crucial knowledge, corporate philosophy and culture to a subsidiary, as well as acquire important information from the host country. The effective management of expatriates needs to include a performance measurement system with appropriate criteria. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the criteria utilized by researchers in the measurement of expatriate performance. The analysis will be conducted through the parent company’s point of view. The focus will be on whether or not the criteria currently used meets the objectives set forth by the parent organization as a primary stakeholder. This study will utilize a systematic review of past research. The proper protocols and procedures were followed to ensure an unbiased group of articles were selected. The articles were analyzed to examine the objective, <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of expatriate performance measurement criteria they utilized. The articles were also evaluated according of a parent company stakeholder checklist outlining the most important aspects to the parent organization. The results of the study concluded that a research gap is evident. The measurement criteria utilized by the overwhelming majority of researchers does not meet the basic objectives set forth by the parent organization. A universal measurement framework for international assignments is absent, both in practice and in research. A small percentage of researchers are aware of this discrepancy and over reliance on a self-evaluation of performance when it comes to expatriate research. In conclusion, the study shows a gap in the current expatriate research and suggests a more detailed look at the measurement criteria used by the researchers in this field. The current criteria utilized fails to meet the basic objectives of the parent company...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we examine the {{structure}} of homework assignments in eight rural high schools. Seventy-seventeachers responded to a 36 -item survey {{which was designed to}} assess (I) the amount of time students devote to homework; (2) the existence of a school homework policy; (3) the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of homework assignment; (4) teacher review, feedback, and grading of homework; and (5) the value and significance of assigning homework. Previous {{research in the area of}} homework has been limited to studies that investigate average hours of homework completed and correlations between time spent on homework and student achievement. Results presented in this article provide a deeper understanding of the structure and use of homework by rural high school teachers. The importance of homework as an educational in-tervention has been the subject of debate for the past hundred years. This dialogue has revealed more about the educational philosophies of the discussants and the educational climates of specific historical eras than about the contributions of homework to student learning [26]. Neill [20], for example, had few positive things to say about homework. Other educators and parents have at-tributed numerous benefits to homework, including in-creased academic achievement and the development of character and self-discipline [26]. In spite of the long history of discussion about homework, our understanding of this educational in-tervention remains rather limited. Neither educators nor students report that much homework is being done these days at either the elementary [5] or secondary levels [10; 19; 29]. There is also evidence that decisions about the structure of homework (e. g., how much is assigned, how it affects course grades) are made at the classroom rather than at the school level [5]. Finally, reports are accumu-lating that show that structured homework assignments can have a "meaningful influence on achievement " (11; 21; 27; 28]. Findings about the positive association be-tween homework and student achievement from educa-tional production function studies are also being sup-ported by conclusions from studies of effective school...|$|E
40|$|Readiness of {{the urgent}} {{reception}} to mass disasters This thesis {{is dedicated to}} the readiness of the urgent reception to mass disasters. It deals with the history, evolution and {{the current state of the}} urgent reception, both in the Czech Republic in the first place and in the world. Within the scope of this thesis I focus mainly on the work scope of the urgent receptions in dependence to their structure, equipment and their actual preparedness to deal with mass accidents. I focus besides other things on technical equipment of the urgent receptions, which is in frames of the Czech Republic very heterogeneous, but totally crucial to handle possible mass accident. A very import aspect is the matter of education and further training of the medical employees on all levels. It concerns not only medical positions, but also nurses and auxiliary staff. The question of the conditions severity of the admitted patients, their classification according to these conditions and transparent processing of the information about them cannot be passed over. Furthermore the thesis discusses emergency medicine as a discipline and the direction it should, in my opinion, further be heading in order to improve the functioning of the present system of pre-hospital and hospital emergency care. Urgent receptions in the Czech Republic represent a relatively new thing, which results into certain ambivalence of their concept and structure. Each urgent reception is somehow original and adapted to the requirements of the founder and the local situation. There is one thing the urgent receptions have in common, overload with patients who fall into the competence of practitioners. This is associated with the financial loss-making of these departments within the medical facilities. This, especially in the case of the private hospitals, leads to a reluctance of the founder to invest to the urgent reception. In this thesis I mention legal framework, contingency planning in the Czech Republic, contingency plans, their content <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> plan with its importance for solving crisis events. Another plan that is resolved in my thesis and that has crucial importance especially, for urgent receptions is the trauma plan of medical facility whose application into practice in the Czech Republic in many health care facilities is very problematic. And the practice of the trauma plan activation itself is, according to my research, the prerogative of only a very small amount of medical facilities...|$|E

40|$|Background: Breastfeeding is an {{important}} public health issue with extensive evidence supporting the health and economic benefits of breastfeeding [1 - 8]. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is an initiative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) to improve breastfeeding practices to promote, support and maintain breastfeeding [9]. The BFHI has two parts: 1) the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, which highlight practices that support the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding; and 2) the WHO Code for the Marketing of Breast milk substitutes, which sets the standard expected of health facilities {{in relation to the}} promotion of breast milk substitutes [10 & 11]. Method: A review of studies was undertaken in 2013 using a systematic process. The databases used were CINHAL, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, MIDIRS, PROQUEST, PUBMED, SCOPUS, WILEY, and Joanna Briggs Institute EBP Database. Key search terms included BFHI, Baby Friendly Hospital, implementation of BFHI, uptake of BFHI, BFHI and policies, and health professionals’ perception of BFHI. Studies that focused on the implementation and uptake of the BFHI were included. Results: The majority of studies examined were related to the implementation of the Ten Steps rather than the uptake and implementation of the BFHI in its entirety. Cultural factors emerged from nine studies and two literature reviews [12 - 21]. Cultural factors can be placed in two main cultural sets, organizational, and individual. The majority of studies examining outcomes found an association between cultural themes at both organisational and individual levels on the uptake and implementation of the BFHI. Support theme emerged from seven studies and three literature reviews [46 - 54, 22 - 30, 18]. These studies and the literature review, which identified the impact of support on the uptake and implementation of the BFHI, mainly focus on providing resources and funds, and intra-organisational support such as training programs for health care staff. These studies suggested the impact of support within organisations, society, and families, on the uptake and implementation of the BFHI, and implementation of the Ten Steps. The provision of education for staff, mothers, and their families emerged as a key factor in 12 studies and one literature review [31 - 40, 18]. It was suggested that education is an influential factor in the uptake and implementation of the BFHI in addition to the implementation of the Ten Steps. This influence depends on the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of education and the audiences receiving it...|$|E
40|$|The land is {{the main}} asset of the farmer. The basic {{production}} of agricultural products, the food security {{of the state and}} its export potential today depend directly on the ability of agricultural producers to conduct sustainable production. However, in addition to the natural elements that {{stand in the way of}} stabilizing the situation in the field of agriculture, we also have a chronic presence of numerous "man-made" problems that remain unsettled for years. One of the most significant and painful of them is the state registration of the right to lease land. Long-term disorder, corporate wars between state authorities for the right to land relations, negligent attitude to information on land rights and their encumbrances, the shifting of competence among registrars of land tenure rights continue to cause complaints from agricultural producers. But the peculiarities of the legal regulation of the state registration of the right to lease land for agricultural purposes did not become the subject of a separate scientific study. Consequently, the purpose of this work is to study and analyze the problems of legal regulation of state registration of the right to lease land and to find an acceptable option for their further solution. Since the reform of the agrarian sector of Ukraine, the most common form of land use in agricultural production is the use of land by agricultural producers on a lease. The advantage of leasing relations in agricultural production is enshrined in the Concept of the State Target Program for Land Relations Development in Ukraine for the period up to 2020, which was approved by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated June 17, 2009 No. 743 -p. The right to lease a land plot is mediated by a contract concluded in accordance with the Article 20 of the Law of Ukraine "On land lease" is subject to mandatory state registration,on the other hand in Article 125 of the Land Code of Ukraine, it is stated that the right to lease a land plot arises from the moment of state registration of this right. Thus, the fact of registration of the lease contract for agricultural land is a necessary condition for determining the legality of land use of agricultural producers. The state registration of the right to lease a land plot of agricultural land is preceded by a state registration of a land plot that is the subject of a lease and a state registration of the ownership of such a land plot. The right to lease a land plot used for agricultural production arises from the moment of state registration of this right. The intended <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of use within the purpose of the leased land should be identical both in the lease agreement of the land plot and in the State Land Cadastre. State registration of land lease agreements for agricultural purposes provides legal guarantees regarding the actual use of land in agricultural production activities...|$|E
30|$|A {{wide variety}} of methods for {{near-field}} tsunami forecasts have been proposed. These methods depend on the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of observational data (e.g., Tsushima and Ohta 2014). Here we define a “real-time tsunami forecast” to derive the information required for evacuation before the first arrival of a tsunami at the coast. In Japan, a real-time tsunami forecast using the hypocenter location and the earthquake magnitude determined from land-based seismological observation has been operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) since 1999 (Tatehata 1997; Kamigaichi 2009). This is used as an initial forecast {{because it can be}} issued very quickly. However, it contains considerable uncertainty, because land-based seismic observation alone cannot constrain the hypocenter location and the magnitude of subduction zone earthquakes. Accordingly, a more accurate real-time tsunami forecast method using fault geometry information and the average amount of slip determined by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) was proposed by Blewitt et al. (2009). Moreover, the centroid moment tensor for a more accurate tsunami forecast could be estimated by W-phase waveform inversions (Benavente and Cummins 2013; Gusman and Tanioka 2014). Because the fault model is obtained from GNSS data and/or W-phase records within a few minutes after an earthquake occurs, it is possible to replace the initial forecast information with more accurate information (Tsushima and Ohta 2014). In addition, a tsunami forecast method to estimate the best tsunami source model by inversion analysis of tsunami waveform data from ocean-bottom pressure gauges was proposed by Tsushima et al. (2009). In their method, the arrival times and amplitudes of tsunamis at the coasts are forecast by linearly combining pre-calculated Green’s functions. However, obtaining direct measurements of tsunamis requires more time to detect tsunami signals than obtaining seismic wave or real-time GNSS data (Tsushima and Ohta 2014, Figure 4). Attempting a breakthrough, Baba et al. (2014) investigated the correlation between offshore and coastal tsunami heights by using ocean-bottom pressure data from the Dense Oceanfloor Network system for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) observation array (Kaneda et al. 2009). They successfully forecast the coastal tsunami height within 10  min after the occurrence of an earthquake by concentrating on predicting the tsunami scale. In addition, Yamamoto et al. (2016) proposed a rapid method to estimate the tsunami source location using a dense offshore observation network. They claimed that this location could be estimated within a few minutes after the occurrence of an earthquake by using the tsunami centroid location (TCL). Although direct measurements of tsunamis are used in their method, the required estimation time is comparable to that achieved using real-time GNSS data. It is possible to replace the earthquake location and magnitude with the tsunami source location estimated by Yamamoto et al. (2016) and the tsunami scale estimated by Baba et al. (2014) for the initial tsunami warning. Moreover, Maeda et al. (2015) proposed a tsunami forecast method based on a data assimilation technique using a dense offshore observation network rather than using seismic source parameters or the initial height of the sea surface. In their method, the tsunami wavefield including offshore tsunami height and velocity will be available as initial conditions for other tsunami forecasting methods such as tFISH (Tsushima et al. 2009), NearTIF (Gusman et al. 2014) to calculate the inundation or run-up for real-time forecasting. For a real-time tsunami inundation forecast, some researchers have proposed new methods that use on-demand forward simulations with inverted tsunami source models (Tatsumi and Tomita 2013; Koshimura et al. 2014; Oishi et al. 2015). However, these methods are computationally expensive; hence, the coastal region {{to be included in the}} forecast is limited. A real-time tsunami inundation forecast on high-resolution topography was achieved by Gusman et al. (2014), who proposed a new method that requires pre-calculated tsunami waveforms and tsunami inundation at near-shore points in advance of the occurrence of an earthquake. Their method involves the selection of the best-matched tsunami scenario by comparing pre-calculated tsunami waveforms and synthetic tsunami waveforms calculated using forecast tsunami source information, such as fault models estimated by the Real-time Automatic detection method for Permanent Displacement (RAPiD) proposed by Ohta et al. (2012), W-Phase data (Kanamori 1993; Gusman and Tanioka 2014), or initial sea-surface displacement distributions (Tsushima et al. 2009). The pre-calculated tsunami inundation for the best-matched tsunami scenario is then forecast.|$|E

As ovelhas foram submetidas a IATF pelo método transcervical, 49 h após a retirada do CIDR. Exp. III: Foram utilizadas 247 ovelhas, divididas em 4 tratamentos: MN= as ovelhas foram sincronizadas e submetidas a monta natural com carneiros; IATF = as ovelhas foram submetidas a IATF por laparoscopia 48 h após a retirada do CIDR; IATF+GnRH= as ovelhas foram submetidas a IATF por laparoscopia + 0, 05 mg de Gonadorelina, quando 50 % das ovelhas apresentaram sinais de estro; IA= as ovelhas foram inseminadas por laparoscopia no sistema AM/PM, 12 h após o início dos sinais de estro. Todos os tratamentos foram submetidos ao mesmo protocolo, CIDR por 11 dias, aplicação de 300 UI de eCG e 6, 31 mg de Dinoprost trometamina, na retirada do CIDR. Nos experimentos I e II as ovelhas foram submetidas ao repasse com carneiros por 20 dias. O delineamento utilizado foi de blocos incompletos ao acaso, analisados pelo teste do Qui-quadrado e Tukey (estro). A taxa de detecção de estro no tratamento IATF (exp. III) foi de 59, 7 % sendo menor que os demais tratamentos (P 0, 05). O efeito macho e o tipo de macho não apresentaram diferença na IATF. O protocolo de 11 dias, mostrou-se eficiente em induzir o estro em 79 % das ovelhas sincronizadas. A IA realizada 12 h após o estro propiciou, índice de prenhez semelhante à monta natural, proveniente do estro sincronizado. In the 60 s, estrus synchronization techniques {{began to}} be used, and during the last 30 years has attracted the interest of developing new methods to synchronize estrus in ewes. Three experiments were performed to determine: I) influence of male effect and type of teaser; II) Effect of new and used CIDR® (Control Internal Drug Release) with different time of implant; III) Different time to perform IA after CIDR removal and comparison of laparoscopy method with natural breed, on heat detection and onset of estrus and pregnancy rate of ewes. Exp. I: 270 ewes were used, divided into three treatments: SM = (control) without teaser; DL = teaser with lateral penis deviation and VS = vasectomized teaser. All ewes were subjected to the same protocol: CIDR® for 7 days and received im. 300 UI of eCG plus 6. 71 mg tromethamine dinoprost at CIDR withdrawal. Ewes were artificially inseminated by transcervical method, 55 h after CIDR removal. There was no difference on onset of estrus for LD (55. 7 %) and VS (50. 5 %). Similarly, the distribution of estrus was similar (P> 0. 05) between treatments, where the averages were of 45 : 01 ± 14 : 30 h for LD 12 : 10 h and 44 : 00 ± 12 : 10 h for VS. Pregnancy rate did not differ (P> 0. 05) among treatments and was 34. 0, 34. 4 and 35. 0 % for LD, VS and SM, respectively. The male effect showed no influence on pregnancy rate when fixed-time artificial insemination was used. EXP. II: 275 ewes were used and divided into 4 treatments: 7 N = 7 d with new CIDR; 7 U = 7 d with already used CIDR for 7 d; 11 N = 11 d with new CIDR; 11 U = 11 d with CIDR already used for 7 d. On {{the withdrawal of the}} CIDR (D 7 or D 11) ewes received im. 300 IU of eCG plus 6. 71 mg tromethamine dinoprost at the time of CIDR removal. Ewes were submitted to FTAI, using the transcervical method, 49 h after CIDR withdrawal. Total pregnancy rate in treatment 11 N was higher (86. 6 %, P = 0. 03) as compared with treatment 7 U (71. 4 %). The protocols for estrus synchronization of 7 and 11 d were effective in inducing the expression of estrus. The reuse of CIDR did not influence the rate of onset and average time to onset of estrus and pregnancy rate in the FTAI. Exp. III: 247 ewes were used and divided in four treatments: MN = ewes were synchronized and exposed to males during 20 d; IATF = ewes were synchronized and inseminated by laparoscopy 48 h after CIDR removal; AITF+GnRH= ewes were synchronized and inseminated by laparoscopy using 0. 05 mg gonadorelin, when 50 % of the ewes showed signs of estrus; AI = ewes received im. 300 IU of eCG plus 6. 71 mg tromethamine dinoprost at the time of CIDR removal and were inseminated by laparoscopy, 12 h after the onset of signs of estrus. All treatments were subjected to the same protocol: CIDR for 11 days, intramuscular injection of 300 UI of eCG plus 6. 31 mg tromethamine dinoprost at CIDR removal. In all experiments ewes were exposed to rams (natural breeding), 10 days after FTAI. The experimental design was an incomplete randomized block, analyzed by chi- square and Tukey (estrus). The rate of detection of estrus in the treatment AITF (exp. III) was 59. 7 %, being lower than the other treatments (P 0. 05). The <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of ram showed no difference in the AITF. The protocol of 11 d, was effective in inducing estrus in the 79 % of ewes synchronized. The IA conducted 12 h after estrus provided, similar to pregnancy rate of natural builders, after the synchronization of estrus...|$|E
40|$|The use of ePortfolios for {{recognition}} of prior learning (e-RPL) and for professional recognition (e-PR) is slowly gaining in {{popularity in the}} VET sector however their use is sporadic across educational sectors, disciplines, educational institutions and professions. Added to this is an array of <b>purposes</b> <b>and</b> <b>types</b> of e-RPL <b>and</b> e-PR models and practice. The aim {{of this paper is}} to build on the conceptual framework developed by Cameron (2012) for e-RPL and e-PR and to provide case studies for each of the four types developed within this framework: e-PR for Professional Accreditation; e-RPL for Workplace Recognition; e-RPL for Access and; e-RPL for Self Recognition. We use the case studies to explore the four <b>types</b> <b>and</b> the two dimensions or continuums central to the framework. The vertical dimension is a continuum between RPL as process and RPL as product and the second horizontal dimension is a continuum between formal learning contexts and low learner control as opposed to informal learning contexts and high levels of learner control. The case studies have aided the further development of the framework and its theoretical and practical applications...|$|R

The CF strategies {{used in the study}} are as follows: Clarification request (the teacher asks students to repeat what they said); Repetition (the teacher emphasizes the student’s grammatical error by changing his/her tone of voice); Explicit correction (the teacher gives the correct form to the student with a grammatical explanation); Elicitation (the teacher asks the student to correct and complete the sentence); Metalinguistic feedback (the teacher gives a hint or a clue without specifically pointing out the mistake); Recast (the teacher repeats the student’s utterance in the correct form without pointing out the student’s error); and No corrective feedback (the teacher does not give CF on the student’s errors). The results indicated that regardless of their anxiety level both groups had similar beliefs about CF and strongly favoured receiving frequent CF in English oral communication classes when they were made aware of the <b>purpose,</b> significance, <b>and</b> <b>types</b> of CF. Similarly, Abedi et al. (2015) present six CF strategies: explicit correction; recast; clarification request; meta-linguistic clues; elicitation and the repetition of the mistake. Regardless of their level of anxiety, the students in their study expressed similar beliefs regarding CF.|$|R

40|$|The {{seed bank}} {{refers to the}} resting place of weed seeds and forms an {{important}} component of the life cycle of weeds. In annual and some perennial weed species that reproduce by seed only, seed banks are the sole source of future weed populations. Because of this, understanding what happens to seeds in the seed bank can be {{an important component of}} overall weed control. When weed seeds enter the seed bank, several factors influence the duration for which seeds persist. Seeds can sense the surrounding environment in the seed bank and use these stimuli to become dormant or initiate germination. Soil and crop management practices can directly influence the environment of seeds in the seed bank and can thus be used to manage seed longevity and germination behaviour. Biology of Weed Seed Banks <b>Purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>types</b> of seed bank Weed seeds are {{an important component of the}} weed life cycle as they are the origin of future populations, and are particularly important in annual and simple perennial species like dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Weber) which reproduce by seed only.
