The war greatly increased the size and importance of the Australian manufacturing sector and stimulated the development of more technologically advanced industries.

Many women were forced out of traditionally male-dominated industries after the war, however.|$|E

Instead, according to Jones, the media focus on female athletes in non-team competitions and on team sports played equally by both genders.|$|E
40|$|Objectives A stable {{follow-up}} <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> is a {{very important}} factor for validity in a cohort study. This study analyzed the factors that affect the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> at one hospital-based birth cohort in South Korean. Methods The participants were recruited from the Mothers’ and Children’s Environmental Health study between 2006 and 2010. The analysis targeted 1751 mothers who participated in a birth cohort. We conducted analyses of general characteristics during pregnancy and those of infants at birth that affect the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> of the 6 -month follow-up survey. Results The <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> for the 6 -month follow-up survey was 60. 4 %. The <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> in the follow-up of the subsequent period decreased within a 5 % to 10 % range compared to the number of subjects. The <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> of premature infants was 16. 9 % lower than that of a full-term infant (52. 6 % vs. 69. 5 %). Analysis showed a 16. 7 % difference between the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> of low-birthweight infants in follow-ups (53. 7 %) and the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> of infants with normal weight (70. 4 %). The <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> of mothers who were employed during pregnancy was significantly lower for the 6 -month follow-up compared to the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> of mothers who were unemployed during pregnancy. Conclusions In this study, factors such as premature birth, low-birthweight, and the employment status of the mother during pregnancy affected the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> of the follow-up survey for the birth cohort at six months. A specific strategy is needed to encourage survey participation for the high risk groups in the follow-ups...|$|R

5|$|The {{economic}} policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment {{outside the home}} in Nicaragua steadily increased {{during the same time}} frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest <b>participation</b> <b>rates</b> in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.|$|E

Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E

The conclusion is that the decline in the welfare <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> in the 1990 s should be attributed to restrictive welfare reforms, not to the fall in the unemployment rate. Further, the political choice to reduce the welfare <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> may have inflated the reduction in the unemployment rate, by increasing the number of people willing to accept peripheral jobs, for instance in the Eating and drinking place.

25|$|The {{development}} of football {{on a national}} level in Cape Verde is hindered by several factors, including local definitions of femininity that discourage participation in sport, lack of adequate training, a lack of competitive spirit in matches and during training. There is also a lack of available players, with <b>participation</b> <b>rates</b> having peaked at roughly 350 a few years back to roughly 200 current players. The lack of opportunities to go further with football inside the country also discourages continued participation in the sport.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 The {{current study}} assesses {{the impact of}} health and {{education}} on labour force participation in Botswana using time series data from 1982 - 2007. To achieve this, stationary test; Johansson Co integration test and multi-collinearity test were conducted before using a dynamic ordinary feast square estimation. There are three labour force participation estimates each ·with four different models. These include: male, female and total labour force <b>participation</b> <b>rate.</b> The. findings were as follows: firstly, an increase of primary school enrolment reduces female participation in the labour force but increases the male <b>participation</b> <b>rate.</b> This increase in male <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> could be {{as a result of}} size of male participants in the labour force or because of their role in the family, especially in the African settings. Secondly, an increase in contemporaneous education expenditure increases both female labour force participation and the total labour force <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> but reduces their participation in the short-run. Thirdly, the study also shows that an increase in contemporaneous health expenditure increases male <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> and reduces male <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> in the long-run while overall labour force <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> increases in the long-run. Finally. given the importance of health and education on labour force <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> in Botswana, the study asserts that it is of paramount importance for government to incorporate strategies that encourage citizens to recognise the need to maintain good health and education. In absence of such interventions, Botswana might find it difficult to achieve most of her vision 2016 and MDG 's goals. Master...|$|R

40|$|By using a {{synthetic}} cohort methodology, this paper {{contributes to the}} analysis of the evolution of female labour force participation in Chile over the last forty years. We decompose the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> in terms of age, year and cohort effects. The results of the estimations show that the age effect significantly explains the <b>participation</b> <b>rate.</b> Cohort variables are also important, enabling us to identify cohort effects associated with both, the number of children and the level of schooling of the group. In turn, contemporary variables are relevant, in particular the cyclical component. All this indicates that the changes in the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> may be due in the first place to increases in the number of women in the age groups where the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> is higher. Secondly, the increase in the <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> is due to effects that are associated with different behaviours in the succeeding cohorts of women; and, finally, contemporary variables seemingly have very small importance.
