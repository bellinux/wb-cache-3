5000|$|Leigh Van Valen {{proposed}} the hypothesis {{to explain the}} [...] "Law of Extinction", showing that, in many populations, the probability of extinction {{does not depend on}} the lifetime of the population, instead being constant over millions of years for a given population. This could be explained by the coevolution of species. At other times, established species have evolved cooperatively by assuming adaptive coevolutionary dependencies. These complementary relationships develop through graduated symbiosis, directing punctuated advantages specialized enough to ensure a greater survivability and fitness rate for both species, coupled. Indeed, however, an adaptation in a population of one species (e.g. predators, parasites) may change the natural selection pressure on a population of another species (e.g. prey, hosts), giving rise to common antagonistic coevolutions. If this positive feedback occurs reciprocally, a <b>potential</b> <b>dynamic</b> coevolution may result.|$|E

The Cahn-Hilliard equation with singular <b>potentials</b> and <b>dynamic</b> boundary conditions {{is the main}} object of study in this paper.

The static analysis uses a hyperbolic model for the rockfill, whereas the dynamic analysis uses a nonlinear hysteretic model, which accounts for the initial dynamic stiffness and produces hysteresis loops in agreement with the experimental data regarding the shear modulus and damping ratio.
