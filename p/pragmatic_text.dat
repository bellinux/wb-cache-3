40|$|This study {{discusses}} how the <b>pragmatic</b> <b>text</b> {{functions of}} the Prince Edward Island Visitor’s Guide can be retained in translation from English into Swedish. Katharina Reiss’ model of texttypes and their different functions {{have been used to}} identify the {{functions of the}} source text, and in order to investigate the possibilities of retaining these functions in the target text, the discussion is tied to text features where the <b>pragmatic</b> <b>text</b> functions are displayed. The translation choices, next, are supported by the translation strategies offered by Rune Ingo and Peter Newmark. The results show that the informative function can be retained by using the translation strategies of addition or explicitation in most cases, whereas the operative function can be retained by copying the sentence structure or the direct address from the source text to the target text. The expressive function, next, can be retained by using Ingo’s strategy of equivalence. However, there are also examples where the expressive function has to be neglected in favor of the informative function. ...|$|E

40|$|The present essay {{discusses}} rhetorics as {{an instrument}} of both persuasion and deception. Early Chinese political thought shows a keen awareness of the deceptive potential immanent in rhetorical skills. Multiple texts warn against certain types of rhetorical behaviour that entail a potential threat to the ruler’s control over political power. Yet, at the same time rhetorical skills were also a desirable qualification. While most texts from early China discuss rhetorical skills in general terms as an asset or a threat to the ruler’s power, some texts reflect rhetorical skills in more detail, describing specific types of rhetorical behaviour. This essay introduces examples of such texts that were probably first composed as <b>pragmatic</b> <b>texts</b> for application in political practice, before they were integrated into larger compilations or literary texts for argumentative purposes. The essay also shows that these <b>pragmatic</b> <b>texts</b> used a set of technical terms, some of which were no longer recognized in the later transmission, which often led to changes in the texts...|$|R
40|$|The {{translator}} as {{agent of}} empowerment: A case study In this article {{the focus is}} on the role of the translator as an agent of empowerment for linguistically marginalised communities; it also raises the practical issue of his/her role as an intermediary equipped with knowledge of the source and target cultures and their (non-) overlap. The community translation approach, which emerged from a socio-linguistic perspective, forms the basis for this point of departure. The aim of this approach is to give these communities access to the same information and services as the linguistical “elite”. In order to realise this, the translator uses discourse patterns and linguistic conventions of the target group. For this approach, the needs of the target audience in the translation process are of paramount importance. To illustrate the translator’s role as an agent of empowerment as well as an effective intermediary, this article’s focus is on translation strategies used in a <b>pragmatic</b> <b>text...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Tibetan Book of the Dead and the Jewish Tractate Mourning are {{important}} texts about death {{in their respective}} traditions. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is a manual read by the living to the deceased as the deceased journeys through the many realms of the after-life. It is an abstract, philosophical text. The Tractate Mourning on the other hand, is a highly empirical and <b>pragmatic</b> <b>text</b> that guides the living through their loss. It is concerned only with the living left behind and offers no guidance to the deceased. Despite this profound difference however, this thesis has as its objective to show that both traditions, as evidenced through these texts, share an underlying emotion: compassion. Through the concern shown to the deceased {{as he or she}} stumbles through the often terrifying realms of the after-life in the Tibetan tradition, and through the precise and detailed instructions given to the living in the Jewish tradition as the mourners are guided through their grief, both texts exhibit profound compassion...|$|E
40|$|Unquestionably, {{the content}} {{analysis}} which {{has emerged as}} part of Information Retrieval Systems (IRS, e. g. literature databases) over the past 20 years has {{much in common with}} the content analysis used by linguists or in the social sciences. However, its intrinsic value stems from the special context in which it is used: a) Close interdependencies link the selected content analysis with the retrieval situation. The user’s retrieval strategies, which are intended to obtain information relevant to the current problem situation, and the available aids (e. g. expansion lists or user-friendly browsing tools) affect the efficacy of some analysis techniques (e. g. noun phrase analysis from computer linguistics) to a considerable extent. b) Normally, a commercial IRS handles mass data, thus necessitating the use of a reduced content analysis even today. Full morphological, syntactic, semantic and <b>pragmatic</b> <b>text</b> analyses are unthinkable simply for efficiency reasons but also for knowledge reasons. Content analysis in IRS is therefore a component part of a special type of restricted system which obeys its own laws. Against the backdrop of these considerations, forms of content analysis in present-day commercial retrieval systems are studied and promising expansions and alternatives are proposed.

40|$|As the {{millennium}} draws to a close, post-modernism is witnessing a trend aimed at restoring {{respect for the}} sociolinguistic cliche. The translation of cliches, however, has not yet attracted comprehensive research. This thesis is not an in-depth study of the question, due to the limits inherent in an MA thesis; rather, our purport is to cover the general implications of translating cliches in <b>pragmatic</b> <b>texts.</b> Translating cliches can usually imply the same theory and practice generally adopted for translating <b>pragmatic</b> <b>texts</b> {{with respect to their}} individual contexts and situation. However, certain parameters can help discern the most appropriate path, namely, elements that are translationally pertinent, encompassing communication-specific discourse, functions, as well as the referential entropy for which cliches are blamed and which may have {{to be taken into account}} in the target text. This study ends by underlining the need to develop a new semiotic approach which would consider a cliche as an entity constituting a sign in itself, and the possibility for developing a teaching model for translating cliches suited to the undergraduate program.

40|$|The {{study of}} social {{identity}} can unlock many features of local culture. This article presents a theoretical model of social {{identity as a}} <b>pragmatic</b> <b>text</b> iterated within routine social interaction. Identities are repeatedly claimed during social life {{as part of the}} pragmatic infrastructures through which humans interact. Qualitative researchers can study social identity through direct observations of social life and through encouraging participants to talk, in interviews, about a variety of activities in which they routinely take part. In the later stages of qualitative interview, paraphrasing and active listening responses may be appropriately used to discuss the self directly, but in terms still tied to contexts of daily activity. Subsequent analysis of identity claims must be theory guided, because of their tacit and textual properties.

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{two aspects}} of the retention of <b>pragmatic</b> <b>text</b> functions in translation. The functionalist approach that was used focuses on achieving congruence between the author’s intended function {{and the perception of}} the reader, i. e., the target text’s actual function. The first aim was to examine whether a focus on text functions can be beneficial when translating terminology. The second aim was to investigate if a functionalist approach can be used to assure that all functions are retained for instances where the source text encompasses more than one pragmatic function. For the purposes of this study, two excerpts from Fritz Eichenberg’s art history book The Art of the Print were translated. Individual terms as well as instances where the source text segment contained one than more pragmatic function were then analyzed with the above mentioned aims in mind. It was found that a functionalist approach, in combination with a conceptual approach to terminology, was beneficial when translating terminology. It was also observed that the surrounding co-text aided in the understanding of the author’s concept. In regard to the second aim, it was found that while a functionalist approach assured that the translator was made aware of the existing functions, the translation procedures suggested were too narrow and static to be applicable to all segments...|$|E

The need for generation to occur {{at the time of}} use occasioned by the impracticality of large-scale electricity storage coupled with constant and often unpredictable changes in demand make electricity-supply systems large, dynamic and complex and their regulation a daunting task. Conceptually arranged in four parts, this book addresses both traditional regulatory frameworks and also liberalized and re-regulated environments. First, an introduction gives a full characterization of power supply including engineering, economic and regulatory viewpoints. The second part presents the fundamentals of regulation and the third looks at the regulation of particular components of the power sector in detail. Advanced topics and subjects still open or subject to dispute form the content of the fourth part. In a sector where regulatory design is the key driver of both the industry efficiency and the returns on investment, Regulation of the Power Sector is directed at regulators, policy decision makers, business managers and researchers. It is a <b>pragmatic</b> <b>text,</b> well-tested by the authors’ quarter-century of experience of power systems from around the world. Power system professionals and students at all levels will derive much benefit from the authors’ wealth of blended theory and real-world-derived know-how. ...|$|E

In this article we strive to prove that these explanatory techniques can take on a totally different dimension when applied to scientific or <b>pragmatic</b> <b>texts.</b> Therefore it can be inferred that translating scientific texts provides for different interventions on the part of the translator than in the case of translating utilitarian texts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explain and {{demonstrate}} that, in the leaflet [...] as a specific form of discourse [...] meaning is primarily a product of the textual interrelationship of both its verbal and visual components. Our definition of meaning of the message in this analysis is that of form-meaning. The object of our analysis is a particular genre of discourse [...] the leaflet [...] which is placed at the intersection of verbal and visual communication. We begin by looking at visual communication theory to better understand how meaning is produced in "visual discourse". Next, we proceed to trace the way translation theory deals with the notion of "form" with regard to meaning. Finally, based on a case study of a hospital informlation leaflet we clearly demonstrate that there is an "isotopic" relationship between meaning and textual form. Ultimately, our study will reveal the necessity to reconsider the notion of "form" as it applies to <b>pragmatic</b> <b>texts</b> in translation theory and didactics.

Failed policies of interference of Western countries, which have even theorized the export of democracy through the use of weapons, it's time to spread worldwide the culture of dialogue and inclusion. This is the thesis of Citizens of the world, the new essay by Daniele Archibugi, {{one of the most influential}} advocates of democratic cosmopolitanism. Only a utopia for naive idealists, as insinuated his detractors, or, as it argues the author, the only viable strategy to address the great challenges of globalization? The urgency of a response increases with the escalation of global violence. The hopes with which he closed the last century - the fall of the Berlin Wall, the abolition of apartheid in South Africa or the defeat of the dictatorship in several Latin American countries - could lead to a peaceful expansion of democracy. The new millennium, however, has opened inauspiciously and the war has returned the daily tool for managing conflicts. Like his main inspirations - Norberto Bobbio, Amartya Sen and Jürgen Habermas - Daniele Archibugi suggests the strengthening and reform of existing international bodies, from the cumbersome gear UN and the International Criminal Court, the creation of new institutions, such as the world Parliament, and a progressive harmonization of national interests with the needs of the global community.

The core values from Alfa Laval consist of 4 values and a describing text, which is presented in a brochure containing Alfa Laval’s mission, vision, core values and code of conduct. To unfold the text I examine the text genre PR texts using literature on this topic from Rita Therkelsen. The core values speech acts is analysed with {{the use of}} Jürgen Habermas and a part of his language philosophy. Alfa Laval’s core values do not have a consistent use of pronouns, and to examine the possible consequences of this breach I use Ole Togeby’s work on Danish functional grammar. To define core values and corporate branding strategies, I use Ole Thyssen and Lars Thøger Christensen and Mette Morsing. The focus of my analysis is whether it is an appropriate way to formulate the core values as a regulative speech act, with a breach in the use of pronouns, based on the knowledge of how core values are used in a corporate branding strategy. At the end of the analysis I make two new suggestions on how to formulate the core values. The conclusion is that it is recommended to use a constative speech act, and to be consistent in the use of pronouns in the core values, so that the ownership of the core values remains clear...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with a specific phenomenon {{of the history of}} translation into Portuguese, the boom of translation of scientific and didactic texts in the turn of the 18 th century in Portugal, in which a considerable number of Brazilians were involved.

Friar Veloso was translator, editor, and translation coordinator in charge of the work of translators concerned with <b>pragmatic</b> <b>texts</b> in Lisbon. Veloso’s involvement with the still incipient editorial industry in Portugal was linked to Portuguese Enlightenment, especially the dissemination of scientific knowledge that could be applied to the progress of the Portuguese kingdom. Clues of Friar Veloso’s close connection with the Portuguese official policies are found in the prefaces he wrote for his translations, and they are enough to include him withim a patronage system that defined the direction his editorial activities would take. Curiously, despite these ties to the authoritarian Portuguese monarchical regime, Friar Veloso’s work led to unexpected historical developments, such as the growth of the reading public and the improvement of printing techniques...|$|R

In the case of linguistics some events and developments of other disciplines prompt some authors to revise the principles constituting it a scientific discipline. Linguistics should be revised and accept new principles {{so that it can be}} a scientifically useful discipline for the starting 21 rst century. Linguistics, some authors say, has widened its limits and deepened its views, due to socio-cultural factors and the influence of thought from other sciences. Linguistics today has shifted to peculiar fields of interest, such as cognitivism, <b>pragmatics,</b> <b>text</b> and discourse analysis. Cognitive sciences deal with the problems of knowledge and communication, the solution of which will produce machines which will think and communicate just in the way human beings do. My intention in this article is to contribute with certain observations to the discussion of the topic, since it affects language, the study of language, and the speaking subjects producing language. The claim of this article is that the situation affecting linguistics cannot be defined by external circumstances affecting linguistics or the object of study of linguistics. Linguistics is to be defined in terms of the adequacy of it to the peculiarity of its object of study, the activity of speaking manifesting the nature of those subjects who speak. Language manifests freedom and intelligence of its speakers. This manifestation of language has to do with the essence of human beings, speaking subjects, who are free and historical.

40|$|International audienceReading {{has long}} been assimilated with the {{understanding}} phase in the translation process and has only recently aroused interest among translation theorists, {{as a sign of}} differentiation in the implementation of the process, whether oral or written. The description of the translation process as applied to <b>pragmatic</b> <b>texts</b> from German into French shows that reading is a multi-stage, multi-facetted and multi-goal activity throughout this process. Results and questions pertaining to cognitive models of reading are taken into account in this analysis. Far from being limited to understanding, reading appears to be an intellectual technique, a mental tool allowing translators to approach and peruse texts to be translated and also to gather and combine the various elements of knowledge necessary to their practice. In the last stage of the process, it also enables them to carry out a critical evaluation of their own translations before passing them on to other readers in the reading chain. The overall computerisation of texts does not outdate the present study but adds up to the many other aspects of reading and the declarative, conditional and procedural knowledge involved. Longtemps assimilée à la phase de compréhension du processus de traduction, la lecture en tant que telle ne suscite que depuis peu l’intérêt à la fois théorique et systématique des traductologues, dans une différenciation de la mise en œuvre du processus à l’oral et à l’écrit. Loin de se cantonner à la phase de compréhension, la lecture apparaît comme une technique intellectuelle, un acte-outil par lequel le traducteur prend connaissance du texte à traduire, se l’approprie, acquiert et relie les connaissances nécessaires à l’exercice de sa pratique ou procède à une évaluation critique de la traduction avant d’en confier la lecture à un tiers et de prolonger la chaîne des lectures.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore in greater detail the {{cognitive}} processes underlying the medical discourse used in written drug information for medical specialists and patients. Starting from a case study based on documents in English issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) we will provide some insights into the ways how drug-related issues such as the administration, use and possible side effects of drugs are conceptualized and linguistically encoded in an expert vs. non-expert setting. Despite substantial differences in terms of content and wording (X) the text types under investigation are very similar in terms of text function and structure. Both represent <b>pragmatic</b> <b>texts</b> designed to accurately convey procedural information in order to help experts and patients to make informed decisions about a drug’s therapeutic use (Wright 1999, 85; Dickinson 2003). In the case of the expert-oriented Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) this is achieved by using specialized language, in the case of the patient leaflet (PL) by presenting the expert knowledge in a re-conceptualized format conform to the patients’ background knowledge, linguistic skills, needs and expectations. We will focus on examples which illustrate the impact of the experienced world on the specialist vs. non-specialist conceptualization and linguistic encoding of drug-related knowledge in both text types. The analysis will be carried out on different linguistic levels in order to account for pragmatic, lexical, syntactic, and stylistic phenomena associated with the setting-specific coding of specialized knowledge. Hereby, the role of contextual information in the representation of specialized knowledge units in PL’s will be an important aspect as well.
