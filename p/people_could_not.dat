5|$|His {{impact was}} {{not only on the}} world of education, but also on Argentine {{political}} and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the time they were not widely accepted. He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.|$|E
5|$|The Buenavista Social Club was a members-only club {{originally}} {{located in}} Buenavista (literally good view), a quarter {{in the current}} neighbourhood of Playa (before 1976 part of Marianao), one of the 15 municipalities in Cuba's capital, Havana. The original club was founded in 1932 in a small wooden venue at calle Consulado y paisaje “A” (currently calle 29, n. 6007). In 1939, {{due to lack of}} space the club relocated to number 4610 on Avenue 31, between calles 46 and 48, in Almendares, Marianao. This location is recalled by Juan Cruz, former director of the Marianao Social Club and master of ceremonies at the Salón Rosado de la Tropical (other nightclubs in Havana). As seen in the Buena Vista Social Club documentary, when musicians Ry Cooder, Compay Segundo and a film crew attempted to identify the location of the club in the 1990s, local <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> agree on where it had stood.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian leaders {{decided that}} their {{traditional}} lifestyle, partly based on plundering raids against sedentary <b>peoples,</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be continued. The defeats at the Lechfeld and Arkadiopolis accelerated the Hungarians' {{adoption of a}} sedentary way of life. This process culminated in the coronation {{of the head of}} the Hungarians, Stephen the first king of Hungary in 1000 and 1001.|$|R

25|$|Subsequent to Khrushchev's overthrow, the Church and the {{government}} remained on unfriendly terms until 1988. In practice, {{the most important aspect}} of this conflict was that openly religious <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which meant that they could not hold any political office. However, among the general population, large numbers remained religious.|$|E
25|$|As the {{demographic}} {{pressure from the}} colonists grew, the remaining Kalapuyans were forcibly removed to Indian reservations. Though some Natives escaped being swept into the reservation, most were moved to the Grand Ronde reservation in 1856. Strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people, known as Métis in French, {{had to make a}} choice between the reservation and Anglo society. Native Americans could not leave the reservation without traveling papers and white <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> enter the reservation.|$|E
50|$|Changes {{in climate}} {{similar to the}} Younger Dryas period or the Little Ice Age punctuate human history.

25|$|For one thing, {{we would}} no longer allow breeding. <b>People</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> create {{different}} breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people had companion animals in their homes, those animals {{would have to be}} refugees from the animal shelters and the streets. You would have a protective relationship with them just as you would with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased out, and we would return to a more symbiotic relationship—enjoyment at a distance.|$|E
25|$|Boxley Abbey had {{a famous}} {{portrait}} of the saint. It was small and of a weight so small a child could lift it but at times became so heavy even strong <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> lift it. According to tradition, the attempt to lift the portrait was a test of a woman's chastity. In practice, those who paid the priest well could lift the portrait with ease, while others could not. Upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England, {{it was discovered that}} the portrait was held by a wooden pin by an unseen person behind the portrait.|$|E
25|$|However, {{recent studies}} suggest many problems. Although the Paraguayan army had between 70,000 and 100,000 {{men at the}} {{beginning}} of the conflict, they were badly equipped. Most infantry armaments consisted of inaccurate smooth-bore muskets and carbines, slow to reload and short-ranged. The artillery was similarly poor. Military officers had no training or experience, and there was no command system, as all decisions were made personally by López. Food, ammunition and armaments were scarce, with logistics and hospital care deficient or nonexistent. The nation of about 450,000 <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> stand against the Triple Alliance of 11 million people.|$|E

25|$|The tiara {{was thus}} worn in formal {{ceremonial}} processions, {{and on other}} occasions when the pope was carried on the sedia gestatoria, a portable throne whose use was ended by Pope John Paul II immediately after his election in October 1978. His short-lived predecessor, John Paul I, also chose initially not to use it, but relented when informed that without it the <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see him. The papal tiara was also worn when a pope gave his traditional Christmas and Easter Urbi et Orbi blessing ("to the City and the World") from the balcony of St Peter's – the only religious ceremony at which the tiara was worn.|$|E
25|$|Around that time, one of Williams' acquaintances, a {{coloured}} lawyer named Edgar Maresse Smith, {{petitioned the}} Governor to declare 1 August a holiday for {{the celebration of}} Emancipation. Robinson did not support it but Gorrie did. Even at that time, there was in Trinidad a highly educated, articulate and race-conscious group of black men, among them John Jacob Thomas, Maresse Smith, Mzumbo Lazare, C. E. Petioni, the Reverend Phillip Henry Douglin. Thomas particularly was famous for his book Froudacity (1889), in which he refuted and questioned the view espoused by Oxford historian James Anthony Froude that black <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be entrusted with self-government. Thomas's ideas certainly inspired Williams.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{separating}} {{church and state}} is often credited to the writings of English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704). According to his principle of the social contract, Locke argued that the government lacked authority {{in the realm of}} individual conscience, as this was something rational <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.|$|E

50|$|Constantine Porphyrogenitus {{records in}} his work De Administrando Imperio that the Khazars asked the Emperor Teophilos to have the {{fortress}} of Sarkel built for them. His record {{is connected to the}} Hungarians on the basis that the new fortress must have become necessary because of the appearance of a new enemy of the Khazars, and other <b>peoples</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be taken into account as the Khazars’ enemies at that time. In the 10th century, a Persian explorer and geographer Ahmad ibn Rustah mentioned that the Khazars entrenched themselves against the attacks of the Hungarians.|$|R
25|$|This {{period was}} fueled by {{skateboard}} companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially on vert ramp skateboarding. The invention of the no-hands aerial (later known as the ollie) by Alan Gelfand in Florida in 1976, and the almost parallel development of the grabbed aerial by George Orton and Tony Alva in California, {{made it possible for}} skaters to perform airs on vertical ramps. While this wave of skateboarding was sparked by commercialized vert ramp skating, a majority of people who skateboarded during this period didn't ride vert ramps. As most <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, street skating increased in popularity.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Peled—member of the Left Camp of Israel Executive {{for the whole}} of the party's six years of existence, though he never held a public office on its behalf—claimed that the Palestinian leadership, {{representing}} its entire <b>people,</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be expected to make in a dialogue with radical Israeli dissidents the kind of concessions that would undermine its negotiating position if and when it came to negotiate with the Government of Israel. (Which, with Menachem Begin as Israel's PM at the time, and Ariel Sharon as Defence Minister, seemed a very distant possibility). In effect, the ICIPP—with Peled and Avnery at its head—became a faction within the Left Camp of Israel, embroiled in constant internecine struggle with the opposing faction.|$|E
5000|$|In the 16th century, Europeans {{began to}} bring slaves from Africa. Spain {{was the only}} European power that <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{establish}} factories in Africa to purchase slaves and therefore the Spanish empire relied on the asiento system, awarding merchants (mostly from Portugal, France, England and the Dutch Empire) the license to trade enslaved people to their overseas territories. Also {{there were people who}} defended the human rights and freedoms of oppressed peoples. The indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be enslaved because they were legally subjects of the Spanish Crown [...] and to protect the indigenous peoples, several forms of land ownership and regulation were established: resguardos, encomiendas and haciendas.|$|R

25|$|Later that evening, Ahasuerus and Haman attend Esther's second banquet, {{at which}} she reveals {{that she is}} Jewish and that Haman is {{planning}} to exterminate her people, which includes her.

The previous decree against the Jewish <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be annulled, so the King allows Mordecai and Esther to write another decree as they wish. They decree that Jewish people may preemptively kill those thought to pose a lethal risk. As a result, on 13 Adar, five hundred attackers and Haman's ten sons are killed in Shushan. Throughout the empire 75,000 of the Jewish peoples' enemies are killed. On the 14th, another 300 are killed in Shushan. No spoils are taken.|$|E
25|$|The first voice {{broadcast}} of 2RN, the original radio callsign for Radio 1, {{took place on}} 14 November 1925 when Seamus Clandillon, the 2RN station director said, 'Seo Raidió 2RN, Baile Átha Cliath ag tástáil', Irish for 'This is Radio 2RN, Dublin calling'. Regular Irish radio-broadcasting began on 1 January 1926. Unfortunately, most Irish <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> receive 2RN's (1.5 kilowatt) signal. When faced with numerous complaints from Cork regarding the writers' inability to tune to the signal, Clandillon remarked in The Irish Radio Review, a magazine dedicated to the service, {{that they did not}} know how to operate their sets. 6CK was established in Cork in 1927; much of 6CK's output was simply a relay of the national service but it also had a significant input into the programmes of 2RN until it was closed down in the 1950s.|$|E
