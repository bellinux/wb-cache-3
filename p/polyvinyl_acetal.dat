40|$|An ion {{exchange}} polymer comprised of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of a poly(carboxylic acid) in a <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetal)</b> matrix is described. The polymer {{is made by}} treating a mixture made of poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(acrylic acid) with a suitable aldehyde and an acid catalyst to cause acetalization with some cross-linking. The material is then subjected to an alkaline aqueous solution of an alkali metal salt or an alkali earth metal salt. All of the film forming and cross-linking steps {{can be carried out}} simultaneously, if desired...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gain insight into the {{mechanisms}} of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetal</b> (PVA) roll brush cleaning in semiconductor device fabrication, we measured the coefficient of friction (COF) between the PVA brush and a substrate. In particular, we focused on the brush rotation speed and the surface wettability. The COF is found to decrease and approach 0. 5 as the brush rotation speed increases. For the case of low rotation speeds, the COF of hydrophobic surfaces has a large value, almost 1. 0, while that of hydrophilic surfaces is small. These results imply that the brush and the surface directly contact and the real contact area of the PVA brush increases over {{the duration of the}} contact time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne novel {{aldehyde}} {{bearing a}} phosphonate group, ca. (3 -diethylphosphonate) propanal, was successfully synthesized and characterized {{by means of}} NMR. Then phosphonic acid ester groups were chemically grafted onto <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetal)</b> pre-made polymers, and especially poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB). Four acetalyzed PVA were then synthesized with different molar contents of either butyral or (3 -diethylphosphonate) propanal groups. Only PVAP 4 was composed of both groups, i. e. 80 mol% of butyral and 20 mol% of phosphonate. TGA of acetalyzed PVA showed a clear improvement of the PVA thermal stability. Furthermore, for PVAP 3, having 50 mol% of phosphonate groups, 40 % of weight remained after 600 C under air. This high thermostability was attributed to stable anhydride bonds. Finally, the coatings were subject to the salt spray test for duration up to 120 h. The results indicate that PVAP 3 coating shows an excellent resistance to corrosion, thus excellent adhesive properties, as no corrosion was observed until 100 h subject to the salt spray tes...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{chemically}} amplified radiation resist having ability of acid multiplication, acid formation in -irradiated polymer films and solutions of acetal compounds containing diphenyliodonium salt has been studied. Acids were generated in the films and solutions by chain reactions in large G-value. The G-value depends on the chemical structure of the polymers and acetal compounds. Compounds containing cyclic acetal structure give large G-values. This dependence {{can be explained by}} difference in the possibility of the electron transfer from radicals of the polymers and acetal compounds to diphenyliodonium salt. <b>Polyvinyl</b> <b>acetals</b> will be a candidate for the dually amplified resist...|$|R
40|$|Acrylic acid (AA) and {{acrylonitrile}} (AN) were synthesized by solution polymerization with nanometer SiO 2. The copolymer {{solution was}} made into {{main body of the}} membranes, then composited with the <b>polyvinyl</b> alcohol (PVA) <b>acetal</b> membranes, to make the three-layer sandwich composite pervaporation membranes. The adsorption and the preferential sorption characteristics of the membranes were analyzed by studying swelling degree in different concentrations of methanol solution. Furthermore, the structure unit ratios of the P(AA-Co-AN/SiO 2) membranes were analyzed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Pervaporation experiments were carried out using these membranes to separate methanol/water mixture, and results showed that selectivity of the membranes has increased with increasing the ratio of AN, but ?ux decreased. When the comonomer ratio AA/AN was 1 / 1, for the 98 wt% mixtures at 60 ?, t he separate factor was up to 1534, and the permeation ?ux was 583 g/(m 2 ·h). Moreover, the composite membranes also showed good stability by a long-term test of the pervaporation experiments. </p...|$|R
40|$|A new {{material}} based on crosslinked poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) (PVBC) with a macromolecular crosslinker is synthesized and employed as the membrane for {{anion exchange membrane}} fuel cells (AEMFCs). PVBC is used as the hydroxide conducting polymers, while <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetal)</b> (PVAc) containing dimethylamino groups plays the role as macromolecular crosslinker and the supporting matrix simultaneously. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectra and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra prove successful crosslinking between PVBC and PVAc. The crosslinked membrane shows hydroxide conductivity larger than 0. 01 S cm(- 1) at room temperature, and the swelling by water at elevated temperature is suppressed. The H- 2 /O- 2 AEMFC using the crosslinked membrane shows a peak power density (P-max) of 124. 7 mW cm(- 2) at 40 degrees C, and the decrease of the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the fuel cell is negligible under continuous OCV conditions for 120 h. All {{the results indicate that}} the crosslinking with a macromolecular crosslinker may be a promising strategy to fabricate anion exchange membrane for the application in the AEMFCs.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{essential}} {{objectives for}} thyroidectomy are: avoidance of {{injury to the}} recurrent laryngeal nerves, conservation of the parathyroid glands, an accurate haemostasis and an excellent cosmesis. In the last 10 years major improvements and new technologies have been proposed and applied in thyroid surgery; among these mini-invasive thyroidectomy, regional anaesthesia and intraoperative neuromonitoring, and new devices for achieving dissection and haemostasis. Minor bleeding from small vessels could be a major complication in thyroid surgery. The purpose of ligating vessels is to maintain the surgical site free from an excess of blood and reduce blood loss in the patient. Materials and methods Hydroxylated <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetal</b> tampons (HPA) are made by a synthetic, open cell foam structure able to absorb fluids up to 25 times the initial weight. We tested their efficacy for small bleeding control and tissue dissection during several thyroid procedures. Results HPA tampons have been found extremely useful to absorb blood coming from minor and diffuse loss, helping to control bleeding by a combined action of fluid absorption and local compression. The porous design of the tampon allows {{the use of the}} suction device right through the tampon itself. Thanks to the initial mildly hard consistency, we also used HPA tampons as dissecting instruments. Conclusion In our experience the use of HPA tampons resulted extremely efficient for minor bleeding control, fluids removal and tissue dissection during thyroid surgery. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective - To {{compare the}} use of two {{ophthalmic}} sponges for tear collection in dogs and cats. Animals studied - Ten healthy dogs and 10 healthy cats. Procedures - A strip (4 x 10 mm) of either cellulose or <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetal</b> (PVA) sponge was inserted into the ventral fornix of each eye for either 15, 30 or 60 seconds. The wetted strip was placed into a 0. 2 -mL tube that was first punctured at its bottom. Tears were eluted through the drainage hole into a 1. 5 -mL tube via centrifugation. Tear volume absorbed (VA) and tear volume recovered (VR) were calculated as the difference of the post- and pre- collection weight of the 0. 2 -mL tube and 1. 5 -mL tube, respectively. Recovery ratio (RR) was determined as the ratio between VR and VA. Results - Ophthalmic sponges were well tolerated by all subjects. In dogs and cats, median (95 % range) VA, VR and RR were: 44 μL (11 - 106 μL) and 16 μL (2 - 43 μL); 27 μL (1 - 84 μL) and 6 μL (0 - 29 μL); 64 % (7 - 91 %) and 35 % (0 - 86 %), respectively. PVA sponges achieved significantly greater VR in cats and RR in both species. All parameters were significantly greater with a collection time of 60 vs. 30 and 15 seconds. Body weight was associated with VA and VR in dogs but not cats. Conclusions – PVA is better than cellulose for tear collection given its superior recovery. Ophthalmic sponges could facilitate routine analysis of tear fluid in dogs and cats, although further {{studies are needed to}} evaluate the quality of tears obtained with this method...|$|E
