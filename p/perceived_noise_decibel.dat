The single stage advanced technology fan was designed to a pressure ratio of 1. 8 at a tip speed of 503 m/sec (1, 650 ft/sec). The two basic approaches taken in the acoustic design were: (1) minimization of noise at the source, and (2) suppression of the generated noise in the inlet and bypass exhaust duct.

50|$|EPNdB, or Effective <b>Perceived</b> <b>Noise</b> {{level in}} <b>decibels,</b> {{is a measure}} of the {{relative}} loudness of an individual aircraft pass-by event.

It is defined in Annex 16 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation and in Part 36 of the US Federal Aviation Regulations.

40|$|The {{retrofit}} of JT 8 D- 109 (refan) {{engines are}} evaluated on a 727 - 200 airplane {{in terms of}} airworthiness, performance, and noise. Design of certifiable hardware, manufacture, and ground testing of the essential nacelle components is included along with analysis of the certifiable airplane design to ensure airworthiness compliance and to predict the in-flight performance and noise characteristics of the modified airplane. The analyses confirm that the 727 refan airplane is certifiable. The refan airplane range would be 15 % less that of the baseline airplane and block fuel would be increased by 1. 5 % to 3 %. However, with this particular 727 - 200 model, with a brake release gross weight of 172, 500 lb (78, 245 kg), {{it is possible to}} operate the airplane (with minor structural modifications) at higher gross weights and increase the range up to 15 % over the 727 - 200 (baseline) airplane.

40|$|Technologies for {{aircraft}} noise reduction {{have been developed}} by NASA over the past 15 years through the Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) Noise Reduction Program and the Quiet Aircraft Technology (QAT) project. This presentation summarizes highlights from these programs and anticipated noise reduction benefits for communities surrounding airports. Historical progress in noise reduction and technologies available for future aircraft/engine development are identified. Technologies address aircraft/engine components including fans, exhaust nozzles, landing gear, and flap systems. New "chevron" nozzles have been developed and implemented on several aircraft in production today that provide significant jet noise reduction. New engines using Ultra-High Bypass (UHB) ratios are projected to provide about 10 EPNdB (Effective <b>Perceived</b> <b>Noise</b> Level in <b>decibels)</b> engine <b>noise</b> reduction relative to the average fleet that was flying in 1997.

40|$|Air trafc {{noise is}} {{a major cause of}} {{community}} annoyance in the residential areas near airports. The present study has been prompted by the need to examine the noise levels induced by the increased air trafc in Delhi in recent years. Noise levels have been measured in the indoor environment of two prominent residential areas of Delhi, namely, University Campus (UC) and Vasant Vihar (VV) which lie underneath the landing ight path of aircraft in Delhi. Spectral distributions show higher noise levels at lower frequencies and exhibit a declining trend with increase in frequency. With the help of spectral information, an index of aircraft <b>noise,</b> PNdB (<b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels in <b>decibels)</b> is determined to assess relative annoyance or noisiness felt by the community of residential areas. PNdB values in the case of UC vary from a minimum of 66. 7 to a maximum of 85. 2. Further down the landing path, PNdB levels at VV are found to be appreciably higher in the range of 76. 1891. 37.

40|$|Jet {{noise from}} supersonic, high {{performance}} aircraft {{is a significant}} problem for takeoff and landing operations near air bases and aircraft carriers. As newer aircraft with higher thrust and performance are introduced, the noise tends to increase due to higher jet exhaust velocities. Jet noise has been a subject of research for over 55 years. Commercial subsonic aircraft benefit from changes to the engine cycle that reduce the exhaust velocities and result in significant noise reduction. Most of the research programs {{over the past few}} decades have concentrated on commercial aircraft. Progress has been made by introducing new engines with design features that reduce the noise. NASA has recently started a new program called "Fundamental Aeronautics" where three projects (subsonic fixed wing, subsonic rotary wing, and supersonics) address aircraft noise. For the supersonics project, a primary goal is to understand the underlying physics associated with jet noise so that improved noise prediction tools and noise reduction methods can be developed for a wide range of applications. Highlights from the supersonics project are presented including prediction methods for broadband shock noise, flow measurement methods, and noise reduction methods. Realistic expectations are presented based on past history that indicates significant jet noise reduction cannot be achieved without major changes to the engine cycle. NASA s past experience shows a few EPNdB (effective <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> level in <b>decibels)</b> can be achieved using low noise design features such as chevron nozzles. Minimal thrust loss can be expected with these nozzles (< 0. 5 %) and they may be retrofitted on existing engines. In the long term, it is desirable to use variable cycle engines that can be optimized for lower jet noise during takeoff operations and higher thrust for operational performance. It is also suggested that noise experts be included early in the design process for engine nozzle systems to participate in decisions that may impact the jet noise...|$|R

40|$|Methods {{developed}} at the NASA Lewis Research Center for predicting the noise contributions from various aircraft noise sources have been incorporated into a computer program for predicting aircraft noise levels either in flight or in ground test. The noise sources accounted for include fan inlet and exhaust, jet, flap (for powered lift), core (combustor), turbine, and airframe. Noise propagation corrections {{are available in the}} program for atmospheric attenuation, ground reflections, extra ground attenuation, and shielding. The capacity to solve the geometrical relationships between an aircraft in flight and an observer on the ground has been included in the program to make it useful in evaluating noise estimates and footprints for various proposed engine installations. The program contains two main routines for employing the noise prediction routines. The first main routine consists of a procedure to calculate at various observer stations the time history of the noise from an aircraft flying at a specified set of speeds, orientations, and space coordinates. The various components of the noise are computed by the program. For each individual source, the noise levels are free field with no corrections for propagation losses other than spherical divergence. The total spectra may then be corrected for the usual effects of atmospheric attenuation, extra ground attenuation, ground reflection, and aircraft shielding. Next, the corresponding values of overall sound pressure level, <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> level, and tone-weighted <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> level are calculated. From the time history at each point, true effective <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels are calculated. Thus, values of effective <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels, maximum <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels, and tone-weighted <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels are found for a grid of specified points on the ground. The second main routine is designed to give the usual format of one-third octave sound pressure level values at a fixed radius for a number of user-selected angles, such as would simulate the ground acoustic testing of an engine.

We assessed noise at four paper mills using three measures: 1) personal noise dosimetry, 2) area noise measurements, and 3) questionnaire items addressing several different aspects of <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> exposure. MethodsWe assessed exposures to noise characterized using the three measures and compared the relationships between them. We also estimated the validity of each of the three measures using a novel application of the Method of Triads, which {{does not appear to have}} been used previously in the occupational health literature. ResultsWe collected 209 valid dosimetry measurements and collected <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> exposure survey items from 170 workers, along with 100 area measurements. We identified exposures in excess of 85 dBA at all mills. The dosimetry and area noise measurements assigned to individual subjects generally showed good agreement, but for some operations within mill, large differences between the two measures were observed, and a substantial fraction of paired measures differed by > 5 dB. <b>Perceived</b> <b>noise</b> exposures varied greatly between the mills, particularly for an item related to difficulty speaking in <b>noise.</b> One <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> exposure item related to difficulty hearing due to noise showed strong and significant correlations with both dosimetry and area measurements. The Method of Triads analysis showed that dosimetry measures had the highest estimated validity coefficient (0. 70), and that the best performing perceived exposure measure had validity that exceeded that of area measurements (0. 48 vs. 0. 40, respectively). ConclusionsWorkers in Swedish pulp mills have the potential for exposures to high levels of noise.

Using three different databases, we are able to obtain a relative large sample of about 2 800 apartments located in Geneva, Switzerland. The sample contains both scientific measures and <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> data, as well as structural and accessibility variables. However, in order to compare scientific and <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> measures we need them expressed in comparable units, e. g. dB(A). Since no such data is available, we refer to the acoustic literature to transform a categorical variable on <b>perceived</b> external <b>noise</b> into a measure directly comparable to a scientific measure of noise in dB(A). We show that a clear relationship appears between the scientific measure of road traffic noise and the transformation of the <b>perceived</b> external <b>noise</b> in dB(A). From this relationship, it is interesting to note that: 1) There is a great variability in the perception of noise when the scientific noise level is relatively low; and 2) The systematic bias of subjective overestimation of low probability events that has been highlighted in the risk literature also parallels with our findings here concerning the perceived exposure to external noise. Having both noise measures in comparable units, we are able to analyse their performance in the context of the hedonic model. We conclude that for moderate to high noise levels, the scientific measures of noise safely approximate the individual perception of it.
