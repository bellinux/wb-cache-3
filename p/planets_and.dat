5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Mysterium and {{with the blessing of}} the Graz school inspectors, Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work. He planned four additional books: one on the stationary aspects of the universe (the Sun and the fixed stars); one on the <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> their motions; one on the physical nature of <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> the formation of geographical features (focused especially on Earth); and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth, to include atmospheric optics, meteorology, and astrology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{relative}} motions for the toroidal drive are analysed. The sliding factors between the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> the stator or the worm are given. The friction coefficients between the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> the stator or the worm under asperity contact or hydrodynamic lubrica-tion are presented. The friction coefficients between the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> the stator or the worm under partial hydrodynamic lubrication are also given. Changes of the sliding factors between the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> the stator or the worm along with drive parameters are presented. The friction coef-ficients between the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> the stator or the worm under hydrodynamic lubrication are compared, {{and the changes}} of them along with drive parameters are discussed. Under asperity contact, the changes of the friction coefficient between the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> the stator along with the drive parameters are given as well. Under partial hydrodynamic lubrication, the changes of the friction coefficient between the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> the stator along with {{the ratio of the}} film thickness to mean standard deviations of the height distributions for two teeth are also discussed. These results can be used for friction design of the toroidal drive...|$|R

5|$|Astronomer Michael E. Brown, co-discoverer of Sedna and {{the dwarf}} <b>planets</b> , , <b>and</b> , thinks {{that it is}} the most scientifically {{important}} trans-Neptunian object found to date, because understanding its unusual orbit is likely to yield valuable information about the origin and early evolution of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} day, {{following}} 'secret' negotiations, a compromise began to emerge after the Executive Committee moved explicitly to exclude consideration of extra-solar <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> to bring into the definition a criterion concerning the dominance of a body in its neighbourhood.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the wide}} {{separation}} between this <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> its host star, and {{the proximity of the}} 14 Herculis system to the Sun, it is a promising candidate for direct imaging of the planet, as the angular separation of the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> host star will be large enough that the light from the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> star might be spatially resolved. However, a search made using the adaptive optics CFHT 3.60m telescope on Mauna Kea did not make such a detection, confirming the object is not a star.|$|R

5|$|During the 18–19th centuries, {{the study}} of the three body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert led to more {{accurate}} predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Lagrange and Laplace, allowing the masses of the <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> moons to be estimated from their perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Ephemerides {{with complex}} astrological calculations, and almanacs {{interpreting}} celestial events {{for use in}} medicine and for choosing times to plant crops, were popular in Elizabethan England. In 1597, the English mathematician and physician Thomas Hood made a set of paper instruments that used revolving overlays to help students work out relationships between fixed stars or constellations, the midheaven, and the twelve astrological houses. Hood's instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between {{the signs of the}} zodiac, the <b>planets,</b> <b>and</b> the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by the <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> signs. While Hood's presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from Gerard Mercator's astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator.|$|E
5|$|Gravitationally rounded {{objects in}} the Solar System have a rounded, {{ellipsoidal}} shape due to the forces of their own gravity (hydrostatic equilibrium) and their sizes range from dwarf <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> moons to the <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> the sun.

5|$|Jean-Luc Margot refined Stern and Levison's {{concept to}} produce a similar {{parameter}} Π (Pi). It is based on theory, avoiding the empirical data used by Λ. Π > 1 indicates a planet, and there is again a gap of several orders of magnitude between <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> dwarf planets.|$|E

5|$|Thousands of exoplanets {{have been}} {{identified}} in the last twenty years.

5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} heat {{is produced}} from the collisions {{that created the}} body, by the decay of radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E

5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's {{habitable}} zone, its gravitational influence would disrupt {{the orbit of}} planets in the outer part of the habitable zone. In addition, it may have disrupted the formation of terrestrial <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system. Therefore, planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris {{are likely to be}} small and dry.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E
