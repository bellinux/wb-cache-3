5|$|Pugs {{can suffer}} from necrotizing meningo{{encephalitis}} (NME), {{also known as}} Pug dog encephalitis (PDE), an inflammation {{of the brain and}} meninges. NME also occurs in other small dogs, such as the Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, and Chihuahua. There is no known cure for NME, which is believed to be an inherited disease. Dogs usually die or have to be <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> within a few months of onset, which, in those susceptible to this condition, is typically between six months and seven years of age.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins when}} the player assumes {{the role of}} a {{stranger}} who arrives at Tantegel Castle. A castle guard tells him that a dragon has captured the princess and is holding her captive in a distant cave. Determined to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord, he discovers an ancient tablet hidden inside a desert cave; carved on the tablet is a message from Erdrick that outlines what the hero needs to do to follow in Erdrick's footsteps and defeat the Dragonlord. The hero eventually rescues Princess Gwaelin, but realizes that in order to restore light to Alefgard, he must defeat the Dragonlord at Charlock Castle. After the hero collects a series of relics, he creates a bridge to reach Charlock and fights his way through the castle before finally confronting the Dragonlord. At this point the hero is given a dialogue choice – to side with the Dragonlord or to challenge him. If players choose the former, the game ends, the hero is <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and the game freezes; however, in the GBC remake, the hero instead wakes up from a bad dream. If players choose to fight, a final battle between the hero and the Dragonlord commences.|$|E

5|$|Susan {{suspects}} Karl {{is having}} an affair with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), but is disappointed to learn that it was Malcolm. Karl and Susan get stuck in a storage shed and they reminisce about their past. They share a kiss goodbye and Susan goes to stay with Toadie and Sonya. Susan notices Audrey is not herself and she and Karl learn Audrey is dying. They care for her before she is <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> When Karl goes to bury Audrey in the garden, Susan stops him and says she wants Audrey to be buried somewhere that she can visit often. They argue, but put aside their differences when Audrey's body, which was placed in an esky, is collected by a hard rubbish collector. Karl rescues the esky and he and Susan bury Audrey at Sonya's nursery. Susan soon finds an apartment to move into. Susan accompanies Karl to the funeral of an old friend and they share a drink together. Paul asks Susan to write a negative article about Ajay Kapoor (Sachin Joab) and the community centre plans, but she refuses. She later discovers Paul sabotaged Natasha Williams's (Valentina Novakovic) party by inviting gatecrashers to it, so he could continue his vendetta against Ajay and the police station merger. Susan tells Paul to publish a retraction or she will write an exposé.|$|E

25|$|Positional Plagiocephaly – IN 1992, to {{decrease}} the incidence of SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics initiated the “Back to Sleep” campaign, which recommended that babies be <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> on their backs. While this almost halved the number of SIDS deaths, the campaign appeared to also help raise plagiocephaly incidence fivefold, to roughly one in sixty live births. Plagiocephaly is simply the flattening of one area of the skull, generally one babies tend to favor as they lie. While treatment is often as simply as repositioning the baby during sleep, in more pronounced cases helmet therapy may be put to use. In most cases, plagiocephaly is quite minor and easily resolved, with many more pediatric plastic surgeons becoming familiar with helmet therapy for more advanced cases.|$|E

500|$|In Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, Sora, Donald and Goofy's {{search for}} Riku and Mickey {{leads them to}} Castle Oblivion, a {{fortress}} controlled by a mysterious group of non-existent [...] "Nobodies" [...] called Organization XIII, who {{use the power of}} a girl named Naminé to manipulate the trio's memories. After defeating the Organization, the three are <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for a year by Naminé to allow them to regain their memories, though they must lose the memories of their experience in Castle Oblivion. Meanwhile, Riku arrives {{in the basement of the}} castle and ascends to the surface with the aid of Mickey. Discovering Sora's sleeping state, Riku helps Naminé keep him safe until he is awoken. In Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, a snag in the plan over the year forces Riku to capture Roxas—Sora's Nobody, who is born when Sora briefly becomes a Heartless in the first game—in order to enable Sora's reawakening.|$|E
500|$|Sora ascends the castle, facing {{off against}} other hooded figures who form {{a group called}} [...] "the Organization" [...] along the way. As Sora loses his memories, he {{gradually}} appears to remember a girl named Naminé as {{an old friend of}} his, and learns from the Organization member Larxene that she is being held prisoner in the castle. He also clashes with a replica of Riku created and controlled by another Organization member, Vexen, and believed by both Sora and the replica himself to be the real Riku. Axel, an Organization double agent, releases Naminé and allows her to meet Sora in person. Sora discovers Naminé to be the one manipulating his memories, having been forced to do so by Marluxia, the lord of Castle Oblivion and the figure who lured Sora there, as part of his plan to overthrow the rest of the Organization with Larxene. Sora climbs {{to the top of the}} tower and defeats Marluxia and the other Organization members, after which Naminé puts Sora and his friends into pod-like machines to help them regain the memories they lost in the castle, even though they will forget the events that transpired in the castle. Before they are <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> Sora and Naminé promise to meet again as real friends once he reawakens, Sora firmly believing that his memories of her and the castle will remain in his heart despite being forgotten.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is useful}} to {{underline}} {{that the majority of}} 18th century lodges belonged to one man who became his lodge's President and so usually died out when he or his descendents died out. [...] Examples of this include the [...] "Parfaite Union" [...] (Fonson family), [...] "Vraie et Parfaite harmonie" [...] (Marquis de Gage) and [...] "Union des cœurs" [...] ("Union of Hearts", by the chevalier de Sicard) lodges. Others, like the [...] "Parfaite Union/Bonne Amitié" [...] of Namur, did not have this characteristic and had presidents who succeeded each other quite regularly.

2500|$|Pain {{is common}} and {{may result from}} the {{inherent}} deficits associated with the condition, along with the numerous procedures children typically face. Pain is associated with tight or shortened muscles, abnormal posture, stiff joints, unsuitable orthosis, etc. There is also a high likelihood of chronic sleep disorders secondary to both physical and environmental factors. [...] Children with cerebral palsy have significantly higher rates of sleep disturbance than typically developing children. [...] Babies with cerebral palsy who have stiffness issues might cry more and be harder to <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> than non-disabled babies, or [...] "floppy" [...] babies might be lethargic. [...] Chronic pain is under-recognized in children with cerebral palsy, even though 3 out of 4 children with cerebral palsy experience pain.|$|E
2500|$|Walker and Stickgold {{hypothesized}} that after initial memory acquisition, sleep reorganizes memory representation at a macro-brain systems level. Their experiment {{consisted of two}} groups; the night-sleep group was taught a motor sequence block tapping task at night, <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and then retested 12 hours later. The day-wake group was taught the same task {{in the morning and}} tested 12 hours later with no intervening sleep. FMRI was used to measure brain activity during retest. Results indicated significantly fewer errors/sequence in the night-sleep group compared to the day wake group. FMRI output for the night-sleep group indicated increased activation in the right primary motor cortex/M1/Prefrontal Gyrus (contra lateral to the hand they were block tapping with), right anterior medial prefrontal lobe, right hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial memory), right ventral striatum (olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens), as well as regions of the cerebellum (lobules V1, V11). In the day-wake group, fMRI showed [...] "decreased" [...] signal activation bilaterally in the parietal cortices (integrates multiple modalities), in addition to the left insular cortex (regulation of homeostasis), left temporal pole (most anterior of temporal cortex), and the left inferior fronto-polar cortex. Previous investigations have shown that signal increases indicate brain plasticity. The increased signal activity seen in M1 after sleep corresponds to increased activity in this area seen during practice; however, an individual must practice for longer periods than they would have to sleep in order to obtain the same level of M1 signal increases. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep enhances the cortical representation of motor tasks by brain system expansion, as seen by increased signal activity.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Englund {{continued}} {{his role as}} Krueger on October 9, 1988, in the television anthology series, Freddy's Nightmares. The show was hosted by Freddy, who did not take direct part {{in most of the}} episodes, but he did show up occasionally to influence the plot of particular episodes. Further, a consistent theme in each episode was characters having disturbing dreams. The series ran for two seasons, 44 episodes, ending March 10, 1990. Although most of the episodes did not feature Freddy taking {{a major role in the}} plot, the pilot episode, [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy", depicts the events of his trial, and his subsequent death at the hands of the parents of Elm Street after his acquittal. In [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy", though Freddy's case seems open and shut, a mistrial is declared based on the arresting officer, Lt. Tim Blocker, not reading Krueger his Miranda rights, which is different from the original Nightmare that stated he was released because someone forgot to sign a search warrant in the right place. The episode also reveals that Krueger used an ice cream van to lure children close enough so that he could kidnap and kill them. After the town's parents burn Freddy to death he returns to haunt Blocker in his dreams. Freddy gets his revenge when Blocker is <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at the dentist's office, and Freddy shows up and kills him. The episode [...] "Sister's Keeper" [...] was a [...] "sequel" [...] to this episode, even though it was the seventh episode of the series. The episode follows Krueger as he terrorizes the Blocker twins, the identical twin daughters of Lt. Tim Blocker, and frames one sister for the other's murder. Season two's [...] "It's My Party And You'll Die If I Want You To" [...] featured Freddy attacking a high school prom date who stood him up twenty years earlier.
