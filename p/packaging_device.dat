40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three dimensional (3 D) magnetic field sensor composed of three Hall elements with similar characteristics. Through adopting complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) technology, the chips of Hall element were designed and fabricated on the p-type silicon substrate with high resistivity.

40|$|All organisms have {{to monitor}} the folding state of {{cellular}} proteins precisely. The heat-shock protein DegP is a protein quality control factor in the bacterial envelope that is involved in eliminating misfolded proteins and in the biogenesis of outer-membrane proteins. Here we describe the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulated protease and chaperone function of DegP from Escherichia coli. We show that binding of misfolded proteins transforms hexameric DegP into large, catalytically active 12 -meric and 24 -meric multimers. A structural analysis of these particles revealed that DegP represents a protein <b>packaging</b> <b>device</b> whose central compartment is adaptable to the size and concentration of substrate. Moreover, the inner cavity serves antagonistic functions. Whereas the encapsulation of folded protomers of outer-membrane proteins is protective and might allow safe transit through the periplasm, misfolded proteins are eliminated in the molecular reaction chamber. Oligomer reassembly and concomitant activation on substrate binding may also be critical in regulating other HtrA proteases implicated in protein-folding diseases...|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{microfluidics}} holds {{great promise}} for large-scale integration of versatile, digitalized, and multitasking fluidic manipulations for biological and clinical applications. Successful translation of microfluidic toolsets to these purposes faces persistent technical challenges, such as reliable system-level <b>packaging,</b> <b>device</b> assembly and alignment, and world-to-chip interface. In this paper, we extended our previously established fit-to-flow (F 2 F) world-to-chip interconnection scheme {{to a complete}} system-level assembly strategy that addresses the three-dimensional microfluidic integration on demand. The modular F 2 F assembly consists of an interfacial chip, pluggable alignment modules, and multiple monolithic layers of microfluidic channels, through which convoluted three-dimensional microfluidic networks can be easily assembled and readily sealed with the capability of reconfigurable fluid flow. The monolithic laser-micromachining process simplifies and standardizes the fabrication of single-layer pluggable polymeric modules, which can be mass-produced as the renowned Lego® building blocks. In addition, interlocking features are implemented between the plug-and-play microfluidic chips and the complementary alignment modules through the F 2 F assembly, resulting in facile and secure alignment with average misalignment of 45 [*]μm. Importantly, the 3 D multilayer microfluidic assembly has a comparable sealing performance as the conventional single-layer devices, providing an average leakage pressure of 38. 47 [*]kPa.

40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{strength}} and low density, the corrugated fibreboard (CFB) box {{is one of}} the most popular types of packaging all over the world. This <b>packaging</b> <b>device</b> is able to fulfil a huge number of requirements of the logistic process, during the phases of handling, shipping and storage. In addition to this, corrugated packaging is easily machinable, so it is also suitable for special supply chains and products. These special needs include the requirement to fit to the inner measurements of the shipping device, e. g. the shipping container. This is particularly expected in case of less than container-load (LTL) shipments, where the shipping cost is usually based on the required area (m 2) or cubic capacity (m 3) of the container, so the useful filling of the shipping device is a very strong advantage. Naturally, this is easily solvable with different CFB boxes which have different heights, but this way the user needs to stock a high variety of boxes, requires a good relationship and cooperation between the parties and also a proper knowledge of product organisation in each box version. The multi-depth corrugated boxes are a suitable solution for resolving this problem. These boxes are creased at multiple intervals, so they are easily cuttable to the desired various heights. But the pre-scored lines can cause a loss of the compression strength capability of the box and thereby can lead to damages. The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of multiple creasing lines on the compression strength of the CFB box. This paper does not focus on the effect of either different creasing parameter, such as depth and width, nor on the distances between each creasing. Based on the test results, the compression strengths are decreased nearly significantly due to the additional creasing line(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} (SLS) {{is one of}} the most popular 3 D printing methods that uses a laser to pattern energy and selectively sinter powder particles to build 3 D geometries. However, this printing method is plagued by slow printing speeds, high power consumption, difficulty to scale, and high overhead expense. In this research, a new 3 D printing method is proposed to overcome these limitations of SLS. Instead of using a laser to pattern energy, this new method, termed selective resistive sintering (SRS), uses an array of microheaters to pattern heat for selectively sintering materials. Using microheaters offers significant power savings, significantly reduced overhead cost, and increased printing speed scalability. The objective of this thesis is to obtain a proof of concept of this new method. To achieve this objective, we first designed a microheater to operate at temperatures of 600 ⁰C, with a thermal response time of ~ 1 ms, and even heat distribution. A <b>packaging</b> <b>device</b> with electrical interconnects was also designed, fabricated, and assembled with necessary electrical components. Finally, a z-stage was designed to control the airgap between the printhead and the powder particles. The whole system was tested using two different scenarios. Simulations were also conducted to determine the feasibility of the printing method. We were able to successfully operate the fabricated microheater array at a power consumption of 1. 1 W providing significant power savings over lasers. Experimental proof of concept was unsuccessful due to the lack of precise control of the experimental conditions, but simulation results suggested that selectivity sintering nanoparticles with the microheater array was a viable process. Based on our current results that the microheater can be operated at ~ 1 ms timescale to sinter powder particles, it is believed this new process can potentially be significantly quicker than selective {{laser sintering}} by increasing the number of microheater elements in the array. The low cost of a microheater array printhead will also make this new process affordable. This thesis presented a pioneering study on the feasibility of the proposed SRS process, which could potentially enable the development of a much more affordable and efficient alternative to SLS...|$|E

40|$|Purpose In recent years, a new {{perspective}} for food packaging {{has emerged as a}} result of several issues like quality, safety, competitive prices or providing of useful information to consumers. This {{new perspective}} is called communicative packaging. Communicative packaging may influence consumers/companies on purchasing decisions. Since the environmental evaluation of such systems has not yet been performed, this paper is focused on the environmental evaluation of a flexible best-before-date (FBBD) communicative device on a packaging consumer unit and its implications on reducing environmental impacts related to fresh products. This consumer unit consists of a nanoclay-based polylactic acid tray filled with pork chops. Methods The environmental assessment of the consumer unit was made through life cycle assessment (LCA) using a cradle-to-gate approach. Environmental impacts were assessed according to the Eco-Indicator 99 v 2. 1 methodology in Individualist (I) perspective. Results and discussion Several results were obtained from the LCA. With regard to environmental impacts of the FBBD, most of them were due to the paper substrate used for the manufacture of this communicative packaging concept {{as well as to the}} transports for delivering the components of the FBBD communicative device. On the other hand, when environmental impacts of packaging system with and without FBBD were compared, a large environmental load was detected for the system that has the communicative device affixed as a result of the higher weight of the package. However, the environmental load caused by the use of the FBBD was minimal in comparison with the total environmental load of the whole packaging system. On the contrary, the consumer unit that has the communicative device affixed showed less environmental burden than the consumer unit that has not affixed the device. This was due to the environmental benefits that the communicative device provides by reducing the amount of out-of-date packaged products at retailer outlets. Conclusions The use of a FBBD contributes to minimize environmental burdens related to the production, packaging and delivery of pork chops since it facilitates a dynamic control of out-of-date products even though the consumer unit with FBBD weighs 1 g more than the consumer unit that does not use the communicative device. Recommendations The results presented in this paper are estimated results of a specific case study for a prototype of communicative <b>packaging</b> <b>device.</b> Consequently, these results must be considered as a first approach according to future developments on communicative packaging...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was {{to determine the effects of}} reminder packaging to enhance patient adherence with self-administered medications taken for one month or more. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO from the start of the databases to 1 September 2004. We also searched the internet, contacted packaging manufacturers, and checked abstracts from the Pharm-line database and reference lists from relevant articles. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials with at least 80 % follow up, comparing a reminder <b>packaging</b> <b>device</b> with no device in participants taking self-administered medications for a minimum of one month. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted data from included studies. Where considered appropriate, data were combined for meta-analysis, or were reported and discussed in a narrative. MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies containing data on 1, 137 participants were included. Six intervention groups in four trials provided data on the percentage of pills taken. Reminder packaging showed a significant increase in the percentage of pills taken, weighted mean difference 11 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 6 % to 17 %). Notable heterogeneity occurred among these trials I(2) = 96. 3 %. Two trials provided data for the proportion of self-reported adherent patients, reporting a reduction in the intervention group which was not statistically significant, odds ratio = 0. 89 (95 % CI 0. 56 to 1. 40).

This review of reminder packaging is an update of our 2006 Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was {{to determine the effects of}} reminder packaging aids for self-administered medication/s taken for at least one month, on adherence and other outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We updated searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library Issue 9, 2010), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO from the database start dates to September 2010. We searched Current Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress. We performed a cited reference search on the Science Citation Index to identify papers that had cited the original systematic review. We also searched the Internet, contacted packaging manufacturers, and checked abstracts from the Pharm-line database and reference lists from relevant articles. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials with at least 80 % follow up. We intended to do a sensitivity analysis of those studies that analysed their data on an intention-to-treat basis. Included studies compared a reminder <b>packaging</b> <b>device</b> with no device, for participants taking self-administered medications for at least one month. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted data from included studies. Where considered appropriate, data were combined for meta-analysis, or were reported and discussed in a narrative. MAIN RESULTS: We included twelve studies containing data on 2196 participants; four of these studies were newly included in this 2011 update of our 2006 Cochrane review. Six intervention groups in four trials provided data on the percentage of pills taken. Reminder packaging increased the percentage of pills taken (mean difference (MD) 11 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 6 % to 17 %)). Notable heterogeneity occurred among these trials (I(2) = 96. 3 %). Two trials provided data for the proportion of self-reported adherent patients, reporting a reduction in the intervention group which was not statistically significant (odds ratio = 0. 89 (95 % CI 0. 56 to 1. 40)). We conducted meta-analysis on data from two trials assessing the effect of reminder packaging on blood pressure measurements. We found that reminder packaging significantly decreased diastolic blood pressure (MD = - 5. 89 mmHg (95 % CI - 6. 70 to - 5. 09; P < 0. 00001; I(2) = 0 %). No effect was seen on systolic blood pressure (mean change - 1. 01, 95 % CI - 2. 22 to 0. 20; P = 0. 1, I(2) = 0 %). We also conducted meta-analysis on extracted data from two trials that looked at change in glycated haemoglobin. We found that reminder packaging significantly reduced glycated haemoglobin levels (MD - 0. 72; 95 % CI - 0. 83 to - 0. 60; P < 0. 00001; I(2) = 92 %), although there was considerable heterogeneity. No appropriate data were available for meta-analysis of remaining clinical outcomes, which included serum vitamin C and E levels, and self-reported psychological symptoms (one trial each). We reported remaining data narratively. In one study the presence of a reminder packaging aid was found to be preferred by patients with low literacy levels.

40|$|A {{challenging}} application space {{exists for}} high-aspect-ratio, high-fidelity dielectrics in micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS), microelectronic, and photonic applications. Photosensitive polymers {{are widely used}} in these fields because they are relatively easy to process and pattern, and have good mechanical properties. Photosensitive polynorbornene (PNB) -based dielectrics {{have been shown to}} have high sensitivity, excellent photodefinition properties, and high mechanical strength making them suitable for MEMS, microelectronic packaging, and photonic applications. PNB-based dielectrics can be functionalized with epoxide, carboxylic acid, or fluorinated alcohol groups. Epoxy or carboxylic acid groups can be used to provide cross-linkable sites, resulting in improved chemical and thermal properties while fluorinated alcohol groups can provide solubility in aqueous base. The focus of this study has been on the epoxy-based cross-linking of ultraviolet and electron beam (e-beam) sensitive negative-tone PNB-based dielectrics. The impact of multifunctional epoxy-based additives on the cross-linking, photolithographic properties, and adhesion properties of the photosensitive PNB dielectric was investigated. High aspect ratio features of 13 : 1 (height:width) were produced in 40 µm thick films (a single coat) with straight side-wall profiles and high fidelity. Contrast values as high as 33. 4 were obtained at doses below 15 mJ/cm 2. To evaluate the polymer's suitability to MEMS and microelectronics applications, epoxy cross-linking reactions were studied as a function of processing condition through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nanoindentation, swelling and dielectric measurements. The fully cross-linked films had an elastic modulus of 2. 9 GPa and hardness of 0. 18 GPa which can improve the mechanical compliance of the <b>packaging</b> <b>device.</b> To explore the feasibility of the PNB dielectric as a highly sensitive e-beam resist for nano scale fabrication, the e-beam initiated reaction between PNB cross-linking sites and the multifunctional epoxy cross-linkers was investigated. In this study, the interaction of an e-beam with the PNB mixture and its compounds was investigated. The contrast, photodefinability, and e-beam activation of the components in the PNB formulations were studied. The PNB polymer had very high e-beam sensitivity and contrast. It was shown that the addition of a photoacid generator (PAG) to the polymer-epoxy mixture enhanced the contrast and sensitivity. Formulations with the additional cross-linker showed improved contrast, sensitivity, and substrate adhesion. 100 nm structures with 13. 5 nm line edge roughness (LER) were fabricated. The influence of the developing time, the developer concentration, PEB, and film thickness on the contrast and sensitivity were studied. Structures with contrast values as high as approximately 8 were fabricated at doses as low as 0. 38 µC/cm 2. The acid-catalyzed epoxy ring opening reaction of the PNB dielectric was studied using FTIR spectroscopy. The photo and thermal acid generation initiated epoxy ring opening reactions and subsequent cross-linking of polymer. Additionally, polymer properties were characterized as a function of processing conditions for this polymer system. It was shown that thermal cure conditions have a substantial impact on the mechanical and electrical properties of the polymer. The rate and ultimate conversion of the epoxy ring opening reaction increased with increasing cure temperature, resulting in a higher degree of cross-linking at cure temperatures above 140 °C. Degradation reactions occurred at temperatures above 160 °C, indicating loss of epoxide cross-linking groups and linkages. These hypotheses were supported by electrical and mechanical property studies. It was shown that curing the PNB polymer at 160 °C for 1 h after develop resulted in full epoxy ring opening and highest cross-link density. This sample showed lower dielectric constant (3. 9), residual stress (20 MPa), and solvent swelling (3. 1 %). Variable frequency microwave (VFM) processing of the PNB dielectric was studied to investigate the rapid curing of the polymer at lower temperatures. The FTIR results showed that the microwave reaction rates were higher at each isothermal cure temperature compared to convective heating, indicating that the rapid VFM curing of PNB at low temperatures is feasible. The PNB film was fully cross-linked after 15 min VFM cure at the low temperature of 150 ˚C. The shortest time to fully cure the polymer was found to be 5 min at 160 °C. Also, the feasibility of rapid VFM curing of PNB in air was studied. All samples VFM-cured (140 ˚C- 180 ˚C) in air showed no signs of oxidation. The electrical and mechanical properties of VFM-cured films were characterized and compared with thermally cured films to determine the effectiveness of the VFM processing. VFM-cured samples showed higher degree of cross-linking than thermally-cured samples, which was congruent with the FTIR results. Improved or equivalent properties were obtained for VFM-cured samples at shorter cure cycles and lower cure temperatures compared to thermally-cured films. The PNB dielectric was also used as an overcoat material to make micro and nano fluidic channels. In this work, incorporation of advanced micro/nano fluidics with high-sensitivity photonic sensors was demonstrated. 500 nm to 50 µm channels were fabricated by thermal decomposition of epoxy-based PNB polymers. Microdisks with quality factors of over 106 were presented in complementary metal-xide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible SiN on oxide technology. These ultra-high quality factor SiN resonators were demonstrated in the visible range for the first time. The fluidic structures were interfaced with photonics for index and florescence sensing.

Chemical reactions, which can arise when red phosphorus is exposed to ambient humidity to form highly mobile ions and oxygen-containing phosphorus acids, are presented. These ions and acids can induce electro-chemical migration, causing short circuits between leads and between wires, internal to the <b>packaged</b> <b>device.</b> Field failures caused by the red phosphorous flame retardant are also presented...|$|R

Packaging provides stable resonator-fiber taper coupling, long-term maintenance of high-Q, a protective layer against contaminants, and portability to microtoroid resonator based devices. We tested the robustness of the <b>packaged</b> <b>device</b> under various conditions and demonstrated its capability for thermal sensing. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, 20 reference...|$|R

30|$|Wafer bonding {{is used in}} {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) {{to protect}} and package sensitive internal structures from environmental influences, such as temperature, humidity and pressure. Wafer bonding is classified into direct bonding, anodic bonding and bonding performed by introducing an intermediate layer [1]. The anodic bonding process is among the wafer bonding techniques widely used for MEMS packaging, since it provides strong bonding strength, hermetic encapsulation, high temperature resistance and permanent bonding; frequently used to <b>package</b> <b>devices</b> such as accelerometers and pressure sensors [2, 3].|$|R

The method employs analytically derived expressions, {{and is based on}} the analysis of measured S-parameters over an appropriate frequency range. The approach produces a good fit between measured and simulated S-parameters for plastic <b>packaged</b> <b>devices,</b> as demonstrated in the results for PHEMT devices up to 26. 5 GHz and for low-cost LNAs up to 6 GHz.
