2500|$|... "…if {{by chance}} {{anyone who had}} been in {{attendance}} on the elders should come my way, I inquired about the words of the elders – that is, what according to the elders Andrew or <b>Peter</b> <b>said,</b> or Philip, or Thomas or James, or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples, and whatever Aristion and the elder John, the Lord’s disciples, were saying." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Greek word messias appears {{only twice}} in the Septuagint of the promised prince ( [...] ; [...] ). This title was used when a name was wanted for the promised one who was to be at once King and Savior. The New Testament states that the long-awaited messiah had come and {{describes}} this savior as [...] "the Christ". In , the apostle <b>Peter</b> <b>said,</b> {{in what has become}} a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first century, [...] "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keegan had {{a clause}} {{inserted}} into his contract {{when he joined}} Hamburg in 1977, giving Liverpool the option to buy him back. Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause {{when he returned to}} England three years later. As late as November 2011, Keegan has stated, [...] "I was with Lawrie [...] at a charity event the other day, and he said he phoned up Peter Robinson because he wanted me, but Liverpool had a clause. <b>Peter</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, we won’t be signing him, definitely, we don't need him.'" [...] It was therefore Southampton boss Lawrie McMenemy who snapped him up for £420,000, and Keegan made his Southampton debut at Lansdowne Road in a pre-season friendly against Shamrock Rovers on 23 July 1980.|$|E

5000|$|In an 2014 op-ed, <b>Peters</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "being anti-Israel is the {{socially}} acceptable form of anti-Semitism" [...] {{and that that}} the Middle East was a [...] "sea of barbarism".|$|R
2500|$|Peter is {{best friends}} with his {{anthropomorphic}} dog, Brian. In earlier seasons, Brian often {{served as a}} voice of reason for Peter, helping him out with issues. Brian is extremely grateful to Peter for picking him up as a stray, shown during a flashback in the episode, [...] "". His gratitude was affirmed in, [...] "New Kidney in Town", where Brian is prepared to give up both his kidneys (and his life), so that Peter could undergo a kidney transplant (although {{he did not have}} to do it thanks to another donor being found).

2500|$|The episode {{featured}} various {{references to}} the popular culture. The episode title is taken from the official Spanish title for the series. While at the Veterans Day parade, Peter hears Herbert sing [...] "God Bless The USA" [...] by Lee Greenwood. When at the bar, <b>Peter</b> <b>said</b> he got a tattoo of the Space Shuttle on his penis and Quagmire in his head {{said he was going}} to do it and plays [...] "I Love a Rainy Night" [...] by Eddie Rabbitt. When Peter acts like a super U.S. Patriot he terminates anything associated with illegal immigration, such as arresting Brian's 85-year-old Korean Buddhist accupuncturist and discarding Stewie's Speedy Gonzales video. During the scene in which Peter and Brian are talking about immigrants, Peter says that [...] "they are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take 'em away!" [...] This is a reference to a line spoken by Darth Vader to Princess Leia in the movie Star Wars. The party Peter is invited to is the celebration of Cinco de Mayo. The scene in which Peter is hired as a babysitter of two children is a reference to the film Mary Poppins. When taking the immigration test, Peter is asked who founded America to which he replies [...] "Dick York" [...] but then quickly changes his answer to [...] "Dick Sargent". This is a reference to the two actors who played Darrin Stephens on the 1960s television show Bewitched. [...] Quagmire considers getting a tattoo in the shape of the Space Needle. John McCain is referenced. The ending to the film Dirty Dancing is referenced. While Peter is seen sacrificing a goat in the name of Toby Keith, it is seen gone and a hat slowly disappearing into the brush, is reference to Jurassic Park with the Tyrannosaurus eating the goat. Also, during that scene, Lois says [...] "Toby Keith doesn't want to be fed. Toby Keith wants to hunt." [...] is a parody of the quote [...] "T-Rex does not want to be fed, he wants to hunt." [...] in Jurassic Park. The mouse that Peter had created, [...] "Rapid Dave" [...] is a parody of the Looney Tunes character Speedy Gonzales.|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{are nice}} and cool," [...] <b>Peters</b> <b>said</b> as, having peeled the long fruit {{as he saw}} his {{companion}} doing, he {{took a bite of}} one; [...] "but they have very little taste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The firing {{is sure to}} {{have been}} heard," [...] <b>Peters</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and they will be sending off {{to know what is}} going on, {{otherwise}} there would have been small chance of getting in tonight." ...|$|R
60|$|Now when <b>Peter</b> <b>said</b> please that way, {{of course}} Old Mr. Toad couldn't resist him. Nobody could.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Michael's kite,' <b>Peter</b> <b>said</b> without interest, {{but next}} moment he had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.|$|E
60|$|<b>Peter</b> <b>said</b> it {{was very}} kind of 'im, but 'e'd sooner go alone, owing to his mother being very shy afore strangers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} we cannot do it," [...] <b>Peters</b> <b>said,</b> after their glasses {{had all been}} fixed on the bridge for several minutes; [...] "at least, I don't see any chance. What do you say, Chris?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1935, he {{left the}} group and Washington, DC. Of his time there, Ware Group {{controller}} J. <b>Peters</b> <b>said</b> of Pressman {{that he was a}} [...] "big climber" [...] and had a [...] "bad case of 'big-shotitis'." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Peters</b> <b>said</b> {{nothing and}} went. His mistake was obvious; {{he might have}} forced Wyndham to accept his terms, but he had misjudged Marston. When he had gone, Marston sat down, rather limply, and there was silence for a few minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "The spider {{had no idea}} {{of attacking}} you, Kelly," [...] <b>Peters</b> <b>said,</b> laughing. [...] "It might {{possibly}} bite you in the night, though I do not think it would do so; or if you took it up in your fingers." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{feel quite}} {{disposed}} to do so," [...] <b>Peters</b> <b>said,</b> laughing, [...] "from your descriptions of her. I've {{heard so much}} of her, {{in all the time}} we've been together; and she writes such bright merry letters, that I seem to know her quite well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{an awkward}} business, Captain Martin," [...] <b>Peters</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "You sha'n't be arrested {{on board the}} Good Venture, {{as long as there}} is a man on board can wield a cutlass; but I don't know whether that would help you in the long run.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall fight all {{the better}} for knowing that," [...] <b>Peters</b> <b>said</b> grimly. [...] "The Dutchmen are {{learning}} that, as the Spaniards are finding to their cost.
