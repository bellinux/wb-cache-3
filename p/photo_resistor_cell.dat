Grease deposition in kitchen exhaust ducts is an imminent fire hazard. There exists {{the need to}} quantize and measure the amount of grease deposition in a commercial kitchen exhaust duct in a cheap and efficient manner. Results from a real cooking emission study (ASHRAE 1375 -RP) were used to model grease deposition onto a cylinder. Simulated cooking experiments were performed using a 200 : 1 ratio of non volatiles: uranine using a Polydisperse Aerosol Generator (PAG). The use of a cylinder in cross flow with a strain gage arrangement and a LED-photo resistor arrangement on two opposite walls of a 0 : 254 m by 0 : 203 m (10 inches by 8 inches) duct at two exhaust velocities namely 2 : 54 m/s (500 ft/min) and 7 : 62 m/s (1500 ft/min) were investigated. The size distributions obtained by the simulated cooking experiments were similar to that obtained in the ASHRAE 1375 -RP study. The modeling results were within a factor of 1 : 5 of the simulated cooking results. This is reasonable considering the complexities of actual grease deposits. The <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> was very sensitive to minute changes of grease deposition layers. It would be beneficial to inspect the output signal of the <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> for greater thickness of grease deposits. The strain gage technique did not prove successful to measure grease deposition inside a duct due to the constant vibrations. Deposition results obtained flurometrically showed that deposition flux on to a cylinder placed in cross flow and all four walls of the duct increases with increasing exhaust velocity. Deposition flux on the windows for the LED and the <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> were {{in close proximity to}} the deposition flux on the two side walls. Correlations were developed for particle deposition on all four walls of the duct. Flow Reynolds number has a major impact on particle deposition in large exhaust ducts.

40|$|Abstract [...] Biosensors are {{analytical}} {{tools for}} the analysis of bio-material samples to gain an understanding of their biocomposition, structure and function by converting a biological response into an electrical signal. Wearable Biosensors (WBS) are the biosensors which can be worn on the body. Recent advancements in miniature devices have fostered a dramatic growth of interest of wearable technology. Wearable Biosensors such as Ring Sensor will permit continuous cardiovascular (CV) monitoring in a number of novel settings. Thus Real-time, continuous monitoring would allow not only for emergency detection but also for long-term assessment to establish the right dose and timing of medication. One type of WBS called the Smart Shirt typically relies on the information provided by the wireless, miniature sensors enclosed in shirt. The vital signals and information gathered by the various sensors on the body travels through the smart shirt controller for processing, from these, the computed vital signals are wirelessly transmitted to the monitoring station. WBS could {{play an important role in}} the wireless surveillance of people during hazardous operations such as military, firefighting, etc or such sensors could be dispensed during a mass civilian casualty occurrence.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} thesis, {{industrial}} product design PPU 304, {{is to develop a}} new product that will reduce food waste of dairy products in households. The main objective is that the product will be able to measure and signal when the milk has expired. The thesis is a start to find the solution to some of the food waste in households which is a major environmental issue in today's society. The goal is to develop a flexible expiration date that can reduce food wastage. With today's sensor technology bacterial levels can be calculated from the milk and that can increase the time a pack of milk can be used. The greater knowledge and awareness humanity have for environmental issues the better world we will live in. To understand the question, “what is it that makes the milk unfit for consumption?” A part of the work has gone into researching the technological aspect. In consumer ready milk there is different bacteria that will grow over time and eventually spoil the milk, how this process works varies depending on what or which bacteria manage to grow the most. Therefore, the most appropriate technique is to measure bacteria in the milk and identify at which level the milk passes its actual expiration date. The design of the product has been guided by two major factors, the predetermined dimensions of the circuit board and the adaptation {{to the size of the}} milk carton. The shape of the product is an oblong rear part with a spherical body at the front. The edges are rounded to give a pleasantand smooth feeling to the hand using the product. The thesis in {{industrial product}} design resulted in a final concept. The product analyses the amount of bacteria in the milk through sensors that measure bacterial metabolism. The data gets interpreted and displayed through the use of LEDs. To save energy the concept is equipped with a <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> that deactivates the LEDs when the fridge is closed and dark. The conclusion of the thesis, performed at Millcroft AB is at a conceptual level. To go from idea to product, is a process that takes a long time to complete and often involves many different moments. The timeframe during this study is considered too short to cover all parts of the product and therefore the boundaries set and the focus has been on constructing a design that fits the estimated technology as well as consumer needs. Some suggestions are that more research in the technical aspect of the product should be concluded. Further testing of dairy sustainability should be conducted on a larger scale and further development of the technology to send data...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{describe}} {{the architecture of}} a heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to be deployed on coastal sand dunes: {{the aim is to}} provide real time measurements of physical parameters to better define sediment transport in connection with aeolian processes. The WSN integrates different typologies of sensors and is provided with both local and remote connection. In particular, three different typologies of sensors are integrated in the network: a multilayer anemometric station, a sensor developed ad-hoc to measure the sand dune level and a sand collector capable of measuring the weight of trapped sand and its quantity. Each sensor node is composed at least by an XBee Series 2 transmission module that is able to transmit the data collected by the sensor at a distance of about 100 meters: while the sand level sensor and the sand collector are provided only with this transmission module, the anemometric station also integrates an Arduino Uno board in charge of data processing. A Gateway node composed by an Arduino Uno Board integrated with a GMS Shield for remote data transmission and an XBee transmission module for Local Area communication has also been developed: this node is in charge of collecting all the data packets sent by the Sensor Nodes and transmit them to a remote server through GPRS connection. A Glassfish server has been set up to collect these packets and store them in a MySQL database. The anemometric station is composed by three anemometer/anemoscope couples positioned 40 cm, 120 cm and 200 cm from the ground. During the tests, the station data were sampled every 20 minutes, wind speed and direction was calculated directly on the Arduino Uno Board and then a packet composed by the six data (three speeds and three directions) was sent to the Gateway. The sand level sensor is composed by an array of 24 <b>photo</b> <b>resistors</b> (LDRs) mounted on a plastic tube 5 cm apart from each other (reaching a total length of 120 cm). Sunk LDRs do not sense sun light and send a 0 value. Surfacing LDRs detect sunlight and send a higher value. By counting sunk LDRs it is possible to measure the current level of the dune. During the tests, the sensor was sampled once per hour, three data packets were sent every time, each packet with the reading of 8 LDRs; the level value was calculated on the Gateway before being transmitted to the remote server. The sand collector is mainly a plastic cylinder about one meter high, able to orientate according to the wind direction. The wind-blown sand flows inside the cylinder and is collected on its bottom, where the load cell can measure weight variations. During the tests, the sensor was sampled once per hour, the value of the Load Cell was transmitted to the Gateway that calculated the sand weight before transmitting this value to the remote server. The proposed WSN can provide both a static and a dynamic framework of sand transport processes acting on coastal dunes...|$|R

However, direct assessment of the permeability barrier is difficult with most available techniques. We used confocal microscopy to image 1 -micron thick optical cross-sections of isolated intact glomeruli and glomeruli denuded of cells and quantitated dextran (70, 000 mol wt) diffusion from the capillary lumen. Dextran permeance was 11 times greater for the acellular filtration barrier than the intact peripheral capillary.

Using a different approach, dextran sieving coefficients for acellular glomeruli consolidated as a multilayer sheet in a filtration cell were similar to those for intact glomeruli in vivo at radii 30 - 36 A and approximately 50 times greater at a dextran radius of 60 A. The presence of cells significantly reduced hydraulic permeability determined on consolidated intact or acellular glomeruli in an ultrafiltration cell with 50 mmHg applied pressure.

40|$|Microelectronic {{manufacturing}} progresses {{not only}} towards further miniaturisation, but also application fields {{tend to become}} more and more diverse. Recently there has been an increasing demand for electronic devices and circuits that function in harsh environments such as high temperatures. Under these conditions, reliability aspects are highly critical and testing remains a great challenge. A versatile CMOS process based on 200 mm thin film Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafers is in production at Fraunhofer IMS. It features three layers of tungsten metallisation for optimum electromigration reliability, voltage independent capacitors, high resistance <b>resistors</b> and single-poly-EEPROM <b>cells.</b> Non-volatile memories such as EEPROMs are a key technology that enables flexible data storage, for example of calibration and measurement information. The reliability of these devices is especially crucial in high temperature applications since charge loss is drastically increased in this case. The behaviour of single-poly- EEPROM cells, produced in the process described before, was evaluated up to 450 °C. Data retention tests at temperatures ranging from 160 °C to 450 °C and write/erase cycling tests up to 400 °C were performed. The dependence of write/erase cycling on both temperature and tunnel oxide thickness was studied.

With Silicon-on-Insulator-technologies (SOI), digital and analog {{circuitry}} is possible up to 250 °C and even more, but performance and reliability are strongly affected at these high temperatures. One of the main critical factors is the gate oxide quality and its reliability. In this paper, we present a study of gate oxide capacitor time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) measurements at temperatures up to 350 °C. The experiments were carried out on gate oxide capacitor structures which were realized in the Fraunhofer 1. 0 µm SOI-CMOS process. This technology is based on 200 mm wafers and features, among others, three layers of tungsten metallization with excellent reliability concerning electromigration, voltage independent capacitors, high resistance <b>resistors,</b> and single-poly-EEPROM <b>cells.</b> The gate oxide thickness is about 40 nm. Using the data of the TDDB-measurements, the behavior of field and temperature acceleration parameters at temperatures up to 350 °C was evaluated.

40|$|Fire-detection systems {{incorporating}} {{multiple sensors}} that measure multiple parameters {{are being developed}} for use in storage depots, cargo bays of ships and aircraft, and other locations not amenable to frequent, direct visual inspection. These systems are intended to improve upon conventional smoke detectors, now used in such locations, that reliably detect fires but also frequently generate false alarms: for example, conventional smoke detectors based on the blockage of light by smoke particles are also affected by dust particles and water droplets and, thus, are often susceptible to false alarms. In contrast, by utilizing multiple parameters associated with fires, i. e. not only obscuration by smoke particles but also concentrations of multiple chemical species that are commonly generated in combustion, false alarms can be significantly decreased while still detecting fires as reliably as older smoke-detector systems do. The present development includes fabrication of sensors that have, variously, micrometer- or nanometer-sized features so that such multiple sensors can be integrated into arrays that have sizes, weights, and power demands smaller than those of older macroscopic sensors. The sensors include <b>resistors,</b> electrochemical <b>cells,</b> and Schottky diodes that exhibit different sensitivities to the various airborne chemicals of interest. In a system of this type, the sensor readings are digitized and processed by advanced signal-processing hardware and software to extract such chemical indications of fires as abnormally high concentrations of CO and CO 2, possibly in combination with H 2 and/or hydrocarbons. The system also includes a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) -based particle detector and classifier device to increase the reliability of measurements of chemical species and particulates. In parallel research, software for modeling {{the evolution of a}} fire within an aircraft cargo bay has been developed. The model implemented in the software can describe the concentrations of chemical species and of particulate matter as functions of time. A system of the present developmental type and a conventional fire detector were tested under both fire and false-alarm conditions in a Federal Aviation Administration cargo-compartment- testing facility.

Although many experiments can be performed with resistive structures which are directly bonded, for extensive stress mapping {{it is necessary to}} have a large number of sensor cells which can be addressed using CMOS logic circuitry. Our previous test chip, the ATC 04, has 100 cells, each approximately 0. 012 in. on a side, on a chip with a side dimension of 0. 45 in. When a <b>cell</b> <b>resistor</b> is addressed, it is connected to a four terminal measurement bus through CMOS transmission gates. In theory, the gate resistances do not affect the measurement. In practice, there may be subtle effects which appear when very high accuracy is required. At high temperatures, gate leakage can increase to a point at which the resistor measurement becomes inaccurate. For ATC 04 this occurred at or above 50 C. Here, we report on the first measurements obtained with a new prototype test chip, the ATC 06. This prototype was fabricated in a 0. 5 micron feature size silicided CMOS process using the MOSIS prototyping facility. The cell size was approximately 0. 004 in. on a side. In order to achieve piezoresistive behavior for the implanted resistors it was necessary to employ a non-standard silicide ''blocking'' process. The stress sensitivity of both implanted and polysilicon blocked resistors is discussed. Using a new design strategy for the CMOS logic, it was possible to achieve a design in which only 5 signals had to be routed to a cell for addressing vs. 9 for ATC 04.

40|$|Resistive {{bistable}} {{thin film}} elements {{have a great}} potential for implementing non-volatile memories with extreme densities. This work investigates using the switching characteristics of these resistive switchable elements to implement active and passive memory arrays. First, different active memory architectures has been investigated analytically and numerically based on the resistive elements which are characterised through there hysteretic resistive I/V curve. A new active memory cell concept which uses a capacitor connected serially to the resistive element has been proposed as an alternative the conventional memory cell. This concept simplifies the manufacturing of the memory and {{makes it possible to}} generate a higher voltage than the supply voltage across the resistive elements. Passive memory architectures based on crossbar-arrays are very compact because they don’t include a transistor in the memory cells. Different active periphery circuits for the read and write operations has been elaborated. In the case of the write operation, the periphery circuits generate more than two voltage levels to accomplish writing. The read and write operations for passive resistive memories has been discussed thoroughly. It has been shown that many simplifications which have been used when analysing passive memories don’t work under real conditions. This is especially true when the interconnect resistances are considered. The optimal array sizes and optimal values of the sense resistors are calculated depending on the memory array parameters like the on- and off-resistance values of the memory cell and the interconnects resistance values. When the interconnect resistances are considered the voltages at the memory cells and the sense resistors are degraded. This degradation limits the construction of large memory arrays. Due to the voltage degradation at the sense <b>resistors,</b> the memory <b>cells</b> can not be read correctly because a common reference voltage does not consider this degradation. To solve this problem, a new concept for the generation of the reference voltage has been proposed. This concept uses dedicated memory cells to generate local and reliable reference voltages, which enables the construction of larger memory arrays. Resistive memory arrays with an additional diode in the memory cells have also been discussed. The usage of a diode reduces the parasitic effects and also allows the construction of larger memory arrays. Finally, the usage of resistive memory elements in lookup tables of FPGAs has been investigated. A simplified write operation which functions under certain conditions has been proposed. In addition, a rule that directly specifies the worst case patterns has been found. By using this rule, long simulation times to find these patterns are avoided...|$|R
