After receiving a partial reimbursement for his wartime expenses, he moved with his wife, Emilie, to Argentina, where they took up farming. When he went bankrupt in 1958, Schindler left his wife and returned to Germany, where he failed at several business ventures and relied on financial support from Schindlerjuden ("Schindler Jews") – the <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> he had saved during the war. He was named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1963. He died on 9 October 1974 in Hildesheim, Germany, and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, {{the only member of}} the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way.|$|E

25|$|As {{the genre}} of {{expressionism}} began to diminish, {{the genre of}} the New Objectivity (die neue Sachlichkeit) began to take its place. It was influenced by new issues which occupied the public in those years, as the rampant inflation caused deterioration in the economic status of the middle class. These films, often called “street films” or “asphalt films”, tried to reflect reality in all its complexity and ugliness. They focused on objects surrounding the characters and cynically symbolized the despair felt by the German <b>people,</b> <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> were shattered after the war. The most prominent film maker who is associated with this genre is Georg Wilhelm Pabst in his films such as: Joyless Street (1925), Pandora's Box (1929), and The Loves of Jeanne Ney (1927). Pabst is also credited with innovations in film editing, such as reversing {{the angle of the}} camera or cutting between two camera angles, which enhanced film continuity and later became standards of the industry.|$|E

2500|$|Imamura {{had once}} been an {{assistant}} of Yasujirō Ozu, and had - in his youth - developed an antipathy towards Ozu's (and Kenji Mizoguchi's) finely crafted aestheticism, finding {{it to be a}} bit too tailored to approved senses of [...] "Japanese" [...] film. [...] Imamura's preference was for <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> were messier and for settings less lovely: [...] amateur pornographers, barmaids, an elderly one-time prostitute, murderers, unemployed salarymen, an obsessive-compulsive doctor, and a lecherous, alcoholic monk were a few of his many protagonists.|$|E

Its need to expand again was in conflict with its landlocked campus in the heart of Alpharetta. After much discussion, the Fulton County Board of Education decided to build a new school in a new location.|$|R

It {{seems to me that the}} purpose of this show is to affect a morbid and depressing display of dysfunctional <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> are in turmoil”, and that it was “a plain disgrace which goes under the guise of entertainment”. He described it as “human bear-baiting” and added that “it should not surprise anyone that these people, some of whom have limited intellects, become aggressive with each other. This type of incident is exactly what the producers want. These self-righteous individuals should be in the dock with you.

50|$|A {{prominent}} {{exception to}} the common distribution of physical characteristics within and among groups is skin color. Approximately 10% {{of the variance in}} skin color occurs within groups, and ~90% occurs between groups (Relethford 2002). This distribution of skin color and its geographic patterning — with <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> ancestors <b>lived</b> predominantly near the equator having darker skin than those with ancestors who lived predominantly in higher latitudes — indicate that this attribute has been under strong selective pressure. Darker skin appears to be strongly selected for in equatorial regions to prevent sunburn, skin cancer, the photolysis of folate, and damage to sweat glands.|$|R

50|$|Melanocytes insert {{granules}} of melanin into specialized cellular vesicles called melanosomes. These {{are then}} transferred into the keratinocyte {{cells of the}} human epidermis.

In general, <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> ancestors <b>lived</b> for long periods in the regions of the globe near the equator have larger quantities of eumelanin in their skins.
