5|$|In August 2007, the MBTA {{published}} a feasibility study exploring {{the possibility of}} rebuilding Yawkey as a full-service station. The study concluded that doing so would increase ridership by 60%, from 585 daily boardings and alightings to 937. On November 15, 2010, Governor Deval Patrick and other officials broke ground on a major rebuilding of the station, originally {{expected to be completed}} in the spring of 2012. The new station has two full-length high-level platforms that <b>provide</b> <b>level,</b> handicapped-accessible boarding for all passengers; the old platform had only a wooden ramp for accessibility. The two 700-foot-long platforms (a side platform between the tracks plus a side platform {{on the south side of}} the tracks) are connected with an overpass, and passengers no longer have to cross the tracks to access certain outbound trains.|$|E

5000|$|From 1987 until September 2003, {{the system}} was served by a fleet of high-floor light rail {{vehicles}} built by Urban Transportation Development Corporation. In 2002, VTA introduced new low-floor light rail vehicles by Kinki Sharyo into the fleet. The low-floor vehicles initially operated only on the Tasman West line (Downtown Mountain View to I-880/Milpitas) because the vehicles' floor height matched the 14 in platform height only at that line's stations and was only able to <b>provide</b> <b>level</b> boarding there. In 2003, after VTA reconstructed platforms along North First Street from the Japantown/Ayer stop northward (with wooden ramps provided for the leading car's front door at all other stations), VTA replaced the entire fleet with low-floor light rail vehicles. Of the high-floor light rail vehicles, 29 (802-830) were sold to Utah Transit Authority and 20 (831-850) were sold to Sacramento Regional Transit, with the remaining car retained as a wrecker. Currently, all stations <b>provide</b> <b>level</b> boarding at all doors.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of <b>providing</b> dierent <b>levels</b> of {{performance}} guarantees or quality-of-service (QOS) for disk I/O. We classify disk requests into three categories based on the <b>provided</b> <b>level</b> of service. We propose an integrated scheme that <b>provides</b> dierent <b>levels</b> of performance guarantees in a single system. The proposed method uses admission control and bandwidth allocation to isolate the dierent cate-gories of requests and appropriate disk scheduling to achieve the desired performance goals. It is shown that the proposed method achieves the performance goals of individual requests while allowing seek optimizations at the disk. In particular, it is shown that the proposed scheme for integrated QOS management at disk pro-vides signicantly better performance than SCAN. ...|$|R

50|$|In Metro Manila, {{water service}} {{has been carried out}} by two private concessionaires since 1997: The Manila Water Company in the East Zone, and Maynilad Water Services, Inc. in the West Zone.
