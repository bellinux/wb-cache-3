Historically proponents have been required to make monetary contributions towards pavement maintenance activities the value of which has been determined via an assessment tool created by the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads. Road data recently made publicly available has enabled consideration of the accuracy of the maintenance predictions produced by the Department’s assessment tool. 1. Executive Summary In Queensland, historically development has been required to make monetary contributions towards pavement activities. Recently there is an increasing trend of conditioning development pavement contributions to be determined exclusively via the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Road’s (TMR’s) <b>Pavement</b> <b>Impact</b> Assessment Tool (PIA Tool). In the past four years co-ordinated projects with a combined investment value of over $ 80 billion dollars have been explicitly conditioned to utilise the tool to establish pavement contributions. While the simplistic nature of TMR’s PIA Tool (and base input assumptions) makes the tool both user-friendly and efficient these benefits come at th...|$|E

This research aims to determine whether storage in dolomite, calcite and quartzite mineral aggregates in the base course of a permeable <b>pavement</b> <b>impacts</b> on {{the survival of the}} pathogen indicator organism Escherichia coli (E. coli) in storage. The reasons for depletion were also investigated. Twelve model permeable pavement storage reservoirs were filled, in triplicate, with dolomite, calcite and quartzite. Three reservoirs contained no aggregate. After filling with pathogen spiked rainwater, the concentration of E. coli was examined for 22 days in the reservoirs. The reservoirs were then agitated to determine if there was E. coli present which was not in aqueous suspension. The results of the experiments show that there is {{no significant difference in the}} depletion of E. coli found in reservoirs without aggregate, and those filled with dolomite or calcite. The rate of depletion was found to be significantly lower in the quartzite filled reservoirs. Agitation of the reservoirs yielded increases in the aqueous concentration of E. coli in all reservoir types, suggesting that the bacteria are adhering to the surface of the mineral aggregate and to the reservoir walls...|$|R
40|$|In this study, dynamic {{responses}} of composite plates on elastic foundations subjected to impact and moving loads are investigated. The first order shear deformation (FSDT) theory {{is used for}} moderately thick plates. Pasternak-type (two-parameter) elastic foundation is assumed. Elastic foundation effects are integrated into the governing equations. It is assumed that plate is first hit by a mass as an impact type loading then the mass continues to move on the composite plate as a distributed moving loading, which resembles the aircraft landing on airport <b>pavements.</b> <b>Impact</b> and moving loadings are modeled by a mass-spring-damper system with a wheel. The wheel {{is assumed to be}} continuously in contact with the plate after impact. The governing partial differential equations of motion for displacements are converted into the ordinary differential equations in the time domain by using Galerkin’s method. Then, these sets of equations are solved by using the Runge-Kutta method. Several parameters such as vertical and horizontal velocities of the aircraft, volume fractions of the steel rebar in the reinforced concrete layer, and the different touchdown locations of the aircraft tire on the runway are considered in the numerical simulation.

40|$|Pavements {{integrate}} the necessary road infrastructure to the traffic {{of people and}} loads. Once technology is blossoming, {{it is possible to}} offer new solutions to reduce the crossing time and improve the flow conditions, comfort and users security. <b>Pavements</b> environment <b>impact</b> is related to their implantation, construction materials, maintenance and rehabilitation. These environment costs have to be estimated taking into account the associated impact costs of raw materials extraction, construction materials production and transportation, and the pavement system construction itself. The gradually increase of the atmospheric pollution leads to a significant loss of vegetation which reflects on the control of drainage and erosion. Usually, the analyses are limited to the pavement design and technological aspects of construction and quality control aiming at its durability, conditions of comfort and structural security. However, the pavement performance should also be considered in terms of minimizing the environment and human costs. In this context, the relatively recent availability of high performance concrete may contribute to minimize the <b>pavement</b> environment <b>impact</b> resulting from its higher flexural strength, allowing the reduction of the pavement thickness and the consequent amount of required construction materials, and its higher durability, requiring less maintenance works.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in developing cool pavement strategies to mitigate <b>pavement’s</b> <b>impact</b> on the global warming in recent years. One of the mitigation strategies is by increasing the solar reflectance (or albedo) of the pavement surface, which directly contributes to global cooling by adjusting radiative forcing and potentially reduces the energy demand in the urban areas. In this paper, the radiative energy budgets in four urban areas are investigated based on the data derived from NASA satellite measurements. The radiative forcing (RF) due to the change of urban surface albedo {{as a result of}} reflective pavements is estimated using a simplified engineering model. The carbon dioxide (CO 2) equivalence savings are also calculated with reference to the 100 -year global warming potential of CO 2. Results show that the implementation of reflective pavement has a great potential to reduce global warming. The CO 2 reduction is significant in the urban areas but also affects the surrounding regions to some extent. In the end, we recommend using a climate model incorporating site-specific information that enables the visualization of the outputs through spatial maps. The results from this work would be useful for guiding the implementation of the cool pavement strategies.

40|$|Stakeholders, (designers, {{industrial}} developers, governmental agencies, {{and private}} landowners) are increasingly concerned about enhancing storm water quality, reducing run off, {{and improving the}} recharge of ground water. They are increasingly turning to sustainable pavement systems to address these issues. The most widely used pervious pavements consist of porous asphalt or concrete over open graded aggregate base and are considered storm water Best Management Practice (BMP). However, without proper information pervious pavements are inapplicable. In choosing pervious pavement options valid measures such as infiltration rate, storm water quality, thermal gain, and water storage capacity are routinely considered, but environmental performance is not. This study discusses the effects of storm water quality on porous <b>pavements</b> and <b>impacts</b> on groundwater quality of infiltrating contaminated storm water.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the extent of <b>pavement</b> {{distress}} <b>impact</b> on traffic capacity of uninterrupted road link sections. A capacity estimation method based on extrapolation from a fundamental diagram representing the relationship between traffic flow and density was used. This method assumes that density is a result of speed and flow on sections of the road link at capacity, and hence is not directly affected by road surface distress. This implies that the capacity shifts are entirely the result of speed changes. In a 'without and with' distress study at selected sites in Nigeria, the impact of road surface distress was estimated for one direction of the road link section. Capacities of the road section were estimated for three sections ('without distress', 'transition' and 'with distress') of the road link and it was found that capacities on 'without distress' and 'with distress' sections differed significantly. The paper concludes that a significant decrease in capacity of about 30 % was found, and is attributable to road pavement distress...|$|R

Numerical analysis is performed by developing a three-dimensional finite element model and by utilizing a cement concrete damage model. The results show that the calculation results based on the cement concrete damage model are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results based on the three-dimensional test slot experiment. The peak values of stress and strain as monitored by the sensors are analyzed and compared with the numerical results, indicating that the errors of numerical results from the proposed model are mostly within 10 %.

Meridiani Planum consists of sorted sands with aeolian features like ripples and desert <b>pavements.</b> In <b>impact</b> craters, a high-albedo layered bedrock is exposed. The soil is a mixture of: (i) fine sand material in the size ranges of 50 to 150 m, (ii) sub-angular, irregular particles of 0. 5 to 5 mm size with submillimeter circular voids that are most likely vesicular basaltic fragments, and (iii) spherules with a restricted grain size between 4 and 6 mm.

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of truck axle load spectra in the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) has brought great advancement in pavement design through quantifying pavement accumulated damage due to individual axle loads. However, how {{to relate the}} truck axle load volume and spectra directly to pavement performance remains a practical challenge for pavement engineers. This paper presents a systematic index approach to this issue that characterizes three aspects of traffic loading to pavement performance: volume, load, and damage. Four summary indices were investigated in this study: cumulative truck volume (CTV), cumulative truck load (CTL), equivalent single axle load (ESAL), and relative <b>pavement</b> performance <b>impact</b> (RPPI). The involved concepts and calculation procedures were first introduced, followed by a numerical evaluation analysis of 30 axle load spectra, 18 vehicle class distributions, 2 truck configurations, and 2 pavement types. To demonstrate how these summary indices could be used, a case study was presented. Overall results suggested that the systematic indices introduced in this study had a clear relationship with pavement performance, {{so it could be}} used to assist engineers in many ways such as comparing different load spectra, communicating between engineers, and understanding the relationship between traffic and pavement performance for a specific design at any point in time...|$|R

The time since last disturbance ranged from three months to over 50 years.

Walking tracks remained visible in the landscape (due to larger clasts concentrating along track margins) long after the desert pavement surface had recovered. However, randomly dispersed footprints were undetectable within five years. For many sites, allowing widespread trampling will give lower medium-term visible impact than concentrating traffic flow by track formation. For steep slopes and sites where repeated visits occur, use of a single track is recommended.

40|$|Urban {{greening}} {{is becoming}} increasingly popular in cities around the world, which is leading to the planting of more and more trees in paved areas in urban environments. However scientifically it is not well understood how <b>pavement</b> may <b>impact</b> tree greening efforts. In this paper, we investigated plant responses to pavement in the suburb of Changping District, Beijing, China. We planted the popular deciduous ash tree (Fraxinus chinensis) in three different pavements: pervious bricks; impervious bricks; and no pavement (i. e., control) at three densities (0. 5 m x 0. 5 m, 1. 0 m x 1. 0 m, and 2. 0 m x 2. 0 m apart). We investigated the influence of pavement type on plant phenology by monitoring soil temperature and moisture as well as leaf budburst rate from January to April in 2014. Our results show that pavement can significantly increase soil temperature, and decreased soil moisture except pervious pavement at the 1. 0 m x 1. 0 m density. The significant relationship between the leaf budburst rate and accumulated soil temperature implies that pavement induced soil warming can accelerate leaf budburst, suggesting that pavement contributes to tree leaf budburst acceleration by probably both increasing soil and air temperatures in urban environments.

However, climate environment, to which pavement is exposed, significantly <b>impact</b> <b>pavement</b> stability and long-term performance. Especially, low temperature cracking of asphalt pavement in cold region is a common existing problem. In order to improve the pavement’s crack resistance it is necessary to predict the temperature stress distribution within the asphalt layers. A two-dimensional finite element model of a concrete bridge in thermal and thermal-structural couple analysis is developed to predict temperature and temperature stress variation of asphalt layers in cold region. The temperature stress variation is analyzed at seasonal temperature, different cooling rate and the different thickness of asphalt layers. The model considers a set of primary thermal environmental conditions. Ultimately, the model is aimed at providing pavement engineers with an efficient computational tool that attempts to increase the prediction accuracy of temperature in asphaltic pavement of cold region for more reliable pavement design. 1...|$|R

The present study focuses on the analysis of the dynamic deflection and the velocity response of airport concrete <b>pavements</b> to <b>impact</b> loading. The pavement-subgrade {{interaction is}} simplified as a linear viscoelastic model, in which the subgrade is composed of two layers (a base layer and a soil layer). The subgrade's synthetical modulus and damping coefficient are obtained by the method of weighed mean. Through the Fourier and the Laplace transform the solution of the equilibrium equation of the pavement-subgrade system is deduced and the dynamic deflection solution of the pavement-subgrade system is obtained. In this study, an impact aircraft landing load increasing proportional to the aircraft vertical landing acceleration is considered. A Matlab program is compiled based on the solution to assess the influence of various system parameters (slab thickness h, slab size, subgrade reaction modulus Ks and subgrade damping factor C 0) on the dynamic deflections of the pavement slab. The influence of h and Ks on the dynamic velocity response of the slab is also discussed. The results show that changing the damping factor and the subgrade reaction modulus has only a small influence on the deflection of the slab and the deflection, while the amplitude of velocity response and the frequency of velocity responses all decrease with the increase of the slab thickness. If the pavement slab size is decreased, the deflection {{at the center of the}} slab will decrease. A nonlinear relationship can be established between h and the maximum deflection, while linear relationships exist between C 0 and the maximum deflection, as well as Ks and the maximum deflection. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

40|$|In any {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) for pavements, the designer must decide on which rehabilitation activities {{will be used to}} maintain the pavement over the analysis period. While this sounds simple, the fact is that there are many different rehabilitation scenarios that could be performed when the pavement requires rehabilitation, and which one is used will impact the LCA results. This creates inherent uncertainty and variability in the LCA results solely due to the selection of the rehabilitation scenario used in the analysis. Currently, most LCA’s apply a single standard rehabilitation scenario to all pavements. The problem with this approach is that because each project is unique, the activities {{may or may not be}} representative of the actual set of activities done on that particular pavement. The only way to get meaningful indication of a project’s <b>pavement</b> environmental <b>impact</b> is to look at the impact of all (or at least most) of the potential rehabilitation activities that could be used to maintain the pavement over the analysis period. This paper shows how State Highway Agencies (SHAs) can use probability and decision tree analysis to evaluate many rehabilitation scenarios in order to determine a range of LCA results, as well as a probability adjusted, expected value LCA result. This process quantifies the underlying uncertainty that different the rehabilitation selection can have on the LCA results so that a more informed decision can be made when comparing the alternate pavement designs. A case study based on alternative designs and rehabilitation scenarios used by a SHA demonstrates the decision tree analysis process and shows how the risk profiles for the two alternatives considered are not equivalent. For this case, this results in the probability-adjusted LCA results being different than the single standard rehabilitation scenario results.

40|$|Recycled asphalt {{shingles}} (RAS) is {{a technology}} in which pavement costs {{can be reduced}} significantly and pavement properties may be enhanced. Also, incorporating shingles into <b>pavements</b> reduces the <b>impacts</b> of waste shingles in landfills, preserving our environment. However, for this new technology to be practical for implementation, {{a better understanding of}} how the ground shingles affect the properties of the asphalt is necessary. The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of recycled asphalt shingles on asphalt binder content, mixture stiffness, and laboratory rutting performance. For this project, shingles were added to hot mix asphalt mixtures at 2. 5, 5, and 10 percent by weight of the total mix. This study showed that incorporating shingles into mixes is sometimes complex due to the interaction of a number of factors such as nominal maximum aggregate size, binder grade, aggregate type, and percent RAS. In spite of the complex behavior of these mixes, a few conclusions could be drawn. First, properties of mixes with RAS were not vastly different from their control counterparts. Second, the manufacturing waste shingles are expected to contribute more than 85 percent of their available binder to a mix. Finally, asphalt with shingles incorporated produced in industry will likely be stiffer than traditional HMA resulting in less rutting and stripping...|$|R
40|$|Urbanisation is characterised by mass {{migration}} {{of people to}} urban areas and conversion of land from rural to urban land uses. Changes in population dynamics have led to half the world’s population living in urban areas; in developed countries, urban dwellers account for three-quarters of the total population. Though populations have shifted from rural to urban areas, people continue to rely on their environment, and trees in particular, for tangible and intangible benefits alike. A great deal of factual and anecdotal knowledge supports the role of trees for ecological, social, and economic well-being. In spite of this, during urbanisation, previously vegetated land is converted to housing, roads, or utility corridors, {{all of which are}} necessary to support growing populations. This thesis investigates tree growth in these modified urban landscapes, in particular, the effects of pavements on urban trees. Pavements are truly pervasive, covering {{more than half of all}} land in highly developed urban areas. Their durability and strength are of great importance to transportation, but large-scale soil sealing is not without consequence. Pavements affect the hydrologic cycle, soil and air temperature, and nutrient cycling. Because of their effect on the surrounding environment, pavements inherently affect remnant or planted trees. They are believed to negatively affect tree growth and survival, thereby compromising the ecological, social, and economic benefits otherwise derived from the urban forest. In recent times, porous pavements have been increasingly installed in favour of impervious pavements. Porous pavements are perceived to be an environmentally-sound alternative to standard impervious pavements. This thesis begins by reviewing the literature concerning porous pavement’s effect on underlying soil and urban vegetation, thus illustrating the scarcity of empirical data describing the effect of porous pavement on tree growth. A greater understanding of porous <b>pavement’s</b> <b>impact</b> on the surrounding environment is needed, if its installation is to continue. With this aim in mind, this thesis describes an experiment in Christchurch, New Zealand, which monitored the impacts of porous and impervious pavement on underlying soil conditions, and subsequent tree growth. The experiment comprised 50 Platanus orientalis trees planted in an augmented factorial design, which consisted of controls and four treatments. Trees were split evenly amongst plots, such that ten replicates existed per treatment. The pavement treatments measured 2. 3 m by 2. 3 m, and were based on the combination of pavement type (2 levels: porous, impervious) and pavement profile design (2 levels: +/- subbase compaction and gravel base). The resulting four treatments were impervious concrete pavement (IP), impervious concrete pavement with compacted subbase and gravel base (IP+), porous concrete pavement (PP), and porous concrete pavement with compacted subbase and gravel base (PP+). From December 2007 to March 2009, data were collected to determine the effect of these treatments on soil moisture, aeration, pH, and nutrient concentration. Final tree height, stem diameter, shoot and root biomass, and root distribution were also measured at the conclusion of the experiment. Results of this experiment indicated that the effects of pavement porosity on soil moisture and aeration were dynamic, varying with season and soil depth. Increased soil moisture beneath porous pavements resulted from rapid infiltration following precipitation. This decreased the duration of plant stress resulting from drought. Relative to bare soil, paved plots had consistently greater soil moisture, likely because pavements reduced evaporation. The inclusion of a gravel base in the profile design limited capillary upflow, which resulted in lower soil moisture under pavements designed with a gravel base. Soil aeration was significantly lower beneath pavements relative to unpaved plots. This is likely related to greater soil moisture beneath pavements. Finally, soil pH increased beneath pavements, in particular beneath porous pavements. Though all growth parameters increased for trees surrounded by porous, rather than impervious pavement, this occurred only in the absence of a compacted subgrade and gravel base. Evidently, the impact of the compacted subgrade superseded the <b>impact</b> of <b>pavement</b> porosity. Furthermore, root growth was relatively shallow beneath pavements, likely due to favourable soil moisture directly beneath pavements. This research highlights (i) the dramatic effect of pavements on underlying soil conditions; (ii) that pavements do not inherently limit tree growth; (iii) that porous pavements can conditionally improve tree growth; and (iv) that soil compaction limits potential benefits resulting from porous pavements...|$|R
40|$|Data {{collection}} {{is a critical}} aspect of any management system. Pavement Management Systems (PMSs) rely on consistent and repeatable data collection. Traditionally, such data has been collected through manual surveys, which are subjective, tedious, and time consuming. However, {{over the past two}} decades, there has been ongoing development of automated data collection technologies. The literature reveals a large number of services and distress data collection technologies each with different features and levels of automation and complexity. These technologies provide fast and improved methods to collect, process, and analyze data. The key is to identify and collect the most useful, reliable, cost-effective information and use it to make informed decisions for asset management. The accuracy and reliability of automated data collection can significantly <b>impact</b> <b>pavement</b> decisions at project and network levels; therefore, it is important that agencies ensure that high quality pavement condition data is collected and processed. Ultimately, this can be assured by carefully selecting the automated technology to be used for data collection. This paper presents a framework for the evaluation and selection of the appropriate automated data collection technologies for pavement management systems when there are several factors. The framework is used to facilitate the selection of the most appropriate automated data collection technologies by the aid of a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) computational approach. A case study of the province of Ontario is presented to illustrate how the framework can be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Water is a scarce {{resource}} in Australia and the conservation and re-use of stormwater runoff is often important {{to supplement the}} municipal water supply. The quality of the runoff {{is also important to}} ensure that it can be reused, or discharged to a location where it will not have negative <b>impacts.</b> <b>Pavements</b> are ubiquitous in our urban environment and consequently they have become an intrinsic and seldom thought-about part of life. However, for developers and local authorities who have to address stormwater flooding and water quality issues, they are very much {{at the forefront of the}} planning process. This is because impervious surfaces such as pavements have such a major impact on water quality and on the health of natural ecosystems. In response, Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) strategies, such as permeable and porous pavements, have been developed to reduce the environmental footprint of new growth. Porous and permeable pavements are becoming more prevalent as a stormwater management tool. Porous and permeable paving provide an ability to infiltrate stormwater on site, or harvest stormwater for fit-for-purpose reuse using geomembrane sealed subsurface ‘tanks’. This paper describes experiments conducted at the University of South Australia to investigate the reuse potential of water harvested using porous and permeable pavements. The experiments focused on identifying and quantifying the water quality processes occurring in the storage mechanism. This paper also describes the new PERMPAVE software program which has been developed as part of the same research program. ...|$|R
40|$|The new Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) {{design and}} {{analysis}} procedures defines the exact traffic loading by defining the specific number of each vehicle {{class and the}} use of axle load distribution factors instead of the equivalent single axle load (ESAL). The number of traffic inputs (parameters) in MEPDG was found to be 17024. This research aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of the predicted flexible pavement distress to vehicle class and tire pressure in MEPDG. To evaluate the impact of vehicle (truck) class on pavement sections, different cases of loading were analyzed. For each case, the MEPDG Ver. 1. 1 was used to evaluate the effect of tire pressure by solving each case for a tire pressure of 120 and 140 psi. The effect of the traffic parameters on asphalt pavement (AC) rutting, base rutting, subgrade rutting, international roughness index (IRI), longitudinal cracking and fatigue (alligator) cracking were investigated. It was found that vehicle class distribution (VCD) would cause clear impact (comparable to the effect of AADTT level) only if the major traffic is of specific class (very light or very heavy). If this is not the case, the vehicle class distribution will not be a significant factor that affects the final design because most of the trucks had similar <b>impact</b> on flexible <b>pavement</b> distresses. The <b>impact</b> of tire pressure is clear on longitudinal cracking, fatigue cracking and AC rutting, and have no significant impact on both base and subgrade rutting...|$|R
