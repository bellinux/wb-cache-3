40|$|The {{problem of}} {{identifying}} a <b>planted</b> <b>assignment</b> given a random k-SAT formula {{consistent with the}} assignment exhibits a large algorithmic gap: while the planted solution becomes unique and can be identified given a formula with O(n n) clauses, there are distributions over clauses for which the best known efficient algorithms require n^k/ 2 clauses. We propose and study a unified model for planted k-SAT, which captures well-known special cases. An instance is described by a <b>planted</b> <b>assignment</b> σ and a distribution on clauses with k literals. We define its distribution complexity as the largest r for which the distribution is not r-wise independent (1 < r < k for any distribution with a <b>planted</b> <b>assignment).</b> Our main result is an unconditional lower bound, tight up to logarithmic factors, for statistical (query) algorithms [Kearns 1998, Feldman et. al 2012], matching known upper bounds, which, as we show, can be implemented using a statistical algorithm. Since known approaches for problems over distributions have statistical analogues (spectral, MCMC, gradient-based, convex optimization etc.), this lower bound provides a rigorous explanation of the observed algorithmic gap. The proof introduces a new general technique {{for the analysis of}} statistical query algorithms. It also points to a geometric paring phenomenon in the space of all <b>planted</b> <b>assignments.</b> We describe consequences of our lower bounds to Feige's refutation hypothesis [Feige 2002] and to lower bounds on general convex programs that solve planted k-SAT. Our bounds also extend to other planted k-CSP models, and, in particular, provide concrete evidence for the security of Goldreich's one-way function and the associated pseudorandom generator when used with a sufficiently hard predicate [Goldreich 2000].

40|$|A random planted {{formula is}} {{constructed}} by fixing a certain <b>planted</b> <b>assignment</b> to the variables, and then adding only clauses that are satisfied by the <b>planted</b> <b>assignment.</b> The purpose of such {{approach is to}} generate a random-like formula that is guaranteed to have a satisfying <b>assignment.</b> The random <b>planted</b> 3 -SAT has received significant attention. In particular, {{it has been shown}} that when containing sufficiently many clauses, it is solvable with high probability in polynomial time. In this work we obtain a similar result for the random planted Not-All-Equal-SAT problem, which is defined in the same way except that the clauses added are the Not-All-Equal clauses. We follow one of the aforementioned approaches by Krivelevich and Vilenchik. In the case of NAE-SAT the first step, voting, makes no sense. We show that the same result can be achieved by solving the MAX-CUT problem in the co-occurrence graph of the formula...|$|R
40|$|For a planted satisfiability {{problem on}} n {{variables}} with k variables per constraint, the <b>planted</b> <b>assignment</b> becomes the unique solution after O(n log n) random clauses. However, the best-known algorithms {{need at least}} nr/ 2 to efficiently identify any assignment weakly correlated with the planted one for clause distributions that are (r − 1) -wise independent (r can {{be as high as}} k). Our main result is an unconditional lower bound, tight up to logarithmic factors, of Ω̃(nr/ 2) clauses for statistical algorithms, a broad class of algorithms introduced in [50, 34]. We complement this with a nearly matching upper bound using a statistical algorithm. As known approaches for problems over distributions in general, and planted satisfiability problems in particular, all have statistical analogues (spectral, MCMC, gradient-based, convex optimiza-tion etc.), this provides a rigorous explanation of the large gap between the identifiability and algorithmic identifiability thresholds for random satisfiability problems with planted solutions. Our results imply that a strong form of Feige’s refutation hypothesis for average-case SAT instances [31] holds for statistical algorithms. We also consider the closely related problem of finding the <b>planted</b> <b>assignment</b> of a random planted k-CSP which is the basis of Goldreich’s proposed one-way function [41]. Our bounds extend to this problem and give concrete evidence for the security of the one-way function and the associated pseudorandom generator when used with a sufficiently hard predicate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{results show}} that certain message passing algorithms, namely, survey propagation, are very {{effective}} in finding satisfying assignments in random satisfiable 3 CNF formulas. In this paper we make a modest step towards providing rigorous analysis that proves the effectiveness of message passing algorithms for random 3 SAT. We analyze the performance of Warning Propagation, a popular message passing algorithm that is simpler than survey propagation. We show that for 3 CNF formulas generated under the <b>planted</b> <b>assignment</b> distribution, running warning propagation in the standard way works when the clause-to-variable ratio is a sufficiently large constant. We {{are not aware of}} previous rigorous analysis of message passing algorithms for satisfiability instances, though such analysis was performed for decoding of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) Codes. We discuss some of the differences between results for the LDPC setting and our results. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{generator}} for weighted instances of MAX k-SAT {{in which every}} clause has a weight associated with it and {{the goal is to}} maximize the total weight of satisfied clauses. Our generator produces formulas whose hardness can be finely tuned by two parameters p and δ that control the weights of the clauses. Under the right choice of these parameters an easy-hard-easy pattern in the search complexity emerges which is similar to the patterns observed for traditional SAT distributions. What is remarkable, however, is that the generated distributions seem to lie in the middle ground between decision and optimization problems. Increasing the value of p from 0 to 1 has the effect of changing the shape of the computational cost from an easy-hard-easy pattern which is typical of decision problems to an easy-hard pattern which is typical of optimization problems. Thus our distributions seem {{to bridge the gap between}} decision and optimization versions of SAT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these phase transitions are related to sudden changes to a quantity similar to the backbone of a SAT formula. In our model not only we know how the optimal solution looks like (because we plant it in advance) but we also give evidence that it is unique. Thus our generator comes with an indication of optimality of the <b>planted</b> <b>assignment</b> which is basically the structural property that is related to the phase transition phenomena observed...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} unreliable or crowdsourced data where there is an underlying set of n binary variables, each evaluator contributes a (possibly unreliable or adversarial) estimate {{of the values of}} some subset of r of the variables, and the learner is given the true value of a constant number of variables. We show that, provided an α-fraction of the evaluators are "good" (either correct, or with independent noise rate p 1 /(2 - 2 p) ^r. This setting {{can be viewed as a}}n instance of the semi-verified learning model introduced in [CSV 17], which explores the tradeoff between the number of items evaluated by each worker and the fraction of good evaluators. Our results require the number of evaluators to be extremely large, >n^r, although our algorithm runs in linear time, O_r,ϵ(n), given query access to the large dataset of evaluations. This setting and results can also be viewed as examining a general class of semi-adversarial CSPs with a <b>planted</b> <b>assignment.</b> This parameter regime where the fraction of reliable data is small, is relevant to a number of practical settings. For example, settings where one has a large dataset of customer preferences, with each customer specifying preferences for a small (constant) number of items, and the goal is to ascertain the preferences of a specific demographic of interest. Our results show that this large dataset (which lacks demographic information) can be leveraged together with the preferences of the demographic of interest for a constant number of randomly selected items, to recover an accurate estimate of the entire set of preferences. In this sense, our results can be viewed as a "data prism" allowing one to extract the behavior of specific cohorts from a large, mixed, dataset...|$|R

In this work, a general modeling framework conceived {{to drive the}} decision-making process for the strategic design of biofuel supply networks is presented. The design task is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that accounts for the simultaneous minimization of the supply chain operating costs (part 1) {{as well as the}} environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [part 2 (DOI 10. 1021 /ef 9004779) ].

40|$|Clonal {{propagation}} {{and sexual}} reproduction have diametrically opposite {{effects on the}} genetic diversity of crops, permitting, respectively, the conservation of existing genotypes or {{the creation of new}} diversity. Oxalis tuberosa Mol. (‘‘oca’’) exhibits a heteromorphic selfincompatibility system and is traditionally propagated clonally but is capable of sexual reproduction. In this study we investigated the influence of sexual reproduction on the in situ genetic diversity of a vegetatively propagated crop, taking oca as a model plant. The occurrence of sexual reproduction in natural conditions and its use by farmers were studied through surveys and interviews, while the effect of sexual reproduction on the in situ genetic diversity was evaluated using microsatellite analysis. Plantlets issuing from sexual reproduction were encountered in five of the nine visited communities. The interviews indicated that six out of the nine interviewed farmers were likely, albeit unconsciously, incorporating clonal lineages issuing from sexual reproduction into their varieties. The microsatellite analysis indicated a strong effect of such incorporations on the genetic diversity of the <b>plant</b> varieties. <b>Assignment</b> tests confirmed the allogamy of oca. ‘‘Complex varieties’’, made up of individuals exhibiting genetically differentiated genotypes,weremost likely the result of recent crossing.

His major research interests were in the development and production of hybrid corn, but he also had responsibilities for other crop species sold commercially throughout the United States and the world. Duvick started his career in 1951 at Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Company as a corn breeder, studying the genetics of cytoplasmic pollen sterility. He advanced within the company to become senior vice president of research in 1984, a position he held until his retirement in 1990. In order to produce large quantities of high-quality hybrid seed corn for growers each year, vast numbers of people were required to detassel cornfields by hand. Production of hybrid seed corn is seasonal (three to five weeks), so it was difficult to hire an adequate number of detasselers and supervisors to ensure quality control in the yearly production. Hence, it was of interest to develop and identify genetic systems that could reduce the need for these seasonal workers by controlling the inherent fertility of the <b>plants.</b> Duvick’s first <b>assignment</b> upon joinin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In a {{collaborative}} design and manufacturing system, the {{different parts of}} a product can be designed by different design teams at different plants. In addition, the parts can be distributed and manufactured with manufacturing operation at different <b>plants.</b> The design <b>assignment</b> and manufacturing distribution affect {{the cost of the}} product. The purpose of a design change is to modify a portion of a product for certain improvement purposes such as adding values or reducing costs. A design change may cause changes of the related design tasks and manufacturing operations that are distributed at different plants. In this research, a design change evaluated model is presented to evaluate the affected design task assignment and the changed manufacturing operation distribution. A mathematical programming model is presented for design task assignment and manufacturing operation distribution with an objective of minimizing the total design and manufacturing cost. The design related costs include design operational cost and design communication cost. The manufacturing related costs include manufacturing operation cost and setup and handling cost. With the presented model, the total costs before and after a design change can be evaluated. The changed total cost is compared with the gained value to determine the worth value of a design change.

40|$|We {{consider}} a bipartite stochastic block model on vertex sets V_ 1 and V_ 2, with planted partitions in each, and ask at what densities efficient algorithms can recover {{the partition of}} the smaller vertex set. When |V_ 2 | ≫ |V_ 1 |, multiple thresholds emerge. We first locate a sharp threshold for detection of the partition, {{in the sense of}} the results of mossel 2012 stochastic,mossel 2013 proof and massoulie 2014 community for the stochastic block model. We then show that at a higher edge density, the singular vectors of the rectangular biadjacency matrix exhibit a localization / delocalization phase transition, giving recovery above the threshold and no recovery below. Nevertheless, we propose a simple spectral algorithm, Diagonal Deletion SVD, which recovers the partition at a nearly optimal edge density.

40|$|Abstract Background The holoparasitic {{plant genus}} Cuscuta {{comprises}} species with photosynthetic capacity and functional chloroplasts {{as well as}} achlorophyllous and intermediate forms with restricted photosynthetic activity and degenerated chloroplasts. Previous data indicated significant differences {{with respect to the}} plastid genome coding capacity in different Cuscuta species that could correlate with their photosynthetic activity. In order to shed light on the molecular changes accompanying the parasitic lifestyle, we sequenced the plastid chromosomes of the two species Cuscuta reflexa and Cuscuta gronovii. Both species are capable of performing photosynthesis, albeit with varying efficiencies. Together with the plastid genome of Epifagus virginiana, an achlorophyllous parasitic plant whose plastid genome has been sequenced, these species represent a series of progression towards total dependency on the host plant, ranging from reduced levels of photosynthesis in C. reflexa to a restricted photosynthetic activity and degenerated chloroplasts in C. gronovii to an achlorophyllous state in E. virginiana. Results The newly sequenced plastid genomes of C. reflexa and C. gronovii reveal that the chromosome structures are generally very similar to that of non-parasitic plants, although a number of species-specific insertions, deletions (indels) and sequence inversions were identified. However, we observed a gradual adaptation of the plastid genome to the different degrees of parasitism. The changes are particularly evident in C. gronovii and include (a) the parallel losses of genes for the subunits of the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase and the corresponding promoters from the plastid genome, (b) the first documented loss of the gene for a putative splicing factor, MatK, from the plastid genome and (c) a significant reduction of RNA editing. Conclusion Overall, the comparative genomic analysis of plastid DNA from parasitic plants indicates a bias towards a simplification of the plastid gene expression machinery as a consequence of an increasing dependency on the host <b>plant.</b> A tentative <b>assignment</b> of the successive events in the adaptation of the plastid genomes to parasitism can be inferred from the current data set. This includes (1) a loss of non-coding regions in photosynthetic Cuscuta species that has resulted in a condensation of the plastid genome, (2) the simplification of plastid gene expression in species with largely impaired photosynthetic capacity and (3) the deletion of {{a significant part of the}} genetic information, including the information for the photosynthetic apparatus, in non-photosynthetic parasitic plants. </p...|$|R
