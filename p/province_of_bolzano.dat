40|$|Landslide {{databases}} {{are essential}} tools for risk assessment. In the Italian {{portion of the}} South-Eastern Alps these archives are managed by the Veneto Region and by the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano</b> and Trento, {{as part of the}} Italian Inventory of Landslides. About 750 rockfall events recorded in these archives were checked, put together and completed to create a new integrated database. Information on 24 new rockfalls were added from different research sources. Descriptive statistic shows that the most affected slopes with the highest frequency of rockfall are the southern ones. The distribution of rockfalls during the year presents three peaks in March, June and November. The most commonly affected lithologies are massive dolomites, effusive rocks and mica schists. Roads proved to be the most commonly involved feature. The hypsographic curves obtained from the DEMs <b>of</b> the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Belluno, <b>Bolzano</b> and Trento have shown that the different areas potentially affected by periglacial processes experience rockfalls during summer and autumn, thus representing a risk to tourists and hikers. This study is the first attempt to collate and extend the available information in the various rockfall databases in the Eastern Italian Alps, with the aim at creating uniform data collection for the whole Alpine range. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelber...|$|R

It is also adaptable to the most difficult and hard farming and breeding conditions, which makes this cattle easy to manage for the farmer.

2500|$|Three days {{following}} his rescue in the Gran Sasso raid, Mussolini {{was taken to}} Germany {{for a meeting with}} Hitler in Rastenburg at his East Prussian headquarters. Despite public professions of support, Hitler was clearly shocked by Mussolini's disheveled and haggard appearance as well as his unwillingness to go after the men in Rome who overthrew him. Feeling that he had to do what he could to blunt the edges of Nazi repression, Mussolini agreed to set up a new regime, the Italian Social Republic ( [...] , RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic because of its administration from the town of Salò where he settled in just 11 days after his rescue by the Germans. Mussolini's new regime faced numerous territorial losses: in addition to losing the Italian lands held by the Allies and Badoglio's government, the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano,</b> Belluno and Trento were placed under German administration in the Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills, while the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola (now Pula), Fiume (now Rijeka) and Ljubljana (Lubiana in Italian) were incorporated into the German Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral."In addition to my... order of the commander of the Greater German Reich in Italy and the organisation of the occupied Italian area from 10 September 1943 I determine:The supreme commanders in the Operational Zone Adriatic Coast consisting <b>of</b> the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Friaul, Görz, Triest, Istrien, Fiume, Quarnero, Laibach, and in the Prealpine Operations Zone consisting <b>of</b> the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Bozen, Trient and Belluno receive the fundamental instructions for their activity from me.

Mussolini opposed any territorial reductions of the Italian state and told his associates:I am not here to renounce even a square meter of state territory. We will go back to war for this. And we will rebel against anyone for this. Where the Italian flag flew, the Italian flag will return. And where it has not been lowered, now that I am here, no one will have it lowered.
