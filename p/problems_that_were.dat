5|$|As Haiti's {{economic}} situation had deteriorated {{during the second}} Aristide presidency, demonstrations proliferated everywhere throughout the nation and political dialogue broke down between opposition leaders and the Aristide government.

40|$|Abstract Under the {{assumption}} that NP does not have p-measure 0, we investigate reductions to NP-complete sets and prove the following: 1. Adaptive reductions are more powerful than nonadaptive reductions: there <b>is</b> a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> Turing-complete for NP but not truth-table-complete. 2. Strong nondeterministic reductions are more powerful than deterministic reductions: there <b>is</b> a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> SNP-complete for NP but not Turing-complete. 3. Every <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> many-one complete for NP is complete under length-increasing reductions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> computed by polynomial-size circuits...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Tintin in the Congo, Hergé conducted research for a story set in the United States, desiring to reflect his concerns regarding the treatment of Native communities by the U.S. government. Bolstered by a publicity stunt, Tintin in America was a commercial success in Belgium and was soon republished in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Cigars of the Pharaoh, and the series became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1945, Tintin in America was re-drawn and coloured in Hergé's ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his American publisher for a 1973 edition. The story was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin. Critical reception of the work has been mixed, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin arguing that although it represents an improvement on the preceding two instalments, it still reflects many of the <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> visible in them.|$|E
5|$|Keen {{to follow}} up his {{interest}} in aviation, Johnson started taking flying lessons at his own expense. He applied to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) but encountered some of the social <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> rife in British society at the time. Johnson strongly felt he was rejected {{on the grounds of}} his class status. Johnson's fortunes were to improve. As the chances of war increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Munich Crisis, the standards of the RAF were relaxed, however, as the service expanded and brought in men from ordinary social backgrounds. Johnson re-applied to the AAF. He was informed that sufficient pilots were already available but there were some vacancies in the balloon squadrons. Johnson rejected the offer.|$|E

5|$|This period also {{marked a}} phase of {{considerable}} travel to the Middle East by European civilians and minor nobility, and in the process, some travelers noticed that the Arabian horse as a pure breed of horse was under threat due to modern forms of warfare, inbreeding and other <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> reducing the horse population of the Bedouin tribes at a rapid rate. By the late 19th century, the most farsighted began in earnest to collect the finest Arabian horses they could find {{in order to preserve}} the blood of the pure desert horse for future generations. The most famous example was Lady Anne Blunt, the daughter of Ada Lovelace and granddaughter of Lord Byron.|$|E
5|$|When Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony, no one remained to oppose him. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> plaguing Rome. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that he had given up.|$|E

25|$|Here a {{slightly}} more rigorous approach is taken {{in order to address}} potential <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> disregarded in the interaction picture approach of above. The final outcome is, of course, the same as when taking the quicker route. For this, the notions of in and out states are needed. These will be developed in two ways, from vacua, and from free particle states. Needless to say, the two approaches are equivalent, but they illuminate matters from different angles.|$|E

The proximity of the two intersections caused complex traffic <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> solved in the late 2000s (decade) by pedestrianizing Holladay Boulevard northwest of the intersection.|$|E

25|$|Seventy-three hostages (including six minors) were {{rendered}} {{no medical}} aid. There were several Chechens among the hostages {{and it may}} be that some of them were not treated because of their Chechen names. Money and other valuables belonging to the victims vanished; official reports stated that the valuables were stolen by an FSB officer who was later killed in a car crash. The Russian authorities initially maintained that none of the deaths among the hostages occurred through poisoning.

25|$|The use of {{psychedelic}} {{agents in}} Western therapy {{began in the}} 1950s, after the widespread distribution of LSD to researchers by its manufacturer, Sandoz Laboratories. Research into experimental, chemotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic uses of psychedelic drugs was conducted in several countries over the next 10–15 years. In addition {{to the release of}} dozens of books and creation of six international conferences, more than 1,000 peer-reviewed clinical papers detailing the use of psychedelic compounds (administered to approximately 40,000 patients) were published by the mid-1960s. Proponents believed that psychedelic drugs facilitated psychoanalytic processes, and that they were particularly useful for patients with <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> otherwise difficult to treat, including alcoholics, although the trials did not meet the methodological standards required today.|$|E
25|$|The {{ganzfeld}} experiment {{studies that}} were examined by Ray Hyman and Charles Honorton had methodological <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> well documented. Honorton reported only 36% {{of the studies}} used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues. Hyman discovered flaws {{in all of the}} 42 ganzfeld experiments and to access each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate documentation, randomization and security as well as possibilities of sensory leakage. Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained {{at least one of the}} 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi.|$|E
