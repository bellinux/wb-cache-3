25|$|Ordinarily, {{carbon dioxide}} is fixed to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) by the enzyme RuBisCO in {{mesophyll}} cells exposed directly to the air spaces inside the leaf. This exacerbates the transpiration problem for two reasons: first, RuBisCo has a relatively low affinity for carbon dioxide, and second, it fixes oxygen to RuBP, wasting energy and carbon in a process called <b>photorespiration.</b> For both of these reasons, RuBisCo needs high carbon dioxide concentrations, which means wide stomatal apertures and, as a consequence, high water loss.|$|E
25|$|Catalase {{is usually}} {{located in a}} {{cellular}} organelle called the peroxisome. Peroxisomes in plant cells are involved in <b>photorespiration</b> (the use of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide) and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (the breaking apart of diatomic nitrogen (N2) to reactive nitrogen atoms). Hydrogen peroxide {{is used as a}} potent antimicrobial agent when cells are infected with a pathogen. Catalase-positive pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni, make catalase to deactivate the peroxide radicals, thus allowing them to survive unharmed within the host.|$|E
500|$|The {{concentration}} {{of carbon dioxide}} in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like Crassulacean acid metabolism and the [...] carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from <b>photorespiration</b> in the more common [...] carbon fixation pathway. These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants.|$|E
2500|$|In {{leaves of}} C3 plants, {{captured}} photons of solar energy undergo photosynthesis which assimilates carbon into carbohydrates (triosephosphates) in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll cells. The primary CO2 fixation step is catalysed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) which reacts with O2 leading to <b>photorespiration</b> that protects photosynthesis from photoinhibition but wastes 50% of potentially fixed carbon. concentration and prospects for its introduction into C3 plants |journal=J.

2500|$|A recent theory {{explores the}} {{trade-off}} between the relative specificity (i.e., ability to favour [...] fixation over [...] incorporation, {{which leads to}} the energy-wasteful process of <b>photorespiration)</b> and the rate at which product is formed. The authors conclude that RuBisCO may actually have evolved to reach a point of 'near-perfection' in many plants (with widely varying substrate availabilities and environmental conditions), reaching a compromise between specificity and reaction rate.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} mostly desert plants called [...] "CAM" [...] plants (Crassulacean acid metabolism, after the family Crassulaceae, which {{includes}} the species in which the CAM process was first discovered) open their stomata at night (when water evaporates more slowly from leaves for a given degree of stomatal opening), use PEPcarboxylase to fix carbon dioxide and store the products in large vacuoles. The following day, they close their stomata and release the carbon dioxide fixed the previous night into the presence of RuBisCO. This saturates RuBisCO with carbon dioxide, allowing minimal <b>photorespiration.</b> This approach, however, is severely limited by the capacity to store fixed carbon in the vacuoles, so it is preferable only when water is severely limiting.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Photorespiration</b> {{can occur}} when the oxygen {{concentration}} is too high. RuBisCO cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well, so it can accidentally add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP. This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis—it consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO2, and produces no sugar. It can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. Several mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast, increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. These mechanisms are called carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms, or CCMs. These include Crassulacean acid metabolism, [...] carbon fixation, and pyrenoids. Chloroplasts in [...] plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism.|$|E
2500|$|A {{peroxisome}} [...] {{is a type}} of organelle {{known as}} a microbody, found in virtually all eukaryotic cells. They are involved in catabolism of very long chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids, D-amino acids, and polyamines, reduction of reactive oxygen species – specifically hydrogen peroxide – and biosynthesis of plasmalogens, i.e., ether phospholipids critical for the normal function of mammalian brains and lungs. [...] They also contain approximately 10% of the total activity of two enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for energy metabolism. It is vigorously debated whether peroxisomes are involved in isoprenoid and cholesterol synthesis in animals. [...] Other known peroxisomal functions include the glyoxylate cycle in germinating seeds ("glyoxysomes"), <b>photorespiration</b> in leaves, glycolysis in trypanosomes ("glycosomes"), and methanol and/or amine oxidation and assimilation in some yeasts.|$|E
2500|$|Increased CO2 is {{expected}} to have positive physiological effects by increasing the rate of photosynthesis. This is known as 'carbon dioxide fertilisation'. [...] Currently, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is 410 parts per million. In comparison, the amount of oxygen is 210,000 ppm. This means that often plants may be starved of carbon dioxide as the enzyme that fixes , RuBisCo, also fixes oxygen in the process of <b>photorespiration.</b> The effects of an increase in carbon dioxide would be higher on C3 crops (such as wheat) than on C4 crops (such as maize), because the former is more susceptible to carbon dioxide shortage. Studies have shown that increased CO2 leads to fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage. Under optimum conditions of temperature and humidity, the yield increase could reach 36%, if the levels of carbon dioxide are doubled. A study in 2014 posited that CO2 fertilisation is underestimated due to not explicitly representing CO2 diffusion inside leaves.|$|E
2500|$|When {{molecular}} oxygen is the substrate, {{the products of}} the oxygenase reaction are phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycolate is recycled through a sequence of reactions called <b>photorespiration,</b> which involves enzymes and cytochromes located in the mitochondria and peroxisomes (this is a case of metabolite repair). In this process, two molecules of phosphoglycolate are converted to one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate, which can reenter the Calvin cycle. Some of the phosphoglycolate entering this pathway can be retained by plants to produce other molecules such as glycine. At ambient levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the ratio of the reactions is about 4 to 1, which results in a net carbon dioxide fixation of only 3.5. [...] Thus, the inability of the enzyme to prevent the reaction with oxygen greatly reduces the photosynthetic capacity of many plants. Some plants, many algae, and photosynthetic bacteria have overcome this limitation by devising means to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide around the enzyme, including [...] carbon fixation, crassulacean acid metabolism, and the use of pyrenoid.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{carbon dioxide}} and oxygen compete at the active site of RuBisCO, carbon {{fixation}} by RuBisCO can be enhanced by increasing the carbon dioxide level in the compartment containing RuBisCO (chloroplast stroma). Several times during the evolution of plants, mechanisms have evolved for increasing the level of {{carbon dioxide in the}} stroma (see [...] carbon fixation). The use of oxygen as a substrate appears to be a puzzling process, since it seems to throw away captured energy. However, it may be a mechanism for preventing overload during periods of high light flux. [...] This weakness in the enzyme is the cause of <b>photorespiration,</b> such that healthy leaves in bright light may have zero net carbon fixation when the ratio of [...] to [...] reaches a threshold at which oxygen is fixed instead of carbon. This phenomenon is primarily temperature-dependent. High temperature decreases the concentration of [...] dissolved in the moisture in the leaf tissues. [...] This phenomenon is also related to water stress. Since plant leaves are evaporatively cooled, limited water causes high leaf temperatures. [...] plants use the enzyme PEP carboxylase initially, which has a higher affinity for [...] The process first makes a 4-carbon intermediate compound, which is shuttled into a site of [...] photosynthesis then de-carboxylated, releasing [...] to boost the concentration of , hence the name [...] plants.|$|E
50|$|Reducing <b>photorespiration</b> may {{not result}} in {{increased}} growth rates for plants. <b>Photorespiration</b> may be necessary for the assimilation of nitrate from soil. Thus, a reduction in <b>photorespiration</b> by genetic engineering or because of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide due to fossil fuel burning may not benefit plants as has been proposed. Several physiological processes {{may be responsible for}} linking <b>photorespiration</b> and nitrogen assimilation. <b>Photorespiration</b> increases availability of NADH, which is required for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite. Certain nitrite transporters also transport bicarbonate, and elevated CO2 has been shown to suppress nitrite transport into chloroplasts.|$|E
5000|$|RuBisCO also reacts {{competitively}} with [...] {{instead of}} [...] in <b>photorespiration.</b> The rate of <b>photorespiration</b> is higher at high temperatures. <b>Photorespiration</b> turns RuBP into 3-PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate, a 2-carbon molecule {{that can be}} converted via glycolate and glyoxalate to glycine. Via the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate, two glycines are converted into serine +. Serine can be converted back to 3-phosphoglycerate. Thus, only 3 of 4 carbons from two phosphoglycolates can be converted back to 3-PGA. It {{can be seen that}} <b>photorespiration</b> has very negative consequences for the plant, because, rather than fixing , this process leads to loss of [...] C4 carbon fixation evolved to circumvent <b>photorespiration,</b> but can occur only in certain plants native to very warm or tropical climates—corn, for example.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the study}} of plants' <b>photorespiration,</b> the {{labeling}} of atmosphere by oxygen-18 allows us to measure the oxygen uptake by the <b>photorespiration</b> pathway.

It was demonstrated that, under preindustrial atmosphere, most plants reabsorb, by <b>photorespiration,</b> half of the oxygen produced by photosynthesis. Then, the yield of photosynthesis was halved by the presence of oxygen in atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to being an intermediate in the glyoxylate pathway, glyoxylate {{is also an important}} intermediate in the <b>photorespiration</b> pathway. <b>Photorespiration</b> {{is a result of the}} side reaction of Rubisco with O2 instead of CO2. While at first considered a waste of energy and resources, <b>photorespiration</b> has been shown to be an important method of regenerating carbon and CO2, removing toxic phosphoglycolate, and initiating defense mechanisms. In <b>photorespiration,</b> glyoxylate is converted from glycolate through the activity of glycolate oxidase in the peroxisome. It is then converted into glycine through parallel actions by SGAT and GGAT, which is then transported into the mitochondria. It has also been reported that the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex may play a role in glycolate and glyoxylate metabolism.|$|E

50|$|Consider the {{differences}} in the mechanics of C3, C4, and CAM plants in regulating the influx of carbon dioxide to the Calvin-Benson Cycle in relation to their abiotic stressors. C3 plants have no mechanisms to manage <b>photorespiration,</b> whereas C4 and CAM plants utilize a separate PEP Carboxylase enzyme to prevent <b>photorespiration,</b> thus increasing the yield of photosynthetic processes in certain high energy environments.|$|E
50|$|This {{ability to}} avoid <b>photorespiration</b> makes these plants more hardy than other plants in dry and hot environments, wherein stomata are closed and {{internal}} carbon dioxide levels are low.

50|$|A {{powerful}} research {{technique is}} to simultaneously measure chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange {{to obtain a}} full picture of the response of plants to their environment. One technique is to simultaneously measure CO2 fixation and PSII photochemistry at different light intensities, in non-photorespiratory conditions.
