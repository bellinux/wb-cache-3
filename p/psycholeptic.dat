40|$|Objective: {{to examine}} the key {{determinants}} of pharmaco-epidemiology in Australian nursing homes. Design: a cross-sectional survey of medication use in 998 residents in 15 nursing homes in Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales, Results: the total, laxative, digoxin/diuretic, benzodiazepine and <b>psycholeptic</b> medication prescribed and administered to residents of nursing homes was affected to differing extents by age and gender, the nursing home, resident functional disability and medical practitioner. Resident Classification Instrument (RCI) category and nursing home were the dominant determinants for prescribing and administration of the total drugs, laxative, benzodiazepine and <b>psycholeptic</b> medications. In contrast, the resident use of digoxin and/or diuretics was dependent on the resident age and on the functional disability (RCI category) of the resident but not medical practitioner or nursing home. Approximately 30 % of medications were prescribed on a pro re nata (p. r. n.) basis and administered {{at the discretion of}} registered nurses. Conclusion: nursing home culture is a major determinant of the variability in medication use between residents, particularly for those medications often prescribed for p. r. n. use. The nursing home does not account for variation in the use of digoxin and/or diuretics which are prescribed on a non-discretionary basis...|$|E

40|$|This {{review article}} draws the {{attention}} to the many species of plants possessing activity on {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) in fact, they cover the whole spectrum of central activity such as psychoanaleptic, <b>psycholeptic</b> and psychodysleptic effects, and several of these plants are currently used in therapeutics to treat human ailments. Among the psychoanaleptic (stimulant) plants, those utilized by human beings to reduce body weight [Ephedra spp (Ma Huang), Paullinia spp (guarana), Catha edulis Forssk (khat) ] and plants used to improve general health conditions (plant adaptogens) were scrutinized. Many species of hallucinogenic (psychodysleptic) plants are used by humans throughout the world to achieve states of mind distortions; among those, a few have been used for therapeutic purposes, such as Cannabis sativa L., Tabernanthe iboga Baill and the mixture of Psychotria viridis Ruiz and Pav and Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C. V Morton Plants showing central <b>psycholeptic</b> activities, such as analgesic or anxiolytic actions (Passiflora incarnata L., Valeriana spp and Piper methysticum G Forst.), were also analysed.

40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} {{and evaluate}} drug utilisation {{in a sample}} of Dutch nursing homes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of computerised medication data of 2355 residents aged 65 years and over from six nursing homes in the Netherlands was performed. For each therapeutic drug group, the number of users was determined. The ten therapeutic groups used most frequently were investigated further. For these, patient characteristics, use of therapeutic subgroups, the average daily dosages and the chronicity of drug use were determined. Chronicity was expressed as the percentage of treatment days divided by the number of residents' days in the nursing home. Results: During the study period, 89 %, 77 % and 56 % of the study population used a drug from the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) main group N (nervous system), A (alimentary tract and metabolism) and C (cardiovascular system), respectively. Eight of the ten therapeutic drug groups prescribed most frequently were used for more than 50 % of the time. In particular, <b>psycholeptic</b> drugs, diuretics and laxatives were used chronically (83 %, 81 %, and 80 % of the nursing home stay, respectively). Except for a few drug groups, such as laxatives and diuretics, the prescribed daily dosages were relatively low. Twenty-eight percent of the residents received loop diuretics; these were prescribed in relatively high dosages. Conclusion: Drug utilisation in the nursing homes was high and many drugs were used chronically. In view of the risk of possible adverse effects and drug-drug interactions, the prescribing and dosage of <b>psycholeptic</b> drugs, laxatives, loop diuretics and ulcer-healing drugs should be re-evaluated, carefully...|$|E

40|$|Linalool is a {{monoterpene}} {{often found}} {{as a major}} component of essential oils obtained from aromatic plant species., many of which are used in traditional medical systems as hypno-sedatives. Psychopharmacological evaluations of linalool (i. p. and i. c. v.) revealed marked sedative and anticonvulsant central effects in various mouse models. Considering this profile and alleged effects of inhaled lavender essential oil, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the sedative effects of inhaled linalool in mice. Mice were placed in an inhalation chamber during 60 min, in an atmosphere saturated with 1 % or 3 % linalool. Immediately after inhalation, animals were evaluated regarding locomotion, barbiturate-induced sleeping time, body temperature: and motor coordination (rota-rod test). The 1 % and 3 % linalool increased (p < 0. 01) pentobarbital sleeping time and reduced (p< 0. 01) body temperature. The 3 % linalool decreased (p< 0. 01) locomotion. Motor coordination was not affected. Hence, linalool inhaled for I h seems to induce sedation without significant impairment in motor abilities, a side effect shared by most <b>psycholeptic</b> drugs. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The {{aim was to}} estimate outpatient consumption of psychotropic drugs in Croatia in correlation with Scandinavian countries. Data on drug utilization in Croatia were collected and analyzed for the 2001 - 2003 period. Data were obtained from Zagreb Municipal Pharmacy and extrapolated to {{the total number of}} pharmacies. All drugs were classified according to Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) drug classification system. These data were used to calculate a number of defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/TID).

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that (2 S, 3 R) - 3 -acetoxy- 4 ’-methoxyflavan (Fa- 131) is a subtype {{selective}} modulator of GABAA-receptors, exerting non-sedative anxiolytic effects in mice. In order to elucidate the flavanol binding site, photoaffinity labelling (PAL) experiments were undertaken in our laboratory. Three analogues of Fa- 131 were prepared, bearing the photoreactive benzophenone moiety at distant points, with an alkyne tag for Cu(I) -catalysed-azide-alkyne-cycloaddition (CuAAC) mediated affinity purification. To utilise the tag, the highly functionalised Bio-SS-N 3 was designed and synthesised along with the Cu-coordinating ligand BTTAA. Bio-SS-N 3 contains biotin, a cleavable disulfide, and tertiary amine {{for the purposes of}} accelerating CuAAC and improving the detection of peptides in mass spectrometry. Due to the large sample requirements of PAL, a rapidly scalable transient transfection protocol was developed in HEK 293 cells, providing a 40 -fold increase over initial protein yields. This entailed transfection of α 1 /β 3 GABAA-receptor subunits within the novel plasmid pARVUS, together with the helper plasmid pARVA using triple-shelled CaP/PEI nanoparticles. Due to the large degree of non-specific labelling encountered, our initial attempts in photolabelling GABAA-receptors were unsuccessful. Work in characterising the flavanol binding site continues with the hope of developing a new class of <b>psycholeptic</b> agents, together with an efficient protocol for the photolabelling of other drug targets.

40|$|Background: Psychotropic {{paediatric}} prescribing {{trends are}} increasing internationally. The {{aim of this}} study is to examine the prevalence and secular trends in psychotropic prescribing in Irish children and adolescents between 2002 and 2011. Methods: Data was obtained from the Irish General Medical Services (GMS) scheme pharmacy claims database from the Health Service Executive Primary Care Reimbursement Services (HSE-PCRS). Prescribing rates per 1000 eligible population and associated 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated across years (2002 – 2011), age groups (0 – 4, 5 – 11, 12 – 15 years) and gender. Rates of concomitant prescriptions for psycholeptics and antidepressants were also examined. The total expenditure costs were calculated and expressed as a percentage of the cost of all prescriptions for this age group (≤ 15 years). Results: In 2002, 3. 77 / 1000 GMS population (95 % CI: 3. 53 – 4. 01) received at least one psychostimulant prescription and this rate increased to 8. 63 / 1000 GMS population (95 % CI: 8. 34 – 8. 92) in 2011. Methylphenidate was the most frequently prescribed psychostimulant. For both males and females the prevalence of medication use was highest among the 12 – 15 year old group. On average, a <b>psycholeptic</b> medication was prescribed to 8 % of all psychostimulant users and an antidepressant was concomitantly prescribed on average to 2 %. Total expenditure rose from € 89, 254 in 2002 to € 1, 532, 016 in 2011. Conclusions: The rate and cost of psychostimulant prescribing among GMS children and adolescents in Ireland increased significantly between 2002 and 2011.

40|$|Persons with {{profound}} intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) {{suffer from a}} wide range of health problems and use a wide range of different drugs. This study investigated for frequently used medication whether there was a health problem documented in the medical notes for the drug prescribed. Persons with PIMD with an estimated intelligence quotient of 25 and profound or severe motor disorders were studied. Data on health problems were taken from medical notes and prescribing data were obtained from pharmacies. Data covering 1 year were analysed. For four therapeutic areas (anticonvulsants, laxatives, drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and psycholeptics), we determined whether we could find an indication for prescribed medication. Some 254 persons with PIMD (46 % male, 54 % female; median age 49 years, range 6 - 82) from eight residential facilities participated. Some 226 participants (89 %) were prescribed medication over the course of 1 year. An indication for the prescribed medication was documented for 92 % (n = 130) (95 % confidence interval 88 - 96 %) of 141 participants on anticonvulsants, for 68 % (n = 112) (61 - 75 %) of 165 participants on laxatives, for 44 % (n = 58) (36 - 52 %) of 132 participants on drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and for 89 % (n = 102) (83 - 95 %) of 115 participants on <b>psycholeptic</b> drugs. The best level of documentation was found for anticonvulsants the worst for drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Lack of documenting an indication may be due to off-label use, inadvertent continuation of no longer indicated medication, inadequate documentation and underdiagnosis. Adequate documentation practices are essential because of the communication problems that are characteristic for persons with PIMD...|$|E

40|$|Dementias are {{the most}} common {{psychiatric}} diseases in old age. Within {{a short period of time}} they lead into severe cognitive impairment, a loss in competences of daily living and therefore to a growing need of health care. Given the demographic development in Germany it has to be considered as essential to clarify health care provided to dementia patients and verify its accordance with dementia guidelines. This study examines the health care provision for people with dementia, based on routine data of a big German health insurance company. Furthermore, the provided care has been compared to applicable therapy guidelines. Three criteria have been used to identify demented people from a cohort of 74, 000 insurants aged 60 years and older: 1) Antidementive medication, 2) Dementia diagnosis during a hospital stay, 3) Dementia diagnosis for care services allocation. 4, 495 insurants with dementia have been identified via these criteria, which results in a dementia prevalence of 6. 1 % in the sample. Differences to elderly people without dementia are: higher mean age, higher rate of female insurants, higher mortality. The pharmacotherapy for most of the dementia patients consists in ginkgo biloba compounds. Only 11 % of all prescriptions are composed by AChE inhibitors and Memantin. A high percentage of insurants with dementia had only one or two antidementive prescriptions in the three year period examined. Every tenth dementia patient received antidepressive medication during the study period. Antipsychotics were prescribed much more often to insurants with dementia compared to other insurants. Nursing home residents with dementia received the highest amount of <b>psycholeptic</b> substances in the study. Compared to elder people without dementia, nearly twice the number of demented insurants was in need of care. Health care utilization in other sectors, e. g. clinical services, remedies and aids, is also higher in the dementia study group. Study participants with dementia generate total health care costs 1. 5 as much as elderly without dementia. In addition, costs for the dementia group increased within 3 years. The data base used in this study allows highly conservative prevalence conclusions. Health insurance routine data can be used to analyse provided health care in a differentiated way and indicates inappropriate or under-supply. The results of this study could be used to brief family practitioners about evidenced-based treatment and potentially inappropriate psychotropic medication of dementia...|$|E
40|$|The lack of Croatian {{studies which}} could {{determine}} the justifiability of excessive psychopharmaceutical utilization was an encouragement to conduct this research. Furthermore, regarding the conduction of this study, {{it would be}} possible to determine whether the trend of drug utilization has increased, decreased or perhaps stabilized. The data on the outpatient utilization of psycholeptics and psychoanaleptics were collected from all Zagreb pharmacies, 2006 - 2009. Based on the collected data for all N 05 and N 06 groups of drugs, the defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per thousand inhabitants per day (DDD/TID) have been calculated using the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical classification (ATC) for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. To indicate the quality of drug prescription the Drug Utilization 90 % (DU 90 %) method was used. Moreover, in order to determine a more precise quality of individual drug group prescriptions, the indicators have been calculated by determining the proportion of the total utilization of individual therapeutic and pharmacological therapeutic subgroups in DDD/TID a day. The utilization of anxiolytics (N 05 B) accounts for most of the <b>psycholeptic</b> utilization in the City of Zagreb throughout the entire study period. In the study period, the utilization of antidepressants has slightly increased, by 10. 5 %, taking the first and the last years of the period into account. In 2006, 5 benzodiazepines and the hypnotic zolpidem, as well as 5 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 1 third generation antipsychotic (olanzapin) were found in the DU 90 % segment. In 2009, the DU 90 % segment also comprised 5 benzodiazepines and the hypnotic zolpidem, as well as 6 SSRIs and 1 third generation antipsychotic (olanzapin). In the City of Zagreb, a general insight into the quality of psychopharmaceutical prescriptions indicates stability in comparison to earlier studies. The ratio index of the first generation antipsychotic utilization, compared to the third generation antipsychotics, shows an increase in the quality of prescription. Also, the ratio index of total tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and SSRI utilization indicates improvement in quality of prescription. The ratio index of the entire outpatient utilization of anxiolytics and antidepressants expressed in DDD/TID unfortunately shows a very mild increase of prescription quality. Benzodiazepines accounted for more than 50 % of the outpatient utilization of psychopharmaceuticals throughout the study period, which proves the need for precise guidelines as the most significant means of drug rationalization and utilization. It is necessary to identify priorities and problems in order to solve them successfully, by monitoring drug utilization and prescription on a national level. Results demonstrate that within the primary health care system, there is a need for constant education on rational prescription of this drug group...|$|E
40|$|Prevalence {{of vitamin}} B 12 {{deficiency}} {{is very common}} in elderly people and can reach values as high as 40. 5 % of the population. It can {{be the result of}} the interaction among several factors. Vitamin B 12 deficiencies have been associated with neurological, cognitive deterioration, haematological abnormalities and cardiovascular diseases that have an important influence on the health of the elderly and their quality of life. It is necessary to approach the problems arisen from the lack of data relative to them. The main objective of this thesis was to analyse the evolution of vitamin B 12 status and related parameters, lipid and haematological profiles and their relationship to health risk factors, and to functional and cognitive status over one year and to determine the effect of an oral supplementation of 500 μg of cyanocobalamin {{for a short period of}} 28 days. An additional objective was to analyze the possible effects of medicine intakes on vitamin B status. Three studies were performed: a) a one year longitudinal follow-up with four measure points; b) an intervention study providing an oral liquid supplement of 500 μg of cyanocobalamin for a 28 days period; and c) analysis of the possible effect of medication intake on vitamin B status using the ATC classification of medicines. The participants for these studies were recruited from nursing homes for the elderly in the Region of Madrid. Sixty elders (mean age 84 _ 7 y, 19 men and 41 women) were recruited for Study I and 64 elders (mean age 82 _ 7 y, 24 men and 40 women) for Study II. For Study III, baseline data from the initially recruited participants of the first two studies were used. An informed consent was obtained from all participants or their mentors. The studies were approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Granada. Blood samples were obtained at each examination date and were analyzed for serum cobalamin, holoTC, serum and RBC folate and total homocysteine according to laboratory standard procedures. The haematological parameters analyzed were haematocrit, haemoglobin and MCV. For the lipid profile TG, total cholesterol, LDL- and HDLcholesterol were analyzed. Anthropometric measures (BMI, skinfolds [triceps and subscapular], waist girth and waist to hip ratio), functional tests (hand grip, arm and leg strength tests, static balance) and MMSE were obtained or administered by trained personal. The vitamin B 12 supplement of Study II was administered with breakfast and the medication intake was taken from the residents’ anamnesis. Data were analyzed by parametric and non-parametric statistics depending on the obtained data. Comparisons were done using the appropriate ANOVAs or non-parametric tests. Pearsons’ partial correlations with the variable “time” as control were used to define the association of the analyzed parameters. XIII The results showed that: A) Over one year, in relationship to vitamin B status, serum cobalamin decreased, serum folate and mean corpuscular volumen increased significantly and total homocysteine concentrations were stable. Regarding blood lipid profile, triglycerides increased and HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly. Regarding selected anthropometric measurements, waist circumference increased significantly. No significant changes were observed for the rest of parameters. B) Prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia was high in the elderly studied, ranging from 60 % to 90 % over the year depending on the cut-off used for the classification. LDL-cholesterol values were high, especially among women, and showed a tendency to increase over the year. Results of the balance test showed a deficiency and a tendency to decrease; this indicates that the population studied is at high risk for falls. Lower extremity muscular function was deficient and showed a tendency to decrease. A highly significant relationship was observed between the skinfold of the triceps and blood lipid profile. C) Low cobalamin concentrations correlated significantly with low MMSE scores in the elderly studied. No correlations were observed between vitamin B 12 status and functional parameters. D) Regarding vitamin B 12 status, holo-transcobalamin seems to be more sensitive for diagnosis; 5 - 10 % of the elderly had a deficiency using serum cobalamin as a criterion, and 45 - 52 % had a deficiency when using serum holotranscobalamin as a criterion. E) 500 μg of cyanocobalamin administered orally during 28 days significantly improved vitamin B 12 status and significantly decreased total homocysteine concentrations in institutionalized elderly. No effect of the intervention was observed on functional and cognitive parameters. F) The relative change (%) of improvement of vitamin B 12 status was higher when using serum holo-transcobalamin as a criterion than serum cobalamin. G) Antiaenemic drug intake normalized cobalamin, urologic drugs and corticosteroids serum folate, and psychoanaleptics holo-transcobalamin levels. Drugs treating pulmonary obstruction increased total homocysteine concentration significantly. H) The daily mean drug intake was 5. 1. Fiftynine percent of the elderly took medication belonging to 5 or more different ATC groups. The most prevalent were <b>psycholeptic</b> (53 %), antiacid (53 %) and antithrombotic (47 %) drugs...|$|E

40|$|Pharmaceuticals {{have been}} {{detected}} in natural waters for more than forty years, but with improvements in sample preparation procedures and analytical instrumentation, the number of scientific publications on the issue has increased significantly. Even though the concentration of pharmaceutical residues in surface and drinking water is not critical for human health according to the present level of knowledge, the consequences for the environment are not clear. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) {{have been identified as}} the primary route of pharmaceuticals to the environment, with households as the major source point for most of the over-the-counter and prescription drugs. In this thesis, the first aim was to study the occurrence, fate and removal of 43 pharmaceuticals during conventional wastewater treatment. The target compounds were {{selected on the basis of}} their high consumption in Spain or/and frequently reported detection in wastewaters and the possibility to be analyzed under the same experimental conditions. They belong to different therapeutic classes, i. e. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and analgesics, lipid modifying agents, <b>psycholeptic</b> and antiepileptic drugs, beta-blocking agents, beta- 2 -adrenoreceptor agonists, H 2 -receptor antagonists, antibiotics, angiotensin converting enzyme agents, diuretics and antidiabetic drugs. A wide variation in removal efficiencies was observed even for individual compounds, and across therapeutic classes and treatment processes, without clear conclusion on the removal of any particular compound. According to mass balance calculations and estimated partition coefficients, the loss of the selected pharmaceuticals during biological wastewater treatment can be fully attributed to biodegradation/biotransformation. None of the studied compounds was entirely biodegraded and/or transformed during biological wastewater treatment, but the measured concentrations were below the levels of concern according to available toxicity data. Conventional WWTPs cannot be expected to be the only mechanism for controlling the entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment because they were neither designed nor can provide their complete removal. Therefore, the challenge is to look for solutions that would be the most economical and effective means of preventing further pollution of natural waters by pharmaceuticals. More appropriate management of sewage waters before they enter treatment plants as well as a stricter control of effluent discharges, along with an in-depth investigation on the development of new designs and strategies for the improvement of existing wastewater treatments should be considered. In light of this, as the second objective of this thesis, alternative approaches for the removal of the antiepileptic carbamazepine (CBZ) were studied in aqueous media in two laboratory scale experiments: a) biodegradation using white rot fungus T. versicolor in an air-pulsed fluidized bioreactor operated in batch and continuous modes, and b) advanced oxidation using TiO 2 -heterogeneous photocatalysis under simulated solar and UV-A irradiation, and under the combined use of ultrasound and UV-A irradiation (sonophotocatalysis). We selected CBZ as a representative example of compounds that are found to be refractory to biological treatment and ubiquitous in various environmental matrices. Both, the fungal and UVA-driven TiO 2 -photocatalytic treatments, very different in their nature, have been shown to be very effective in degrading carbamazepine in aqueous media. The fungal treatment resulted in average removals of 54 and 96 % in batch and continuous reactor, respectively. Acute toxicity test using the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri showed a decrease in toxicity during the treatment in both types of bioreactor. In the other study, initial CBZ concentrations were reduced for 95 % during 120 min of the UV-driven photocatalytic experiment and sonophotocatalysis, while only 10 % of CBZ was photodegraded during under solar irradiation. A slight increase in toxicity in Daphnia magna acute toxicity testing was observed over the time-course of the photocatalytic experiments, which can be associated with the formation of transformation products of CBZ. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for a tentative identification of the transformation products of CBZ formed during the performed experiments. Most of the tentatively identified intermediates exhibited only slight modifications of the CBZ molecular structure. The fungal as well as the photocatalytic processes yielded oxygenated transformation products. In the biological treatment using T. versicolor, transformation products were formed by enzymatic epoxidation and hydroxylation of seven-membered heterocyclic ring of the carbamazepine molecule. During the photocatalytic experiments, CBZ-related transformation products emerged from hydroxylation and further oxidation of different parts of the molecule of carbamazepine. The generated transformation products appeared to be more persistent than their parent compound, as they were present, although at low concentration, until the end of the experiments. The results of the thesis contribute to a better understanding of a) the magnitude of the selected pharmaceuticals that reach the environment through the wastewater and sludge discharge, b) the efficiency of typical conventional wastewater treatment plants regarding the removal of these compounds from raw wastewater, and c) possible developments of alternative technologies for their enhanced elimination. Desde hace más de cuarenta años se ha detectado la presencia de fármacos en el ciclo de aguas, sobre todo debido a los avances en la química analítica que han permitido el desarrollo de nuevas metodologías analíticas para la determinación de estos compuestos de modo fiable y a bajas concentraciones. Las estaciones depuradoras de aguas residuales (EDARs) han sido identificadas como la ruta principal de entrada de fármacos de origen humano en el medioambiente. Por tanto, el principal objetivo de esta tesis ha sido el estudio de la presencia, destino y eliminación de 43 fármacos seleccionados, durante el tratamiento convencional realizado en las EDARs. Los compuestos estudiados fueron seleccionados en base a los índices de consumo en España, a la frecuencia de detección en aguas residuales y además en base a la posibilidad de ser analizados bajo las mismas condiciones experimentales. Estos compuestos pertenecen a diferentes clases terapéuticas, i. e. antiinflamatorios no esteroideos, los agentes que reducen los lípidos séricos, ansiolíticos y antiepilépticos, los agentes bloqueadores beta-adrenérgicos, agonistas β 2 adrenérgico, antagonistas H 2, antibióticos, inhibidores de la enzima convertidora de angiotensina, diuréticos y antidiabéticos. Para el análisis cuantitativo se utilizó la cromatografía de líquidos acoplada a espectrometría de masas en tándem (LC-MS/MS), empleando un sistema híbrido triple quadrupolo/trampa de iones lineal. Como segundo objetivo hemos considerado evaluar tratamientos avanzados alternativos al tratamiento convencional para la eliminación de un fármaco antiepiléptico, la carbamazepina, uno de los compuestos más recalcitrantes al tratamiento biológico convencional. Se procedió a estudiar su degradación en medio acuoso mediante dos procedimientos a escala laboratorio: a) biodegradación utilizando el hongo ligninolitico Trametes Versicolor en un reactor fluidizado por pulsos de aire operando en modo batch y continuo, y b) oxidación avanzada mediante un tratamiento fotocatalitico en presencia de TiO 2 bajo irradiación UV-A y solar, y aplicando la radiación UV en combinación con ultrasonidos (sonofotocatálisis). Para la evaluación de los tratamientos alternativos, se identificaron los productos de transformación de la carbamazepina, y se evaluó la toxicidad de las muestras tratadas. Se utilizó la LC-MS/MS con analizador de tipo cuadrupolo-tiempo de vuelo. También se evaluó la toxicidad de las muestras tratadas...|$|E

40|$|The {{drug use}} on Curacao was {{evaluated}} {{with the help}} of the prescription forms of twelve community pharmacies at Curacao over a period of three months, The emphasis of the study was on three therapeutic groups: the systemic antibiotics, the <b>psycholeptics</b> and the anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs. Within the group of systemic antibiotics broad-spectrum antibiotics were very frequently prescribed compared with the small-spectrum penicillins. The consumption of <b>psycholeptics,</b> particularly benzodiazepines, on Curacao is remarkably low in comparison with drug utilization data of Denmark and the Netherlands. In contrast, the number of defined daily doses per 1, 000 persons per day of antirheumatic drugs is higher compared with data from these two countries. Within the analysed groups, large differences occur between the two most important kinds of insurance, i. c., the poor people (PP) and social insurance bank (SVB) insurance. The PP-insured patients consume in the case of antibiotics and antirheumatic drugs almost twice as many and in the case of <b>psycholeptics</b> even five times as many as the SVB-insured patients do. A few calculations of prices prove that the extra amount of drugs consumed by PP-insured has important financial consequences...|$|R
