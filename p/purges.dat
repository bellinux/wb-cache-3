5|$|Molotov's {{position}} {{became increasingly}} tenuous after February 1956, when Khrushchev launched an unexpected denunciation of Stalin at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party. Khrushchev attacked Stalin both over the <b>purges</b> of the 1930s and the defeats {{of the early}} years of World War II, which he blamed on Stalin's overly trusting attitude towards Hitler and his <b>purges</b> of the Red Army command structure. As Molotov was the most senior of Stalin's collaborators still in government and had played {{a leading role in the}} <b>purges,</b> it became evident that Khrushchev's examination of the past would probably result in Molotov's fall from power, and he became the leader of an old guard faction that sought to overthrow Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|Set against this, the <b>purges</b> of the Red Army leadership, {{in which}} Molotov participated, {{weakened}} the Soviet Union's defence capacity {{and contributed to}} the military disasters of 1941 and 1942, which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war. The <b>purges</b> also led to the dismantling of privatised agriculture and its replacement by collectivised agriculture. This left a legacy of chronic agricultural inefficiencies and under-production which the Soviet regime never fully rectified.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of <b>purges</b> that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the <b>purges</b> within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>purging</b> a {{horizontal}} closed end side-branch {{in a natural}} gas pipeline is considered in this paper. Experimental results obtained in a scale model are presented, where air and CO 2 were used to simulate air and natural gas in the field. The {{rate at which the}} side-branch is <b>purged</b> is evaluated as a function of <b>purge</b> velocity and side-branch length. Various <b>purging</b> strategies are also examined, for example allowing the <b>purge</b> velocity passing the side-branch to vary with time in a cyclic manner. Data are presented which show that improved <b>purging</b> rates are obtained at lower <b>purging</b> velocities, rather than at higher <b>purging</b> velocities as intuition would suggest. It is also shown that <b>purge</b> gas savings in excess of 90 % can be achieved by selecting the correct <b>purging</b> strategy. Application of these methods to operational procedures should generate significant financial savings and reduced atmospheric pollution. ...|$|R

Molotov was one of few with whom Stalin openly discussed the <b>purges.</b> Although Molotov and Stalin signed a public decree in 1938 that disassociated them from the ongoing Great Purge, in private, and even after Stalin's death, Molotov supported the Great Purge and the executions carried out by his government.|$|E

40|$|<b>Purge</b> {{operation}} {{is an effective}} way to remove the accumulated liquid water in the anode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This paper studies the phenomenon of the two-phase now as well as the pressure drop fluctuation inside the flow field of a single cell during the <b>purge</b> process. The flow patterns are identified as intermittent <b>purge</b> and annular <b>purge,</b> and the two <b>purge</b> processes are contrastively analyzed and discussed. The intermittent <b>purge</b> greatly affects the fuel cell performance and thus it is not suitable for the in situ application. The annular <b>purge</b> process requires a higher pressure drop, and the critical pressure drop is calculated from the annular <b>purge</b> model. Furthermore, this value is quantitatively analyzed and validated by experiments. The results show that the annular <b>purge</b> is appropriate for removing liquid water out of the anode in the fuel cell. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} in 1894 {{in the village of}} Kalinovka, which is close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was {{employed}} as a metal worker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. With the help of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported Joseph Stalin's <b>purges,</b> and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern Ukraine, and he continued the <b>purges</b> there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War (Eastern Front of World War II), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.|$|E

5|$|After the prewar Communist Party of Poland was {{eliminated}} in Stalin's <b>purges</b> in 1938 (some five thousand Polish communists {{were brought to}} Russia and killed), a group of survivors, led by Marceli Nowotko, Bolesław Mołojec and Paweł Finder, convinced in 1941 the Soviets in Moscow {{of the need to}} reestablish a Polish party. The conspiratorial core of the new Polish Workers' Party was assembled in Warsaw in January 1942, and after the deaths or arrests of the above leaders there, Władysław Gomułka emerged as the PPR's First Secretary by the end of 1943. Gomułka was a dedicated communist in the national tradition of the Polish leftist movement, who loathed the Soviet practices he experienced while being trained in Russia and Ukraine in the 1930s, but was convinced of the historic necessity of alliance with the Soviet Union. He may have survived the <b>purges</b> because of being imprisoned in Poland for illegal labor-organizing activities in 1938–39. Throughout the German occupation, Gomułka remained in Poland and was {{not a part of the}} Moscow-reared Stalin's Polish circle. In Polish society of 1945, Gomułka's party was marginally small in comparison to other political groups.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{experiments}} on the 1 : 20 Hong Kong model diffuser, a numerical model for simulating seawater intrusion and <b>purging</b> process in an invertconnected outfall is developed. An {{extension of the}} theory of Guo and Sharp (1996), this is essentially a one dimensional unsteady flow model with locally 2 D techniques to account for stratification and density changes at riser-tunnel junctions. Numerical predictions of <b>purging</b> flow and times are in good agreement with measurements; key features of the <b>purging</b> sequence are also well-supported by the synoptic observed riser flows. Both experiments and calculations demonstrate that, unlike a soffit-connected outfall, the seawater {{at the bottom of the}} tunnel is initially <b>purged,</b> and the mixing between effluent and seawater is much stronger. The <b>purging</b> sequence in invert-connected situation is usually from seaward end to landward end for unsteady and quasi-steady purging; however for steady <b>purging</b> the sequence is from landward end to seaward end as in soffit-connected outfalls. The presence of an effluent layer at the top of the tunnel (due to e. g. pump shutdown) results in a persistent circulation in the system. The numerical model also shows that shortening the outfall tunnel length by an artificial bend has an effect on the <b>purging</b> sequence and time, but not the <b>purging</b> flow. Two-layer <b>purging</b> occurs in steady <b>purging</b> process and can help reduce <b>purging</b> discharge rate, especially with a large number of risers. Salt-assisted <b>purging</b> is effective only if the duration of the process is sufficiently long; however, the effluent volume required can be larger than that in the pure effluent <b>purging</b> process. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Presented is a {{nonlinear}} {{model of}} a, lean NOx trap with applications to diagnostics {{and to a}} lean burn engine control strategy for <b>purging</b> NO x from a trap. A lean NOx trap <b>purging</b> strategy is proposed based on a fundamental understanding of trap behavior and {{a model of the}} propagating transient reductant front through the trap during <b>purge.</b> ^ <b>Purging</b> a lean NOx trap of NOx emissions is challenging for several reasons. First, the engine air/fuel ratio must be controlled such that lean and rich operation are possible. Secondly, spark ignition engine torque changes with air/fuel ratio. Therefore, engine torque control is necessary for lean burn applications. Thirdly, the engine a. ir/fuel ratio <b>purge</b> profile, which determines the rich exhaust gas profile used to <b>purge</b> the lean NO x trap, must accomplish two goals. The profile must be designed such that the fuel economy penalty, during <b>purge,</b> is minimized to ensure the overall fuel economy during both lean and rich operation is maximized. In addition, the <b>purge</b> profile must send reductant to reduce NOx and oxygen stored in the trap without excessive tailpipe emissions. The focus of this work is the development of a lean NOx trap model to be used in conjunction with a model based <b>purge</b> profile which meets the aforementioned goals. ^ The <b>purge</b> profile proposed in this work is based on the development of a nonlinear lean NOx trap <b>purge</b> model. The model includes critical <b>purging</b> phenomena such as NOx storage and release dynamics, NO x and oxygen reduction dynamics, and includes an on-line stored oxygen estimate. A first principle based chemical model describing the reduction of NOx during <b>purge</b> forms the fundamental lean NOx trap <b>purge</b> model. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are considered the most effective reductants and a method of estimating exhaust gas hydrogen content downstream of a catalyst is presented. Validation of the NOx <b>purge</b> model is achieved through engine dynamometer experiments. ...|$|R
