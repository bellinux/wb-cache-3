The impact of mechanisation on the fishery causing heavy damage to the brooders with eggs/embryo, was critically analysed and suggestions and measures enumerated.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{mechanism}} that relates asset {{returns to the}} firm s optimal listing choice. The crucial element in our framework is not {{a difference in the}} structure or rules of the alternative markets, but a difference in the return patterns of the securities that are traded on these markets. We use a simple trading model with asymmetric information to show that a stock would be more liquid when it is listed on a market with similar securities, or securities with correlated payoff patterns. We empirically examine the implications of our model using NYSE and Nasdaq securities, and document that the return <b>patterns</b> of <b>stocks</b> listed on the NYSE indeed look different from the return <b>patterns</b> of Nasdaq <b>stocks.</b> Stocks that are eligible to list on another market but do not switch have return patterns that are similar to other securities on their own market and different from securities listed on the other market. We show that the return <b>patterns</b> of <b>stocks</b> that switch markets change in the two years prior to the move in the direction of being more similar to the stocks on the new market. Our results are consistent with the notion that managers choose the market on which to list to maximize the liquidity of their stocks. ...|$|R

They were intended for use by second-echelon and noncombatant troops. Very few M38 carbines were made in 1945 and are highly sought after by collectors. Essentially a M1891/30 with a shortened barrel and shortened stock (the M38 is 1000 millimeters (40 in) in overall length versus 1230 millimeters (48 in) overall length for the Model 91/30), this carbine did not accept a bayonet and was in fact designed so that the standard Model 91/30 bayonet would not fit it.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether risk seeking or non-concave utility functions {{can help to}} explain the cross-sectional <b>pattern</b> 0 of <b>stock</b> returns. For this purpose, we analyze the stochastic dominance efficiency classification of the value-weighted market portfolio relative to benchmark portfolios based on market capitalization, book-to-market equity ratio and momentum. We use various existing and novel stochastic dominance criteria that account {{for the possibility that}} investors exhibit local risk seeking behavior. Our results suggest that Markowitz type utility functions, with risk aversion for losses and risk seeking for gains, can capture the cross-sectional <b>pattern</b> of <b>stock</b> returns. The low average yield on big caps, growth stocks and past losers may reflect investors' twin desire for downside protection in bear markets and upside potential in bull markets. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} stock data {{analysis}} {{has been widely}} researched by stock analysts interested in detecting <b>patterns</b> in <b>stocks.</b> Resulting algorithms have dealt with many representations of stock data depending on the problem, many dealing with complex cases where <b>patterns</b> in <b>stock</b> data need to be matched despite differences in scale, translation, or noisiness. However, specific instances arise where such generality is not needed. For example, analysts {{may be interested in}} compiling historical price data from different sources. In this case the correspondence between subsequences in two datasets is not known, but is desired to allow analysts to have accurate stock prices. This problem may be subject to noise, but is not subject to scaling or translation, allowing for a much simpler matching algorithm that can be made to run rapidly to allow for user interaction. This paper presents a visual interface that allows the user to solve such matching problems by iteratively making queries, viewing results, and changing parameters or matching algorithms. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{much has}} been {{discussed}} {{about the relationship between}} ownership and financial performance of banks in emerging markets, literature about cross-ownership differences in credit market behaviour of banks in emerging economies is sparse. Using a portfolio choice model and bank-level data from India for 9 years (1995 - 96 to 2003 - 04), we examine banks' behaviour in the context of credit markets of an emerging market economy. Our results indicate that, in India, the data for the domestic banks fit well the aforementioned portfolio-choice model, especially for private banks, but the model cannot explain the behaviour of foreign banks. In general, allocation of assets between risk-free government securities and risky credit is affected by past allocation <b>patterns,</b> <b>stock</b> exchange listing (for private banks), risk averseness of banks, regulations regarding treatment of NPA, and ability of banks to recover doubtful credit. It is also evident that banks deal with changing levels of systematic risk by altering the ratio of securitized to non-securitized credit. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{finds that}} trading volume is a {{significant}} determinant of the lead-lag <b>patterns</b> observed in <b>stock</b> returns. Daily and weekly returns on high volume portfolios lead returns on low volume portfolios, controlling for firm size. Nonsynchronous trading or low volume portfolio autocorrelations cannot explain these findings. These patterns arise because returns on low volume portfolios respond more slowly to information in market returns. The speed of adjustment of individual stocks confirms these findings. Overall, {{the results indicate that}} differential speed of adjustment to information {{is a significant}} source of the cross-autocorrelation <b>patterns</b> in short-horizon <b>stock</b> returns. BOTH ACADEMICS AND PRACTITIONERS HAVE LONG BEEN interested in the role played by trading volume in predicting future stock returns. 1 In this paper, we examine the interaction between trading volume and the predictability of short horizon stock returns, specifically that due to lead-lag cross-autocorrelations in stock returns.

40|$|We tested {{whether the}} {{abundance}} of C(4) vegetation in grasslands of the Mongolian plateau is influenced by grazing conditions. The analysis exploited the politically originated contrast that exists between Mongolia (low stocking rate, transhumant system) {{and the district of}} Inner Mongolia, China (high stocking rate, sedentary system). We estimated the proportion of C(4) carbon (P(C 4)) in grazed vegetation from the relative carbon isotope ratio (δ(13) C) of sheep wool sampled from 298 annual shearings originating from 1996 to 2007. Annual stocking rates varying over time and between the districts of both countries were taken from regional statistics. The P(C 4) pattern within the 0. 7 million km(2) sampling area was geostatistically analyzed and related to stocking rates and temperature gradients. For similar climatic conditions, P(C 4) was the same in both countries. Further, a unique relationship was found between P(C 4) and July temperature {{on both sides of the}} border, which explained 71 % of the <b>pattern.</b> <b>Stocking</b> rate and grazing system had no significant influences on present-day C(3) /C(4) abundance ratio.

40|$|The general {{techniques}} of pattern analysis {{can be seen}} in numerous interesting applications, such as hurricane modeling, biometrics, understanding of brain wave <b>patterns,</b> <b>stock</b> market trend modeling, landscape ecology, etc. As the technology of digital imaging grows exponentially, the task of organizing and analyzing high-dimensional data becomes increasingly more important, yet difficult. The understanding of patterns in high-dimensional data sets is proven to be a key ingredient to knowledge discovery. The analysis of massive data sets involves a myriad of theoretical, algorithmic, and computational challenges from which has emerged a new field of applied mathematics. For example, some common techniques used in general pattern recognition problems include clustering, neural networks, subspace methods, and multiresolution analysis, which are disciplines of various fields of pure and applied mathematics that are not usually taught in the traditional graduate courses. The analysis of patterns in data has typically been a subject in statistics and engineering.

40|$|Our {{analysis}} of financial data, {{in terms of}} super-exponential growth, suggests that the seed of the 2002 / 03 crisis of the Dutch supermarket giant AHOLD was planted in 1996. It became quite visible in 1999 when the post-bubble destabilization regime was well-developed and acted as the precursor of an inevitable collapse fueled by raising expectations of investors to maintain strong herding pressures. We have adapted Weidlich’s theory of opinion formation to describe the formation of buy or sell decisions among investors, based on a competition between the mechanisms of herding and of personal opinion opposing the herd. Among four typical <b>patterns</b> of <b>stock</b> price evolution, we have identified a “critical zone ” in the model characterized by a strong sensitivity of the price trajectory on the herding and personal inclination parameters. The critical zone describes the maturation of a systemic instability forewarning of an inevitable crash. Classification and recognition of the spontaneous emergence of <b>patterns</b> of <b>stock</b> market evolution based on Weidlich’s theory of complex systems, and in particular our discovery of the post-bubble destabilization regime which acts as a precursor to a subsequent crash or antibubble, not only presents the possibility of developing early warning signals but also suggests to top management {{ways of dealing with}} the coming crisis. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{highlight}} important {{consequences of}} the choice of deflator for conclusions regarding apparent <b>patterns</b> in <b>stock</b> returns. In particular, {{we focus on the}} use of share price as a deflator. Previous research has documented that there are <b>patterns</b> in <b>stock</b> returns related to the magnitude of share price, and consequently this relation has the potential to confound inferences about information variables that are scaled by share price. We show analytically the potentially misleading effects of using share price as a deflator in abnormal returns tests and identify several studies in the literature that have deflated candidate anomaly variables by price. We then select one previous finding-evidence of abnormal returns to a strategy based on share-price-scaled analysts' forecasts-as an exemplar of the problem. Taken as a whole, our findings indicate that after controlling for the systematic negative relation between share price and subsequent abnormal return there is no apparent mis-weighting by investors of the information in analysts' earnings forecasts or abnormal returns to an investment strategy based on analysts' forecasts. These findings suggest that caution is warranted in the selection of deflators in anomaly studies and in the interpretation of findings of abnormal returns to share-price-scaled information variables.

40|$|Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we {{document}} that, {{controlling for}} observable characteristics, household investors' likelihood of entering {{the stock market}} {{within the next five}} years is about 30 percent higher if their parents or children had entered the stock market during the previous five years. Because even family members who live far away from each other tend to communicate frequently, despite the fact that interactions among people living close geographically have declined with the rise of alternative social channels, we argue that these findings highlight the significance of information sharing regarding household financial decisions. In addition, focusing on the sequential <b>patterns</b> of <b>stock</b> market entry, we explicitly take into account the time needed for information to be shared and disseminated among family members. Our finding that one member's entry positively influences future entries of other family members at distinct stages of the life cycle allows us to largely rule out the hypothesis that the observed correlations in stock market entries are primarily caused by common preferences shared by family members. Furthermore, because we do not find similar sequential <b>patterns</b> in <b>stock</b> market exits, our results do not support the hypothesis of herding behavior.
