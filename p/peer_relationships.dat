5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in <b>peer</b> <b>relationships.</b> In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor <b>peer</b> <b>relationships.</b>|$|E

40|$|Post-traumatic Stress (PTS) symptomology {{includes}} ruminating {{thoughts and}} feelings around trauma, inability to feel and express emotions, and avoidance of things related to the traumatic event (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Children and youth exposed to child maltreatment (abuse and neglect) are at higher risk of experiencing PTS. Extra-familial support, including peer support can reduce post-traumatic stress among youth (Pina et al., 2008). In the present study, Witnessing, Victimization, and Both Witnessing and Victimization due to Exposure to In-Home Violence and <b>Peer</b> <b>Relationship</b> Quality are evaluated as to their relative impact on PTS for children at risk for child maltreatment. <b>Peer</b> <b>Relationship</b> Quality is also tested as a moderator {{of the effects of}} violence exposures on PTS. Data come from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being II (NSCAW II). Three waves of assessment were obtained starting in 2008 at 18 month intervals. A subsample of 2, 151 children (2, 071 children with non-missing values on the predictor, outcome and moderator variables) who were between the ages of 8 and 17 at any of the 3 waves was used. ^ A three process latent linear growth model was estimated to assess PTS, <b>Peer</b> <b>Relationship</b> Quality and Exposure to In-Home Violence. Each of three Exposure to In- Home Violence constructs were assessed separately. Findings suggest that the average PTS at baseline was about 9. 18 points (on a 32 point scale) and PTS declines by about 0. 58 points every year on average. Additionally, baseline <b>Peer</b> <b>Relationship</b> Quality was predictive of baseline PTS with higher scores on <b>Peer</b> <b>Relationship</b> Quality associated with lower PTS at baseline. Moreover higher <b>Peer</b> <b>Relationship</b> Quality over time was associated with declines in PTS over time. The baseline effect of Exposure to In-Home Violence was positively associated with baseline PTS. So more Exposure to In-Home Violence was related to more post-traumatic stress. Change in witnessing violence at home over time and change in both witnessing and victimization over time were strongly positively associated with change in PTS over time. <b>Peer</b> <b>Relationship</b> Quality did not moderate the association between baseline Exposure to In-home Violence and PTS levels at baseline nor between baseline Exposure to In-Home Violence and change in PTS over time. ^ These findings suggest several possible avenues for intervention for clinicians and help understand the dynamic associations between Exposure to In-Home Violence, <b>Peer</b> <b>Relationship</b> Quality and PTS in the population of children at risk for maltreatment. ...|$|R

Methods – The participants were inexperienced adolescents (n = 1107) in the age of 9 to 18 years (M = 13. 50, SD = 1. 25) who answered the sexual intention question. Online questionnaires were completed including the Network of Relationship Inventory (NRI) and one item for the sexual intention. Results – The results showed no significant relation between the quality of parentchild relationship and the sexual intention. Also, no significant relation was found between the quality of <b>peer</b> <b>relationship</b> and the sexual intention. No gender differences were found in the relation between the quality of parent-child relationship and the quality of <b>peer</b> <b>relationship</b> on the one hand and the sexual intention on the other hand.

40|$|Adopting a {{combination}} of expectancy-value and achievement goal theories, {{this study examined the}} role of self-efficacy, task value, and achievement goals in students' learning strategies, task disengagement, <b>peer</b> <b>relationship,</b> and English achievement outcome. A sample of 1475 Year- 9 students participated in the study. A structural equation model showed that while task value predicted only mastery goals, self-efficacy predicted each of the three types of achievement goal. Mastery and performance-approach goals were both positive predictors of deep learning and <b>peer</b> <b>relationship.</b> Mastery goals were also negatively associated with task disengagement and positively associated with surface learning. In contrast, performance-avoidance goals were a positive predictor of surface learning and task disengagement but a negative predictor of <b>peer</b> <b>relationship.</b> On the whole, these findings suggest that, like mastery goals, performance-approach goals can generate adaptive outcomes. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

25|$|The {{frequency}} of physical aggression in humans peaks at around 2–3 years of age. It then declines gradually on average. These observations suggest that physical aggression {{is not only}} a learned behavior but that development provides opportunities for the learning and biological development of self-regulation. However, a small subset of children fail to acquire all the necessary self-regulatory abilities and tend to show atypical levels of physical aggression across development. These may be at risk for later violent behavior or, conversely, lack of aggression that may be considered necessary within society. Some findings suggest that early aggression does not necessarily lead to aggression later on, however, although the course through early childhood is an important predictor of outcomes in middle childhood. In addition, physical aggression that continues is likely occurring in the context of family adversity, including socioeconomic factors. Moreover, 'opposition' and 'status violations' in childhood appear to be more strongly linked to social problems in adulthood than simply aggressive antisocial behavior. Social learning through interactions in early childhood has been seen as a building block for levels of aggression which {{play a crucial role in}} the development of <b>peer</b> <b>relationships</b> in middle childhood. Overall, an interplay of biological, social and environmental factors can be considered.|$|E

These study had been conducted with 579 adolescents (11 to 14 years old) as described by the Quick Big Five Personality Questionnaire (Vermulst & Gerris, 2005), Sibling Relationship Questionnaire (Buhrmester & Furman, 1990) and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Nada-Raja, McGee & Stanton, 1992). Results showed a significant effect of agreeableness on warmth in the sibling relationship. Furthermore, there is a significant effect of conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness to experience on conflict in the sibling relationship. Finally, there is a significant effect of extraversion and agreeableness on peer attachment. Findings highlight the importance of identifying the complex ways in which varying dimensions of personality traits influence specific aspects of the sibling <b>relationship</b> and <b>peer</b> <b>relationship.</b> Implications of these results are discussed, as well as suggestions for follow-up studies.

The APSAC Taskforce (2006) gives examples of such lists ranging across multiple domains from some elements within the DSM-IV criteria to entirely non-specific behavior such as developmental lags, destructive behaviors, refusal to make eye contact, cruelty to animals and siblings, lack of cause and effect thinking, preoccupation with fire, blood and gore, poor <b>peer</b> <b>relationships,</b> stealing, lying, lack of a conscience, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, poor impulse control, abnormal speech patterns, fighting for control over everything, and hoarding or gorging on food. Some checklists suggest that among infants, [...] "prefers dad to mom" [...] or [...] "wants to hold the bottle as soon as possible" [...] are indicative of attachment problems.
