5000|$|Interpersonal space {{refers to}} the {{psychological}} [...] "bubble" [...] that we can imagine exists when someone is standing far too close to us. Research has revealed that in North America there are four different zones of interpersonal space. The first zone is called intimate distance and ranges from touching to about eighteen inches apart. Intimate distance is the space around us that we reserve for lovers, children, as well as close family members and friends. The second zone is called <b>personal</b> <b>distance</b> and begins about an arm's length away; starting around eighteen inches from our person and ending about four feet away. We use <b>personal</b> <b>distance</b> in conversations with friends, to chat with associates, and in group discussions. The third zone of interpersonal space is called social distance and is the area that ranges from four to eight feet away from you. Social distance is reserved for strangers, newly formed groups, and new acquaintances. The fourth identified zone of space is public distance and includes anything more than eight feet away from you. This zone is used for speeches, lectures, and theater; essentially, public distance is that range reserved for larger audiences.|$|E

50|$|Proxemics is {{the study}} of the cultural, behavioral, and sociological aspects of spatial {{distances}} between individuals. Every person has a particular space that they keep to themselves when communicating, like a personal bubble. When used as a type of nonverbal signal in communication, proxemics helps to determine the space between individuals while they interact.There are four types of proxemics with different distances depending on the situation and people involved. Intimate distance is used for close encounters like embracing, touching, or whispering. <b>Personal</b> <b>distance</b> is for interactions with close friends and family members. Social distance is for interactions among acquaintances. It is mostly used in workplace or school settings where there is no physical contact. Public distance is for strangers or public speaking.|$|E
5000|$|According to Edward T. Hall, {{the amount}} of space we {{maintain}} between ourselves and the persons with whom we are communicating shows {{the importance of the}} science of proxemics. In this process, it is seen how we feel towards the others at that particular time. Within American culture Hall defines four primary distance zones: (i) intimate (touching to eighteen inches) distance, (ii) personal (eighteen inches to four feet) distance, (iii) social (four to twelve feet) distance, and (iv) public (more than twelve feet) distance. Intimate distance is considered appropriate for familiar relationships and indicates closeness and trust. <b>Personal</b> <b>distance</b> is still close but keeps another [...] "at arm's length" [...] the most comfortable distance for most of our interpersonal contact, social distance is used for the kind of communication that occurs in business relationships and, sometimes, in the classroom. Public distance occurs in situations where two-way communication is not desirable or possible.|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{the third}} effect, <b>personal</b> <b>distance</b> obstructs {{collaborator}} selection, complicates the process, and hampers collaborations’ output. Considering collaborator selection, {{in the absence}} of personal proximity people are less likely to seek out one another for collaborations (Casciaro and Lobo 2008; Yuan et al. 2014). They do not sufficiently trust each other as they lack the background information and experience of working with the potential partner or simply do not like the potential partner. As a consequence, they are not willing to take the risk to embark on an inherently risky research project with them. Should it, however, come to the formation of collaborative tie despite <b>personal</b> <b>distance,</b> the collaboration process is complicated. The lack of sympathy associated with <b>personal</b> <b>distance</b> may cause partners to refrain from leveraging the relevant knowledge residing in their networks (Yuan et al. 2014) as well as from sharing the knowledge necessary to complete the collaborative work. Consequently, this would also hamper the collaboration’s output.|$|E

Dispositional empathy was assessed by questionnaire in a separate session. Older children placed vignette characters closer to themselves when they reported greater responsive empathy with them.
