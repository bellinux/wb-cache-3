25|$|Power {{lost the}} congressional election, and his trial against Morrison began on Dec. 3, 1924. State Rep. George Lommen {{was the first}} to take the witness stand on Power’s behalf. Morrison had {{attacked}} Lommen in the past, accusing him of collecting bribes from the operators of slot machines, as well as declaring that he was such a flip-flopping “political chameleon,” he would <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> a Communist.|$|E
25|$|Accompanied by {{her husband}} Albert (Luigi Pistilli), Renata visits the house of Paolo Fassati (Leopoldo Trieste), an {{entomologist}} who lives {{on the grounds of}} Donati's estate. Fassati's wife Anna (Laura Betti) tells them that Donati was responsible for the Countess's death, and says that Simon will <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with the property. Renata, who had no idea she had a half-brother, swiftly dispenses with any notion of sibling affection and immediately begins making plans with her husband to murder Simon, who at the same time is orchestrating Renata's demise.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few drug therapies that are {{possible}} for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet). Since there is no cure for it, the patient will <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> having to have surgery done to relieve some of the symptoms. When a patient has this procedure done, they are most likely going to receive a deep brain stimulation. So it will keep the brain stimulated even though the disease tries to disable it. Recently a study was performed to test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery. This shows that surgery does improve a patients speech perception, even though it might not cure their disease.|$|E

The water in the forest <b>probably</b> <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> in nearby streams, such as Hurricane Creek. [...] These streams empty into the Stones River's J. Percy Priest Lake impoundment, which is located just a few miles to the west.|$|R
500|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Donnchadh ever regained his territory; after Hugh was formally restored to the Earldom of Ulster in 1227, Donnchadh's land was probably controlled by the Bisset family. Historian Séan Duffy argues that the Bissets (later known as the [...] "Bissets of the Glens") helped Hugh de Lacy, and <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with Donnchadh's territory as a reward.|$|R
50|$|Since the 10th century, {{the church}} holds {{a shrine to}} Saint Alban. The remains of Saint Alban <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in the church after the Dissolution of the Monasteries by King Henry VIII of England in the 16th century. In 2002, a collar bone, one of the relics in the shrine, was moved to St Albans Cathedral in St Albans, England, {{and placed in the}} shrine to Saint Alban there.|$|R
2500|$|In France, Marianne {{magazine}} stated Western {{critics of}} the case might not be satisfied if the Kabul court avoided the death sentence for Abdul Rahman by declaring him insane and unfit for trial.

2500|$|Khan {{took part}} in the 10 m Air rifle {{individual}} event in the 2002 Commonwealth Games at the age of 15. [...] He performed well and found himself fifth before the last shot. At that moment he thought a good shot could earn him a fourth-place finish. [...] He said,"..if I could make a good I would <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> fourth. The bronze was a possibility but slightly unlike". His final shot scored 9.9, with a total of 691.9, and he won the gold medal.|$|E
2500|$|A new song, [...] "City Hall", {{appeared}} in a setlist, and the band entered the studio in January 2009. On his online diary, Roddy Woomble noted that he had: [...] "been trying to work on lyrics for the new Idlewild record. At the moment it has {{the possibility of being}} about anything, so I've been trying to narrow that down a bit. I've been re-reading Jack Kerouac's novels and following this US election, and keeping up with all the new US groups, so maybe it'll take on a Stars and stripes theme. It'll <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being about mountains and Islands though." ...|$|E
50|$|Locomotive number 99 192 was retired on 5 May 1959. Number 99 193 was retired on 30 November 1967 and was {{transferred}} into {{the ownership of}} EUROVAPOR, where it is used on the Blonay-Chamby museum railway in Switzerland. It was still there in 2007. There are various accounts of the whereabouts of 99 194. It <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in Yugoslavia after the Second World War and was in service there until the late 1960s with the Yugoslav Railways (JŽ).|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the crew}} of the station discovers that a number of warheads have been stolen from the station and have <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in the {{possession}} of the Maquis, a faction that has been attacking the Cardassians. Major Kira (Nana Visitor) looks into the station's records and finds that the transfer of the warheads was made by Chief O'Brien. She plays a security log containing O'Brien's voice, and in it he clearly requests access to the warheads. This evidence will be used by the Cardassians to demonstrate his guilt before his execution.|$|R

What gold there was returned to Richmond Banks by 1910, although some has never been accounted for. The unrecovered gold <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in a Bank in Charleston, SC with a mysterious Rhett Butler figure who was treasurer of the Confederacy and who became inexplainably rich after the Civil War running a bank in Charleston.|$|R
2500|$|Joe Pesci didn't judge his {{character}} but found {{the scene where}} he kills Spider for talking back to {{his character}} hard to do, because he had trouble justifying the action until {{he forced himself to}} feel the way Tommy did. Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because it was such a male-dominated cast, and she realized if she did not make her [...] "work important, it would <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> on the cutting room floor". When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film's release, Weitz {{suggested}} that an extended {{cut of the}} film could be released on DVD, saying [...] "I'd really love to do a fuller cut of the film"; he further speculated that such a version [...] "could <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> at {{two and a half}} hours." [...] This proposed cut would presumably not include the original ending: MTV reported in December 2007 that Weitz hoped to include that material {{at the beginning of a}} possible The Subtle Knife adaptation, and that a Compass Director's Cut might feature [...] "a moment" [...] of it as a [...] "teaser". Cast members Craig and Green have echoed this hope for such a DVD ...|$|E
2500|$|He had a minor {{knee injury}} during {{the end of}} the 2008 season, which led to {{corrective}} surgery. This slowed his Combine numbers; however, he improved upon them during MSU's Pro Days. He was one of three Spartans invited to the NFL combine. ESPN.com ranked him the 8th best running back in the draft. He was a projected third rounder in the 2009 NFL Draft. Another site lists him as a mid-second round draft choice. Ringer has drawn comparisons to NFL players Mike Hart and Chester Taylor. His performance at the MSU Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. NFL Analyst Mel Kiper Jr. said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." ...|$|E
5000|$|Based on simulations, NASA space {{scientists}} John Chambers and Jack Lissauer {{have proposed}} {{the existence of}} a planet between Mars and the asteroid belt, going in a successively eccentric and unstable orbit, 4 billion years ago. They connect this planet, which they name Planet V, and its disappearance with the Late Heavy Bombardment episode of the Hadean era. Chambers and Lissauer also claim this Planet V most <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> crashing into the Sun. Unlike the Disruption Theory's fifth planet, [...] "Planet V" [...] is not credited with creating the asteroid belt.|$|R

2500|$|Ringer was one {{of three}} MSU players to be invited to the NFL combine, along with QB Brian Hoyer and safety Otis Wiley. Ringer took part in Michigan State's 2009 NFL Pro Day at the Duffy Daugherty indoor facility. Ringer's shuttle time was 3.89, which was faster than the fastest time at the NFL combine. Ringer said of the workout, [...] "I think I did pretty well, {{especially}} coming back from my knee injury. I'm still not 100 percent, probably around 85 or 90. This is basically another big stepping stone from what I did at the combine. Now that I was able to do some training, I felt like my change of direction was superb. I feel like I did really well in the shuttle and in the three-cone drill." [...] He participated in an MSU-sponsored podcast after the event discussing the event. Ringer improved his forty time from a 4.59 at the combine to a 4.42 during Pro Days. When asked about where he wants to get drafted, Ringer responded, [...] "I'll go anywhere. To get picked up somewhere will be a blessing." [...] Ringer's performance at Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. With his draft stock on the rise, Ringer has worked out with several NFL teams, including the Denver Broncos, the Tennessee Titans and the San Diego Chargers. He has also drawn interest from the Seattle Seahawks. He has since received workouts from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Buffalo Bills, and the New York Jets. A website that predicts him as a 3rd to 4th rounder also compares him to Priest Holmes. Ringer stated about his knee right before the draft, [...] "My leg feels fine. Right now, I'll give it between 90-95%." [...] One site calls Ringer a [...] "willing, if undersized, workhorse", but also questions his durability. When talking about draft day, Ringer responded [...] "I'm not nervous at all. I'm just kind of really mellow, calm ... knowing that whatever happens is going to happen, and whatever team I go to, that's the team where I'm meant to be." [...] Mel Kiper said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." [...] Ringer spent time with his family in Dayton, Ohio, on April 25 watching the draft and celebrating his mother's birthday, waiting to get selected.|$|E

50|$|The interior, {{including}} the iconostasis, furniture and painting, was completely redone. Fragments of 17th-century painting that depicted Ruset, Duca {{and their families}} were saved; for a time, they were kept in the Old Metropolitan Cathedral, then in the Gothic hall of Trei Ierarhi before <b>probably</b> <b>ending</b> <b>up</b> in a museum. The new painting was done by three French artists in a neo-Byzantine style that deviates from the previous iconographic layout. Notable are the idealized portrait of the first founder, Stephen and the second, King Carol I of Romania. The latter is shown with his queen, Elisabeth of Wied; Crown Prince Ferdinand and his wife Marie; and the three children the couple had at the time: Carol, Elisabeth and Mărioara. The symbolic significance of the paintings is underscored {{by the presence of}} traditional Romanian costume in the allegorical figures surrounding the king and in the children.|$|R
