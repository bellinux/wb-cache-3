The fluid in volume elements approach plug flow as they move though the tubes of the reactor. Turbulent flow is promoted through wire mesh inserts in the tube. The tubular reactor does not require moving mechanical parts and is inexpensive to build. However, the reactor can become impractically long if the particles aggregate slowly.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} {{that does not}} involve farming spiders is to extract the spider silk gene and use other organisms to produce the spider silk. Working under the trademark BioSteel, in 2000 Canadian biotechnology company Nexia successfully produced spider silk protein in transgenic goats that carried the gene for it; the milk produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the protein, 1–2grams of silk proteins per litre of milk. Attempts to spin the protein into a fibre similar to natural spider silk resulted in fibres with tenacities of 2–3grams per denier. Nexia used wet spinning and squeezed the silk <b>protein</b> <b>solution</b> through small extrusion holes in order to simulate {{the behavior of the}} spinneret, but this procedure has so far not been sufficient to replicate the properties of native spider silk.|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence {{correlation}} spectroscopy (FCS) {{was used to}} measure the translational diffusion of labeled apomyoglobin (tracer) in concentrated solutions of ribonuclease A and human serum albumin (crowders), as a quantitative model system of protein diffusive motions in crowded physiological environments. The ratio of the diffusion coefficient of the tracer protein in the <b>protein</b> crowded <b>solutions</b> and its diffusion coefficient in aqueous solution has been interpreted in terms of local apparent viscosities, a molecular parameter characteristic for each tracer-crowder system. In all <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> studied in this work, local translational viscosity values were larger than the solution bulk viscosity, and larger than rotational viscosities estimated for apomyoglobin in the same crowding solutions. Here we propose a method to estimate local apparent viscosities for the tracer translational and rotational diffusion directly from the bulk viscosity of the concentrated <b>protein</b> <b>solutions.</b> As a result of this study, the identification of protein species and the study of hydrodynamic changes and interactions in model crowded <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> by means of FCS and time-resolved fluorescence depolarization techniques may be expected to be greatly simplified...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric hydrogels, {{composed}} of poly(N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone) and cross-linked polyacrylamide have been synthesized {{for the purpose}} of concentrating <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> by excluding water from them. The hydrogles showed pH-independent swelling behaviour, which was attributed to the non-ionic nature of polymers present in the gel. The hydrogels proved to be an efficient device to extract water from the <b>protein</b> <b>solutions.</b> The extraction efficiency of the hydrogels was found to increase with the increase in cross-linking ratio. Similarly, the gel efficiency has been found to decrease with the increase in concentration of <b>protein</b> <b>solutions.</b> Hence, gels have proved to be an effective device to exclude water from dilute <b>protein</b> <b>solutions.</b> The swollen gels returned to their original shape, when dried in a vacuum oven at 40 'C for 48 h. The de-swollen gels were re-used for the extraction purpose. In order to reflect the quantitative aspect of swelling behaviour, various parameters such as swelling exponent n, diffusion coefficient D, have also been evaluated. The gels with cross-linking ratio 1. 5 (in mole%) were found to follow non-fickian swelling mechanism, while gels with cross-linking ratio 3. 0 and 4. 5 (in mole%) showed Fickian swelling behoviour.

40|$|Statistical {{thermodynamics}} of <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> {{is often}} studied {{in terms of}} simple, microscopic models of particles interacting via pairwise potentials. Such modelling can reproduce the short range structure of <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> at equilibrium and predict thermodynamics instabilities of these systems. We introduce a square well model of effective protein–protein interaction that embeds the solvent’s action. We modify an existing model [45] by considering a well depth having an explicit dependence on temperature, i. e. an explicit free energy character, thus encompassing the statistically relevant configurations of solvent molecules around proteins. We choose <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> exhibiting demixing upon temperature decrease (lysozyme, enthalpy driven) and upon temperature increase (haemoglobin, entropy driven). We obtain satisfactory fits of spinodal curves for both the two proteins without adding any mean field term, thus extending {{the validity of the}} original model.

40|$|Background: Image {{contrast}} in clinical MRI is often determined by differences in tissue water proton relaxation behavior. However, {{many aspects of}} water proton relaxation in complex biological media, such as <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> and tissue are not well understood, perhaps due to the limited empirical data. Principal Findings: Water proton T 1, T 2, and T 1 r of <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> and tissue were measured systematically under multiple conditions. Crosslinking or aggregation of protein decreased T 2 and T 1 r, but did not change high-field T 1. T 1 r dispersion profiles were similar for crosslinked <b>protein</b> <b>solutions,</b> myocardial tissue, and cartilage, and exhibited power law behavior with T 1 r(0) values that closely approximated T 2. The T 1 r dispersion of mobile <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> was flat above 5 kHz, but showed a steep curve below 5 kHz that was sensitive to changes in pH. The T 1 r dispersion of crosslinked BSA and cartilage in DMSO solvent closely resembled that of water solvent above 5 kHz but showed decreased dispersion below 5 kHz. Conclusions: Proton exchange is a minor pathway for tissue T 1 and T 1 r relaxation above 5 kHz. Potential models for relaxation are discussed, however the same molecular mechanism appears to be responsible across 5 decades of frequencies from T 1 r to T 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMembrane {{separation}} {{processes are}} widely employed for protein {{concentration in the}} food industry. The major drawback is permeability reduction caused by concentration polarization and fouling. The present work evaluated {{the influence of a}} permanent magnetic field applied to the ultrafiltration process (UF) of <b>protein</b> <b>solutions,</b> as an alternative to improve the permeation performance and the permeability recovery. Permeation tests of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and milk as the feed <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> through a 50 kDa hydrophilic polyethersulfone (PES) membrane were carried out in a tangential flow module. The feed pH was varied (4. 0, 6. 5 and 8. 0) and ionic strength was modified by sodium chloride (NaCl). Permanent magnets were placed so as to obtain a maximum 0. 7 T magnetic field perpendicular to the membrane surface. The magnetic induction effect (MI) on the feed solutions was also studied by submitting the feed to the magnetic field for 2 h before permeation run. The presence of magnetic field and the MI effect of the solution were effective in increasing both the permeate flux and the recovery of hydraulic permeability. The magnetic field application in the UF of <b>protein</b> <b>solutions</b> has proven to be an attractive alternative for improving process performance...|$|R
