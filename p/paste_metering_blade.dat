40|$|The {{photochemical}} apparatus {{organization in}} the thylakoid membrane of Macrocystis pyrifera, the giant kelp, was investigated. Chloroplasts were isolated from surface and minus 20 <b>meter</b> <b>blades.</b> Photosynthetic electron-transport complex quantitation revealed ratios of photosystem (PS) II/cytochrome b 6 -f/PSI = 1. 8 : 3. 3 : 1. 0 in surface and 2. 2 : 2. 3 : 1. 0 in minus 20 <b>meter</b> <b>blades.</b> The apparent photosynthetic unit size of chloroplasts from minus 20 <b>meter</b> <b>blades</b> (chlorophyll/P 700 = 1485 : 1) was about 45 % larger than that of surface blades (chlorophyll/P 700 = 1025 : 1). The larger photosynthetic unit size of minus 20 <b>meter</b> <b>blades</b> is attributed to the substantially lower intensity of sunlight reaching the minus 20 meter habitat. In different chloroplast preparations, the effective absorption cross section of PSI and PSII to 670 nanometer light (chlorophyll a) and 481 nanometer light (chlorophyll c and fucoxanthin) was investigated. The results showed larger functional antenna size for PSII (about 90 %) and for PSI (about 50 %) in minus 20 meter than in surface blades. Moreover, the efficiency of utilization of 481 nanometer light by Macrocystis chloroplasts was {{equal to that of}} 670 nanometer light. It is concluded that the chlorophyll c-fucoxanthin complex in brown algae enables the highly efficient utilization of blue-green wavelengths of the nearshore marine environment and contributes to the dominance of M. pyrifera in this habitat...|$|R
40|$|With {{the current}} trend toward larger and larger {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines, classical flutter is becoming a more critical issue. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} for a single blade turning in still air the flutter speed for a modern 35 <b>meter</b> <b>blade</b> occurs at approximately twice its operating speed (2 per rev), whereas for smaller blades (5 - 9 meters), both modern and early designs, the flutter speeds are in the range of 3. 5 - 6 per rev. Scaling studies demonstrate that the per rev flutter speed should not change with scale. Thus design requirements that change with increasing blade size are producing the concurrent reduction in per rev flutter speeds. In comparison with an early small <b>blade</b> design (5 <b>meter</b> <b>blade),</b> flutter computations indicate that the non-rotating modes which combine to create the flutter mode change as the blade becomes larger (i. e. for the larger blade the 2 nd flapwise mode, as opposed to the 1 st flapwise mode for the smaller blade, combines with the 1 st torsional mode to produce the flutter mode). For the more modern smaller <b>blade</b> design (9 <b>meter</b> <b>blade),</b> results show that the non-rotating modes that couple {{are similar to those of}} the larger blade. For the wings of fixed-wing aircraft, it is common knowledge that judicious selection of certain design parameters can increase the airspeed associated with the onset of flutter. Two parameters, the chordwise location of the center of mass and the ratio of the flapwise natural frequency to the torsional natural frequency, are especially significant. In this paper studies are performed to determine the sensitivity of the per rev flutter speed to these parameters for a 35 <b>meter</b> wind turbine <b>blade.</b> Additional studies are performed to determine which structural characteristics of the blade are most significant in explaining the previously mentioned per rev flutter speed differences. As a point of interest, flutter results are also reported for two recently designed 9 <b>meter</b> twist/coupled <b>blades...</b>|$|R

40|$|Global {{production}} of coated paper for printing is currently about 45 - 50 million tonnes annually, with a predicted {{growth rate of}} between 3 and 4 %. In order to remain competitive, coated paper producers have had to increase productivity and reduce cost. One way this has been achieved is through developments in technology which make the papermaking, coating and finishing operations much more efficient. Coated papers give much better printing quality than uncoated grades. The coating layer {{is made up of}} mineral particles (kaolin and calcium carbonate) with a latex binder, formulated above the cpvc so that the pores are filled with air. This controls the ink setting process and generates light scattering and gloss, important for the appearance of the sheet. The coating layer is typically about 10 to 20 µm thick on a basepaper of thickness between 50 and 100 µm. In this paper we will illustrate some of the benefits to be obtained by reducing the physical impact of the coating application method on the basepaper.

The fwst test was a fatigue test of part of a 13. 1 <b>meter</b> wood-epoxy-composite <b>blade.</b> The second test was on a 4. 25 meter pultruded fiber glass blade section driven at several mechanical resonant frequencies. The digital infrared camera can produce images of either the static temperature distribution {{on the surface of}} the specimen, or the dynamic temperature distribution that is in phase with a specific frequency on a vibrating specimen.

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{trend in}} paper machines is towards an increased running speed. At the same time, the paper produced {{must have a}} higher and more even quality. In printing papers the main end-use properties and quality components are runnability, printability, and print quality. These coexistent requirements create new demands for the behaviour of rolls under production conditions. High quality printing paper grades are coated. In blade coating {{the thickness of the}} coating film on the paper surface is found to be heavily dependent on the run-out of the backing roll which supports the paper web against the <b>metering</b> <b>blade.</b> The run-out tolerance of backing rolls at running speed has lately been 50  µm and should be substantially reduced in the future. The new tolerances can no longer be met by tightening the traditional roll manufacturing tolerances. A new predictive 3 D grinding method has been developed to improve roll behaviour in the paper production environment. It consists of a measuring system, which can verify the rotational and geometry errors of the roll at running speed, and a 3 D grinding system, which controls the grinding process according to the information gained by these measurements. In this study, the new method was applied to the backing rolls of a coating station. The experiments were carried out in a paper mill, on a medium-weight coated (MWC) paper production line. The paper was analysed before and after the predictive 3 D grinding. The predictive 3 D grinding reduced the machine direction (MD) ash variation caused by the backing rolls by an average of 76  %. Ash variation correlates well with coating variation. As a result of a more even coating film, MD gloss variation was reduced by 82  %. Reduced gloss variation improves the print quality of LWC paper. The variation in thickness caused by the backing rolls was reduced by 74  %. More even paper thickness reduces excitations and therefore improves runnability in calendering, winding, and printing. A new paradigm for roll grinding was set. The applications of the technology are not limited to high-speed paper machine rolls; the method can also be applied to different kinds of nips of rolls. The method can compensate for a systematic error causing nip force variation, such as uneven thermal expansion or the uneven flexural stiffness of a roll. The technology can be applied in different industries, such as the steel, plastics, or aluminium industries. With this method, it is also possible to use rolls in applications which have requirements too high to be met by traditional technology. reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed, no matter the thrust output—a characteristic permitted by the Astafan's use of precise fuel <b>metering</b> and fan <b>blade</b> pitch adjustment. To control the engine, the pilot first sets the speed lever, which adjusts fuel flow {{in proportion to the}} selected engine speed. Then the pilot moves the thrust lever (analogous to a throttle), actuating the fan pitch piston by way of a mechanical linkage and hydraulic valve, and varying the blade pitch. In response, the speed governor holds engine speed steady by adjusting fuel delivery to the combustor. The control system also monitors turbine temperature and adjusts blade pitch (and therefore engine load) to maintain it within the preferred range of 350 °C to 450 °C. Additionally, the system automatically protects against excessive fuel delivery or unusual changes in blade pitch. Using the thrust lever, pilots can start an Astafan in fine pitch (for minimal resistive torque), select takeoff (coarse) pitch, feather the fan, or even reverse the fan pitch in flight (with the fan providing reverse thrust in lieu of conventional reversers).|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 27 / 08 / 2002. The dynamic response of turbine flowmeters in low pressure gas flows (i. e. where the rotational inertia of the fluid is negligible) is well understood and methods for correcting meter signals {{for a lack of}} response are available. For liquid flows there has been a limited amount of experimental work on the response of meters to step changes but no reports have been found of the response of meters to sinusoidally pulsating flows. "Small" turbine meters are expected to behave differently from "large" meters for a number of reasons: a smaller meter would generally have: (1) a larger percentage of tip clearance leakage flow; (2) less fluid momentum between the meter blading; and, (3) less fluid friction forces on the effective surface area. In this research, arbitrarily, meters up to size 25 mm were defined as small; and within this study, meters of size 6 mm to 25 mm were investigated. The aim of the research was to investigate and to understand the response of small turbine meters to pulsating liquid flows and to provide methods for correction. Three approaches were used: (1) application of an existing theoretical model of turbine meter behaviour; (2) an experimental investigation of meter performance in pulsating flows; and (3) simulation of flow behaviour through one selected meter using CFD and extending the simulation to predict the rotor dynamics and, hence, the response of this meter to specified cases of pulsating flow. A theoretical model developed by Dijstelbergen (1966) assumes frictionless behaviour and that flow is perfectly guided by meter blading through the rotor and that fluid within the rotor envelope rotates as a "solid body". Results from this theoretical model applied for pulsating flows showed that there was likely to be positive error in predicted mean flow rate (over-registration) and negative error for predicted values of the amplitude of the pulsations (amplitude attenuation). This behaviour is due to the fundamental asymmetry between flows with increasing and decreasing angle of attack relative to the <b>meter</b> <b>blades,</b> throughout a pulsation cycle. This qualitative behaviour was confirmed by experimental work with meters up to size 25 mm working with pulsation frequencies up to 300 Hz. For low frequency pulsations (below 10 Hz), the over-registration errors were within the limits of specified meter accuracy. At higher frequencies and larger pulsation amplitudes, the largest over-registration observed was 5. 5 % and amplitude attenuation could be as large as 90 %. The dependence of these errors on both the flow pulsation amplitude and frequency were investigated. The theoretical model was also used as a basis for generating correction procedures, to be applied to both the mean flow and the pulsation amplitude measurements. The results from the CFD simulation showed qualitative good agreement with the experimental data. The same kind of meter error trends were observed and it was shown to provide a better correlation with the experimental trends than the theoretical model derived from Dijstelbergen. From the CFD simulation, the causes of over-registration and amplitude attenuation in turbine flowmetering were understood through the investigation of rotor dynamics coupled with fluid behaviour around meter blading within the pulsation cycle. The CFD results were used to evaluate fluid angular momentum flux and to review the validity of the assumption that fluid within the rotor "envelope" rotated as a solid body. For the case investigated, whilst the assumption that flow is perfectly guided is not inappropriate, the volume of fluid assumed to rotate as a "solid body" was found to be significantly less than the rotor envelope volume...|$|R
40|$|A heliogyro {{spacecraft}} is {{a specific}} type of solar sail that generates thrust from the reflection of solar photons. It consists of multiple long (200 to 600 <b>meters),</b> thin <b>blades,</b> similar to a helicopter. The heliogyro 2 ̆ 7 s blades remain in tension by spinning around the central hub of the spacecraft. The individual blades are pitched collectively or cyclically to produce the desired maneuver profile. The propellant-free heliogyro is a long-duration sustainable spacecraft whose maneuverability allows it to attain previously inaccessible orbits for traditional spacecraft. The blades are constructed from thin Mylar sheets, approximately 2. 5 μm thick, which have very little inherent damping making it necessary to include some other way of attenuating blade vibration caused by maneuvering. The most common approach is to incorporate damping through the root pitch actuator. However, due to the small root pitch control torques required, on the order of 2 μNm, compared to the large friction torques associated with a root pitch actuator, it is challenging to design a root control system that takes friction into account and can still add damping to the blade. The purpose of this research is to address the limitations of current control designs for a heliogyro spacecraft and to develop a physically realizable root pitch controller that effectively damps the torsional structural modes of a single heliogyro blade. Classical control theory in conjunction with impedance control techniques are used to design a position-source root pitch controller to dominate friction with high gains, wrapped with an outer loop that adds damping to the blade by sensing differential twist outboard of the blade root. First, modal parameter characterization experiments were performed on a small-scale heliogyro blade in a high vacuum chamber to determine a how much inherent damping is present in the blade, which drove the selection of the damping constant used in the membrane ladder finite element model of the blade. The experimental damping ratio of the lowest frequency torsional mode is on the order of 0. 005...|$|R

The TX- 100 blade is a 9 <b>meter</b> prototype <b>blade</b> designed with bend-twist coupling to augment the mitigation of peak loads during normal turbine operation. This structural coupling was achieved by locating off axis carbon fiber in the outboard portion of the blade skins. The report will present the tooling selection, blade production, blade instrumentation, blade shipping and adapter plate design and fabrication. The baseline blade used for this project was the ERS- 100 (Revision D) wind turbine blade. The molds used {{for the production of}} the TX- 100 were originally built for the production of the CX- 100 blade. The same high pressure and low pressure skin molds were used to manufacture the TX- 100 skins. In order to compensate for the difference in skin thickness between the CX- 100 and the TX- 100, however, a new TX- 100 shear web plug and mold were required. Both the blade assembly fixture and the root stud insertion fixture used for the CX- 100 blades could be utilized for the TX- 100 blades. A production run of seven TX- 100 prototype blades was undertaken at TPI Composites during the month of October, 2004. Of those seven blades, four were instrumented with strain gauges before final assembly. After production at the TPI Composites facility in Rhode Island, the blades were shipped to various test sites: two blades to the National Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, two blades to Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico and three blades to the United States Department of Agriculture turbine field test facility in Bushland, Texas.

Power output of the wind turbine in free yaw, aligned at a large yaw angle, was considerably less than that if the wind turbine were aligned with the wind. For the Mod- 0 wind turbine at 26 rpm, the MOSTAB computer code calculations of the free yaw alignment angle and power output compare reasonably well with experimental data.

Structural analyses of three blade sizes were performed at representative spanwise stations assuming a stressed shell design approach and E-glass/vinylester laminate. A bill of materials was prepared {{for each of the}} three blade sizes using the laminate requirements prepared during the structural analysis effort. The labor requirements were prepared for twelve major manufacturing tasks.

Each of the three potential manufacturing facilities was sized to provide a constant annual rated power production (MW per year) of the blades it produced. The cost of the production tooling and overland transportation was also estimated. The results indicate that as blades get larger, materials become a greater proportion of total cost, while the percentage of labor cost is decreased. Transportation costs decreased as a percentage of total cost.

A study was made to investigate how the relative change in coating quality was dependent {{on the characteristics of}} the coating color when changing from a ceramic blade to a soft-tip blade. Eight different coating colors were used for topcoat trials where conventional ceramic blades were compared with soft-tip blades. The coating colors had different water retention and rheological characteristics. Their rheology was measured from low to high shear rates alongside with static water retention. Continuous phase viscosity was measured after phase separation in an ultracentrifuge. Oscillation measurements were made on the coating colors to study the thickener-pigment interaction. The uncalendered board samples were tested for optical properties and for surface roughness with a range of instruments. Coating coverage was quantitatively analyzed by scanning burnout samples with STFI Mottling software. Confocal white light microscopy was used to evaluate the surface roughness alongside with the PPS 10 and Bendtsen instruments. The porosity of the coating layer was evaluated with mercury porosimetry.
