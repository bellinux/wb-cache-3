The Bf 109F-2 proved an excellent match to the Spitfire V, but Oesau disliked its reduced armament compared to the 'Emil', and continued to fly an E-4 model in <b>preference</b> <b>to</b> the Bf 109F, until lack of spares forced him to switch to the newer variant.

5|$|In 1994 {{the family}} name Fregatidae, cited as {{described}} in 1867 by French naturalists Côme-Damien Degland and Zéphirin Gerbe, was conserved under Article 40(b) of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in <b>preference</b> <b>to</b> the 1840 description Tachypetidae by Johann Friedrich von Brandt. This was because the genus names Atagen and Tachypetes had been synonymised with Fregata before 1961, resulting in the aligning of family and genus names.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's <b>preference</b> <b>to</b> remain {{in the type of}} habitat that it was born into.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how strong Matilda's {{personal}} piety was, although contemporaries praised her lifelong <b>preference</b> <b>to</b> be buried at the monastic site of Bec rather than the grander but more worldly Rouen, and believed her to have substantial, underlying religious beliefs. Like {{other members of the}} Anglo-Norman nobility, she bestowed considerable patronage on the Church. Early on in her life, she preferred the well-established Benedictine monastery of Cluny alongside some of the newer Augustinian orders, such as the Victorines and Premonstratensians. As part of this patronage, she re-founded the abbey of Notre-Dame-du-Vœu near Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|Most of Acapulco {{remained}} {{closed for}} at least a week after the hurricane. Initially, authorities around Acapulco gave <b>preference</b> <b>to</b> clean up tourist areas, which resulted in the scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed. Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, causing some hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back. One airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane.|$|E

As well as Waleran, Pain imprisoned a Welsh hostage there in 1128, Llywelyn ab Owain, the nephew of Maredudd ap Bleddyn, ruler of the Welsh principality of Powys. Besides Bridgnorth, Pain used his possession of Ludlow Castle to consolidate his power in the Welsh Marches. During Henry's reign, the Welsh border was a zone of frequent raids and conflict between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh.|$|E

This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave <b>preference</b> <b>to</b> the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is {{the most}} widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan.

However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European Russia, or the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in <b>preference</b> <b>to</b> conifers.|$|E

A report in 1916 gave <b>preference</b> <b>to</b> the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins.|$|E
