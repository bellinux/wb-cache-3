The cry of a child attracted me. I made for a door opposite, and burst it open. The scene that presented itself was striking. Out of four cribs and a cradle arose five cones of bed-clothes, with a <b>pretty</b> <b>little</b> curly <b>head</b> surmounting each cone, and ten eyes blazing with amazement.

It is her modest <b>little</b> <b>head</b> that has bent over the boxes of earth, which {{constitute}} her landed property; her <b>pretty</b> <b>little</b> fingers which have trained the stems and watered the roots and cherished the flowers until the barren house-top has been made to blossom like the rose. And love, as usual, has done it all--love to that very ugly old woman, chimney-pot Liz, who sits on the rustic chair {{in the midst of the}} garden enjoying it all.|$|R

60|$|She {{did not sit}} down, and Dan {{perceived}} that the ladies were going out. In her tailor-made suit of close-fitting serge and her Paris bonnet, carried like a crest on her <b>pretty</b> <b>little</b> <b>head,</b> Miss Anderson was charming.
