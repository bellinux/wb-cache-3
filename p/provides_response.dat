40|$|Abstract. Software {{response}} time distributions {{can be of}} high variance and multi-modal. Such characteristics reduce confidence or applicability in various statistical evaluations. We contribute an approach to correlating {{response time}}s to their corresponding operation execution sequence. This provides calling-context sensitive timing behavior models. The approach is based on three equivalence relations: caller-context, stack-context, and trace-context equivalence. To prevent model size explosion, a tree-based hierarchy provides timing behavior models that provide a trade-off between timing behavior model size {{and the amount of}} calling-context information considered. In the case study, our approach <b>provides</b> <b>response</b> time distributions with significantly lower standard deviation, compared to using less or no calling-context information. An example from a performance analysis of an industry system demonstrates that multi-modal distributions can be replaced by multiple unimodal distributions using trace-context analysis. ...|$|E

The study design includes three treatments: an actual payment treatment, a contingent valuation (CV) treatment with a follow-up certainty question, and a CV treatment with a cheap talk script. Our {{results suggest that}} both the follow-up certainty treatment and the cheap talk treatment produce willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates consistent with the actual payment treatment. However, the follow-up certainty treatment <b>provides</b> <b>response</b> distributions at all offer amounts that are statistically similar to the actual payment treatment, while the cheap talk treatment provides similar responses only at some offer amounts.

RTP statistics are used to identify the connection management feedback controls for the network layer. Real-time adaptation at the network layer and above is made possible by using hierarchical coding techniques. The proposed adaptive management architecture is illustrated by a case memory representation of call preparation feedback controls, RTP feedback control tests for providing audio stream bandwidth adaptation, and configuration of integrated experiments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{techniques for}} providing adaptation in intrusion detection and intrusion response systems. As attacks on computer systems {{are becoming increasingly}} numerous and sophisticated, {{there is a growing}} need for intrusion detection and response systems to dynamically adapt to better detect and respond to attacks. The Adaptive Hierarchical Agent-based Intrusion Detection System (AHA! IDS) provides detection adaptation by adjusting the amount of system resources devoted to the task of detecting intrusive activities. This is accomplished by dynamically invoking new combinations of lower level detection agents in response to changing circumstances and by adjusting the confidence associated with these lower-level agents. The Adaptive Agent-based Intrusion Response System (AAIRS) <b>provides</b> <b>response</b> adaptation by weighting those responses that have been successful in the past over those techniques that have not been as successful. As a result, the more successful responses are used more often than the less successful techniques. It also adapts responses based on the system's belief that intrusion detection reports are valid. Intuitively, adaptive detection and response systems will provide more robust protection than static, non-adaptive systems. ...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{security}} issue today in Nigeria is the increased occurrence of identity fraud. Research shows that perpetrators of this act are foreigners {{who enter the}} country without any document and are employed as security officers, thereby posing security treats to lives and properties. It has been noted that these foreigners device a means of beating security devices put {{in place at the}} border. The Nigerian Immigration uses Automated Fingerprint identification system (AFIS) which is minutiae base and it’s less noise tolerant unlike the correlation base approach. This paper therefore proposes a novel fingerprinting method that can help identify identity fraud. The method combines two approaches namely minutiae and correlation approaches, the idea is to see how the shortcomings of one is complemented by the other and the two approaches processes extraction and matching so as to get good and reliable images. Each of the approaches computes the matching score and the mean of the two resulting scores is taken. The mean is compared with the established threshold such that the system <b>provides</b> <b>response</b> by indicating whether the verification is successful or not. It follows that the adoption of this new method by organizations like the Nigerian Immigration Service will drastically reduce, if not totally eradicate, the level of insecurity in the country...|$|E

40|$|A {{wireless}} communication network {{can be viewed}} as a collection of nodes, located in some domain, which can in turn be transmitters or receivers (depending on the considered network, nodes will be mobile users, base stations in a cellular network, access points of a WiFi mesh etc.). At a given time, some nodes simultaneously transmit, each toward its own receiver. Each transmitter–receiver pair requires its own wireless link. The signal received from the link transmitter is jammed by the signals received from the other transmitters. Even in the simplest model where the signal power radiated from a point decays in an isotropic way with Euclidean distance, the geometry of the node location plays a key role since it determines the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) at each receiver and hence the possibility of establishing simultaneously this collection of links at a given bit rate. The interference seen by a receiver is the sum of the signal powers received from all transmitters, except its own transmitter. Stochastic geometry provides a natural way of defining and computing macroscopic properties of such networks, by averaging over all potential geometrical patterns for the nodes, in the same way as queuing theory <b>provides</b> <b>response</b> times or congestion, averaged over all potential arrival patterns within a given parametric class. Modeling {{wireless communication}} networks in terms of stochastic geometry seems particularly relevan...|$|E

40|$|Advances in Internet Protocol (IP) {{multicasting}} {{provide a}} rich background for support of IP multipoint collaborative communications. IP multicast applications {{have traditionally been}} deployed over wired networks, however, new wireless technologies such as Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) are currently emerging as transport mechanisms for wireless video, voice, and application sharing environments. For multimedia wireless services to effectively evolve, management tools that can support Quality of Service (QoS) adaptation of increasingly complex network resources and customer application profiles are needed. In this paper, we present a control model which <b>provides</b> <b>response</b> time and bandwidth requirement adaptation of audio, video, and application sharing multipoint IP teleconferences for emerging wireless multimedia communications. Our study is innovative in that it integrates feedback controls between the application and network layers. Our model is based on revealing feedback controls for multimedia call preparation and subsequent real-time connection control. Case-based reasoning memory is used to match real-time congestion (connection) controls with call preparation controls and user profiles for improved QoS. Network agents are used to capture user and multimedia teleconference application call profiles at the application layer and transfer them to the case memory. Real Time Protocol (RTP) statistics are used to identify connection management feedback controls at the network layer. Receiver-based, real-time adaptation at the network layer and above is possible {{through the use of}} a hierarchical coding technique. The proposed adaptive management architecture is based upon a case memory representation of call preparation feedback controls, RTP feedback controls for providing audio stream bandwidth adaptation, and configuration descriptions for integrated experiments.
