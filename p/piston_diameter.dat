25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common <b>piston</b> <b>diameter</b> (76mm) {{in a common}} wet {{cylinder}} liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or sprag clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E
500|$|All {{seven of}} the Billinton L Class {{locomotives}} entered Eastleigh works in 1934 for rebuilding, each leaving the works the same year. Conversion into the 4-6-0 tender type, entailed removing the trailing bogie, water tanks, and bunker, shortening the mainframes [...] and fitting new cabs; these were of the side-window variety already used on the Lord Nelson class.

5000|$|The {{civilian}} use Tatra 81H and Tatra 81HB were {{fitted with}} wood gas generator and a 14726 cc, [...] power engine working on wood gas. To avoid drastic {{reduction of the}} engine power, the <b>pistons</b> <b>diameter</b> was increased by 10mm.|$|R
50|$|British {{cars and}} cars in other {{countries}} applying the same approach to automobile taxation continued to feature long thin cylinders even in the 1950s and 1960s, after taxation had ceased {{to be based on}} <b>piston</b> <b>diameters,</b> partly because limited funds meant that investment in new models often involved new bodies while under the hood/bonnet engines lurked from earlier decades with only minor upgrades such as (typically) higher compression ratios as higher octane fuels slowly returned to European service stations.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} pinch-off of axisymmetric vortex rings and the evolution of pressure in the shear layer being entrained into the vortex rings. A piston-cylinder apparatus was used to generate the vortex rings, and five cases of constant piston acceleration over distances ranging from zero (impulsive start) to eight <b>piston</b> <b>diameters</b> were investigated. It was determined that increasing the distance over which the piston accelerated increased the dimensionless formation time at which the vortex ring pinches off, consistent with previous observations. A limiting value of vortex ring formation number of approximately seven is approached when the piston is accelerated over more than six <b>piston</b> <b>diameters.</b> For each case, the evolution of pressure in the shear layer was calculated based on PIV measurements of the velocity field and spatial integration of the corresponding pressure gradients using a recently developed algorithm. Plots of the shear layer pressure in X-T diagrams aided in identifying key features of the pressure associated with the evolution of vortex rings, including a high-pressure region that forms behind the leading ring. By extrapolating the motion of this high-pressure region back to the nozzle exit plane in the X-T diagram, its time of first appearance can be estimated. It is found that the appearance of the extrapolated local pressure maximum in the shear layer at the nozzle exit plane coincides with vortex ring pinch-off, as conventionally quantified by the vortex ring formation number...|$|R

The beam length is 33 ft, the <b>piston</b> <b>diameter</b> 50 in, stroke of 10 ft and the engine works at 7 strokes per minute. The boilers, replaced in 1900, have a pressure of 40 p.s.i.|$|E
50|$|Double-expansion (usually {{known as}} compound) engines {{expanded}} the steam in two stages. The pairs may be duplicated or {{the work of}} the large low-pressure cylinder can be split with one high-pressure cylinder exhausting into one or the other, giving a three-cylinder layout where cylinder and <b>piston</b> <b>diameter</b> are about the same, making the reciprocating masses easier to balance.|$|E
50|$|In {{a normal}} {{internal}} combustion engine, because cylinder bore <b>diameter,</b> <b>piston</b> stroke length and combustion chamber volume {{are almost always}} constant, the compression ratio (CR) for a given engine is almost always constant.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, with bar frames, Walschaerts valve gear, steam-operated {{reversing gear}} and 11 in <b>diameter</b> <b>piston</b> valves.

50|$|The {{high-pressure}} cylinders were {{fitted with}} 10 in <b>diameter</b> <b>piston</b> valves {{and had a}} bore of 17+1/2 in, while the low-pressure cylinders were fitted with Richardson balanced slide valves and had a bore of 28 in. Both sets of cylinders had a stroke of 26 in.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first ten}} {{locomotives}} were modified on similar lines as the {{earlier versions of}} the Class 14C. As they went in for major overhauls, they had their cylinders bushed to reduce the bore from the as-built 22 to 21+3/4 in.

50|$|The Honda Magna {{of years}} 1982-1988 {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} unique features into a cruiser market dominated by V-twin engines. The V4 engine configuration provided a balance between torque for good acceleration and high horsepower. The 90-degree layout produced less primary vibration, and the four cylinders provided a much smoother delivery of power than a V-twin. Good engine balance, plus short stroke and large <b>piston</b> <b>diameter</b> allowed for a high redline and potential top speed.|$|E
50|$|Movement {{reduction}} can {{be performed}} by mechanical levers, hydraulically using <b>pistons</b> of different <b>diameters</b> connected by tubing containing non-compressible fluid, electronically using stepper motors or linear actuators, or combinations of techniques in one instrument. Mechanisms with different ranges of movement or variable reduction ratio may be incorporated in one instrument to allow coarse and fine positioning.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. This paper investigates the challenges in developing a solar powered Stirling engine for domestic electricity generation. All the system components, the parabolic troughs, heat transfer fluid and the Stirling engine are individually analysed. The analysis includes a market survey and performance assessments of such components. A mathematical analysis for the Stirling engine is carried out {{in order to understand}} the affect of varies parameters with the work output per cycle and the engine efficiency. Such parameters are the phase angle between <b>pistons,</b> the <b>diameter</b> ratio of the power and displacer piston, and change in temperature. dc 201...|$|R
50|$|The {{unique design}} of this bikes piston makes {{cylinder}} maintenance difficult, as aftermarket companies (as of 2016) do not manufacture replacements and new old stock (NOS) parts are not widely available. Due to this, {{it is common}} practice to install the nearly identical 88-04 pistons in these bikes, which share both wrist pin and <b>piston</b> <b>diameter</b> measurements. Doing so will lower the compression ratio, but still function. Cylinders from later bikes are not compatible.|$|E
50|$|The bore {{pitch is}} always {{larger than the}} inside {{diameter}} of the cylinder (the bore and <b>piston</b> <b>diameter)</b> since it includes the thickness of both cylinder walls and any water passage separating them. This {{is one of the}} first dimensions required when developing a new engine, since it limits maximum cylinder size (and therefore, indirectly, maximum displacement), and determines the length of the engine (L4, 6, 8) or of that bank of cylinders (V6, V8 etc.).|$|E
50|$|Double-expansion (usually just {{known as}} 'compound') engines expand the steam in two stages, {{but this does}} not imply that all such engines have two {{cylinders}}. They may have four cylinders working as two LP-HP pairs, or the work of the large LP cylinder can be split across two smaller cylinders, with one HP cylinder exhausting into either LP cylinder, giving a 3-cylinder layout where the cylinder and <b>piston</b> <b>diameter</b> of all three are about the same, making the reciprocating masses easier to balance.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, {{the battery}} and starter were improved. The bike {{received}} more resilient seat foam, a new front fender, an altered bottom triple-clamp, a better headlight (using a common H4 bulb) and new handguards. The bike retains the older spring-type clutch providing a lighter lever action than other KTMs. The 2014 {{is provided with}} a new master cylinder/reservoir with a smaller <b>diameter</b> <b>piston</b> and new lever for a lighter pull.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Class B Hendrie D, the ALCO {{locomotive}} {{also used}} Walschaerts valve gear, {{but it had}} a bar frame, larger 24 in <b>diameter</b> <b>pistons,</b> lower [...] boiler pressure, superheating, an American type cab and some other features which were typical of American design, such as high running boards. It was the first superheated locomotive to be acquired by the NGR and also the first with a bar frame.|$|R
50|$|Boosters may {{be driven}} by an {{electric}} motor, hydraulics, low or high pressure air or manually by a lever system. Those powered by compressed air are usually linear actuated systems, where a pneumatic cylinder directly drives the compression piston, often in a common housing, separated by a seal. A high pressure pneumatic drive arrangement may use the same pressure as the output pressure to drive the piston, and a low pressure drive will use a larger <b>diameter</b> <b>piston</b> to multiply the applied force.|$|R

The vessel's {{dimensions}} were 132 ft long, with a 27 ft beam, 5 ft depth of hold, 370 gross tons and 281 registered tons. The vessel was propelled by a sternwheel which was turned by two twin horizontally mounted high pressure steam engines.

5000|$|The {{design of}} this new engine {{commenced}} around January 1952, and was designated as the [...] "B" [...] series. Although superficially similar, it was longer and heavier than the A40 Devon engine. A major advantage was {{that it could be}} bored out, whereby the <b>piston</b> cylinders <b>diameter</b> could be increased to provide a larger capacity if needed. Originally of approximately 1.2 Litre capacity, later displacements ranged widely from 1.2 L to 2.4 L, the latter being an Australia only production six-cylinder variant. The most common engine sizes were 1.5 L and 1.8 L and saw service in a number of vehicles. This included a version of the engine built under license in India by Hindustan Motors for its Ambassador series of cars. Petrol versions were produced in the greatest numbers, but diesel versions exist for both cars and marine applications.|$|R

50|$|The {{gudgeon pin}} is {{typically}} a forged short hollow rod {{made of a}} steel alloy of high strength and hardness that may be physically separated from both the connecting rod and piston or crosshead. The design of the gudgeon pin, {{especially in the case}} of small, high-revving automotive engines is challenging. The gudgeon pin has to operate under some of the highest temperatures experienced in the engine, with difficulties in lubrication due to its location, while remaining small and light so as to fit into the <b>piston</b> <b>diameter</b> and not unduly add to the reciprocating mass. The requirements for lightness and compactness demand a small diameter rod that is subject to heavy shear and bending loads, with some of the highest pressure loadings of any bearing in the whole engine. To overcome these problems, the materials used to make the gudgeon pin and the way it is manufactured are amongst the most highly engineered of any mechanical component found in internal combustion engines.|$|E
50|$|An {{estimate}} for the tractive effort {{of a single}} cylinder steam locomotive {{can be obtained from}} the cylinder pressure, cylinder area, stroke of the <b>piston</b> and the <b>diameter</b> of the wheel. The torque developed by the linear motion of the piston depends on the angle that the driving rod makes with the tangent of the radius on the driving wheel. For a more useful value an average value over the rotation of the wheel is used. The driving force is the torque divided by the wheel radius.|$|R
50|$|The {{superheated}} Class FC had 7 in <b>diameter</b> <b>piston</b> valves actuated by Walschaerts valve gear, and a 7/8 {{in thick}} plate frame. The aim with the experimental locomotive {{was to compare}} the performance and maintenance requirements of the Modified Fairlie {{to that of a}} Garratt, in particular to the Class GC 2-6-2+2-6-2 Double Prairie type Garratt which was similar in both size and mechanical respects. Hence, also, the experimental Modified Fairlie's Class FC designation, skipping the FA and FB classifications which were never used by the SAR.|$|R
5000|$|The {{scavenging}} pistons {{were even}} more unusual, being double-acting. Two highly oversquare double-acting pistons in a single cylinder gave two pump volumes: one between the pistons that supplied #1 power cylinder, the other formed by the two spaces outside the pistons being coupled to both supply #2 cylinder. These double-acting pistons were of crosshead form, with a ½'" [...] <b>diameter</b> <b>piston</b> rod emerging through a seal and to a crosshead formed {{on the end of}} the piston rod, where it carried the connecting rod.|$|R
