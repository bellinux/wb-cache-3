5|$|The show {{planned a}} {{dramatic}} stunt which {{would lead to}} the discovery of Callum's body. The scene featured Carla Connor (Alison King) causing a car accident, colliding with Tyrone Dobbs' (Alan Halsall) <b>pick-up</b> <b>truck</b> which smashes into the Platt's home. This causes the floor to give way and a recovery team unearthing Callum's body. Producers decided to conclude the story without Kylie being held accountable for the murder. Instead they used a character that had been recently killed off, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), who had publicly feuded with Callum. When Sarah confesses the truth to Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), he decides to frame Tony for the crime–a scheme which proved successful.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, Ford of Brazil and Ford of Argentina merged their {{operations}} with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range.

Consequently, the Ford Fiesta and Ford EcoSport are built only in Brazil, and the Ford Focus only built in Argentina, with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries. Models like the Ford Mondeo from Europe could now be imported completely built up. Ford of Brazil produces a <b>pick-up</b> <b>truck</b> version of the Fiesta, the Courier, which is also produced in South Africa as the Ford Bantam in right hand drive versions.|$|E

However, only {{three out of four}} poles came out of the ground due to mechanical problems, resulting in inadvertently excluding Le May Doan from lighting it with the other three athletes. Because the site of the ceremonies - BC Place - was a domed stadium, Gretzky was sent via the back of a <b>pick-up</b> <b>truck</b> to a secondary site— the Vancouver Convention Centre which served at the International Broadcast Centre for these Olympics— to light a larger cauldron of a similar design located outdoors, as Olympic rules state that the flame must be in public view for the entirety of the Olympics.

After getting a ride, they leave the car on a motel next to the road, where Inna enters to sing on a stage.

500|$|The Misrata militia took Gaddafi prisoner, causing serious {{injuries}} {{as they tried}} to apprehend him; the events were filmed on a mobile phone. A video appears to picture Gaddafi being poked or stabbed in the anus [...] "with some kind of stick or knife" [...] or possibly a bayonet. Pulled onto the front of a <b>pick-up</b> <b>truck,</b> he fell off as it drove away. His semi-naked, lifeless body was then placed into an ambulance and taken to Misrata; upon arrival, he was found to be dead. Official NTC accounts claimed that Gaddafi was caught in a cross-fire and died from his bullet wounds. Other eye-witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot Gaddafi in the stomach. Gaddafi's son Mutassim, who had also been among the convoy, was also captured, and found dead several hours later, most probably from an extrajudicial execution. Around 140 Gaddafi loyalists were rounded up from the convoy; tied up and abused, the corpses of 66 were found at the nearby Mahari Hotel, victims of extrajudicial execution. Libya's chief forensic pathologist, Othman al-Zintani, carried out the autopsies of Gaddafi, his son and Jabr in the days following their deaths; although the pathologist initially told the press that Gaddafi had died from a gunshot wound to the head, the autopsy report was not made public.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. In regards to the video's concept, Swift stated, [...] "It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song {{years after it was}} first popular can have such an emotional appeal." [...] Clayton Collins portrayed Swift's love interest in the music video. He was cast because of his physical resemblance to the real subject of the song, in that they were both tall with dark hair. The video begins with Swift, dressed by a white sundress, as she lies on the grass of a lake-bed and holds a transistor radio. Suddenly, the setting is switched to Collins as he drives a white and orange 1970 Chevrolet CST-10. He then turns his radio on and ceases driving, coming to a complete stop on a road. As Collins facial expressions become more serious, he flashbacks to memories with Swift. Swift and Collins are seen frolicking in a field, lying beside another on the back of Collins' CST-10, staring at the stars together, holding hands as they walk, and slow dancing. When the song is in its final chorus, Collins arrives at a wooden cabin in his <b>pick-up</b> <b>truck.</b> He runs up the staircase to discover an enveloped letter next to the door. He then sits on the staircase, opens the envelope, and reads the letter. The video transcends towards Swift playing an acoustic guitar as she leans against the wooden cabin. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the lake-bed and performing with a guitar next to the wooden cabin. The video concludes with Swift, once again, lying on the initial setting.|$|E

As Swift's ex-boyfriend and the woman start frolicking inside the truck, and the music begins and the music video transcends to a concrete room where the singer (clothed by a grey, one-shoulder mini-dress and black leather, thigh-length boots) is playing an electric guitar, alongside her backup band. During [...] "Picture to Burn"'s chorus, fire ignites behind them. Afterwards, the band is depicted entering a house furtively, using flashlights. Swift is sitting on a brown couch, sporting a black tank top, black leather pants, and beehive hair, as the band ransacks the house. They throw darts at photographs of him, envelop all of his furniture with toilet paper, mess his mirror with the word [...] "loser", lick his utensils and spit into his mouthwash. Suddenly, the ex-boyfriend and the woman are shown approaching the house, and, seeing this, Anderson informs them of it via handheld transceiver. He enters the house and discovers it was ransacked, and repeats the word [...] "Taylor". The video then transitions to Anderson and Swift inside the Ford Mustang, with Anderson also repeating [...] "Taylor". She then suggests leaving, and Swift says, [...] "You know what? I'm over it." [...] The video concludes with the photograph of Swift and her ex-boyfriend in flames, thrown in the sidewalk. Cut-scenes feature Swift and her band performing in the concrete room, Swift singing on the couch, or Swift dancing affront a shower of sparks. To date, the video has 96 million views on YouTube.|$|E
