50|$|Since 1996, the Japanese Ministry of Education {{has taken}} steps to address this 'pressure-cooker' {{educational}} environment and instill greater creative thought in Japanese youth by significantly relaxing the school schedule from six-day weeks to five-day weeks and dropping two subjects from the daily schedule, with new academic curricula more comparable to Western educational models. However, Japanese parents are sending their children to <b>private</b> <b>cram</b> schools, known as juku, to 'make up' for lost time.|$|R

50|$|In total, {{more than}} a quarter of the Korean {{population}} in South Africa may consist of students or family members who moved to the country primarily to give their children the opportunity for an English-language education.

However, South Korean children who have gone through the more relaxed South African educational system sometimes find it difficult to adjust to the fast pace and high demands of schooling once they return to their native country.|$|R
50|$|The {{conflict}} between the AKP and the Gülen Movement was fully underway after the government proposed a new law that would force several <b>private</b> <b>cram</b> schools, {{many of which are}} owned by the Gülen Movement, to close.

25|$|Aydın {{city centre}} is still {{relatively}} small but growing, centred on one palm-lined avenue of shops and cafes, and {{a maze of}} narrow side streets, dotted with orange trees. The people are traditional and family-oriented, so there is little night life, or cultural amenities for young people, although presumably now they have a university this will change. There {{are a number of}} mosques, high schools, dersane (<b>private</b> courses <b>cramming</b> students for the university entrance exams) and other public buildings. Like all Turkish cities Aydın is now spreading as the middle-classes are leaving their flats in the city for smarter apartments or houses slightly out of town.|$|R
5000|$|Tiger {{mothers have}} high {{expectations}} and may harbor elitist views regarding their children’s academic performance. In some cases these expectations may be held {{regardless of the}} child's aptitude or passion for studying. Tiger mothers may exhibit harsh and unrealistic expectations for the child's academic performance where [...] "B" [...] and even mid to low end [...] "A" [...] grades are not tolerated. Tiger mothers put a heavy emphasis on the pursuit of academic success. Tiger mothers eschew the lax parenting style exhibited by many Western parents. Tiger mothers may impose choices on their children as to which interests they choose to pursue. Some argue that this approach will restrict their children's ability to discover their individual talents and passions thus denying a sense of belonging, self-esteem, and purpose. Advocates for tiger mothers suggest that their parenting strategy imbues children with self-control and self-discipline. Tiger mothers may fill up their children’s schedule with tutorial classes (taught by <b>private</b> tutors and/or <b>cram</b> school instructors) and extracurricular activities. Slacking off may be strictly forbidden.|$|R
