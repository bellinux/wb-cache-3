While photovoltaic solar cells are widely used, much attention has been devoted {{in the past decade}} to developing nanotechnology for potential cost reduction and improved device efficiency and reliability. Low-dimensional materials offer unique physical properties which may be exploited for solar energy harvesting and conversion. Understanding their fundamental properties and developing relevant manufacturing strategies will thus pave the road toward high-performance, cost-effective, light-harvesting devices. ^ This thesis has investigated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) nanolayers for their light-harvesting ability in donor-acceptor systems. These materials were studied with three specific goals: (i) introducing innovative light-harvesting designs, (ii) understanding their fundamental photophysical and photoelectrochemical properties, and (iii) providing potential solutions to improve the system performance. ^ First, novel light-harvesting complexes were designed using semiconducting SWCNTs and cationic porphyrins as acceptors and donors, respectively. These complexes were assembled by synthetic DNA oligonucleotides that recognize porphyrins, while noncovalently functionalizing SWCNTs. The SWCNT-DNA-porphyrin hybrids were used to manufacture large-area thin films through solution-phase processing and membrane filtration methods. From extensive studies of optical absorption, emission, and photocurrents, new detailed insights on photo-processes were gained for <b>photoelectrochemical</b> <b>conversion.</b> ^ A regenerative donor-acceptor light-harvesting system was introduced and demonstrated to counteract photoinduced degradation of porphyrin molecules. The photo-damaged chromophores were dissociated from the complex by modulating the chemical environment, while DNA-SWCNTs were preserved. When fresh porphyrins were reintroduced and reassociated with DNA-SWCNTs, photocurrents were fully recovered. As proof-of-principle, A 50 % increase in photocurrents was demonstrated through four successive regenerations within 90 minutes, compared to the complex without regeneration. Such dynamic strategy could improve the overall device efficiency and extend the operation lifetime. ^ Lastly, a novel solution-phase manufacturing process was developed to fabricate large-area two-dimensional MoS 2 nanolayers for light harvesting applications. The MoS 2 nanolayers were functionalized with 8 porphyrin species from 3 families to mitigate charge recombination by defects and small crystallites. A strong correlation between porphyrin species and photocurrents was observed, where interfacial porphyrins suppress charge recombination within MoS 2 nanolayers, thus enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance of the devices. A photocurrent enhancement mechanism was proposed based on the energy difference between the valence band of MoS 2 and highest occupied molecular orbital level of porphyrins. ^ Overall, the innovative designs and the scientific insights on photophysics and <b>photoelectrochemical</b> <b>conversion</b> in this thesis will form the basis for developing next-generation solar energy harvesting devices. ...|$|E

Pathways for conversion of solar energy, being the most abundant, to fuel represent crucial areas of research. Hydrogen as a chemical energy carrier is storable and transportable, while being a feedstock for ammonia fertilizer that is essential to global food supply. Direct <b>photoelectrochemical</b> <b>conversion</b> of sunlight via water splitting is a prominent concept for clean, scalable, cost-effective, and locally produced hydrogen, but the technology is not yet commercially viable. Here, we address the technical challenges of realizing economical solar hydrogen production using III-V semiconductor-based devices: high conversion efficiency and extended lifetime in aqueous electrolyte. Solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency is a fundamental metric for evaluating progress that will impact introduction of commercial solar water-splitting systems. Its definition is generally agreed upon, but measurement technique standards are not well defined. We demonstrate common practices, show how they can lead to significant error, and introduce methodology and cross-validation practices for improved accuracy. The advanced techniques are relevant to device configurations based on tandem absorbers, necessary for achieving maximum conversion efficiency. We outline the development pathway for III-V tandem devices to reach maximum efficiency, demonstrate progress toward 15 % enabled by a new architecture allowing lower bandgaps, and investigate alternative p-i and p-n PEC junction doping profiles that enhance photovoltage. We identify reflection as the primary loss and model anti-reflective TiO 2 coatings that demonstrate improved photocurrent. We present findings on the intrinsic stability of III-V photocathodes {{and the development of}} stabilizing surface modifications. We show that water vapor reversibly passivates p-GaInP 2 surfaces and derive a model describing the behavior. Bare p-GaAs photocathodes etch ~ 100 x slower than other III-V photocathodes due to residual surface As. Bare p-GaInP 2 is unstable, but surface modification involving nitridation and/or PtRu alloy co-catalyst deposition offers corrosion resistance. We show that sputtered PtRu consistently provides better initial performance than other treatment variations, making it preferable for device development. Department of Energy progress milestones are exceeded for STH efficiency and approached for durability, while considerable reduction of device processing cost remains to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|The {{increases}} in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) concentrations and depletion of hydrocarbon based fuels have become global concerns. As a result, {{a number of}} methods are being developed which aim to restrict GHG and to develop alternative fuels from sustainable sources. Photocatalysis has shown potential to restrict GHG through CO 2 recycling and convert solar energy to alternative fuels through solar H 2 production. This thesis describes the development of photo reactors to reduce CO 2 emissions {{and to provide a}} novel method of producing H 2 as a fuel source. A number of photo reactors were developed including three fluidised design concepts and a thin film system. The preliminary evaluation of the reactors was performed using methyl orange (MO) as a model compound and utilising TiO 2 and ZnO. The reduction of CO 2 and H 2 evolution was performed over a range of novel catalysts in the optimised system developed, referred to as the propeller fluidised photo reactor (PFPR). A MO photodegradation efficiency of > 95 % was achieved in all the photo reactors using illumination from a low power 36 W lamp. The reduction of CO 2 was performed in the PFPR under varying illumination sources including UV, simulated and natural solar exposure. CO 2 reduction was not achieved in the unit under any experimental conditions. However, the evolution of H 2 was achieved under both simulated and natural solar irradiation. The results demonstrated that reactor properties such as propeller rotational speed were found to enhance the photo activity of the system through the elimination of mass transport limitations and increasing light penetration. The optimum conditions for H 2 evolution were found to be a propeller rotational speed of 1035 rpm and 144 W of simulated solar irradiation, which produced a rate of 109 μmol h- 1 g- 1 over Pt-C 3 N 4. Under solar irradiation 8 μmol h- 1 g- 1 was evolved over NaTaO 3. La. The rate of H 2 evolution over Pt-C 3 N 4 increased from 27 to 109 μmol h- 1 g- 1, upon increasing the rotational speed of the propeller from 0 to 1035 rpm. Furthermore, the use of the PFPR with solar irradiation displayed the potential for solar photocatalysis applications.

Efficiencies of the monolithic system for <b>photoelectrochemical</b> solar energy <b>conversion</b> and for photoelectrocatalytic evolution of hydrogen were investigated in {{dependence of the}} preceding surface preparation. Smooth nanotopographies on n type Si 111, consisting of recurrent structures with 2 nm average height, showed highest device performance while an increasing aspect ratio of the structures reduced the efficiency. As possible cause, lower densities of Pt contacts on stronger corrugated surfaces were observed. Comparable results were obtained for p type Si 111 in corresponding experiments for hydrogen reduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{and dynamics}} of photocatalyzed dissociation of ethanol on TiO 2 (110) surface {{have been studied}} using the time-dependent and time-resolved femtosecond two-photon photoemission spectroscopy respectively, in order to unravel the photochemical properties of ethanol on this prototypical metal oxide surface. By monitoring the time evolution of the photoinduced excited state which {{is associated with the}} photocatalyzed dissociation of ethanol on Ti- 5 c sites of TiO 2 (110), the fractal-like kinetics of this surface photocatalytic reaction has been obtained. The measured photocatalytic dissociation rate on reduced TiO 2 (110) is faster than that on the oxidized surface. This is attributed to the larger defect density on the reduced surface which lowers the reaction barrier of the photocatalytic reaction at least methodologically. Possible reasons associated with the defect electrons for the acceleration have been discussed. By performing the interferometric two-pulse correlation on ethanol/TiO 2 (110) interface, the ultrafast electron dynamics of the excited state has been measured. The analyzed lifetime (24 fs) of the excited state is similar to that on methanol/TiO 2 (110). The appearance of the excited state provides a channel to mediate the electron transfer between the TiO 2 substrate and its environment. Therefore studying its ultrafast electron dynamics may lead {{to the understanding of the}} microscopic mechanism of photocatalysis and <b>photoelectrochemical</b> energy <b>conversion</b> on TiO 2...|$|R
40|$|Anchoring {{quantum dots}} (QDs) onto {{thermodynamically}} stable, large band gap oxide semiconductors {{is a very}} important strategy to enhance their quantum yields for solar energy conversion in both visible and near-IR regions. We describe a general procedure for anchoring a few chalcogenide QDs onto the titanium oxide layer. To anchor the colloidal QDs onto a mesoporous TiO 2 layer, linker molecules containing both carboxylate and thiol functional groups were initially attached to TiO 2 layers and subsequently used to capture dispersed QDs with the thiol group. Employing the procedure, we exploited cadmium selenide (CdSe) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots (QDs) as inorganic sensitizers for a large band gap TiO 2 layer of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their attachment was confirmed by naked eyes, absorption spectra, and photovoltaic effects. A few QD-TiO 2 systems thus obtained have been characterized for <b>photoelectrochemical</b> solar energy <b>conversion...</b>|$|R
