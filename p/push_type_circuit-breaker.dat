Various parameters such as weeding index, weeding efficiency and field capacity of the weeder were considered during the test. The highest field efficiency was obtained for khurpi (91. 5 per cent) followed by cycle weeder (85. 4) and power weeder (71. 25 per cent). The field capacity of 0. 065, 0. 025 and 0. 035 ha/hr respectively observed for power weeder, khurpi and <b>push</b> <b>type</b> cycle weeder.

50|$|These {{guns were}} of {{built-up}} construction with a fixed liner, autofretted barrel, and a Welin breech block. The gun mounts had electrically powered training, elevation, hoists and rammers. There was no swinging arm, and shell hoists were of <b>pusher</b> <b>type</b> with loading at +15°. These guns suffered from dispersion problems (due to the turret {{design of the}} Trento-class cruisers), so the original muzzle velocity of 905 m/s was reduced to 840 m/s for armor-piercing shells. Shell weight was also reduced from 125.3 kg to 118 kg {{in an attempt to}} resolve these problems, but these efforts were only partially successful. The main reason for the dispersion problem was because the guns were mounted too close together on a common cradle, which together with a narrow 4.52 m ball track complicated loading of the guns.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Though {{balancing}} is {{a fundamental}} part of human walking, {{it has been a}} challenging topic for bipedal robot. Compared to the versatile strategies for handling disturbances of humans, current bipedal robots possess limited skills of managing external disturbances. Among them the capabilities of push recovery and maintaining balance are obviously of prior importance for a bipedal robot to walk in an unknown environment. Existing solutions, such as, capture point, walking phase modification, foot placement estimator and etc, are mostly based on simplifying a bipedal robot as a linear inverted pendulum, which result in omitting the effects of knee and ankle joints, natural dynamics, ground reaction forces and interaction between joints in sagittal and frontal planes in a 3 D bipedal robot.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1920s the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's main trainer aircraft, the pusher {{configuration}} Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.4, {{which had been}} introduced in 1918, was outdated. The introduction of such new aircraft as the Hansa-Brandenburg W.33 reconnaissance aircraft left the M.F.4 unfit for service as a trainer. The wings of the M.F.4s were also considered to be too weak. This led to a requirement for a new trainer aircraft of the tractor configuration. Until a tractor aircraft could be designed, a final <b>pusher</b> <b>type</b> was built as an emergency measure, {{in the shape of}} the Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.6.

40|$|Abstract. The use of unboxed data {{representations}} often {{increases the}} efficiency of programs, especially numerical ones. Operations on unboxed data {{do not need to}} mask out type tags or dereference pointers. As a result, certain operations, such as floating point arithmetic, become a single machine instruction. Type-based techniques [1 – 3] directly enable the use of unboxed data representations in the presence of polymorphic functions. The problem is, however, that type information, computed in the front end, has to be carried though the entire compilation process, {{all the way to the}} codegeneration phase, where unboxing decisions are made. Doing so increases the complexity of the compiler and results in a significant overhead in compilation time. This work presents an alternative approach. Instead of <b>pushing</b> <b>types</b> through the compiler, it relies on exposing specialized primitives that operate on unboxed data of a given type. The typechecker then rewrite...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational model for heat transfer in direct fired <b>pusher</b> <b>type</b> reheat furnaces for heating steel billets prior to plastic working. Radiation, {{which is the}} dominant mode of heat transfer in the furnace chamber, is modelled in a detailed manner. The model incorporates several features of radiation heat transfer that are typical of reheat furnaces, such as non-grey participating gas in the chamber and specular/diffuse reflection off the furnace surfaces. Radiation heat transfer in the furnace chamber and conduction within the billets are modelled using the finite volume method (FVM). Convection heat flux on the billets is calculated using correlations from the literature. Overall, the model is capable of predicting the radiative heat flux distribution within the furnace, {{as well as the}} resulting temperature distribution within the billets as they pass through various zones in the furnace. Several key process parameters have been identified, and their effects on the heating process of the billets are studied...|$|R

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{increase in}} the competitive advantage that the Japanese manufacturing companies have experienced in the past decades over their American counterparts has been widely attributed to their use of 2 ̆ 2 just in time with Kanban 2 ̆ 2 among other things. Slow down in the increase of productivity and loss of business to foreign competitors have made the American manufacturing managers increasingly aware of the inadequacy of the classical 2 ̆ 2 push 2 ̆ 2 type production systems. In the last decade the American manufacturing managers have shown an increasing amount of interest in abandoning these <b>push</b> <b>type</b> systems and adopting the more current 2 ̆ 2 pull 2 ̆ 2 type systems such as 2 ̆ 2 just in time with Kanban 2 ̆ 2. ^ The difference between pull and push systems lies in the control structure. In the classical push system, a work center has no control on {{the arrival of the}} jobs to be processed. Once the processing of a job is completed, it immediately gets pushed to the next work center. Hence the inventories at a given work center in a push system consist of nonprocessed jobs. In a pull system, on the other hand, a work center has no control on the delivery dates (the date a job needs to be delivered) but can specify the time a job has to arrive to be processed. Hence in a pull system the inventories on a given work center consist of processed jobs, waiting to be pulled by the next work center. ^ Most research in the scheduling literature so far has focused on <b>push</b> <b>type</b> manufacturing systems. In this thesis we study and analyze two major scheduling problems which are relevant for pull type systems. The first problem considers the scheduling of jobs on a single machine without lot sizing. The second problem is similar to the first one except that both scheduling and lot sizing are done simultaneously. ^ We focus on The Single Machine Scheduling Problem. Extending the results to The Multiple Machine Scheduling Problem requires further research. Some ideas along this line are proposed. ...|$|R
