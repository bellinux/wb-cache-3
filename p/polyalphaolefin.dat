5000|$|Practically all polyolefins {{that are}} of any {{practical}} or commercial importance are poly-alpha-olefin (or poly-α-olefin or <b>polyalphaolefin,</b> sometimes abbreviated as PAO), a polymer made by polymerizing an alpha-olefin. An alpha-olefin (or α-olefin) is an alkene where the carbon-carbon double bond starts at the α-carbon atom, i.e. the double bond is between the #1 and #2 carbons in the molecule. Alpha-olefins such as 1-hexene {{may be used as}} co-monomers to give a alkyl branched polymer (see chemical structure below), although 1-decene is most commonly used for lubricant base stocks. [...] Many poly-alpha-olefins have flexible alkyl branching groups on every other carbon of their polymer backbone chain. These alkyl groups, which can shape themselves in numerous conformations, make it very difficult for the polymer molecules to align themselves up side-by-side in an orderly way. This results in lower contact surface area between the molecules and decreases the intermolecular interactions between molecules. Therefore, many poly-alpha-olefins do not crystallize or solidify easily and are able to remain oily, viscous liquids even at lower temperatures. [...] Low molecular weight poly-alpha-olefins are useful as synthetic lubricants such as synthetic motor oils for vehicles and can be used over a wide temperature range.|$|E

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} solubilities (C*) and volumetric liquid-side {{mass transfer}} coefficients (kLa) for He and N 2, as surrogates to H 2 and CO, and their mixtures were measured in a Silicone Oil and a SpectraSyn <b>Polyalphaolefin</b> as startup liquids in Fischer-Tropsch Slurry Bubble Column Reactors (SBCRs). The {{data were obtained}} within wide ranges of pressures (4 - 30 bar), temperatures (298 - 398 K) and mixing speeds (1000 - 1400 rpm) in one-gallon agitated ZipperClave reactor operating in the gas-inducing mode. The effects of different operating variables {{as well as the}} gas and liquid natures on C* and kLa for He and N 2 in the two liquids were discussed. The interpretation of the experimental results and calculations reveals the following: 	At constant temperature, the C* values of He and N 2 in the Silicone Oil and SpectraSyn <b>polyalphaolefin</b> increased non-linearly with the gas partial pressure and hence Henry’s Law was not applicable. 	Under similar pressures and temperatures, the C* values of both gases in the Silicone Oil were greater than those in the SpectraSyn polyalphaolefin; and C* values of N 2 were greater than those of He in both liquids. This behavior was attributed to the differences among the Hildebrand solubility parameters calculated for the gases and liquids used. 	The kLa values of both gases in the two liquids increased with the mixing speed, gas partial pressure and system temperature which was related to the increase of both the gas-liquid interfacial area (a) and the liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (kL). Increasing mixing speed, gas partial pressure and system temperature increased the gas holdup and decreased the liquid-phase viscosity and surface tension, leading to the formation of small gas bubbles and hence an increase of (a). Also, increasing mixing speed and system temperature increased the turbulence and the gas diffusivity in the liquid, resulting in an increase of (kL). 	Under similar pressure, temperature and mixing speed, the kLa values of He in the two liquids were greater than those of N 2. This behavior was because at the same temperature the diffusivities of He in both liquids were greater than those of N 2 and hence (kL) He and consequently (kLa) He values were greater than those of N 2 in both liquids, knowing that kL ∝ (DAB) n, n = 1 for the two-film theory and 0. 5 for the penetration theory. 	Unlike gas solubilities, kLa values of He were lower in Silicone Oil than those in the SpectraSyn <b>Polyalphaolefin,</b> whereas the opposite was true in the case of N 2. This behavior was attributed to the lower He and N 2 diffusivities in Silicone Oil than in the SpectraSyn <b>Polyalphaolefin,</b> resulting in small kL values for both gases. On the other hand, the higher viscosity of Silicone Oil than that of the SpectraSyn <b>Polyalphaolefin</b> was expected to enhance the formation of large bubbles with small gas-liquid interfacial area (a). This was true {{in the case of the}} light He where smaller kL and, a values in the more viscous liquid (Silicone Oil) resulted in lower kLa values. In the case of N 2, however, it seems that the induced heavy N 2 bubbles were broken by the impeller and scattered throughout the reactor, leading to the formation of small bubbles with large gas-liquid interfacial area (a). Thus, the small kL values of N 2 in the more viscous liquid (Silicone Oil) were overcame by its larger a values, leading to the higher kLa than those in the less viscous (SpectraSyn <b>polyalphaolefin).</b> 	Five liquids, namely Silicone oil, SpectraSyn <b>polyalphaolefin,</b> reactor wax, n-tetradecane and paraffins mixture, were explored as potential startup liquids for the F-T synthesis in SBCRs at 410 K and 15 bars at two α values, 0. 85 and 0. 92. This investigation indicated that the SpectraSyn <b>polyalphaolefin</b> cloud remain in the reactor for over 200 hr, whereas the paraffins mixture would remain only for about 100 hr. This behavior was related to the startup liquid molecular weight, which was the main factor controlling its residence time in the SBCRs. ...|$|E

30|$|Lubricant is a {{substance}} (often a liquid) reduces the friction and wear when introduced between two moving surfaces. A lubricant provides a protective film {{which allows for}} two touching surfaces to be separated and thus lessening the friction between them. Hence, in internal combustion engines lubricant is very essential for longer life of the engine. Lubricants are generally composed {{of a majority of}} base oil plus a variety of additives to impart desirable characteristics. The types of the lubricant depend upon the types of base oils. The base oils may be mineral (petroleum originated), synthetic (<b>polyalphaolefins,</b> polyalkylene glycols, synthetic esters, silicones etc.) or vegetable (sunflower oil, soybean oil, palm oil etc.). When the base oil is a vegetable oil, then the lubricant is known as biolubricant, in case of synthetic oil it is called synthetic lubricant and when the base oil is mineral or petroleum based then the lubricant is known as mineral lubricant. Most of the lubricants used today are mineral or petroleum based and are a mixture of paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Nowadays, with increasing environmental pollution although it is essential to use vegetable oils as base fluid rather than mineral oil or synthetic ester based oils, but due to the poor oxidative and hydrolytic stability, high temperature sensitivity of tribological behavior, poor cold flow properties and high cost vegetable oils are very limitedly used as base oils for industrial lubricants [1, 2].

Two types of tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) DLC coatings (of varying thickness and surface morphology) and seven hydraulic oils (of different API groups and additive packages) were tested. Different tribological test configurations used were steel cylinders against DLC coated steel discs (non-conformal line contact) under reciprocating sliding motion; cast iron blocks against DLC coated steel rings (non-conformal line contact) under unidirectional sliding motion; and cast iron pins against DLC coated steel discs (conformal area contact) under unidirectional sliding motion. As the contact configuration changed, coating characteristics (including roughness and hardness) influenced the tribological performance of the different coating-lubricant combinations tested.

40|$|M. Sc. The {{development}} of synthetic lubricants was the logical result of high demands {{being made by}} modern technology, the exhaustion of natural mineral oil sources {{and the search for}} environmentally friendly substances. Alpha olefins are products of the Sasol Fischer-Tropsch process and are currently part of the wider petrol pool. Substantial value can be added to the alpha olefins by the production of high value <b>polyalphaolefins</b> (PADs). This project was aimed at finding explanations for previous unsuccessful attempts to produce acceptable PADs from Sasol feedstreams. High priority was given to the modification of experimental procedures to produce a synthetic oil that conforms to specific standards. Oxygenates, aromatics and "other than alpha" olefins (branched, internal and cyclic olefins) were identified as problem components in the Sasol feedstream. These compounds led to early termination of oligomerisation and in the presence of BF 3, unwanted compounds were even incorporated into the PAD products. The feedstream was thus purified by distillation and a MeDH/H 2 D extraction procedure. As a result, better reaction control (with regard to oligomer distribution) was gained and the product quality improved. Reaction conditions were optimised and basic reaction models (to predict oligomer distributions) were developed. It became clear however, that product quality did not only depend on oligomer distribution, but also on the specific structures present in the various oligomers. GC analyses showed that each oligomer consists of a great number of isomers - even more than can be explained in terms of the classic cationic mechanism for oligomerisation. GC-MS analyses could not successfully distinguish between different branched isomers, because of the complexity of the mixture. Summary The question was asked whether the complex mixture has already been formed during the primary oligomerisation process, or at a later stage by skeletal rearrangements. Research work indicated that one can distinguish between a primary (normal oligomerisation) process, and a secondary process (skeletal rearrangement). It became clear that the secondary process is favoured by specific reaction conditions (e. g. long reaction times and high co-catalyst concentrations). The formation of isomers increased under these conditions and product quality was adversely affected. The possibility to produce PAD products from Sasol feedstreams identical to commercial products still exists, and necessitate further research work...|$|R

With thermocouples affixed {{to the surface and}} placed in the inlet and outlet tubing, data was gathered and analyzed to quantify module effectiveness in dissipating heat over a variety of power input settings and coolant flow rates.

30|$|Using an MFT-R 4000 tester at room temperature, the leaf-surface wax of two desert plants, Ammopiptanthus mongolicus (AM) and Reaumuria soongorica (RS), was {{extracted}} {{and evaluated}} for its {{potential as a}} lubricant additive in <b>polyalphaolefin</b> (PAO) for steel-steel contact. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify {{the composition of the}} AM leaf-surface wax, and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to investigate its friction mechanisms. The results suggest that the leaf-surface wax could successfully reduce the friction and wear of steel-steel sliding pairs compared with PAO containing molybdenum dithiocarbamate additives. AM, in particular, showed high-performance wear resistance and friction-reducing properties. Its excellent tribological properties were attributed to the wax composition of leaf-surface fatty acids, alcohol, and esters.|$|E
