One function of the Johnston’s organ is for detecting the wing beat frequency of a mate. Production of sound in air results in two energy components: the <b>pressure</b> <b>component,</b> which is changes in air pressure emanating away from the source of the sound; and the particle displacement component, which is the back and forth vibration of air particles oscillating in the direction of sound propagation. Particle displacement has greater energy loss than the <b>pressure</b> <b>component,</b> so the displacement component, called “near-field sound,” is detectable only within one wavelength of the source.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} spherical, hydrostatic {{models of}} dense molecular cores and Bok globules {{consisting of two}} distinct, spatially separate gas components: a central, isothermal region surrounded by a negative-index, polytropic envelope. The clouds are supported against their own self-gravity {{by a combination of}} thermal, mean magnetic, and turbulent wave pressure. The latter two are included by allowing for locally adiabatic, non-isentropic <b>pressure</b> <b>components.</b> Such models are meant to represent, in a schematic manner, the velocity and density structure of cores and globules, as inferred from molecular line and dust continuum observations. In addition, our picture reflects the theoretical expectation that MHD wave motions, which are important at scales> 0. 1 pc in typical low-mass star-forming regions, are damped at smaller scales, giving rise to a finite-sized, thermally-dominated core region. We show that if the <b>pressure</b> <b>components</b> are isentropic, then the pressure drop from the center {{to the edge of the}} composite polytropes we consider is limited to 197, the square of the value for the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. If the <b>pressure</b> <b>components</b> are non-isentropic, it is possible to have arbitrarily large pressure drops, in agreement with the results of McKee & Holliman (1999). However, we find that even for non-isentropic <b>pressure</b> <b>components,</b> the ratio of the mean to surface pressure in the composite polytropes we consider is less than 4. We show by explicit construction that it is possible to have dense cores comparable to the Jeans mass embedded in stable clouds of much larger mass. In a subsequent paper, we show that composite polytropes on the verge of gravitational instability can reproduce the observed velocity and density structure of cores and globules under a variety of physical conditions...|$|R
50|$|Insects, such as {{fruit flies}} and bees, detect near field sounds using loosely {{attached}} hairs or antennae which vibrate with air particle movement. (Tympanal organs detect the <b>pressure</b> <b>component</b> of sound.) Near-field sound, {{because of the}} rapid dissipation of energy, is suitable only for very close communication. Two examples of near-field sound communication are bee’s waggle dance and Drosophila courtship songs. In fruit flies, the arista of the antennae and the third segment act as the sound receiver. Vibrations of the receiver cause rotation of the third segment, which channels sound input to the mechanoreceptors of the Johnston’s Organ.|$|E

50|$|The {{magnitude}} of the exhaust scavenging effect is a direct function of the velocity of the high and medium pressure components of the exhaust pulse. Performance headers work to increase the exhaust velocity as much as possible. One technique is tuned-length primary tubes. This technique attempts to time the occurrence of each exhaust pulse, to occur {{one after the other}} in succession while still in the exhaust system. The lower pressure tail of an exhaust pulse then serves to create a greater pressure difference between the high pressure head of the next exhaust pulse, thus increasing the velocity of that exhaust pulse. In V6 and V8 engines where {{there is more than one}} exhaust bank, 'Y-pipes' and 'X-pipes' work on the same principle of using the low <b>pressure</b> <b>component</b> of an exhaust pulse to increase the velocity of the next exhaust pulse.|$|E

5000|$|In 1949, the Czech {{engineer}} Jiří Vackář {{published a}} paper {{on the design of}} stable variable-frequency oscillators (VFO). The paper discussed many stability issues such as variations with temperature, atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> <b>component</b> aging, and microphonics. For example, Vackář describes making inductors by first heating the wire and then winding the wire on a stable ceramic coil form. The resulting inductor has a temperature coefficient of 6 to 8 parts per million per degree Celsius. [...] Vackář points out that common air variable capacitors have a stability of 2 parts per thousand; to build a VFO with a stability of 50 parts per million requires that the variable capacitor is only 1/40 of the tuning capacity (.002/40 = 50ppm). The stability requirement also implies the variable capacitor may only tune a limited range of 1:1.025. Larger tuning ranges require switching stable fixed capacitors or inductors.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} {{component is}} caused by water drawing heat {{away from the body}} and causing vasoconstriction of the cutaneous blood vessels within the body to conserve heat. The body detects an increase in the blood pressure and inhibits the release of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH)), causing an increase in the production of urine. The <b>pressure</b> <b>component</b> {{is caused by}} the hydrostatic pressure of the water directly increasing blood pressure. Its significance is indicated {{by the fact that the}} temperature of the water does not substantially affect the rate of diuresis. Partial immersion of only the limbs does not cause increased urination. Thus, the hand in warm water trick (immersing the hand of a sleeping person in water to make him/her urinate) has no support from the mechanism of immersion diuresis. On the other hand, sitting up to the neck in a pool for a few hours clearly increases the excretion of water, salts, and urea.|$|E
5000|$|The mask {{required}} to deliver CPAP {{must have an}} effective seal, and be held on very securely. The [...] "nasal pillow" [...] mask maintains its seal by being inserted slightly into the nostrils and being {{held in place by}} various straps around the head. Some full-face masks [...] "float" [...] on the face like a hover-craft, with thin, soft, flexible [...] "curtains" [...] ensuring less skin abrasion, and the possibility of coughing and yawning. Some people may find wearing a CPAP mask uncomfortable or constricting: eyeglass wearers and bearded men may prefer the nasal-pillow type of mask. Breathing out against the positive pressure resistance (the expiratory positive airway <b>pressure</b> <b>component,</b> or EPAP) may also feel unpleasant to some patients. These factors lead to inability to continue treatment due to patient intolerance in about 20% of cases where it is initiated. Some machines have pressure relief technologies that makes sleep therapy more comfortable by reducing pressure at the beginning of exhalation and returning to therapeutic pressure just before inhalation. The level of pressure relief is varied based on the patient’s expiratory flow, making breathing out against the pressure less difficult. Those who suffer an anxiety disorder or claustrophobia are less likely to tolerate PAP treatment. Sometimes medication will be given to assist with the anxiety caused by PAP ventilation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor a half century, the {{calculation}} of local <b>pressure</b> <b>components</b> and surface tension along the normal to the surface {{have been carried out}} using mechanical definitions. This has led to three principal definitions: Irving and Kirkwood, Harasima and Kirkwood-Buff. Recently, thermodynamic definitions based on the energy calculation have been introduced to compute the local properties. We propose here to compare both definitions for Lennard-Jones particles interacting through a truncated and shifted potential. For this, two locations of the pairwise interaction involved in {{the calculation}} of the local <b>pressure</b> <b>components</b> and surface tension within the thermodynamic routes are investigated. For the first time, we show that the thermodynamic definition suffers, to one least degree with respect to the mechanical definition, from the same ambiguity. From a numerical standpoint, thermodynamic definition is more simple and less computationally expensive. Therefore, with the complicated potential, the thermodynamic approach appears to be most interesting to compute macroscopic and local pressure and surface tension...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is {{interesting}} to ask how a confinement scale affects the thermalization of strongly coupled gauge theories with gravity duals. We study this question for the AdS soliton model, which underlies top-down holographic models for Yang-Mills theory and QCD. Injecting energy via a homogeneous massless scalar source that is briefly turned on, our fully backreacted numerical analysis finds two regimes. Either a black brane forms, possibly after one or more bounces, after which the <b>pressure</b> <b>components</b> relax according to the lowest quasinormal mode. Or the scalar shell keeps scattering, {{in which case the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>components</b> oscillate and undergo modulation on time scales independent of the (small) shell amplitude. We show analytically that the scattering shell cannot relax to a homogeneous equilibrium state, and explain the modulation as due to a near-resonance between a normal mode frequency of the metric and the frequency with which the scalar shell oscillates.

Using the exact transfer-matrix method the transverse and longitudinal <b>pressure</b> <b>components</b> and the correlation function are determined numerically. Fluid-solid phase transition {{does not occur}} even in the widest tube, where the method just loses its exactness, but {{the appearance of the}} dramatic change in the equation of state and the longitudinal correlation function shows that the system undergoes a structural change from a fluid to a solid-like order. The <b>pressure</b> <b>components</b> show that the collisions are dominantly longitudinal at low densities, while they are transverse in the vicinity of close packing density. The transverse correlation function shows that the size of solid-like domains grows exponentially with increasing pressure and the correlation length diverges at close packing.
