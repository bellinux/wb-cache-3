500|$|Following the {{suspension}} of operations at {{three out of four}} BPI plants, members of the media and leaders were invited by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to tour the BPI facility that remained open in South Sioux City, Nebraska. The founders of BPI gave campaign contributions to Branstad in 2010, and to other candidates' campaigns. Branstad stated to ABC News that the contributions were not a factor in his decision regarding having the event. Texas Governor Rick Perry, Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Rick Sheehy, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, and South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Matt Michels, toured the South Sioux City, Nebraska, plant in an attempt to allay [...] "inaccurate information" [...] that they stated as having caused [...] "an unnecessary panic among consumers". The publicity tour emerged with the promotional slogan, [...] "Dude, it's beef!" [...] News reporters were not allowed to ask employees at BPI any questions during the tour. BPI asserts that social media and ABC News [...] "grossly misrepresented" [...] their product. BPI eventually sued ABC News for defamation. On March 28, 2012, Branstad stated, [...] "The <b>problem</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> take this off the market, then we end up with a fatter product that's going to cost more and it's going to increase the obesity problem in this country". Safeway and other retailers that have removed the product from their shelves or product lines have stated they will not raise the price of their beef. Branstad also stated that he would recommend that Iowa state public schools continue to use ground beef which contains the product, and stated plans to [...] "send a letter to the state's public schools, encouraging them to continue to buy LFTB".|$|E

5000|$|In an April 2012 interview, {{aired on}} MSNBC, Lovelock {{stated that he}} had been [...] "alarmist", using the words “All right, I made a mistake,” about the timing of climate change and noted the {{documentary}} An Inconvenient Truth and the book The Weather Makers as examples of the same kind of alarmism. Lovelock still believes the climate to be warming although the rate of change is not as he once thought, he admitted {{that he had been}} “extrapolating too far." [...] He believes that climate change is still happening, but it will be felt farther in the future. Of the claims “the science is settled” on global warming he states: [...] "One thing that being a scientist has taught me is that you can never be certain about anything. You never know the truth. You can only approach it and hope to get a bit nearer to it each time. You iterate towards the truth. You don’t know it." [...] He criticizes environmentalists for treating global warming like a religion. [...] “It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion,” Lovelock observed [...] “I don’t think people have noticed that, but it’s got all the sort of terms that religions use … The greens use guilt. That just shows how religious greens are. You can’t win people round by saying they are guilty for putting (carbon dioxide) in the air.” In the MSNBC article Lovelock is quoted as proclaiming: [...] "The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> don't know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books - mine included - because it looked clear-cut, but it hasn’t happened;" [...] he continues [...] "The climate is doing its usual tricks. There’s nothing much really happening yet. We were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now," [...] he said [...] The world has not warmed up very much since the millennium. Twelve years is a reasonable time ... it (the temperature) has stayed almost constant, whereas it should have been rising - carbon dioxide is rising, no question about that", he added. [...] In a follow up interview Lovelock stated his support for natural gas; he now favors fracking as a low-polluting alternative to coal. He opposes the concept of [...] "sustainable development", where modern economies might be powered by wind turbines, calling it meaningless drivel. He keeps a poster of a wind turbine to remind himself how much he detests them.|$|E

In 17 out of 19 OECD countries work-related mental problems are up. Surveys of individuals show that the worst time in their day is when they are in the presence of their line manager 28. We need better job design and a more pro-active way of handling absence.

40|$|Abstract We {{start with}} Fodor’s {{critique}} of cognitive science in [8]: {{he argues that}} much mental activity cannot be handled by the current methods of cognitive science because it is nonmonotonic and, therefore, is global in nature, is not context-free, and is thus not capable of being formalised by a Turing-like mental architecture. We look at the use of non-monotonic logic in the Artificial Intelligence community, particularly with {{the discussion of the}} so-called “frame problem”. The mainstream approach to the frame <b>problem</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> argue, probably susceptible to Fodor’s critique: however, there is an alternative approach, due to McCain and Turner, which is, when suitably reformulated, not susceptible. In the course of our argument, we give a proof theory for the McCain-Turner system, and show that it satisfies cut elimination. We have two substantive conclusions: firstly, that Fodor’s argument depends on assumptions about logical form which not all non-monotonic theories satisfy; and, secondly, that metatheory plays an important rol...|$|E
