40|$|Overall, CloudSat {{gives an}} unparalleled {{view of a}} slice through {{the eye of a}} {{hurricane}} and a cross section of precipitation through the hurricane. Although there are only 32 overpasses of the earth each day, CloudSat has made seven eye hits of hurricanes and seven eye wall grazes. A statistical analysis predicts that one would expect 9 eye hits for a 29 hurricane season. The common features of the eye such as the spiral rainbands and the stadium structure of the eye wall boundary help identify a pass near the eye. There is very heavy rain in the eyewall, {{so much so that the}} radar return is completely absorbed several km above the ocean surface at a rainfall rate of 30 mm/hr. This also helps to identify an eye wall graze. Precipitation areas of NH hurricanes Hurricanes cover large areas which are profiled by a latitude slice with CloudSat. The CloudSat slices through the hurricanes were used to estimate the area covered by rainfall and drizzle in each hurricane. These slices were used to calculate the average area covered by precipitation in each of the eight events. This was then used as the mean area for the 29 hurricanes in 2006. The season covered 24 weeks and each storm lasted typically a week. A mean duration of one week was used, so there was on average, one storm active in the NH belt from 0 to 20 degrees N continuously during the season.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to {{study the effects of}} changes in precipitation amounts by intercepting water with PVC gutters and redirecting the water to adjacent plots. The net effect over two years was to redirect about 25 % of the available water to one plot and restrict it to another. Additional <b>precipitation</b> increased <b>diameter</b> growth, litterfall and fine tootbiomass...|$|R
50|$|Rhizoliths are root {{systems that}} have been encased in mineral matter. Rhizoliths are created through {{processes}} of chemical weathering, decomposition, reprecipitation and cementation. Rhizoliths are formed through the transport of dissolved Ca2+ and HCO3− enhancing the CaCO3 <b>precipitation</b> in a <b>diameter</b> of up to several centimeters around the roots. This is possible on calcareous sediments, where high amounts of Ca2+ in the rhizosphere {{can lead to the}} formation of encrustations around roots termed rhizoliths.|$|R
50|$|The {{intensity}} of the radar echoes (reflectivity) {{is proportional to the}} form (water or ice) of the <b>precipitation</b> and its <b>diameter.</b> In fact, rain has much stronger reflective power than snow but its diameter is much smaller. So the reflectivity of rain coming from melted snow is only slightly higher. However, in the layer where the snow is melting, the wet flakes still have a large diameter and are coated with water so the returns to the radar is much stronger.|$|R
40|$|Tough, {{moisture}} resistant laminating resins for employment with graphite fibers were developed. The new laminating resins exhibited cost, handleability and processing characteristics equivalent to 394 K (250 F) curing epoxies. The laminating resins {{were based on}} bisphenol A dicyanate and monofunctional cyanates with hydrophobic substituents. These resins sorb only small quantities of moisture at equilibrium (0. 5 % or less) with minimal glass transition temperature depression and represent an improvement over epoxies which sorb around 2 % moisture at equilibrium. Toughening was accomplished by the <b>precipitation</b> of small <b>diameter</b> particles of butadiene nitrile rubber throughout the resin matrix. The rubber domains act as microcrack termini and energy dissipation sites, allowing increased stress accommodation prior to catastrophic failure. A unique blend of amine terminated butadiene nitrile elastomer (MW 2, 000) and a high nitrile content butadiene nitrile rubber yielded the desired resin morphology...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Radial {{immunodiffusion}} and electroimmunodiffusion {{were used}} to measure thyroglobulin, {{the main component of}} thyroid colloid, in thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsies. A linear relationship was established between <b>precipitation</b> ring <b>diameter</b> and thyroglobulin concentration by radial immunodiffusion (0. 5 - 3. 0 g/ 1), and between "rocket " height and thyroglobulin concentration by electroimmunodiffusion (0. 1 - 2. 0 g/ 1). A nearly com-plete correlation was observed between the two methods (r = 0. 97). In radial immunodiffusion the ring diameter is dependent on time of diffusion and on the antiserum concentration in the agar gel. In this study, the observation time was standardised at 48 h, and the rabbit anti-thyroglobulin serum concentration at 26 ml/ 1. The intrathyroidal concentration of thyroglobulin was determined by radial irrummodiffusion and the thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy of 45 thyroid tumours with different cytological-laboratory- and clinical diagnoses. It was found that in colloid nodules or cysts thyroglobulin is markedly higher than in euthyroid nodular goitre (13. 7 ± 11. 9 g/ 1 vs 1. 35 ± 0. 8 g/l, p = 0. 005). In conclusion radial immunodiffusion and electroimmunodiffusion are precise, easy to perform, low cost, non polluting methods, which do not require high sample dilution (in contrast, high sample dilution is necessary for measurement of thyroglobulin in thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy by radial immunodiffusion). Measurement of thyroglobulin in thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy provides a quantitative estimate of colloid, an important marker in the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the use of}} inkjet printing technology to fabricate a flexible microstrip antenna. The antenna is printed on a flexible PET foil (Polyethylene terephthalate) using silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles were synthetized by the solvothermal <b>precipitation</b> technique. The <b>diameter</b> of the prepared silver nanoparticles ranges from 20 to 200 nm measured {{with the help of}} the SEM analysis. In addition, the ink formulation for printing of a homogenous and electrically conductive layer was further prepared using silver nanoparticles. The printed antenna operates in two frequency bands of 2. 02 GHz (- 16. 02 db) and 2. 3 GHz (- 19. 33 db). The antenna is flexible and weigh is only 0. 208 g and is suitable for electronic devices of a very low weight, such as wearable electronic devices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|High-strength {{low-alloy}} steel (HSLA) {{is a type}} of alloy steel that provides better mechanical properties or greater resistance to corrosion than carbon steel. HSLA steels vary from other steels in that they are not made to meet a specific chemical composition but rather to specific mechanical properties. They have a carbon content between 0.05-0.25% to retain formability and weldability. Other alloying elements include up to 2.0% manganese and small quantities of copper, nickel, niobium, nitrogen, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, calcium, rare earth elements, or zirconium. Copper, titanium, vanadium, and niobium are added for strengthening purposes. These elements are intended to alter the microstructure of carbon steels, which is usually a ferrite-pearlite aggregate, to produce a very fine dispersion of alloy carbides in an almost pure ferrite matrix. This eliminates the toughness-reducing effect of a pearlitic volume fraction yet maintains and increases the material's strength by refining the grain size, which in the case of ferrite increases yield strength by 50% for every halving of the mean grain <b>diameter.</b> <b>Precipitation</b> strengthening plays a minor role, too. Their yield strengths can be anywhere between [...] Because of their higher strength and toughness HSLA steels usually require 25 to 30% more power to form, as compared to carbon steels.|$|R
40|$|Number–size {{distributions}} of aerosol particles with diameters of 10 – 500 nm {{in the marine}} boundary layer were observed continually onboard the R/V Hakuho Maru over the equatorial and subtropical North Pacific and South Pacific during December 2011 –March 2012. Number–size distributions over each area were parameterized using a sum of up to three lognormal functions. Bi-modal size distributions with peak diameters at 30 – 80 nm (Aitken mode) and 100 – 200 nm (accumulation mode) were observed frequently. Larger peak diameters of Aitken and accumulation modes were observed over the eastern equator, where 5 -day backward trajectories showed that the air masses had derived from high-chlorophyll oceanic regions without <b>precipitation.</b> Smaller peak <b>diameters</b> and low concentrations were often observed over the North Pacific. The trajectories show that such air mass originated from oceanic regions with less chlorophyll, exhibiting high precipitation frequency. New particle formation (NPF) events have often been observed over the mid-latitude eastern South Pacific with a low condensation sink (CS) and some dimethyl sulfide, although none was observed over the equator, where CS was higher. The lesser CS condition at NPF events was mostly correlated with local precipitation or precipitation along the trajectories within 1 day. These results suggest that differences of the number–size distribution and occasions of NPF events among sea areas most closely accord with precipitation along the trajectories...|$|R
40|$|In {{semi-arid}} areas vegetation {{is scarce}} and often dominated by individual shrubs on raised mounds. The processes of formation of these mounds are diverse and still debated. Often, shrub mound formation {{is directly related}} to the formation of vegetation patterns, thereby assuming that shrub mound formation is driven by biological interactions. We hypothesize that water-related erosion and sedimentation are also important drivers of shrub mound formation in the Northern Negev Desert of Israel. We test this hypothesis by combining field observations with model simulations. We studied shrub mounds in the semi-arid catchment of Sayeret Shaked in the Northern Negev Desert (200 mm annual <b>precipitation).</b> Height and <b>diameter</b> of shrub-canopy and shrub mounds were measured and micro-morphological techniques were used to reconstruct the formation of the shrub mounds. We used landscape evolution model LAPSUS to simulate shrub mound formation at short (single precipitation event) and longer (100 years) timescales at different slope angles. Both field and model results indicate that shrub mounds in Sayeret Shaked are at least partly formed by redeposition of eroded material below the shrubs, and by erosion and lowering of the surrounding crust. Additional model simulations suggest that mounds are formed most under low shrub density and large shrub-canopy diameter. Shrub mound formation increases with slope. In dryer and wetter climates than the studied 200 mm rainfall semi-arid climate zone, shrub mound formation is less likel...|$|R
40|$|Zinc Oxide (ZnO) is a {{promising}} material {{for future use}} in both solar cells as a transparent conductive oxide, in addition to a range of other electrical applications, due to its low cost, transparency, and electrical properties. Using ion implantation group IV elements Si and Ge have been implanted into a ZnO matrix, and annealed at a broad range of temperatures to monitor the lattice disorder caused by implantation, dopant characteristics, and potential for formation of nanostructures. Si implanted ZnO shows promising defect annihilation, and a crystal quality very close to that of virgin ZnO after annealing at 800 C. In addition donor activation is indicated already at room temperature by SSRM and hall effect measurements, making Si {{a promising}} candidate for implantation processing in ZnO. Ge implanted material shows similar dopant properties as Si, but high amounts of implantation damage, and precipitation of new phases at higher annealing temperatures makes it less suited for implantation doping. However, interesting observations have been done using TEM imaging, EELS, and EDS on precipitates formed during annealing at 800 C and 1000 C. Ge <b>precipitations</b> with a <b>diameter</b> of 10 nm enclosed by Zn 2 GeO 4 is indicated by EELS and EDS after annealing at 800 C. After 1000 C Ge precipitations seem to be fully oxidized into Zn 2 GeO 4, and 100 nm long and 20 nm wide rods of the same material, as well as other particle shapes of varied sizes, are observed using TEM imaging, and is further indicated by XRD...|$|R
