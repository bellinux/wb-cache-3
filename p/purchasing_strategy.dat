40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to further {{understand}} the relationship between <b>purchasing</b> <b>strategies</b> practiced by less-powerful buyers and their purchasing power. Drawn on the resource dependency theory, a two-way relationship was predicted where power is both a cause and an effect. The theoretical predictions were then explored in a multiple-case study in the context of vaccine procurement for developing countries. This context presents an asymmetric power situation, favoring suppliers, and changes some of the basic assumptions of theories used; i. e. nonprofit, public procurement, and end customer satisfaction. Cases were selected to represent different strategies towards similar power constraints. The results of the study indicated that <b>purchasing</b> <b>strategies</b> were set in response to individual constraints from sources of purchasing power, and not in response to the power positions as the cumulative effect of all sources of power.

40|$|The top {{management}} of the Kverneland Group, a Norwegian MNC which develops, produces and distributes agricultural machinery, wants to improve the performance of its spare parts supply chain and considers making some adjustments of its current <b>purchasing</b> <b>strategy.</b> In the present setting, all spare parts which are needed at the central warehouse are ordered from the Kverneland factories which developed the machines to which the respective parts belong. However, {{since most of the}} spare parts are not manufactured inhouse by Kverneland factories but produced externally, the factories usually have to order the required parts from external suppliers on behalf of the warehouse. According to the proposed future <b>purchasing</b> <b>strategy,</b> the warehouse would order the parts directly from the external suppliers and they would also be delivered directly to the warehouse. Against this background, this thesis analyzes possible consequences of a change from the current to the future setting for the Kverneland Group, the Business Area After Sales and the Kverneland factories. The proposed <b>purchasing</b> <b>strategy</b> would especially affect the administrative ordering and physical order handling activities which are currently executed by the factories on behalf of the warehouse.

40|$|Setting up an {{international}} purchasing office (IPO) {{is one of}} the key steps for firms doing global sourcing. This paper aims to explore the relationship between strategy and structure in a contemporary global purchasing context. We build a theory of IPOs, employing a case study method to address two research questions-what types of IPOs exist in China? And how may an IPO become strategic to its parent's global purchasing? We identify three types or clusters of IPOs along four dimensions: motives for sourcing from China; global <b>purchasing</b> <b>strategy</b> for China; IPO structure and IPO followership. We present a causal model and associated propositions to explain how an IPO may become more strategic for its parent company. In the model we identify that, in addition to the direct link of 'structure follows strategy', IPO followership can be an underlying construct, linking IPO structure and global <b>purchasing</b> <b>strategy</b> for China. The paper opens up new avenues for global sourcing research and provides new insights for managers on global <b>purchasing</b> <b>strategy,</b> specifically with respect to IPO organisational design and capabilities...|$|E
