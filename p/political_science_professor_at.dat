25|$|On March 12, 2009, 115 {{supporters}} of Abdelrazik presented {{a ticket for}} his flight to the Canadian government. The government's position was {{that he needed to}} have a pre-paid flight ticket, but that any Canadian who donated money to purchase such a ticket could be charged under Canadian anti-terrorism legislation implementing the Security Council's sanctions against people on their blacklist. The donors included former solicitor-general Warren Allmand, <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of Toronto Joseph Carens, and Canadian peace activist and former Iraq hostage James Loney.|$|E
25|$|The ongoing {{involvement}} of the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan may also influence voters. Desmond Morton, a <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> McGill University suggested that the Conservatives could be blamed for the war because they have extended the mission twice, {{despite the fact that}} it was then Liberal Leader Jean Chrétien who was Canada's prime minister when Canada's current military involvement in Afghanistan first started in 2001. Both the Conservatives and Liberals have at various times agreed to extend the mission(s) to at least 2011, so this may result in some Canadians who are strongly against Canada's ongoing involvement, who might have otherwise typically voted either Liberal or Conservative in the past, to take their votes elsewhere in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Diệm {{applied for}} {{permission}} to travel to Rome for the Holy Year celebrations at the Vatican. After gaining French permission, he left in August 1950 with his older brother, Bishop Ngô Đình Thục. Before going to Europe, Diệm went to Japan, where he met with Prince Cường Để, his former ally, and discussed Cường Để's efforts to return to Vietnam and his capacity to play some roles in his homeland. Diệm's friend also managed to organize a meeting between him and Wesley Fishel, an American <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> University of California who was working for CIA in Japan. Fishel was a proponent of the anti-colonial, anti-communist third force doctrine in Asia and was impressed with Diệm and helped him organize connections in the United States. In 1951, Diệm flew to the United States to seek the support of government officials. Nevertheless, Diệm was not successful in winning the US support for Vietnamese anti-communists. He continued on and flew to Europe.|$|E

500|$|Pat Buchanan, the {{conservative}} columnist who challenged President Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries, came to Ohio {{to campaign for}} McEwen, as did Vice President Dan Quayle and Oliver North. Though George H. W. Bush won the district, McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland {{in the general election}} on November 3. While he won 55-45 in the area he once represented, McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller's district, losing the unfamiliar territory 59-41. Strickland received 122,720 votes to McEwen's 119,252, a plurality of only 3,468. [...] "I think McEwen's loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance," [...] said Alfred Tuchfarber, a <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll. [...] "He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn't go down well in a poor district." [...] Strickland said, [...] "I ran against Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, the National Rifle Association and Right-to-Life. They threw everything at me. I'm just so happy I beat back those guys.

Otherwise you don't go there." [...] On April 25, 2014, Bevin apologized for attending the event, saying [...] "I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event which, other than my comments, appears to have primarily involved a discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many Kentucky voters. I understand that concern. I am not and have never been a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty." [...] The Daily Beast said the issue could be the [...] "nail in the coffin" [...] for Bevin's campaign, while The Washington Post wrote, [...] "On its own, the cockfighting story isn't enough to sink Bevin's campaign. But viewed {{in the context of the}} string of other distractions he's had to deal with, it reinforces the reality that his campaign is in serious need of repairs down the stretch." ...|$|E

On 16 February 2012, an inspection by {{officials of the}} Buildings Department revealed a basement with an area of more than 2200 square feet (11 m by 19 m) that was not documented in the approved floor plan. Tang admitted {{at a press conference}} that he was aware of the construction of an illegal basement at his family house and said that it was his wife's idea.

500|$|Some legal scholars, {{opposed to}} the idea that jus soli should apply to the {{children}} of illegal aliens, have argued that the Wong Kim Ark precedent does not apply when alien parents are in the country illegally. [...] John C. Eastman, a former dean of the Chapman University School of Law, has argued that Wong Kim Ark does not entitle U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to gain automatic citizenship because, in his opinion, being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States requires a status of [...] "full and complete jurisdiction" [...] that does not apply to aliens who are in the country illegally. [...] Eastman further argues that the Wong Kim Ark decision was fundamentally flawed in the way it dealt with the concept of jurisdiction, and that the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924—which followed Wong Kim Ark—would not have been necessary if Congress had believed [...] "that the Citizenship Clause confers citizenship merely by accident of birth." [...] A similar analysis of the jurisdiction question has been proposed by Professor Peter H. Schuck of the Yale School of Law and Rogers M. Smith, <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Yale. According to law professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas, even if Wong Kim Ark settled the status of children of legal residents, it did not do so for children of illegal residents; Graglia asserts that the case weighs against automatic birthright for illegal immigrants because the Court denied such citizenship for an analogous group, namely [...] "children of alien enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation". [...] Richard Posner, a judge of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, has also criticized the granting of citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, suggesting that Congress can and should act to change this policy. [...] Charles Wood, former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on immigration, has also opposed the practice, urging (in 1999) that it be stopped as quickly as possible, either by an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment.|$|E

5000|$|On April 8, 2011, Kyl {{spoke on}} the Senate floor and claimed that {{performing}} abortions is [...] "well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does." [...] Planned Parenthood responded that 90 percent of its services are to provide contraception, STD and cancer testing and treatment, and only 3 percent are abortion-related. A spokesperson for Kyl later claimed the senator’s remark [...] "was {{not intended to be}} a factual statement but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, an organization that receives millions in taxpayer dollars, does subsidize abortions." [...] Politifact noted that Planned Parenthood's numbers (from their most recent Annual Report, year ending June 30, 2009) are the result of self-reporting and that there is no national audit on such claims, but stated their belief that Kyl [...] "vastly overstated" [...] the number. A <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> writing <b>at</b> National Review Online suggested that perhaps Kyl's comments were based on the pregnancy-related services provided to pregnant women, citing Planned Parenthood's 2009 annual report figures and claiming that 98% of those services were for abortion.
