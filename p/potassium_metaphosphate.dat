50|$|Monopotassium {{phosphate}} {{can exist}} in several polymorphs. At room temperature it forms paraelectric crystals with tetragonal symmetry. Upon cooling to −150 °C it transforms to a ferroelectric phase of orthorhombic symmetry, and the transition temperature shifts up to −50 °C to when hydrogen {{is replaced by}} deuterium. Heating to 190 °C changes its structure to monoclinic. When heated further, MKP decomposes, by loss of water, to <b>potassium</b> <b>metaphosphate,</b> KPO3, at 400 °C (752 °F).|$|E

40|$|The {{condensed}} phosphates such as ammonium pyrophosphate, <b>potassium,</b> <b>metaphosphate,</b> ammonium polyphosphates {{are among the}} newest achievements {{in the domain of}} fertilizers (5, 6). Results of various experiments have shown that these fertilizers increase the yield in wheat, barley, maise, potato, sugar beat, bean and others (2, 3, 5). However, experiments in this field are few (3). In Lolium multiflorum the reactions of these forms of phosphorus were not illustrated in many cases, because the experiments had been carried out with salts of NH 4, K and Ca, where the effect was combined. The objective of this report is to present results of a series of greenhouse pot experiments...|$|E
40|$|During {{inhibition}} {{of the growth}} of Escherichia coli by sulfonamides, a diazotizable amine is formed (Fox, 1942). Following its isolation (Stet-ten and Fox, 1945) and identification as 4 -amino- 5 -imidiazolecarboxamide (Shive et al., 1947), its important roles in purine (Buchanan, 1952) and nucleic acid metabolism (Brown et al., 1952) were disclosed. Accordingly the relationships of the chief intracellular cation, potasium to growth, metabolism and the bacterial synthesis of this metabolite were investigated. The importance of potassium in cellular physiology has received an increasing apprecia-tion (McQuarrie, 1953; Sheppard, 1951). In contrast to sodium, potassium functions in nu-merous metabolic reactions. Its role in phosphorylations, i. e., in fructokinase, phos-phofructokinase, and pyruvate phosphopherase activity, as well as stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation, carbohydrate metabolism, res-piration, fatty acid oxidation, and decarboxyla-tion of malate has been reviewed (Lardy, 1951; Lehninger, 1950). <b>Potassium</b> also stimulates <b>metaphosphate</b> (Schmidt et al., 1949), acetoin (Nossal, 1952), and pantothenate formation (Maas, 1952); aldehyde dehydrogenase (Black, 1951) and lactase activity (Cohen and Monod, 1951); acetate activation by coenzyme A (Stadt-man, 1952); various oxidations (Quastel and Webley, 1942); and this cation is required for the growth of several microorganisms (MacLeod and Snell, 1947; Rahn, 1936; Falk, 1923) and other forms of life. The present study illustrates some aspects of the role that potassium exerts on the anabolic metabolism of E 8 cherichia coli.

40|$|A {{batch of}} very dry lithium {{metaphosphate}} glass, containing 1 % <b>potassium</b> <b>metaphosphate,</b> was prepared and dissolved completely in nearly pure heavy water. From this solution, {{a series of}} glasses with varying deuterium oxide content was prepared. The internal friction and dielectric loss data were taken. The amount of dissolved deuterium oxide was determined from the weight-loss of specimens during heating in vacuum, and checked by means of tritium labeling. It is found that dissolved deuterium oxide influences the internal friction and dielectric losses, in the same was as additions of dissimilar alkali ions do (mixed alkali effect) so that one can say that deuterium behaves similarly to alkali ions. A comparison of the present data {{with the results of}} a recent study on the influence of protons on the mechanical and electric properties in an identical host glass illustrates clearly that the mixed alkali effect is not governed by mass differences of the cations...|$|E
