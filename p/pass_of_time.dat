5000|$|One common way to {{call the}} Limón Creole English in Costa Rica is by the term [...] "Patois", a word was used {{initially}} by frenchs. In France, {{there are many ways}} to speak French and also many languages (including other romance languages as provenzal). This country needed to homogenize the language and declared the French of Paris as the correct French. For that, the other varieties of French or the other minority languages were consired incorrect or bad ways to speak and were called patois (that means speak with the feet). The French creole was also considered patois because it differed to the French or Paris. By the <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the meaning of the term patois expanded even more. As an analogy to the French creole, the English creole was also called with patois. When Costa Ricans talk about the Costa Rican Patois used in Limón, it is not clear if they mean the creole English (the most common creole) or the creole French.|$|E

40|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of medical language {{is the use}} of eponyms or denominations constructed using the names of real or imaginary persons. Some consider this practice as inappropriate, because eponyms are sometimes more a reflection of influence and power rather than the real authorship of discoveries. On the other hand, others consider valid the use of eponyms since they are a part of a scientific domain used to name objects and diseases. The fact is that tradition and use have finally imposed eponyms in medical language and demonstrated its usefulness. They facilitate the communication between peers and are also a tribute to the clinical sagacity and observational skills of their discoverers. A reasonable practice is to favor the use of those classical eponyms that have endured the <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> due to their clinical importance, specificity diagnostic significance or historical relevance. Moreover, the knowledge of the biography or historical environment of discoverers of signs, syndromes or diseases gives us a historical perspective of medicine and sheds light on the past, evolution and present knowledge and practice of medicine...|$|E
40|$|Antonio Prieto {{has pursued}} a {{versatile}} {{career as a}} professor, critic and novelist. Even though all these activities are extremely coherent, it is for his novels that he is most celebrated. Antonio Prieto holds a singular position within contemporary narrative fiction in Spain, as he remains {{on the margins of}} popular groups and currents. This independence, however, has made him be a target of discrimination {{on the part of both}} the critics and the modern literary historiography. Prieto’s novels have been mostly appreciated and received in the university context –the space that has best preserved the humanistic knowledge throughout the time and the axis around which the author’s poetics revolves. His poetics is built outside of the «realist» predilections that prevail in post-war Spanish novel, which is also another reason that could explain why he has been excluded of the codes established by literary criticism. Prieto’s key topic in his critical production ―the permanence of the written word throughout the time― coincides with that of his narrative fiction. It is this one that ultimately prevails, since as a narrator, he leaves mark on the chain of tradition. In fact, «writers do not actually solve their problems in their literary work, but rather those problems are dissolved in it, and with the <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> it must remain as a piece of literary work, as successive texts where they dissolve what must exist in word-format» (my translation) [...] ...|$|E
