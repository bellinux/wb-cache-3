The F110s were both 6.6 seconds off the polesitter's time, but only 0.34 seconds behind the Virgin of Lucas di Grassi. Senna's car only lasted four laps of the race before retiring with a hydraulic failure, but Chandhok finished 14th and last for the car's first classified finish, albeit five laps adrift of the winner and three laps behind Heikki Kovalainen's 13th-placed Lotus. This was partly due to a damaged floor caused by Chandhok coming off the track twice during the race. In Malaysia, Chandhok achieved the F110's best qualifying position without grid rearrangement in 22nd position. In the race both cars ran efficiently and achieved the F110's first double-finish, with Chandhok and Senna finishing in 15th and 16th positions respectively, ahead of the two delayed Lotus drivers. Chandhok finished three laps down, while Senna was another lap behind the leader. At the Chinese Grand Prix, Chandhok received a five-place grid penalty as the team broke the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) seal on his car's gearbox without {{a representative of the}} governing body being present; he was then further penalised for his mechanics changing a hydraulic <b>pump</b> <b>assembly</b> with parts of a different specification to the originals, and was made to start from the pit lane.

5000|$|The pistons have to {{be drawn}} {{outwards}} in their cylinder by some means. On small pumps {{this can be done}} by means of a spring inside the cylinder that forces the piston up the cylinder. Inlet fluid pressure can also be arranged so that the fluid pushes the pistons up the cylinder. Often a vane pump is located on the same drive shaft to provide this pressure and it also allows the <b>pump</b> <b>assembly</b> to draw fluid against some suction head from the , which is not an attribute of the unaided axial piston pump.|$|E
5000|$|Spring-piston air guns (or simply [...] "spring guns" [...] or [...] "springers") operate {{by means}} of a coil {{spring-loaded}} piston <b>pump</b> <b>assembly</b> contained within a compression chamber separate from the gun barrel. Before shooting, the user need to manually cock the gun by flexing a lever connected to the <b>pump</b> <b>assembly.</b> The cocking causes the pump piston to move backwards and compress the spring until its rear engages the sear. The act of pulling the trigger disengages the sear, allows the spring to decompress and release the elastic potential energy stored within it, and pushes the piston forward thereby compressing the air in the pump cylinder. Because the pump outlet (located {{to the front of the}} pump) is directly behind the pellet sitting in the barrel chamber, once the air pressure has risen enough to overcome any static friction and/or barrel restriction holding back the pellet, the pellet is propelled forward by an expanding column of pressurized air. All this takes place in a fraction of a second, during which the air undergoes adiabatic heating to several hundred degrees and then cools as the air expands. This can also cause a phenomenon referred as [...] "dieseling", where flammable substances in the compression chamber (e.g. petroleum-based lubricant) can be ignited by the heat generated, and lead to combustion smoke coming out of the muzzle upon firing.|$|E

50|$|At {{the bottom}} of wells, based on formation, a {{screening}} device, filter pack, slotted casing, or open bore hole is left to allow {{the flow of water}} into the well. Constructed screens are typically used in unconsolidated formations (sands, gravels, etc.), allowing water and a percentage of the formation to pass through the screen. Allowing some material to pass through creates a large area filter out {{of the rest of the}} formation, as the amount of material present to pass into the well slowly decreases and is removed from the well. Rock wells are typically cased with a PVC liner/casing and screen or slotted casing at the bottom, this is mostly present just to keep rocks from entering the <b>pump</b> <b>assembly.</b> Some wells utilize a filter pack method, where an undersized screen or slotted casing is placed inside the well and a filter medium is packed around the screen, between the screen and the borehole or casing.

40|$|The {{performance}} of automotive cooling {{systems can be}} improved by replacing the traditional mechanically driven radiator fan and water <b>pump</b> <b>assemblies</b> with computer controlled components. The introduction of electric servo-motors to drive the cooling components can improve temperature tracking, which should increase fuel efficiency and decrease tailpipe emissions. However, the power requirement for these electric motors increases with greater cooling demands if the radiator surface area remains constrained. For heavy-duty applications, where engines are subjected to significant cooling loads, electric motors may become impractical due to their increased size and power requirements; in these situations, hydraulic-based components are advantageous due to their high power density. The off-road equipment industry currently uses hydraulic radiator fan drives for cooling applications, while the coolant pump remains mechanically driven. Therefore, an opportunity exists to integrate the radiator fan and coolant pump into hydraulic circuits to actively meet cooling demands...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{precision}} assemblies in {{high volume}} manufacturing have used pin-hole joints; however {{the evolution of}} more stringent design requirements has pushed the performance of this method to its practical performance limit of approximately five microns repeatability. Next generation designs (i. e. automotive engines and <b>pump</b> <b>assemblies)</b> require low-cost couplings which permit sealing between interfaces and deliver better than five micron repeatability. This presentation will introduce a fundamentally new type of kinematic coupling, the quasi-kinematic coupling, which costs less than most precision pinned joints, delivers sub-micron repeatability, and allows contact/sealing between mated components. GEOMETRY In general, Quasi-Kinematic Couplings (QKCs) are well-suited for high volume precision assembly, particularly where integral locating features and/or sealing contact are required. Quasi-kinematic couplings are similar to traditional Kinematic Couplings as they consist of three convex protrusions which mate with three corresponding grooves. However, QKC grooves and convex surfaces are formed as surfaces of revolutions (i. e. for instance a conical hole). Mating the kinematic elements results in six arced lines of contact (two at each groove-protrusion joint) not six points as in a kinemati...|$|R
