5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack. The mounted conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not <b>passive,</b> <b>and</b> could buffet the enemy combatant.|$|E

5|$|Bullet souls {{are often}} projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide {{continuous}} effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars. The movement and attacking of familiars {{can be directly}} controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Several Guardian souls can be used in conjunction with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are <b>passive,</b> <b>and</b> require no magic points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points. Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with <b>passive</b> <b>and</b> active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we discuss {{some of the}} main {{properties}} of constructions involving participial <b>passives,</b> <b>passive</b> se, <b>and</b> impersonal se in Portuguese, focusing on its two main varieties, European and Brazilian Portuguese (henceforth EP and BP, respectively). 1 When the two dialects differ, we will provide the relevant judgments each dialect assigns to the data under discussion by using the abbreviations EP and BP. The chapter is organized in five sections. Section 2 deals with participial passives, distinguishing between adjectival <b>and</b> verbal <b>passives</b> <b>and</b> between the participial forms of <b>passives</b> <b>and</b> compound tenses. Section 3 focuses on <b>passive</b> se <b>and</b> impersonal se constructions, comparing them with verbal passives when appropriate.

His orders were to eliminate local groups of communist guerrillas who had fled to the area following the Shanghai massacre of 1927.

5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} analogue {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of capacitors, inductors and, sometimes, resistors (<b>passive)</b> <b>and</b> are designed to operate on continuously varying (analogue) signals. There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which may have the same transfer function of the filters described in this article. Analogue filters are most often used in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{still do}} not know the exact {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (<b>passive</b> <b>and</b> active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E

An analysis based on construction grammar can clarify {{nature of the}} adversity and finds parallelism between Japanese and English constructions. In chapter 2, introducing the analysis methods of Construction Grammar, syntactic and semantic features of the adversative passive construction in Japanese will be described. This chapter also explains the syntactic flexibility assuming metonymy a clue. Chapter 3 points out parallelism between Japanese adversative <b>passives</b> <b>and</b> English resultatives.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} within HPSG a {{model of}} grammar with two syntactic levels, valence lists and argument structure, at which sentences may have different representations: syntactically ergative and Western Austronesian languages are distinctive by allowing different prominence orderings between the valence lists and argument structure, while forms like <b>passives</b> <b>and</b> causatives have nested argument structure lists. While binding theory and related phenomena have traditionally been {{described in terms of}} surface grammatical relations or configurations, we demonstrate that binding theory is actually correctly described in terms of argument structure configurations. Such an approach generalizes nicely over accusative and ergative constructions, correctly predicts binding patterns with causative <b>and</b> <b>passive</b> verbs, <b>and</b> supports the lexicality-preserving account of <b>passives</b> <b>and</b> causatives a [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Volcanic eruptions {{vary widely}} in strength. On the one extreme there are effusive Hawaiian eruptions, which are {{characterized}} by lava fountains and fluid lava flows, which are typically not very dangerous. On the other extreme, Plinian eruptions are large, violent, and highly dangerous explosive events. Volcanoes are not bound to one eruptive style, and frequently display many different types, both <b>passive</b> <b>and</b> explosive, even {{in the span of}} a single eruptive cycle. Volcanoes do not always erupt vertically from a single crater near their peak, either. Some volcanoes exhibit lateral and fissure eruptions. Notably, many Hawaiian eruptions start from rift zones, and some of the strongest Surtseyan eruptions develop along fracture zones. Scientists believed that pulses of magma mixed together in the chamber before climbing upward—a process estimated to take several thousands of years. But Columbia University volcanologists found that the eruption of Costa Rica’s Irazú Volcano in 1963 was likely triggered by magma that took a nonstop route from the mantle over just a few months.|$|E
5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection. Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: <b>passive</b> <b>and</b> active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E

Hence we replicate CW’s specific findings but reach opposite conclusions, based on wider evidence. <b>Passives</b> <b>and</b> object relatives are more difficult for agrammatic aphasics to process and interpret than actives and object relatives. CW (Caplan & Waters, in press) ascribe this well-known fact to deficits in a domain-specific grammatical processor, with a syntaxspecific pool of working-memory resources. They base this conclusion on evidence involving comprehension of a small subset of English syntactic structures, in patients with agrammatic aphasia, patients without receptive agammatism despite working-memory deficits...|$|R
