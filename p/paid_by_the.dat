On 23 September, he received another 5,882 Francs on the Empire's Grand Livre.

He also received an endowment of 100,000 Francs for the acquisition of a Parisian Hôtel particulier; Nansouty bought the Hôtel du Président Duret in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a neighbourhood inhabited by the new elite of Imperial France. Indeed, first-rate military figures such as the Viceroy of Italy Eugène, Marshals Davout and Lannes and Generals Rapp and Legrand also acquired residences in Faubourg Saint-Germain.|$|E
