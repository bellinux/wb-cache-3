5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of <b>pattern</b> <b>design</b> tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E

500|$|The {{reaction}} to the book was limited, {{at least in part}} due to the specialised nature of the work. His second book, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, covered cavalry theory more widely and made a series of recommendations, including the use of carbines on foot rather than from the saddle, and substantial improvements to the cavalry saddle itself. The existing saddle, in use since 1796, was considered too high, restricting the use of a rider's lower legs, leading to instability. Accordingly, he designed a new saddle, {{with the assistance of the}} saddler sergeant at Maidstone depot, which focused on reducing rubbing against the horse, improved comfort and weighed less than the existing design. The resulting saddle was tested in April 1853, with attendance by the Duke of Cambridge, inspector general of cavalry. The reaction was positive, and the army commissioned it as a new model for the cavalry, known as the Universal Wood Arch <b>Pattern</b> <b>design,</b> but informally referred to as [...] "Nolan's saddle".|$|E
500|$|Barber duly {{produced}} the required designs. [...] Fairly {{large numbers of}} pattern coins were struck. [...] Barber's design for the nickel showed a portrait similar to that eventually adopted for the obverse, with [...] "United States of America" [...] and the date. [...] The reverse featured the required wreath surrounding the [...] "V", and no other lettering. [...] A modified <b>pattern</b> <b>design</b> later that year added the words [...] "In God We Trust" [...] to the reverse. [...] Snowden decided that the proposed cents and three-cent pieces would be too small for effective use, but Barber continued work on the nickel, with the size adjusted to [...] [...] Barber reworked the design in 1882, adding [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] to the reverse. [...] One variant that was struck as a pattern, but was not adopted, was a coin with five equally spaced notches in {{the rim of the}} coin. [...] This [...] "Blind Man's nickel" [...] was struck at the request of Congressman and former Union General William S. Rosecrans, who stated that many of his wartime colleagues had been blinded by combat or disease.|$|E

2500|$|Design, {{science and}} {{industry}} {{came together in}} the Festival Pattern Group, which commissioned textiles, wallpaper, domestic objects and Festival exhibits based on x-ray crystallography. The idea of using the molecular patterns revealed in x-ray crystallography in surface patterns was first suggested by Dr Helen Megaw, a leading Cambridge University crystallographer. [...] After hearing a presentation by Dorothy Hodgkin to the Society of Industrial Artists, Mark Hartland Thomas, chief industrial officer of the CoID, took up the idea and formed the Festival Pattern Group. [...] Hartland Thomas {{was a member of}} the Festival of Britain Presentation Panel and was co-ordinating the CoID's stock list. [...] He secured the Regatta Restaurant, one of the temporary restaurants on the South Bank, for an experiment in <b>pattern</b> <b>design</b> with crystal structure furnishings as the theme of the décor. [...] Designs were based on the crystal structure of haemoglobin, insulin, wareite, china clay, mica and other molecules. [...] The work of the Festival Pattern Group fitted in well with displays in the Dome of Discovery about the structure of matter.|$|E
2500|$|For 1981, the Spirit sedan-based VAM Gremlin saw the {{greatest}} changes since 1979. Both versions obtained a 55-amp alternator, coolant recovery tank and fan shroud regardless of trim level or {{the presence of}} the air conditioning system, as well as a new shared grille design with vertical bars and a single horizontal one in the bottom plus a shared new seat <b>pattern</b> <b>design.</b> For the first time, door panels completely covered all previously exposed metal parts. International symbols appeared in the instrument cluster warning lights and the light beam switch was integrated to the steering column marker light lever. The Gremlin X received numerous updates. All chromed items were deleted other than the front end and rear licence plate light housings while the rear spoiler passed on to the option list. Both bumpers changed to blacked out units. Side decals were almost gone, with only a small [...] "Gremlin X" [...] one at the bottom corner of each C-pillar. A new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with six simulated hex socket bolts on the horn button was used. A four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage and a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio became standard. Units with automatic transmission retained the 3.31:1 rear gear ratio of all previous years. The optional equipment list now included eight-spoke sports-style steel wheels using the same volcano hubcaps as the standard wheels.|$|E
