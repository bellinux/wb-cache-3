Upozorava se na važnost urednog zahtjeva i ispravnosti glavnog projekta te odgovornosti investitora i projektanta. Posebno se opisuju odredbe koje se odnose na ranije uvedenu potvrdu o usklađenosti glavnog projekta s posebnim zakonima. Uvodi se pojam "uredovanje na jednom mjestu" umjesto engleske inačice "one-stop-shop".

40|$|Complex of {{operational}} {{properties of}} sulfur-based and sulfur-extended building materials may lead both to economical efficiency of construction and to reduced {{load on the}} environment. The feasibility of the sulfur-extended materials is primarily caused by properties, availability and low cost of sulfur. Before the development of building material {{it is necessary to}} examine the supramolecular structure of the matrix in detail. Material science of sulfur is still with several «white spots» which have to be filled with sound knowledge and reproducible data. New level of the research in constructional material science can be achieved with help of system analysis. The key prerequisite for successful application of system analysis in material science is the determination of primary interactions which, in turn, define applicable modeling methods. Several investigation methods can be used at the nanoscale level – traditional experimental methods, quantum chemistry modeling, molecular dynamics. The methodology of research depends on objectives and also on acceptable values of time and resource consumption. Requirements for precision and reproducibility, together with demands for new scientific data must also be taken into consideration. In the present work we have presented different strategies of investigation: case for dominance of practice, case for high demands for new scientific data and the case for high demands for precision, reliability and reproducibility. The latest case is the preferable one, and it was used during investigation of the nanostructure of sulfur binder. Three different methods of research were applied: Raman spectroscopy, quantum chemistry simulation and molecular dynamics. It was demonstrated again that broadly available technical sulfur corresponds to orthorhombic allotrope; at the same time, comparative analysis of the Raman spectra reveals that bending of long sulfur chains in technical sulfur takes place in less constrained conditions. For the quantum chemistry computations three different software tools are used; the capabilities of accompanying pre- and post-processing tools are discussed. It is shown during analysis of quantum chemistry calculations that verification of the experimental Raman spectra should not be performed with results obtained for isolated S 8 molecule. Results of simulation performed for the sulfur crystal are close to the experimental measurements; such correspondence is an important <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> between lattices of real crystal and model. During molecular dynamics simulations it is found that such methods can successfully be used only on the spatial scales starting from 10 nm, whereas on the lower scale the quantum effects must be taken into account. ...|$|E

The procedure would make a factual determination that the underlying levels of protection sought to be guaranteed by the parties’ respective regulations are substantially equivalent. An equivalency finding would promote recognition by shifting the burden <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> to <b>conformity</b> assessment systems to demonstrate why they cannot be recognized as meeting the equivalent level of protection. The instrument as proposed would be made operable by private rights of action, accord representation to consumers’ interests, and retain certain political features as entrusted to a supervising trade agreement committee.

After Karl Agell and Phil Swisher left the band (Swisher {{being replaced by}} original bassist Mike Dean), Keenan took over on vocals and guitar. Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> have since released the albums Deliverance, Wiseblood, America's Volume Dealer, and In the Arms of God, {{as well as the}} live release, Live Volume. From 2006 to 2010, Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> had been on hiatus. The band has since reunited and recorded an album without Keenan. However, a possibility of Keenan re-joining C.O.C. remains, according to a message dated May 15, 2010, on the official C.O.C. website. According to drummer Reed Mullin, Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> plans to reunite with Keenan in 2015 for a new album and tour. Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> performed their first show with the re-united Deliverance era line-up of Pepper Keenan, Woody Weatherman, Mike Dean, and Reed Mullin on March 7, 2015 in Manchester, England. Their first U.S. tour with the re-united line-up, supporting Clutch, was announced on July 28, 2015.|$|R

For this purpose conformal contact analyses are carried out by means of Finite Element (FE) models, and also with the exact rolling contact theory approach developed by Kalker, which has been appropriately adapted by the authors {{in order to take}} into account some of the effects <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> On the other hand, equivalent cases are analysed without taking into account the effects <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> In this way, the validity of the hypothesis of non-conformity is evaluated in different cases with varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>conformity...</b>|$|R
40|$|The role of {{perceived}} {{authority on the}} clinical behaviour and decisionmaking of midwives has received little research attention, {{largely due to the}} unavailability of a midwifery-specific measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> The current study investigated the factor structure of the social influence scale for midwifery (SISM), a recently developed measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> designed specifically for use within midwifery practice. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a four-factor model <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> comprising distinct dimensions <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> client control, personal control and non-conformity offered an excellent fit to the data. It is concluded that, though the SIS-M was developed as a unitary measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> there is also compelling evidence that the SIS-M could be developed as a multi-dimensional measure of distinct, but related, conformity dimensions. The SIS-M therefore offers considerable potential as a research tool to gain novel insights into the <b>conformity</b> behaviour <b>of</b> midwives in the practice environment and the relationship of such behaviour to maternal and neonatal outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Seller {{is liable}} for the <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> {{delivered}} goods. However, there are cases where the seller's liability is excluded despite the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> the goods. First, pursuant to Art. 478 (3) of Serbian Law on Obligations an insignificant material defect of the goods {{should not be taken}} into account. In other words, minor difference in quantity or quality will not be taken into consideration where it is not material. In international trade, in principle, the seller is liable for minor defects of the goods. However, in practice seller's liability for immaterial lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> will be excluded on the basis of relevant trade usages and previous bussines dealings of the parties. Second, it is commonly accepted in international and domestic trade, as concretization of the principle of good faith, that the seller is not liable for any lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> goods if at the time of conclusion of a contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> Seller's liability for the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> the goods is excluded when the following requirements are fulfilled. The first requirement is that the buyer had positive knowledge of the defects or that he could not have been unaware of their existence. It is considered that the buyer could not have been unaware of the non-conformity if he acted with gross negligence. Furthermore, buyer's knowledge of the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> should exist at the time of conclusion of the contract. Finally, the exclusion of seller's liability is not possible when he acts in bad faith...|$|R
