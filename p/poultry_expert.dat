50|$|Atlee {{was born}} in 1858 in Sheffield, New Brunswick, Canada but he moved to Philadelphia as a child, where his father practiced medicine. Both his father and {{grandfather}} were prominent in medicine. At fourteen, Atlee was already actively breeding chickens, geese and turkeys. A skilled breeder, he corresponded with <b>poultry</b> <b>experts</b> worldwide and wrote scholarly articles in poultry journals. In 1876, an 18-year-old Atlee started a mail-order chicken business out of the family home with $1,000 (equal to $ today) loaned to him by his mother and a partner. Poultry farmers from the Northeast already knew of his talents, and he soon opened a store in Philadelphia, selling poultry and also corn seed for poultry feed. It wasn't long before his customers started requesting cabbage, carrot, cauliflower and cucumber seeds. In 1878, Burpee dropped his partner and founded W. Atlee Burpee & Company. The company soon switched to primarily garden seed, but live poultry wasn't dropped from the Burpee catalog until the 1940s.|$|R
40|$|Abstract] 1. The {{purpose of}} this work was to support {{decision-making}} in poultry farms by performing automatic early detection of anomalies in egg production. 2. Unprocessed {{data were collected from}} a commercial egg farm on a daily basis over 7 years. Records from a total of 24 flocks, each with approximately 20 000 laying hens, were studied. 3. Other similar works have required a prior feature extraction by a <b>poultry</b> <b>expert,</b> and this method is dependent on time and expert knowledge. 4. The present approach reduces the dependency on time and expert knowledge because of the automatic selection of relevant features and the use of artificial neural networks capable of cost-sensitive learning. 5. The optimum configuration of features and parameters in the proposed model was evaluated on unseen test data obtained by a repeated cross-validation technique. 6. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value are presented and discussed at 5 forecasting intervals. The accuracy of the proposed model was 0. 9896 for the day before a problem occurs. Xunta de Galicia; GRC 2014 / 04...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT An expert/knowledge base {{computer}} program called XLAYER {{was developed to}} provide expert management advice to Northeastern commercial poultry layer managers. It has demonstrated ability to diagnose and estimate economic and associated losses and recommend remedial management action for over 80 individual production management problems significantly affecting flock profitability. The XLAYER program, containing over 400 production rules and running on IBM'-compatible personal computers, possesses diverse diagnostic capabilities {{consistent with those of}} <b>poultry</b> management <b>experts</b> in nutrition, housing and equipment, disease, marketing, economic, and human-induced management areas. The XLAYER program's expertise was developed from information obtained by interviewing <b>poultry</b> manage-ment <b>experts</b> and specialists in avian nutrition. The XLAYER program expert system technology has application in poultry management and possibly other areas of poultry science. Preliminary success has supported the hypothesis that scarce poultry management expertise can be economically provided to poultry managers, regardless of size and scale of operation, through expert system programs. {Key words: expert systems, rule-based, layer management, expert decision support systems...|$|R
40|$|For {{approximately}} {{the past ten}} years, the European poultry sector has faced both competition from new poultry-exporting countries and growing societal concerns about animal welfare, food safety, and environmental impacts of production systems. On a global scale, poultry production increased nearly 4 % per year during that period. Although it increased slightly in the European Union (EU) as a whole, largely owing to the integration of new EU member states, in some EU countries such as France it decreased by up to 20 %. This caused concern among public and private stakeholders, especially poultry farmers, {{about the future of}} poultry farming in their countries. To help French stakeholders design strategies for the future, a technical institute (ITAVI) and a research institute (INRA) conducted a scenario-building exercise. Based on interviews with stakeholders and an 18 -month-long series of discussions by a panel of <b>poultry</b> <b>experts,</b> four future scenarios were developed. Rather than simply extending current trends, they took into account uncertainties such as potential shifts in European policies and regulations, consumer attitudes, and stakeholder strategies. The main economic, social, environmental, and food-safety lessons of this exploration are presented here from a European perspective. More specifically, the implications of these scenarios for future research are highlighted. Although no scenario envisages strong production growth by 2025, all emphasise the importance of multidisciplinary research to characterise the quality and sustainability of poultry production, which in turn can improve its competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|This {{health risk}} {{assessment}} evaluates potential health {{risks associated with}} a proposed introduction of wild turkeys to the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia. The preferred source for the turkeys would be the Province of Ontario, but alternative sources include the northeastern United States from Minnesota eastward and Tennessee northward. This report assesses qualitatively the probability that health hazards would be created in Nova Scotia {{in association with the}} introduction of wild turkeys and the magnitude of harm that would result, and the probability that the introduced wild turkeys would encounter health hazards in Nova Scotia and the magnitude of the harm that would result. The assessment is based primarily on peerreviewed scientific literature. Additional sources of information include unpublished reports, opinions of <b>poultry</b> health <b>experts,</b> compiled laboratory findings and anecdotal information solicited from wildlife health personnel in the states and provinces from which the turkeys might originate, and from Nova Scotia. The methods of the assessment used are those recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (formerly the OIE), Working Group on Wildlife Diseases. One hundred and twenty two potentially hazardous infectious agents were considered; eleven were assessed in full detail: avian pox viruses, three species of Mycoplasma, two species of Salmonella, Bordatella avium, three groups of protozoan blood parasites and the tick Amblyomma americanum...|$|R
50|$|The Silver Appleyard was bred in the 1930s at Priory Waterfowl Farm near Ixworth, in Suffolk, by Reginald Appleyard, an <b>expert</b> <b>poultry</b> breeder {{who also}} created the Ixworth breed of chicken. His aim in {{creating}} the breed is described in a leaflet he put out {{after the end of}} the Second World War: to create white-skinned duck with a wide, deep breast, which would also be beautiful to look at and would lay abundant white eggs. By the time the pamphlet was issued, his birds had won prizes at the Dairy Show in London and at Bethnal Green. In 1947 a pair of Silver Appleyards was painted by the animal painter Ernest George Wippell. Appleyard worked on the development and stabilisation of the breed until his death in 1964, but never produced a standard. When the Silver Appleyard standard was drawn up in 1982, it was based on Wippell's painting.|$|R
40|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to carry out an assessment of welfare in an entirely objective manner. The choice of welfare indicators, as well as the assignment of relative weightings to these indicators, both involve a certain degree of subjectivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} create a possible method of dealing with this subjectivity, using the opinions of groups of experts to increase the consensus for a protocol for the on-farm assessment of laying-hen welfare. The selection of the 17 separate welfare indicators was based both on a questionnaire submitted to 18 international <b>poultry</b> welfare <b>experts</b> and on the practical feasibility of collecting the respective data during a one-day farm visit. Subsequently, a second group of 13 experts was asked to assign relative weightings to the welfare indicators in this protocol. This assessment was carried out twice, once with and once without provision of detailed information on the welfare indicators. When detailed information was provided, the weightings assigned to the welfare indicators were generally lower than when no detailed information was provided. In conclusion, subjectivity regarding the choice of welfare indicators and the assignment of their relative weightings, can be dealt with and made transparent by seeking consensus among experts. Although the choice of experts, the methodology for extracting consensus data, and the nature and amount of information on the welfare indicators that should be provided, are likely to benefit from further refinement, the data presented in this study should be valuable for the development and application of formalised protocols for an integrated assessment of the welfare of laying hens, on-farm...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Although Australia is {{free from}} highly {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI), incursions {{of this disease}} {{have the potential to}} have severe impacts on animal welfare and cause substantial economic losses for Australia’s commercial poultry industries. Australia has experienced five epidemics of HPAI between 1976 and 1997, and has detailed contingency plans for this disease, but the potential consequences and effectiveness of different control and eradication strategies under Australian conditions are not well understood. Epidemiological modelling is a tool {{that can be used to}} combine available information on infection dynamics from field and experimental studies with expert opinion to gain insights into disease transmission and control. This thesis describes the application of modelling tools to study the spread of HPAI within and between farms. In particular, it describes the development, verification, validation, sensitivity analysis and evaluation of a spatial, stochastic simulation model, called AISPREAD, to investigate the potential transmission and control of HPAI in the Australian chicken meat, chicken egg layer, duck and turkey industries. AISPREAD is divided into three modules: a production module to simulate the timing of farm husbandry practices such as routine destocking and visits by service providers; an infection module to simulate the spread of infection between farms by local spread, the movement of live birds and contact networks of service providers; and a mitigations module which implements combinations of realistic outbreak response strategies. AISPREAD is a flexible simulation model that can incorporate different combinations of mitigation strategies including: active and passive surveillance; diagnosis; tracing; zoning; quarantine and movement restrictions; culling, disinfection and decontamination of infected farms; pre-emptive culling; process slaughter of chicken meat broiler and duck and turkey grower farms; and emergency vaccination. Data on the location, ownership, type, capacity, biosecurity and production characteristics and identity of service providers were obtained from a series of cross-sectional surveys of the commercial chicken meat, chicken egg layer, duck and turkey industries conducted in 2005 and 2007. These studies revealed that these industries are functionally distinct and few of the 1594 farms produced multiple species of poultry. However, five Australian poultry production regions had poultry farm densities that were comparable to areas in Canada and Italy that have experienced extensive epidemics of HPAI, indicating that they may be more vulnerable to larger outbreaks. Results also revealed that movements of birds and service providers between farms could lead to the transmission of HPAI between companies, regions or industries. Limited data were available to estimate several important model parameters, including the likelihood of HPAI spreading between farms by different types of indirect contacts; the relative effectiveness of biosecurity measures on different types of farms to prevent indirect transmission of HPAI on fomites; the number of trucks operated by feed mills, hatcheries and waste disposal companies; and the risk of HPAI spread posed by the movement of used cardboard egg trays in the chicken egg layer industry. A modified Delphi conference approach was used in this study to gather the opinions of Australian poultry industry professionals to estimate these parameters. This study confirmed that <b>poultry</b> industry <b>experts</b> considered that indirect contacts by service providers between poultry farms and differences in biosecurity practices between poultry farms would be important in the spread of HPAI amongst poultry farms. In order to investigate within-farm spread of HPAI, a stochastic discrete entity simulation model was developed to estimate parameters regarding the dynamics of HPAI in unvaccinated and vaccinated chicken meat, chicken egg layer, duck and turkey farms. These studies revealed that a 1...|$|R
