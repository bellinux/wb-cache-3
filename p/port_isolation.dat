Two orthogonal one-wavelength-perimeter modes of a rectangular loop are excited by two orthogonal feedings. One mode for vertical polarization is excited by a circular monopole, {{and the other}} mode for horizontal polarization is excited by a slot-coupled microstrip line. By optimizing the antenna structure and the orthogonal feedings, the orthogonal polarizations can be achieved in a wide bandwidth with high <b>ports</b> <b>isolation.</b> The overall size of the proposed antenna is only 58 × 53 mm 2 (0. 43 λ 0 × 0. 39 λ 0, λ 0 is the free-space wavelength at 2. 2 GHz). A prototype of the proposed antenna is built and tested. The measured bandwidth with reflection coefficient less than − 10 dB is 61. 4 % (1. 65 – 3 GHz) for both orthogonal polarizations, covering the DCS, PCS, UMTS, WLAN, LTE 2300, and LTE 2500 operation.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the design {{techniques}} mitigating the <b>port</b> <b>isolation</b> degradation in dual-polarized microstrip arrays. The advantages of using dual-polarized antennas are the frequency band reuse and simultaneous receive/transmit capability.

40|$|Abstract—A compact {{decoupling}} network for enhancing the <b>ports</b> <b>isolation</b> of two coupled antennas is proposed in this letter. Parallel coupled lines (PCLs) and transmission lines (TLs) with different electrical lengths {{are considered to}} control the magnitude and phase of this {{decoupling network}}, respectively. The coupling coefficient of the PCLs is adjusted with various line widths and coupled gaps so that {{the magnitude of this}} network will be equal to that of the coupled antennas. And the electrical length of the series TLs can be controlled to make the signals of coupled antennas and decoupling network out of phase. Thus, the mutual coupling between the coupled antennas can be canceled. A prototype is fabricated on a RO 4003 print circuit board (PCB) for demonstration. The measured results agree quiet well with the simulation ones. High antenna isolation and good matching are simultaneously achieved at the center frequency, i. e., 925 MHz for global system mobile communications (GSM) which shows the compact decoupling network is suitable for reducing the isolation of size limited multi-antenna systems. 1...|$|R

The built-in filter is composed of several slits etched on the ground of the antenna structure. The number and length of slits depend on both the resonance frequency {{and the structure of}} the MIMO antenna system. To illustrate its usefulness, two designs of compact planar four-port MIMO antenna systems with built-in filters are proposed. One MIMO system is composed of different types of antennas with similar radiation characteristics, such as polarization. The lateral size of the whole system is 0. 64 λ× 0. 48 λ. To further reduce the size of the MIMO structure, polarization diversity is utilized in the second example. The dimension is only 0. 4 λ× 0. 4 λ. In both cases, with the built-in filters, the isolation level can be improved by 10 dB.
