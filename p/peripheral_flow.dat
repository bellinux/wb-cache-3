40|$|VR {{lends itself}} {{to the study of}} intersensory {{calibration}} in self-motion perception. However, proper calibration of visual and locomotor self-motion in VR is made complicated by the compression of perceived distance and by unfamiliar modes of locomotion. Although adaptation is fairly rapid with exposure to novel sensorimotor correlations, here it is shown that good initial calibration is found when both (1) the virtual environment is richly structured in near space and (2) locomotion is on solid ground. Previously it had been observed that correct visual speeds seem too slow when walking on a treadmill. Several principles may be involved, including inhibitory sensory prediction, distance compression, and missing <b>peripheral</b> <b>flow</b> in the reduced FOV. However, though a richly-structured near-space environment provides higher rates of <b>peripheral</b> <b>flow,</b> its presence does not improve calibration when walking on a treadmill. Conversely, walking on solid ground still shows relatively poor calibration in an empty (though well-textured) virtual hallway. Because walking on solid ground incorporates well-calibrated mechanisms that can assess speed of self-motion independent of vision, these observations suggest that near space may have been better calibrated in the HMD. Near-space obstacle avoidance systems may also be involved. Order effects in the data from the treadmill experiment indicate that recalibration of self-motion perception occurred during the experiment...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany {{authors have}} assumed that motor actions {{required}} for collision avoidance and for collision achievement (for example, in driving a car or hitting a ball) are guided by monitoring the time to collision (TTC), {{and that this is}} done on the basis of moment-to-moment values of the optical variable τ [1 – 3]. This assumption has also motivated the search for single neurons that fire when τ is a certain value [4 – 8]. Almost all of the laboratory studies and all the animal experiments were restricted to the case of stationary observer and moving object. On the face of it, this would seem reasonable. Even though humans and other animals routinely perform visually guided actions that require the TTC of an approaching object to be estimated while the observer is moving, τ provides an accurate estimate of TTC regardless of whether the approach is produced by self-motion, object-motion or a combination of both. One might therefore expect that judgements of TTC would be independent of self-motion. We report here, however, that simulated self-motion using a <b>peripheral</b> <b>flow</b> field substantially altered estimates of TTC for an approaching object, even though the <b>peripheral</b> <b>flow</b> field did not affect the value of τ for the approaching object. This finding points to long range interactions between collision-sensitive visual neurons and neural mechanisms for processing self-motion...|$|E

40|$|Increases in skin {{temperature}} and <b>peripheral</b> blood <b>flow</b> following the ingestion of food {{have been reported}} by previous investigators (1 to 4). In 1941, Abramson and Fierst (5), using the ve-nous occlusion plethysmograph, studied the effects of various dietary components upon <b>peripheral</b> blood <b>flow</b> in man. Following the ingestion of a predominantly carbohydrate meal, they found no significant change in total blood <b>flow</b> through the <b>peripheral</b> vascular beds of the hand, forearm or leg. Following the ingestion of a protein meal, however, an augmentation in blood flow became manifest in the hand, reaching its highest level 2 to 2 % hours after ingestion. A similar, though less marked, increase in flow was noted in the fore-arm and leg. In view {{of the increase in}} oxygen consumption which occurs {{as a result of the}} specific dynamic ac-tion (S. D. A.) of protein, it might be postulated that the rises in skin {{temperature and}} blood flow subsequent to a protein meal bear a causal rela-tionship to this phenomenon.

40|$|Identifying moving objects {{while we}} are moving is an {{important}} everyday skill. This ability allows us to monitor our surroundings, successfully interact with objects or people, and avoid potential hazards. Self-movement generates optical flow on the retina that complicates the recognition of moving objects from retinal motion alone. Rushton and Warren (2005) proposed a purely visual solution to this problem. They suggest that, {{in order to assess}} scene-relative object movement, the brain identifies and parses out (globally subtracts) patterns of visual flow that are consistent with self-movement. Existing research has demonstrated evidence of this flow parsing process in central vision (i. e. Warren & Rushton, 2008). This thesis aims to characterise the role of peripheral visual flow in this process. Research from the wider self-motion literature has often distinguished between central and peripheral vision. Some researchers have claimed that peripheral vision is specialised for self-motion perception, whilst more recent studies have challenged this assertion. This thesis investigates whether peripheral visual motion, traditionally considered to be a strong cue to self-movement, also contributes to flow parsing. The experimental work employed a simulated self-movement paradigm to isolate retinal motion from other non-visual cues. Thus, observers remained stationary whilst computer generated stimuli moved to produce patterns of retinal motion associated with actual self-movement. In the first set of experiments, I demonstrate that <b>peripheral</b> <b>flow</b> simulating forward or backward self-movement gives rise to characteristic flow parsing effects. This finding generalises to rotational observer motion (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 considers whether <b>peripheral</b> <b>flow</b> contributes to parsing for judgements of object size change. Finally, Chapter 5 investigates whether there is a benefit of peripheral information under conditions where central flow is potentially ambiguous. The results indicate that peripheral visual flow contributes to the flow parsing process. The contribution of flow in the near periphery appears to be maximally important...|$|E
40|$|Elevated {{systemic}} hematocrit (Hct) increases cardiovascular risk, such as {{stroke and}} myocardial infarction. One possible pathophysiological mechanism {{could be a}} disturbance of the blood - endothelium interface. It {{has been shown that}} blood interacts with the endothelial surface via a gel-like layer ('glycocalyx', or 'endothelial surface layer - ESL') that modulates various biological processes, including inflammation, permeability, and atherosclerosis. However, consequences of an elevated Hct on the functional properties of this interface are incompletely understood. In a transgenic mouse (tg 6) model exhibiting systemic Hct levels of about 0. 85 the glycocalyx/ESL was nearly abolished. The corresponding increase in vessel diameter had only minor effects on <b>peripheral</b> <b>flow</b> resistance. This suggests that the pathological effects of elevated Hct may relate stronger to the biological corollaries of a reduced ESL thickness and alterations of the blood-endothelium interface, than to an increased flow resistance...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{demonstrate}} that treatment with distal radial artery ligation (DRAL), based on preoperative evaluation with duplex ultrasound, is effective for correction of hand ischemia related to distal radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF).
