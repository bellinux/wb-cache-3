40|$|The {{purpose of}} the survivor's pension is to create rights for young and old age dependants. In the case of {{developed}} countries, the system deals essentially with the spouse survival. In the case of MENA countries, the survivor’s pensions scheme provides a wider perspective of coverage and is extended to protect children, brothers, sisters, dependant parents and grand-parents according to specific criteria. Two objectives of survivor's pensions can be distinguished. On the one hand, the survivor's pensions aim at providing a minimum of resources when the widow(er) could not acquire any other sources of income. In this case, the widow survivor's pension is provided to the most modest households {{in order to help}} them from plunging in extreme poverty. This context prevails widely in MENA countries, where poverty is high and the level of dependancy is also prominent. On the other hand, a second perspective considers the survivor's pensions as a <b>pension</b> <b>right</b> to the widow (er) with the aim of maintaining her/his former standard of living. Developed countries are particularly concerned by this environment. This paper propose an analysis of the impact of pension reforms, particurlarly, of the survirvorship pensions reforms on the individual situations of retirees. The analysis focuses on Moroccan pension system and will consider a representative sample of members of the main schemes in Morocco. Survivorship Pensions; Reforms; MENA countries; Morocco;...|$|E
40|$|With {{this paper}} I aim at {{outlining}} understandings of homelessness and present central {{research on the}} topic in Denmark. I shall begin by outlining an official – or juridical – understanding, and briefly touch upon {{the development of this}} understanding during the last decade, within which significant juridical changes have taken place. I shall then turn to the understanding of homelessness that one finds in Danish research on the phenomenon, {{and at the same time}} present some of the major studies carried out. Homelessness in the legislation I shall begin by outlining – very briefly – the political, i. e. the legal, understandings of homelessness as this can be traced in the legislation on the topic since the enactment of The Social Assistance Act in 1976. It might be worth noticing that there does not exist any ‘homelesslegislation’ in Denmark. In general there is a social legislation that provides universal measures for all citizens – sometimes based on social workers evaluations of needs. These universal measures are also available for people living at shelters. In addition to the universal measures – e. g. the right to welfare payment, right to old age <b>pension,</b> <b>right</b> to early retirement pension all independently of ones degree of contact with the labour market – there are a few targeted measures concerning homeless people. In the social legislation these are 1) the regional counties obligation for providing temporary sheltering in accordance with section 94, 2 2) section 66 which oblige the municipality to provide temporary sheltering for singles and families in acute need, and 3) the possibility for the municipality, eventually in cooperation with the regional county, to provide special housin...|$|E

40|$|Living {{longer is}} the result of social progress. But it also brings new {{challenge}}s. One challenge is <b>pension</b> <b>rights.</b> Diversity in <b>pension</b> landscape is increasing. This increased diversity leads to less security. Questions rise about the protection of <b>pension</b> <b>rights.</b> The answer to these questions depends of the legal qualification of the <b>rights.</b> Can <b>pension</b> <b>rights</b> be qualified as property? How d we qualify the tripartite relationship in occupational pensions? Can a pension be qualified as wages or salary? In addition to these specific questions, there are also more abstract questions. What is the difference between an attributed and an assertable right? How does a legitimate expectation become an assertable right? Given the increasing number of retirees, the need for legal certainty is growing. The doctoral research begins with a history of <b>pension</b> <b>rights.</b> It also develops a new pension typology. Pensions are a multidimensional phenomenon, with a legal, economic and social dimension. These three dimensions are the structure for the research.

Our data set covers male employees {{in the public sector}} in the Netherlands who faced an unexpected major pension reform in 2006, which was initiated by the government. We compare job motivation of employees who were born in 1950 and therefore face a substantial retrenchment of their <b>pension</b> <b>rights</b> to job motivation of slightly older employees who remain entitled to generous pension bene¯ts. We ¯nd that job motivation declines among negatively reciprocal individuals who face the unexpected drop of <b>pension</b> <b>rights,</b> while we do not observe a negative treatment e®ect among non-reciprocal employ- ees. Positively reciprocal inclinations do not trigger di®erences in job motivation between the treatment and control group. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{cross-border}} portability of supplementary (occupational) <b>pension</b> <b>rights</b> for ED workers and self-employed {{has been discussed}} for more than fifteen years. The free movement of persons {{is one of the}} fundamental goals of the ED. Currently labour mobility is impeded by the lack of a clear framework protecting supplementary pension entitlements for workers and self-employed persons who move across different Member States for employment purposes. The challenge of providing enhanced social security and adequate pensions, in the light of demographic changes, further puts emphasis on the need for the ED working population {{to be able to move}} to different Member States for employment without being penalised, through reduced pension entitlements. The aim of this study is to identify the legal framework on portability of supplementary occupational <b>pension</b> <b>rights</b> for ED workers and self-employed persons who move or seek to move between the Member States for employment purposes. The examination of this framework is not limited to the analysis of actual legislative measures adopted at ED level, on safeguarding supplementary occupational <b>pension</b> <b>rights</b> for migrant workers and self-employed persons, but further tries to assess how this framework, and consequently cross-border portability of supplementary occupational <b>pension</b> <b>rights,</b> is being formed and could be further developed, and how, consequently, cross-border portability of relevant rights could be enhanced.
