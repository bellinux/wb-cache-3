Discrete trusts consist of a fixed or static pool of receivables that are tranched into senior/subordinated bonds. [...] A master trust {{has the advantage of}} offering multiple deals out of the same trust as the number of receivables grows, each of which is entitled to a pro-rata share of all of the receivables.

5000|$|What was it ex-rating agency analysts {{might show}} their new employers? According to the hedge fund {{managers}} Michael Lewis talked to who had bet against mortgages securities, {{there were a}} number of ways to game [...] or [...] "reverse-engineer" [...] the raters' models. Rating agencies judged creditworthiness of a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> in part by looking at the averages of credit scores of borrowers who made up the security. The agencies used FICO, the [...] "best-known and most widely used credit score model". The average FICO score needed to be about 615 for a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> to meet rating agencies' minimum standard and allow a maximum percentage of triple-A rated tranches.|$|E
5000|$|While {{using an}} average was less work than getting {{a list of}} the borrowers' {{individual}} scores or finding the standard deviation of the pool of scores, it left out useful information. A <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> composed of borrowers all of whom had a FICO score of 615 was likely far fewer defaults than a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> with the same average but more dispersion—e.g.composed of borrowers half of whom had FICO scores of 550 and half 680, since someone who had earned a FICO score as low as 550 [...] "was virtually certain to default". Knowing this blind spot, securities issuers who could no longer find high FICO-scoring families who wanted to take out a mortgage found other ways to raise the average pool score.|$|E

Investors who had trusted the AAA rating to mean that CDO were low-risk had purchased large amounts that later experienced staggering drops in value or could not be sold at any price. For example, institutional investors lost $125 million on $340.7 million worth of CDOs issued by Credit Suisse Group, despite being rated AAA by S&P.|$|R

50|$|The typical {{structure}} for the securitization of commercial real estate loans is a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). A REMIC is a creation of the tax law that allows the trust to be a pass-through entity which {{is not subject to}} tax at the trust level. The CMBS transaction is structured and priced {{based on the assumption that}} it will not be subject to tax with respect to its activities; therefore, compliance with REMIC regulations is essential. CMBS has become an attractive capital source for commercial mortgage lending because the bonds backed by a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> are generally worth more than the sum of the value of the whole loans. The enhanced liquidity and structure of CMBS attracts a broader range of investors to the commercial mortgage market. This value creation effect allows loans intended for securitization to be aggressively priced, benefiting Borrowers.|$|E

40|$|Mortgage-backed {{securities}} (MBS) are debt obligations whose {{cash flows}} are {{backed by the}} principal and interest payments <b>of</b> <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> mortgage <b>loans,</b> most commonly on residential property (Riddiough, 2001). Lenders establish underwriting guidelines, evaluate prospective homeowners’ credit, and make loans. Having done so, lenders generally hold only a fraction <b>of</b> the <b>loans</b> they make in their own portfolios. Most are sold to the secondary market, where they are pooled and become the underlying assets for residential mortgage-backed securities. Individuals with strong credit qualify for traditional mortgages, whereas those with weak credit histories that include payment delinquencies, and possibly more severe problems such as charge-offs, judgments, and bankruptcies qualify for subprime loans (Hayre, 2001). Securitization is the financial technology that integrates the market for residential mortgages with the capital markets. Investment banks take <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> home <b>loans,</b> carve up the cash flows from those receivables, and convert the cash flows into bonds that are secured by the mortgages.

5000|$|A {{group of}} {{mortgages}} could be split into principal-only and interest-only bonds. The [...] "principal-only" [...] bonds would sell at a discount, and would thus be zero coupon bonds (e.g., bonds that you buy for $800 each and which mature at $1,000, without paying any cash interest). These bonds would satisfy investors who {{are worried that}} mortgage prepayments would force them to re-invest their money at the exact moment interest rates are lower; countering this, principal only investors in such a scenario would also be getting their money earlier rather than later, which equates to a higher return on their zero-coupon investment. The [...] "interest-only" [...] bonds would include only the interest payments of the underlying <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> These kinds of bonds would dramatically change in value based on interest rate movements, e.g., prepayments mean less interest payments, but higher interest rates and lower prepayments means these bonds pay more, and for a longer time. These characteristics allow investors to choose between interest-only (IO) or principal-only (PO) bonds to better manage their sensitivity to interest rates, {{and can be used}} to manage and offset the interest rate-related price changes in other investments.|$|E
40|$|Advocates of {{financial}} regulation, Arestis and Demetriades, argue that financial liberalisation does not impact on financial market efficiency and {{the allocation of}} investment.

Stiglitz has the view that financial repression improves the quality of the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> Results here indicate that companies in these countries previously had very limited access to credit while government owned companies and government projects received the bulk of credit.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} optimally selecting a large portfolio <b>of</b> risky <b>loans,</b> such as mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, student loans, or business loans. Examples include loan portfolios held by financial institutions and fixed-income investors as well as <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> backing mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The size of these portfolios can range from the thousands to even hundreds of thousands. Optimal portfolio selection requires the solution of a high-dimensional nonlinear integer program and is extremely computationally challenging. For larger portfolios, this optimization problem is intractable. We propose an approximate optimization approach that yields an asymptotically optimal portfolio for a broad class of data-driven models <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> delinquency and prepayment. We prove that the asymptotically optimal portfolio converges to the optimal portfolio as the portfolio size grows large. Numerical case studies using actual loan data demonstrate its computational efficiency. The asymptotically optimal portfolio’s computational cost does not increase {{with the size of}} the portfolio.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} how new credit risk transfer vehicles have {{made it easier to}} reallocate large amounts of credit risk from the financial sector to the non-financial sector of the capital markets. In this article, we describe one of these new credit risk transfer vehicles, the collateralized debt obligation. Synthetic credit debt obligations utilize credit default swaps, another relatively new credit risk transfer vehicle. Financial institutions face five major risks: credit, interest rate, price, currency, and liquidity. The development of the derivatives markets prior to 1990 provided financial institutions with efficient vehicles for the transfer of interest rate, price, and currency risks, as well as enhancing the liquidity of the underlying assets. However, it is only in recent years that the market for the efficient transfer of credit risk has developed. Credit risk is the risk that a debt instrument will decline in value {{as a result of the}} borrower's inability (real or perceived) to satisfy the contractual terms of its borrowing arrangement. In the case of corporate debt obligations, credit risk encompasses default, credit spread, and rating downgrade risks. The most obvious way for a financial institution to transfer the credit risk of a loan it has originated is to sell it to another party. Loan covenants typically require that the obligor be informed of the sale. The drawback of a sale in the case of corporate loans is the potential impairment of the originating financial institution's relationship with the obligor of the loan sold. Syndicated loans overcome the drawback of an outright sale because banks in the syndicate may sell their loan shares in the secondary market. The sale may be through an assignment or through participation. While the former mechanism for a syndicated loan requires the approval of the obligor, the latter does not since the payments are merely passed through to the purchaser and therefore the obligor need not know about the sale. Another form of credit risk transfer (CRT) vehicle developed in the 1980 s is securitization [Fabozzi and Kothari (2007) ]. In a securitization, a financial institution that originates loans pools them and sells them to a special purpose entity (SPE). The SPE obtains funds to acquire the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> by issuing securities. Payment of interest and principal on the securities issued by the SPE is obtained from the cash flow of the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> While the financial institution employing securitization retains some of the credit risk associated with the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans,</b> the majority of the credit risk is transferred to the holders of the securities issued by the SPE. Two recent developments for transferring credit risk are credit derivatives and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). For financial institutions, credit derivatives allow the transfer of credit risk to another party without the sale of the loan. A CDO is an application of the securitization technology. With the development of the credit derivatives market, CDOs can be created without the actual sale of a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> to an SPE using credit derivatives. CDOs created using credit derivatives are referred to as synthetic CDOs. In this article, we discuss CDOs. We begin with the basics of CDOs and then discuss synthetic CDOs. The issues for regulators and supervisors of capital markets with respect to CDOs, as well as credit derivatives, are also discussed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a predominantly oral-history {{account of the}} development of the Gaussian copula family of models, which are used in finance to estimate the probability distribution of losses on a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> or bonds, and which were centrally involved in the credit crisis. The paper draws upon this history to examine the articulation between two distinct, cross-cutting forms of social patterning in financial markets: organizations such as banks; and what we call ‘evaluation cultures’, which are shared sets of material practices, preferences and beliefs found in multiple organizations. The history of Gaussian copula models throws light on this articulation, because those models were and are crucial to intra- and inter-organizational coordination, while simultaneously being ‘othered ’ by members of a locally dominant evaluation culture, which we call the ‘culture of no-arbitrage modelling’. The paper ends with the speculation that all widely-used derivatives models (and indeed the evaluation cultures in which they are embedded) help to generate inter-organizational co-ordination, and all that is special in this respect about the Gaussian copula is that its status as ‘other ’ makes this role evident. 3 Given how crucial mathematical models are to financial markets, surprisingly little research has been devoted to how such models develop and why they develop {{in the way that they}} do. The work on models by researchers on finance influenced by science studies (work that forms part of the specialism sometimes called ‘social studies of finance’) has focussed primarily on the ‘performativity ’ (Callon 1998 and 2007) of models, in other words on the way in which models are not simply representations of markets, but interventions in them, part of the way in which markets are constituted. Models have effects, for example on patterns of prices. However, vital though that issue is – we return to it at the end of this paper – exclusive attention to the effects of models occludes the prior question of the processes shaping how models are constructed and used...|$|E
