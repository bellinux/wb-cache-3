5000|$|Older surfaces, such as double jute-backed {{carpets and}} loose rugs with natural {{foundation}} yarns, could shrink after a wet treatment, leading to suppositions that wet-cleaning could also remove wrinkles. [...] However, this notion is antiquated and this method could also occasionally tear seams or uproot strips. [...] Newer carpets, such as with synthetic backing and foundation yarns, do not shrink, and they smooth easily; in such carpets, wrinkles indicate an underlying problem, such as delamination where the secondary backing becomes unstuck from the <b>primary</b> <b>backing,</b> that {{may need a}} certified carpet inspector to determine.|$|E

5000|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} [...] "Summer Night City" [...] began in early 1978. It had the working titles of [...] "Kalle Sändare" [...] and [...] "Dancing in the Moonlight". ABBA's new recording studio, Polar Music Studio, had opened in May 1978, {{but had not}} been ready to use initially, so the <b>primary</b> <b>backing</b> track had been recorded at Metronome Studio. A 43-second ballad-style introduction to the song had been edited out to improve the overall quality, but nothing seemed to work. Allegedly, mixing the single took at least a week, far more than it took to mix any other track in ABBA's recording history. They felt {{something was wrong with}} the recording but couldn't put their finger on it. In the end, the song had an enormous amount of compression applied to it to give it a more [...] "driving" [...] sound. Agnetha has been quoted as saying she didn't like the song to start with, as she felt [...] "it wasn't ABBA" [...] but later on grew to like it. A reluctant ABBA decided to release [...] "Summer Night City" [...] as a single in September despite their disappointment with the track in its current form. The group still performed the song live on their 1979 world tour, though with the original introduction that had been removed from the studio recording. The previously unreleased version with the extended introduction was finally released as part of the box set Thank You for the Music in 1994.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his blog}} of July 4, 2016, Jojo Soria de Veyra, {{a member of}} ePIRMA, confessed that after the initiative's launch [...] "the {{signature}} gathering was mostly left to certain parishes of the more organized Catholic Church, the <b>primary</b> <b>backing</b> of the Cebu Coalition. Sporadic rallies of support were organized by the Makabayan group and provincial groups. Other members of ePIRMA were seen to have moved on to various other national concerns. Manny SD Lopez—ePIRMA's leading convenor and most active campaigner on the road—would also busy himself with organizing the Christian Peace Alliance, {{one of the groups}} advocating for a drastic review of some provisions of the then-in-its-final-thrust Bangsamoro Basic Law. Lopez would also form the EdlSA 2.22.15 Coalition, a group that called for President Benigno Aquino III's resignation after the Mamasapano mishap. I submit that in this latter period I was not privy anymore to how the signature-gathering for the initiative on the pork barrel was progressing. I did hear of some pockets of resistance to the initiative, as well as the Comelec's seeming lack of enthusiasm towards verifying the signatures, but that's about it[...] [...] [...] Then came the various noises leading to the 2016 general election, within which news concerning the initiative's progress were nowhere anymore to be found on Google." [...] De Veyra, also a convenor of a Facebook group called Forum for Direct Democracy, then proceeded in his blog to propose amendments to the Initiative and Referendum Act that would make the law easier for the people to use as well as obligate Comelec to do its part in the initiative process within a limited time period.|$|E
