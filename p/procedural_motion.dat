5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a <b>procedural</b> <b>motion.</b> On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a <b>procedural</b> <b>motion</b> by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} issue for the left in the early 1980s was {{to change the system}} of election of the Leader of the Labour Party, which had until then been chosen solely by Labour MPs. The left wanted to have the Leader elected by an 'electoral college' which would include affiliated trade unions and individual Constituency Labour Parties. At the 1980 Labour Party conference a <b>procedural</b> <b>motion</b> to allow the change to be made without delay was narrowly carried after Heffer argued for it, but all proposals for balancing the composition of the electoral college were defeated and the issue was deferred until a special conference.|$|E

500|$|At the convention, Conkling {{nominated}} Grant with {{an elegant}} speech, {{the most famous}} line being: [...] "When asked which state he hails from, our sole reply shall be, he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree." [...] With 370 votes needed for nomination, the first ballot had Grant at 304, Blaine at 284, Sherman at 93, and the rest scattered to minor candidates. Subsequent ballots followed, with roughly the same result; neither Grant nor Blaine could win. After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined {{with those of other}} candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative James A. Garfield of Ohio. A <b>procedural</b> <b>motion</b> made the vote unanimous for Garfield, who accepted the nomination.|$|E
500|$|Following the April 2005 {{release of}} Jean Brault's {{damaging}} testimony at the Gomery Commission, implicating the Liberals in the scandal, opinion polls placed the Conservatives ahead of Liberals. The Conservatives had earlier abstained from {{the vote on}} the 2005 budget to avoid forcing an election. With the collapse in Liberal support and a controversial NDP amendment to the budget, the party exerted significant pressure on Harper {{to bring down the}} government. In May, Harper announced that the government had lost the [...] "moral authority to govern". Shortly thereafter, the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois united to defeat the government on a vote that some considered to be either a confidence motion or else a motion requiring an immediate test of the confidence of the House. The Martin government did not accept this interpretation and argued that vote had been on a <b>procedural</b> <b>motion,</b> although they also indicated that they would bring forward their revised budget for a confidence vote the following week. Ultimately, the effort to bring down the Government failed following the decision of Conservative MP Belinda Stronach to cross the floor to the Liberal Party. The vote on the NDP amendment to the budget tied, and with the Speaker of the House voting to continue debate, the Liberals stayed in power. At the time, some considered the matter to be a constitutional crisis.|$|E
2500|$|All three Manitoba {{party leaders}} {{agreed to a}} federally {{brokered}} compromise in June 1990, shortly before the accord's official deadline. [...] The accord nonetheless failed to pass in the Manitoba legislature because of a <b>procedural</b> <b>motion</b> from Elijah Harper, a Cree member of the NDP caucus who argued {{that it did not}} give fair representation to indigenous Canadians. [...] Doer described Harper's decision as [...] "a fundamental issue of conscience", and blamed Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for delaying negotiations until the deadline had almost expired. [...] One year later, he indicated that he felt [...] "betrayed" [...] by federal negotiators, and described the entire Meech Lake process as [...] "dishonest from start to finish".|$|E

Pepper refused to recognize any of the women waiting to speak and instead called on someone to speak about the American Indians. Five women, including Firestone, rushed the podium to demand to know why. William F.

40|$|We {{collect data}} on the record of every action in over one {{thousand}} cases involving public companies from 2004 to 2011 in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which is the leading court for corporate law disputes in the United States. We use these data to estimate how markets respond to Delaware litigation events and characteristics such as case initiations, <b>procedural</b> <b>motions,</b> case quality, and judge identity. We find that negative abnormal returns {{are associated with the}} filing of derivative and contract cases, but we observe little effect associated with the filing of the average merger challenge. When we include measures of case quality, we see that higher quality cases increase the expected impact of derivative and contract litigation on firm value. We also develop evidence that tactics associated with multijurisdictional litigation are associated with a weakened impact of litigation on firm value. This evidence is consistent with the belief that the presence of litigation in another jurisdiction allows defense lawyers to bid down competing groups of plaintiffs’ lawyers during settlement negotiations. Finally, we show that abnormal returns are not associated with information on judicial assignment at the time of case filing, nor are they associated with judge identity at case resolution. These results suggest that the judicial impact on shareholder wealth at the time of judicial assignment and the time of case termination is too small to be statistically detected...|$|R

40|$|<b>Procedural</b> human <b>motion</b> {{generation}} {{is still an}} open area of research. Most research into <b>procedural</b> human <b>motion</b> focus on two problem areas: the realism of the generated motion and the computation time required to generate the motion. Realism is a problem because humans are very adept at spotting the subtle nuances of human motion and so the computer generated motion tends to look mechanical. Computation time is a problem because {{the complexity of the}} motion generation algorithms results in lengthy processing times for greater levels of realism. The balancing human problem poses {{the question of how to}} procedurally generate, in real-time, realistic standing poses of an articulated human body. This report presents the balancing human algorithm that addresses both concerns: realism and computation time. Realism was addressed by integrating two existing algorithms. One algorithm addressed the physics of the human motion and the second addressed the prediction of the next pose in the animation sequence. Computation time was addressed by identifying techniques to simplify or constrain the algorithms so that the real-time goal can be met. The research methodology involved three tasks: developing and implementing the balancing human algorithm, devising a real-time simulation graphics engine, and then evaluating the algorithm with the engine. An object-oriented approach was used to model the balancing human as an articulated body consisting of systems of rigid-bodies connected together with joints. The attributes and operations of the object-oriented model were derived from existing published algorithms...|$|R

This action was seen as controversial with many prominent Republican politicians, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, speaking out against the punishment.|$|E
50|$|The {{legislation}} collapsed for {{a variety}} of reasons, {{not the least of which}} was the poor timing of debating a bill predicted to increase energy costs while much of the country is focused on $4-a-gallon gas. On top of that, a number of industrial state Democrats like Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio were uncomfortable with the strong emissions caps that would have created a new regime of regulations for coal, auto and other manufacturing industries. Republicans, for the most part, held firm against a bill they said would cost billions in regulations while pushing the cost of gas higher.

40|$|Abstract — Automatic motion {{generation}} {{for digital}} character under the real-time user {{control is a}} challenging problem for computer graphic research and virtual environment applications such as on-line games. The present study introduces a methodology to generate a glove puppet animation which is controlled by a new input device, called the SmartGlove, capturing the hand motion. An animation system is proposed to generate the puppet animation based on the <b>procedural</b> animation and <b>motion</b> capture data from SmartGlove. As {{the control of the}} puppet character in the animation takes into account the design of SmartGlove and the operation of the puppet in reality, the physical hand motion can either activate the designed <b>procedural</b> animation through <b>motion</b> recognition or tune the parameters of the procedural animation to build the new puppet motion, which allows the direct user control on the animation. The potential application and improvement of the current animation system are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|As the {{legislative}} {{body of the}} European Union (EU), the European Parliament (EP) comprises 732 elected representatives from over 150 national political parties from 25 member states. At the EP level, these members are affiliated with seven major party groups representing distinct policy positions. Here we provide precise estimates of these policy positions based on expert surveys, in addition to characterizing the dimensionality of policy competition in the EP. Our results suggest not only that party groups have identifiable and differentiated positions on multiple issues of policy, but also that these positions group broadly into two orthogonal dimensions: one consisting of classic left–right social and economic issues, and the other related to the powers and scope of EU institutions. KEY WORDS European Parliament expert surveys party competition policy positions Policy and Party Competition in the European Parliament Legislative activity and decision-making in the European Parliament (EP) is organized around political groups, partisan entities that perform most of the same functions at the transnational level as do parties in national parlia-ments. Political groups act as the gatekeepers to legislative amendments and the vast bulk of interruptive and <b>procedural</b> <b>motions</b> in the EP. In addition, political group size determines membership of committees and most other key parliamentary decision-making bodies. Despite the important role played by these groups in {{the functioning of the}} increasingly powerful EP, however, our understanding and knowledge of the policy space in which they compete remain rudimentary. This article addresses this gap in our knowledge by reporting the results of an expert survey of the policy posi-tions of the political groups in the EP...|$|R
