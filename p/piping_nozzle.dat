40|$|Tutorialpg. 157 Pump {{reliability}} {{problems are}} responsible for {{a large amount of}} the maintenance budget and lost-opportunity cost at chemical plants, refineries, and many electric utilities. This tutorial outlines the typical reasons for pump failures, and how they can be avoided in many cases by applying the right kinds of analysis and criteria during the pump selection process. Specifically, important issues include where the pump will operate on its curve (preferably close to best efficiency point (BEP)), how its net positive suction head required (NPSHR) compares to the worst case suction head available, the design of the piping hydraulics in the suction and discharge piping close to the pump, {{and the manner in which}} <b>piping</b> <b>nozzle</b> loads will be accommodated. Whether or not the ideal pump has been selected, installation must be performed in a manner that avoids hot misalignment, soft foot issues, and thermal bowing of the casing. Once the pump is installed as part of an overall process or system, it is shown how proper startup and steady operation procedures will avoid binding the pump rotor due to temperature differential within the rotor or casing. Appropriate types and locations of instrumentation will be discussed, and various other condition monitoring methods and criteria. The most productive troubleshooting test methods will be discussed. The usefulness of detailed vibration testing (especially operating deflection shape plotting) and experimental modal analysis ?bump? testing will be illustrated. When and why rotordynamic analysis or finite element analysis might be performed will be discussed, as well as what kinds of information these analyses can provide to an end user that could be critical in making decisions about premature shutdown or permanent modifications that should be scheduled for the next outage. Predictive maintenance test and evaluation procedures will be discussed, and it will be shown how these can be used to diagnose problems in many cases. Some specific case histories will be discussed in the context of typical or particularly problematic situations that plants have faced, and what types of solutions were effective at inexpensively providing a permanent fit...|$|E
50|$|Between 1980 and 1984 Siopis {{developed}} her 'cake' paintings which {{sprang from}} her childhood experiences of watching her mother ice cakes {{in the family}} bakery. Siopis’ fascination with the implements used in the shop gave rise to this first series of her career. Instead of the traditional paintbrush techniques, she used unconventional implements such as <b>piping</b> <b>nozzles</b> and other tools used in the decoration of cakes. Concerned with exploring the materiality of paint and its potential as object, Siopis worked with oil paint {{in a way that}} strayed from the norm, layering it thickly in high relief, in a technique referred to as ‘impasto’. This approach causes the outside layer of the medium to dry long before the interior, leading the surface to wrinkle and crack over time.|$|R

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this procedure, the term "ARB " refers to the State of California Air Resources Board, and the term "ARB Executive Officer " refers to the Executive Officer of the ARB or his or her {{authorized}} representative or designate. 1. 1 General This procedure applies to novel vapor recovery systems for controlling gasoline vapors emitted during the dispensing of the fuel into motor vehicles (Phase II). This procedure is only applicable if previously certified vapor recovery equipment (nozzle, hose, P/V valve, etc.) are used with the system. However, if uncertified vapor recovery equipment is used with the system, then such equipment may require prior certification by CP- 201. Small, integral aboveground tank systems shall be tested during the summer months (normally between May and October) when heat transfer rate, solar insolation, and diurnal temperature variation are at a maximum. Vapor recovery systems are complete systems and shall include all necessary <b>piping,</b> <b>nozzles,</b> couplers, processing units, storage tanks and any other equipment necessary for the control of gasoline vapors during fueling operations. This procedure applies to any vapor emissions associated with the dispensing of any fluid, although it is written to reflect application to the hydrocarbon (HC) vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline at facilities with balance, hybrid, or assist type vapor recovery systems. 1. 2 Modifications Additional modifications may be required for unique installations. Any modification of this method shall be subject to approval by the ARB Executive Officer...|$|R
5000|$|The Round Knob Hotel {{burned to}} the ground in 1903, and the {{fountain}} fell into disrepair. In 1911, George Fisher Baker, a wealthy New York financier and philanthropist who had been friends with Colonel Andrews, funded its restoration. The Southern Railway Company did not grant continuation of the easement for the fountain at that time, so a new, five-sided basin was constructed about 70 yards across Mill Creek, and the <b>piping</b> and <b>nozzle</b> were moved (to the fountain's current location). The town of Old Fort was given rights to the basin and the pipe that carries the water, and the fountain was formally named Andrews Geyser.|$|R
40|$|Special Paperpg. 267 - 274 At recent {{chemical}} plants and {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) plants, the increase of plant capacity has caused the size of turbomachinery to increase and larger nozzle sizes are being utilized. Especially for offshore facilities, a simpler piping arrangements is required despite the larger capacity trend because the space around the turbomachinery is constrained and therefore the piping design allows for less flexibility in its arrangement. Additionally, the heavier total weight of the turbomachinery and the larger size of <b>piping</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{make it more difficult}} for plant contractors to handle external piping forces and moments. Although NEMA SM 23 (1994) or API standard 617 (2002) have been conventionally referred to for allowable loads in turbomachinery piping arrangement designs, the increase in plant capacity and piping size with larger machine installations for offshore facilities has heightened the need to relax this specification. In this study, the possibility of relaxing the maximum allowable load on centrifugal compressors and steam turbines in investigated based on the general design philosophy of turbomachinery, the authors? experience and analysis of quantitative influence using finite element method (FEM) of typical machines with a piping load of 1. 85 times the allowable limit specified by NEMS SM 23 (1994). Various key components including nozzle deformation, stress level, clearance and misalignment of shaft ends a reexamined and, as a result, a bottleneck (i. e., the limiting factor) which should be taken into account for centrifugal compressors and steam turbines, is clarified in the case of excess piping load. Finally, applicable solution from the machine manufacturer?s side are suggested in order to relax this specification for piping loads on turbomachinery...|$|R
50|$|By definition, an {{automatic}} {{fire suppression system}} can operate without human intervention. To do so it must possess a means of detection, actuation and delivery. In many systems, detection is accomplished by mechanical or electrical means. Mechanical detection uses fusible-link or thermo-bulb detectors. These detectors are designed to separate at a specific temperature and release tension on a release mechanism. Electrical detection uses heat detectors equipped with self-restoring, normally-open contacts which close when a predetermined temperature is reached. Remote and local manual operation is also possible. Actuation usually involves either a pressurized fluid and a release valve, {{or in some cases}} an electric pump. Delivery is accomplished by means of <b>piping</b> and <b>nozzles.</b> Nozzle design is specific to the agent used and coverage desired.|$|R
40|$|The {{machines}} tested are in-line shredders {{used primarily}} to reduce tough solids to a size {{that will not}} clog or otherwise affect pumps, <b>piping,</b> valves, <b>nozzles,</b> filter presses or other components in the system. Two of these inline shredders, the Super Shredder® and the DeLumper®, were tested for head losses at various flowrates. The testing system consisting of a pump, PVC piping, and the shredder support structure, was incorporated into to the existing flume {{in the basement of}} Hick's Hall. Flowrates were determined from the pressure drop across an orifice plate using a manometer. Pressure drop across the shredder was measured with both a diaphragm pressure transducer and a manometer. Correlations accurate to within +/- 10 % for the Super Shredder® and within +/- 5 % for the DeLumper® were obtained for pressure drop as a function of flow rate...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a review of}} nuclear industry efforts to manage thermal fatigue, flow-accelerated corrosion, and water hammer damage to pressurized water reactor (PWR) feedwater <b>nozzles,</b> <b>piping,</b> and feedrings. The review includes an evaluation of design modifications, operating procedure changes, augmented inspection and monitoring programs, and mitigation, repair and replacement activities. Four actions were taken: (a) review of field experience to identify trends of operating events, (b) review of technical literature, (c) visits to PWR plants and a PWR vendor, and (d) solicitation of information from 8 other countries. Assessment of field experience is that licensees have apparently taken sufficient action to minimize feedwater nozzle cracking caused by thermal fatigue and wall thinning of J-tubes and feedwater piping. Specific industry actions to minimize the wall-thinning in feedrings and thermal sleeves were not found, but visual inspection and necessary repairs are being performed. Assessment of field experience indicates that licensees have taken sufficient action to minimize steam generator water hammer in both top-feed and preheat steam generators. Industry efforts to minimize multiple check valve failures that have allowed backflow of steam from a steam generator and have {{played a major role}} in several steam generator water hammer events were not evaluated. A major finding of this review is that analysis, inspection, monitoring, mitigation, and replacement techniques have been developed for managing thermal fatigue and flow-accelerated corrosion damage to feedwater <b>nozzles,</b> <b>piping,</b> and feedrings. Adequate training and appropriate applications of these techniques would ensure effective management of this damage...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The {{metalworker}} can {{be exposed}} to cutting oils during application by two basic routes of entry: skin contact and inhalation. The higher risk jobs tend to be those with high cutting speeds, heavy oil flow, and continuous contact, which may result in the worker being splashed with oil on the skin or clothing. The oil may remain on the skin {{for some time and}} oil-soaked clothing may be worn all shift. Cutting oils may be applied manually, by an air-carried mist, or by a continuous flood. When flooding is used, the oil is delivered by a pump, <b>piping,</b> and <b>nozzle</b> to the cutting zone. With this method the tool, work, and chip are flooded. (Used fluid is then collected in the chip pan and returned by gravity to the pump sump.) Inhalation of cutting oil mists may occur {{because of the nature of}} coolant delivery or because of the high temperatures and speeds generated at the cutting tool 2 ̆ 7 s working edge. When the mist stream method of coolant delivery is used, much of it evaporates on contact with the hot tool, workpiece or chip. In addition to the intentional production of oil mists, vaporized oil can also be generated by the forces of the rapidly spinning workpiece or tool, or by the vaporization of the fluid from the heat of the cutting process...|$|R
5000|$|... "Water spray" [...] {{systems are}} operationally {{identical}} to a deluge system, but the <b>piping</b> and discharge <b>nozzle</b> spray patterns {{are designed to}} protect a uniquely configured hazard, usually being three-dimensional components or equipment (i.e. {{as opposed to a}} deluge system, which is designed to cover the horizontal floor area of a room). The nozzles used may not be listed fire sprinklers, and are usually selected for a specific spray pattern to conform to the three-dimensional nature of the hazard (e.g. typical spray patterns being oval, fan, full circle, narrow jet). Examples of hazards protected by water spray systems are electrical transformers containing oil for cooling or turbo-generator bearings. Water spray systems can also be used externally on the surfaces of tanks containing flammable liquids or gases (such as hydrogen). Here the water spray is intended to cool the tank and its contents to prevent tank rupture/explosion (BLEVE) and fire spread.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} primary {{factors that affect}} the {{cleaning}} results in an aqueous parts washer. These factors are mechanical energy, temperature, detergent and time. Adjusting {{any one of these}} factors in a cleaning cycle changes the cleaning results. A parts washer with large amounts of mechanical energy and a high temperature delivers shorter cleaning cycles and uses less cleaning detergent. Mechanical energy is provided by the pump drive system. Most aqueous parts washers use an electric motor to drive a centrifugal pump. The mechanical energy delivered to the wash load is what defines the mechanical energy for cleaning and not the horsepower of the pump. Efficient use of the pump motor energy through a well designed centrifugal pump and attention to details of <b>piping</b> design and <b>nozzle</b> types are critical to put the most mechanical energy into the cleaning process. Additionally, one must consider the work volume of the parts washer. In order to achieve similar results, from one size machine to another, the power density must be the same for a given work volume, This factor requires that substantially higher horsepower pumping systems be used as the work volume increases exponentially on larger diameter machines.|$|R
40|$|At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the {{two main}} cooling tower systems (central and northwest) were {{upgraded}} {{during the summer of}} 1997 to reduce the generation of hazardous waste. In 1996, these two tower systems generated approximately 135, 400 lbs (61, 400 kg) of hazardous sludge, which is more than 90 percent of the hazardous waste for the site annually. At both, wet decks (cascade reservoirs) were covered to block sunlight. Covering the cascade reservoirs reduced the amount of chemical conditioners (e. g. algaecide and biocide), required and in turn the amount of waste generated was reduced. Additionally, at the northwest cooling tower system, a sand filtration system was installed to allow cyclical filtering and backflushing, and new pumps, <b>piping,</b> and spray <b>nozzles</b> were installed to increase agitation. the appurtenance upgrade increased the efficiency of the cooling towers. The sand filtration system at the northwest cooling tower system enables operators to continuously maintain the cooling tower water quality without taking the towers out of service. Operational costs (including waste handling and disposal) and maintenance activities are compared for the cooling towers before and after upgrades. Additionally, the effectiveness of the sand filter system in conjunction with the wet deck covers (northwest cooling tower system), versus the cascade reservoir covers alone (south cooling tower south) is discussed. the overall expected return on investment is calculated to be in excess of 250 percent. this upgrade has been incorporated into the 1998 DOE complex-wide water conservation project being led by Sandia National Laboratory/Albuquerque...|$|R
