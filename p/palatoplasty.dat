50|$|Normally {{when the}} patient has VPI, first of all the palatum will be closed. If speech is not as aimed, <b>palatoplasty</b> will take place. This is an {{operation}} in which the velopharyngeal port is narrowed down and functionally improved.|$|E
50|$|Velopharyngeal {{insufficiency}} {{remains in}} 5-20% {{of the patients}} who underwent surgery for closing the palatal cleft. Therefore, a secondary operation is necessary.

50|$|<b>Palatoplasty</b> is a {{surgical}} procedure used to correct or reconstruct the palate {{in a person}} with a cleft palate. The basic goals of the procedure are to close the abnormal opening between the nose and mouth, to help the patient develop normal speech, and to aid in swallowing, breathing and normal development of associated structures in the mouth. Any person with any degree of a cleft palate is a candidate for <b>palatoplasty.</b> The procedure is usually performed on infants. The ideal age for the patient is between six and twelve months of age. If the surgery is carried out much beyond three years of age, speech development may not be optimal. 80% of the time, development of the palate and speech is normal after only one procedure.|$|E
40|$|Since 1958, 900 {{children}} with cleft lip and palate were operated {{on at the}} University Hospital Brugmann in Brussels.

50|$|Few {{advantages}} of the vomer flap procedure include the relative simple execution compared to other <b>palatoplasties,</b> amount of surgery time, and similarity between the vomer tissue and the nasal mucosa. A major disadvantage of the vomer flap surgery is the varying size and visibility of the vomer in different patients. If the vomer is not visible or too small to cover the cleft, the procedure cannot be done. Another disadvantage {{of the use of}} the vomer flap in the oral cavity is that the vomer tissue does not aesthetically match the oral mucosa. The color and texture of the vomer mucosa matches the nasal mucosa much better than the oral mucosa. Sometimes, patients are displeased and uncomfortable with the visible vomer flap in the oral cavity.|$|R
50|$|Both {{techniques}} are used often, {{but there is}} no standard operation. Pharyngeal flap surgery is not better than sphincter <b>palatoplasty.</b> It is more upon the surgeon's experience, knowledge and preference which operation will be done. Also the patient’s age, and the size and nature of the velopharyngeal defect, contribute to which technique is used.|$|E
50|$|A common {{method to}} treat Velopharyngeal {{insufficiency}} is pharyngeal flap surgery, where tissue {{from the back}} of the mouth is used to close part of the gap. Other ways of treating velopharyngeal insufficiency is by placing a posterior nasopharyngeal wall implant (commonly cartilage or collagen) or type of soft palate lengthening procedure (i.e. VY <b>palatoplasty).</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1950 Bardach {{graduated}} from the Moscow Medical Stomatologogical Institute, and completed his residency there as well in 1954, specializing in reconstructive maxillofacial surgery.

Eventually, he developed the procedure known as the Bardach <b>palatoplasty.</b>|$|E
50|$|The vomer is a {{triangle}} shaped bone {{that forms the}} inferior and posterior portion of the nasal septum (www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic519.htm). A vomer flap {{is a type of}} <b>palatoplasty</b> surgery that uses the mucoperiosteal tissue of the vomer to cover a unilateral or bilateral cleft palate. This procedure can be used to reconstruct the nasal or oral surfaces by either raising the vomer or creating a flap. Surgical procedures can be combined according to type of clefting in order to ensure the best outcomes for the patient. Vomer flap surgery involves the suture line of the vomer bone which is an important site for midface growth. In this case, a suture line refers to boundary between two bony plates which eventually grow together as the child matures.|$|E
50|$|Pharyngoplasties {{correcting}} hypernasal speech can {{be traced}} back as far as the 19th century when Passavant first explored palatopexy in a 23-year-old female (Hall et al., 1991). In 1876, Schoenborn also attempted {{to reduce the amount of}} air entering the nasal cavity by developing the first true inferior based pharyngeal flap surgery, where a flap of tissue was sutured into the velum and attached to the lower end of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Modifying his technique, Schoenborn published a superior based pharyngeal flap surgery in 1886, where the flap of tissue attached to the upper end of the posterior pharyngeal wall. In 1928, Rosenthal used an inferiorly based posterior pharyngeal flap in combination with a modified von Langenbeck <b>palatoplasty</b> in primary surgery for cleft palate repair. Taking a different approach, Padgett (1930) utilized a superiorly based flap for cleft palate patients whose primary surgical repair had been unsuccessful (Sloan, 2000). By the 1950s, posterior pharyngeal flap surgery became widely adopted in the correction of VPI (Peterson-Falzone et al., 2001).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{compared}} the dental arch morphology of adult patients with isolated cleft palate {{in order to}} verify the influence of <b>palatoplasty</b> on occlusion. METHODS: Cast models of 77 patients, 30 males and 47 females, {{with an average age}} of 21 years and no syndromes were taken. They were in the permanent dentition and had not undergone orthodontic treatment. The sample was divided into non-operated and operated patients, the latter having been submitted to <b>palatoplasty</b> at a mean age of 2. 2 years. RESULTS: Almost 80 % of the sample exhibited sagittal discrepancies in the inter-arch relationship, with a Class II malocclusion prevailing (59. 74 %) followed by Class III (20, 78 %), regardless of <b>palatoplasty.</b> Transverse analysis showed a 23 % incidence of posterior crossbite also not influenced by <b>palatoplasty.</b> Intra-arch relationship indicated that constriction and crowding on the upper arch were more frequent in the operated group (p= 0. 0238 and p= 0. 0002, respectively), showing an influence of <b>palatoplasty</b> on its morphology. The predominant morphological characteristics in patients with isolated cleft palate were a Class II malocclusion, upper dental arch constriction and upper and lower anterior crowding. CONCLUSION: The influence of <b>palatoplasty</b> was restricted to constriction and crowding of the upper dental arch, with no interference from the extension of the cleft, except for the upper crowding, which occurred more in patients with complete cleft palates...|$|E

40|$|Cleft palate affects {{almost every}} {{function}} of the face except vision. Today a child born with cleft palate with or without cleft lip {{should not be considered}} as unfortunate, because surgical repair of cleft palate has reached a highly satisfactory level. However for an average cleft surgeon <b>palatoplasty</b> remains an enigma. The surgery differs from centre to centre and surgeon to surgeon. However there is general agreement that <b>palatoplasty</b> (soft palate at least) should be performed between 6 - 12 months of age. Basically there are three groups of <b>palatoplasty</b> techniques. One is for hard palate repair, second for soft palate repair and the third based on the surgical schedule. Hard palate repair techniques are Veau-Wardill-Kilner V-Y, von Langenbeck, two-flap, Aleveolar extension <b>palatoplasty,</b> vomer flap, raw area free <b>palatoplasty</b> etc. The soft palate techniques are intravelar veloplasty, double opposing Z-plasty, radical muscle dissection, primary pharyngeal flap etc. And the protocol based techniques are Schweckendiek&#x 2032;s, Malek&#x 2032;s, whole in one, modified schedule with <b>palatoplasty</b> before lip repair etc. One should also know the effect of each technique on maxillofacial growth and speech.

40|$|Background: The {{challenge}} in <b>palatoplasty</b> {{is no longer}} a successful closure of the cleft palate but an optimal speech outcome without compromising maxillofacial growth. On the contrary, repairing cleft palate as soon as possible is recommended to improve speech. The surgeon proposed two-stage <b>palatoplasty</b> in early aged, range between 4 to 30 months. The delayed hard palate closure started approximately between the age of three years and one year after soft <b>palatoplasty</b> to avoid temporary retracted oral articulation of certain consonant. Patient and Methods: 11 -months old and 9 -months old patients with non-syndromic unilateral cleft lip and palate had undergone soft <b>palatoplasty.</b> Speech was examined as a perceptual assessment, using protocol in Craniomaxillofacial Center Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, in the age of 29 months by an experienced speech pathologist. Result: Patient 1 has mild hypernasality, adequate velopharyngeal competence, normal articulation pattern, phonation and speech intelligibility. Patient 2 has misarticulation pattern,which are omission or weak consonants, substitution of pharyngeal stop, mild to moderate hypernasality, mild impairment in speech intelligibility, and inadequate velopharyngeal competence. Summary: Speech outcome is in!uenced by intense speech practicing done by their parents. The patient can work on the misarticulation.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Palatoplasty</b> is a {{surgical}} procedure that aims at {{the reconstruction of}} the soft and/or hard palate. Actually, we dispose of different techniques that look for the bigger stretching of the soft palate joint to the nasofaryngeal wall to contribute in the appropriate operation of the velopharyngeal sphincter. Failure in its closing brings on speech dysfunctions. Objective: To compare the auditory-perceptive' evaluations and instrumental findings in patients with cleft lip and palate operate through three distinctive techniques of <b>palatoplasty.</b> Method: A prospective transversal study of a group of patients with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate. Everybody was subjected to a randomized clinical essay, through distinctive techniques of <b>palatoplasty</b> performed for a single surgeon, about 8 years. In the period of the surgery, the patients were divided in three distinctive groups with 10 participants each one. The present study has evaluates: 10 patients of the Furlow technique, 7 patients of the Veau-Wardill-Kilner+Braithwaite technique and, 9 patients of the Veau-Wardill-Kilner+Braithwaite+Zetaplasty technique; having a total sample of 26 individuals. All the patients were subjected to auditory-perceptive evaluation through speech recording. An instrumental evaluation was also performed through video endoscopy exam. Results: The findings were satisfactory in the three techniques, in other words, the majority of the individuals does not present hyper nasality, compensatory articulatory disturbance and audible nasal air emission.

40|$|The {{presence}} of low intraoral pressure in speech following surgical correction of cleft palate Fraca pressão aérea intraoral na fala após correção cirúrgica da fissura palatina Background: Several anatomical and functional changes are observed in individuals with cleft lip and palate, including structural abnormalities of the oropharyngeal muscles, {{which can cause}} loss of velopharyngeal function and other functions such as sucking, swallowing, and speaking. The present study aimed to evaluate the {{presence of}} weak intraoral air pressure in the speech of individuals with cleft palate who underwent primary <b>palatoplasty</b> {{at the appropriate time}} or at a late stage and assess whether surgical timing may lead to a higher occurrence of the disorder. We hypothesized that individuals who undergo belated primary <b>palatoplasty</b> show a higher occurrence of weak intraoral air pressure compared to those who undergo primary <b>palatoplasty</b> at the appropriate time. Methods: This study included 37 patients of both sexes with a diagnosis of cleft palate, with or without cleft lip, who were divided into 2 groups: 1) early group (GP), consisting of 22 patients who underwent primary <b>palatoplasty</b> during the second year of life, and 2) the late group (GT), comprising 15 patients who underwent primary <b>palatoplasty</b> at a later stage, after acquiring speech sounds. All participants underwent routine clinical assessment with an interval of at least 3 months after surgery. Among the parameters evaluated, weak intraoral air pressure was an important variable considered in this study. Results: Data analysis revealed a higher fre-quency of weak intraoral air pressure in the GT group (33 %) as compared to the GP group (18 %). However, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 44). Conclusions: The study hypothesis was rejected.

40|$|Background: Adult primary <b>palatoplasty</b> is more {{challenging}} than in infants because the gaps are wider. The risk of intraoperative bleeding and palatal!stula are higher. Most adults with un-operated palatal cleft have good maxillary growth but poor speech. The {{aim of this}} study is to introduce our technique in repairing wide cleft palate in adult patients. Patients and Methods: We report four patients with cleft palate who underwent <b>palatoplasty</b> at adulthood. The age ranges from 17 to 20 years. Interspina distance were between 2 to 3. 5 cm. All of them were nonsyndromic and had normal maxillary growth. The surgical technique used on these patients was two-"ap <b>palatoplasty</b> with an additional 3 mm gingival bulk on the lateral side of the "ap. Honey was given as oral drops postoperatively. Result: Lateral palatal defect healed well and epithelialized completely between 7 - 14 days postoperative and only one small palatal!stula was found with this modi!ed technique. All subjects had good maxillary growth, and speech outcome was poor to begin with. Summary: Two-"ap <b>palatoplasty</b> can adequately provide palatal closure, especially with an additional lateral "ap extension to include gingival components.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{number of}} {{surgical}} procedures {{to repair a}} cleft palate {{may play a role}} in the outcome for maxillofacial growth and speech. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the relationship between the number of surgical procedures performed to repair the cleft palate and maxillofacial growth, speech and fistula formation in non-syndromic patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search was performed in PubMed/old MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL databases for publications between 1960 and December 2015. Publications before 1950 -journals of plastic and maxillofacial surgery-were hand searched. Additional hand searches were performed on studies mentioned in the reference lists of relevant articles. Search terms included unilateral, cleft lip and/or palate and <b>palatoplasty.</b> Two reviewers assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted data, applied quality indicators and graded level of evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. All were retrospective and non-randomized comparisons of one- and two-stage <b>palatoplasty.</b> The methodological quality of most of the studies was graded moderate to low. The outcomes concerned the comparison of one- and two-stage <b>palatoplasty</b> with respect to growth of the mandible, maxilla and cranial base, and speech and fistula formation.

40|$|A {{two-stage}} palatal repair using {{a modification}} of Furlow <b>palatoplasty</b> is presented. The authors investigate the speech outcome, fistula formation and maxillary growth. In a prospective, successive cohort study, 40 nonsyndromic patients with wide cleft palate were operated on between March 2001 and June 2006 by a single surgeon. 10 patients in the first cohort underwent a Furlow <b>palatoplasty</b> (control group). In 30 patients in the second cohort a unilateral myomucosal cheek flap was used in combination with a modified Furlow <b>palatoplasty</b> (study group). The hard palate was closed in both groups 9 - 12 months later. The Bzoch speech quality score was superior in the study group, and the hypernasality was significantly reduced in the study group. Overall fistula formation was 0 %. At the time of hard palate reconstruction palatal cleft width was significantly reduced. Relative short-term follow up of maxillary growth was excellent. There were no postoperative haematomas, infections, or episodes of airway obstruction. This technique is particularly encouraging, because of better speech outcome, absence of raw surfaces on the soft palate, no fistula formation, and good maxillary growth.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of <b>palatoplasty</b> is to achieve a tension-free palatal closure {{ensuring}} no postoperative complications. Many surgeons fracture the pterygoid hamulus to minimize tension during <b>palatoplasty.</b> However, this maneuver gained criticism by some authors {{on the grounds that}} it may lead to Eustachian Tube dysfunction. Our study intended to figure out the relationship of hamulus fracture with the postoperative state of middle ear in cleft palate children. Fifty consecutive cleft palate patients with an age range of 10 months to 5 years were recruited. All the patients were assigned to either hamulotomy or nonhamulotomy group preoperatively. The patients were subjected to otoscopic examination and auditory function evaluation by brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA) preoperatively and 1 month and 6 months postoperatively. Otoscopy revealed that the difference in the improvement of middle ear status in both groups was statistically insignificant. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the BERA outcomes of the fracture and nonfracture populations. Complication rate in both groups was also statistically not significant. It can be concluded that hamulotomy does not have any effect on the hearing ability in cleft palate population, so hamulotomy can be performed for tension-free closure during <b>palatoplasty...</b>|$|E

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the influence of isolated cleft palate and <b>palatoplasty</b> on the face, based on facial analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Lateral facial photographs of {{the right side of}} 85 young adult patients with cleft palate were analyzed, of whom 50 were operated on and 35 had never received any previous surgical treatment. The nasolabial angle and zygomatic projection were used to define the maxillary position in the face. Mandibular positioning was classified as Pattern I, II and III. RESULTS: Patients were distributed into 54. 12 % as Pattern I, 32. 94 % Pattern II and 12. 94 % Pattern III. Distribution of facial patterns did not show statistically significant differences between groups (p> 0. 05). Although <b>palatoplasty</b> did not influence the facial pattern, the zygomatic projection was vulnerable to plastic surgeries. Twenty-eight percent of the patients in the operated group showed zygomatic deficiency, compared to only 8. 5 % in the unoperated group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{analyzed}} histological and histochemical {{features of}} specimens of the orbicularis oris muscle, and palatal and pharyngeal muscles biopsied during surgery from 33 patients affected by cleft lip and palate. DESIGN: Three groups were studied: 20 patients affected by cleft palate {{with or without}} cleft lip (at the time of primary <b>palatoplasty),</b> seven by cleft lip with or without cleft palate (primary lip closure), and six by cleft lip with or without cleft palate (secondary cheiloplasty). Muscle sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, modified Gomori trichrome, ATPase reaction at pH 9. 4, and NADH-TR. Analyzed parameters included organization, muscle fiber size and type, nuclear changes, presence of ragged-red fibers, degree of fibrosis, and presence of inflammatory infiltrate. RESULTS: In all patients who underwent primary <b>palatoplasty</b> and lip closure we noted dystrophic-like alterations of orbicularis oris and palatopharyngeal muscles, such as variability of fiber size, fiber disorganization, and increased fibrosis. The same alterations were found in adult patients submitted to secondary cheiloplasty, notwithstanding surgical repair. Furthermore, in all groups neither neurogenic atrophy nor ragged-red fibers or inflammatory infiltrate were detected.

Results: Of the 54 patients (29 male, 25 female) treated, five (9. 3 %) had positive family history of cleft lip/cleft palate. Twenty-two patients (40. 7 %) had associated cleft lip and four (7. 4 %) had other congenital malformations. Thirty-one palates were Veau classes I & II; 15 were class III, six were class IV, and two were submucous clefts. The mean ± SD patient age was 22. 8 ± 11. 9 months, and follow-up period 50. 6 ± 17. 5 months with five (9. 3 %) defaulted. Blood loss and operation time were significantly different among the different classes of clefts. There was one case of postoperative bleeding requiring immediate opening. Three palatal fistulae occurred, all within the first 3 years of the study period. Two were repaired with no recurrences. Conclusions: The surgeon's incidence of palatal fistula after Furlow <b>palatoplasty</b> is 5. 6 %, comparable to the low incidence reported by other surgeons using other methods of repair. © 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2006 College of Surgeons of Hong Kong. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine (Dex) administration would reduce the incidence and severity of EA after Sev-based anesthesia in infants undergoing <b>palatoplasty.</b> MethodsA prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted with 70 patients undergoing <b>palatoplasty,</b> aged 10 – 14 months. Infants were randomly allocated into two groups: Dex (n= 35) and saline (n= 35). In the Dex group, Dex (6 μg/kg/h) was administered approximately 10 min {{before the end of the}} surgery for 10 min, followed by 0. 4 μg/kg/h until 5 min after extubation. In the saline group, an equivalent amount of saline was administered in a similar manner. After the surgery, patients were transferred to the postanesthetic care unit (PACU). The infant's behavior and pain were assessed with scoring system for EA (5 -point rating scale) and pain scale (PS; 10 -point rating scale), respectively. EA and PS were estimated at six time points (after extubation, leaving the operating room, 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after arrival in PACU). ResultsEA and PS scores were significantly lower in the Dex group than in the saline group from extubation to 120 min after arrival in PACU. ConclusionsDex administration has the advantage of a reduced EA and PS without any adverse effects. Dex provided satisfactory recovery in infants undergoing <b>palatoplasty...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of behaviour management in medical treatment, especially in dental treatment, {{is needed to}} eliminate uncooperative children behaviour. The main factor influencing children behaviour is fear of painful that usually related to dental treatment. Children patients who will have their post­labioplasty and <b>palatoplasty</b> stitches removed have more sensitive condition, they cry when the dentist gives treatment. Using general anesthesia is a method to manage uncooperative children behaviour. Inhalational anesthesia is often used in general anesthesia and sevoflurane is a drug of choice. Sevoflurane has low solubility in blood, pleasant odor, nonirritating airway, and has a rapid induction of and recovery from anesthesia. Some researches indicate that sevoflurane gives more calm condition {{and can be used}} as a sufficiently ideal induction and maintenance of anesthesia in children. Sevoflurane can therefore made as alternative procedure in the removal of post-labioplasty and <b>palatoplasty</b> stitches...|$|E
