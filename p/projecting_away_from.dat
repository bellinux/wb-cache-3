If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials <b>projecting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground).

40|$|SummaryNeurons receive signals through {{dendrites}} {{that vary}} widely {{in number and}} organization, ranging from one primary dendrite to multiple complex dendritic trees. For example, retinal amacrine cells (ACs) project primary dendrites into a discrete synaptic layer called the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and only rarely extend processes into other retinal layers. Here, we show that the atypical cadherin Fat 3 ensures that ACs develop this unipolar morphology. AC precursors are initially multipolar but lose neurites as they migrate through the neuroblastic layer. In fat 3 mutants, pruning is unreliable and ACs elaborate two dendritic trees: one in the IPL and a second <b>projecting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the IPL that stratifies to form an additional synaptic layer.

40|$|Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell-adhesion {{proteins}} that associate with their presynaptic partners, the neurexins. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we determined {{the shapes of}} the extracellular region of several neuroligin isoforms in solution.

X-ray scattering and neutron contrast variation data show that two neurexin monomers, separated by 107 A, bind at symmetric locations {{on opposite sides of the}} long axis of the neuroligin dimer.

40|$|What is a {{mushroom}} body? The mushroom {{body is a}} prominent and striking structure in the brain of several invertebrates, mainly arthropods. It is found in insects, scorpions, spiders, and even segmented worms. With its long stalk crowned with a cap of cell bodies, a GFP-labeled mushroom body certainly {{lives up to its}} name (Figure 1). The mushroom body is composed of small neurons known as Kenyon cells, named after Frederick Kenyon, who first applied the Golgi staining technique to the insect brain. The honey bee brain, for instance, contains roughly 175, 000 neurons per mushroom body while the brain of the smaller fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster only possesses about 2, 500.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tau protein, a {{neuronal}} microtubule-associated protein, forms insoluble fibers (“paired helical filaments”) in Alzheimer’s {{disease and}} other tauopathies. Conflicting {{views on the}} structure of the fibers have been proposed recently, ranging from mainly R-helical structure to mainly â-sheet, or a mixture of mostly random coil and â-sheet. We have addressed this issue by studying tau fibers immunopurified from Alzheimer brain tissue by a conformation-specific antibody and comparing them with fibers reassembled from recombinant tau or tau constructs in vitro, using a combination of electron microscopy and spectroscopic methods. Brain-derived fibers and reassembled fibers both exhibit a typical twisted appearance when examined by electron microscopy. The soluble tau protein is a natively unfolded protein dominated by random coil structure, whereas Alzheimer PHFs and reassembled fibers show a shift toward an increase in the level of â-structure. The results support a model in which the repeat domain of tau (which lies within the core of PHFs) adopts an increasing level of â-structure during aggregation, whereas the N- and C-terminal domains <b>projecting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the PHF core are mostly random coil.

40|$|The N-terminal NC 4 {{domain of}} {{collagen}} IX is a globular structure <b>projecting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{the surface of}} the cartilage collagen fibril. Several interactions have been suggested for this domain, reflecting its location and its characteristic high isoelectric point. In an attempt to characterize the NC 4 domain in more detail, we set up a prokaryotic expression system to produce the domain. The purified 27. 5 -kDa product was analyzed for its glycosaminoglycan-binding potential by surface plasmon resonance and solid-state assays. The results show that the NC 4 domain of collagen IX specifically binds heparin with a K-d of 0. 6 muM, and the full-length recombinant collagen IX has an even stronger interaction with heparin, with an apparent K-d of 3. 6 nM. The heparin-binding site of the NC 4 domain was located in the extreme N terminus, containing a heparin-binding consensus sequence, whereas electron microscopy suggested the presence of at least three additional heparin-binding sites on full-length collagen IX. The NC 4 domain was also shown to bind cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. This interaction and the association of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein with other regions of collagen IX were found to be heparin-competitive. Circular dichroism analyses of the NC 4 domain indicated the presence of stabilizing disulfide bonds and a thermal denaturation point of about 80 degreesC. The pattern of disulfide bond formation within the NC 4 domain was identified by tryptic peptide mass mapping of the NC 4 in native and reduced states.

Acta Tropica, 136, 108 - 117 Sponsors: BBSRC RONO: BB/H 009256 / 1 Triclabendazole (TCBZ), the anthelmintic drug active against both mature and immature liver flukes, was used to investigate the effect of in vivo treatment on the tegumental surface of juvenile Fasciola gigantica. Five goats were infected with 150 F. gigantica metacercariae each by oral gavage. Four of them were treated with single dose of TCBZ at 10 mg/kg at four weeks post-infection. They were euthanized at 0 (untreated), 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post treatment. Juvenile flukes were manually retrieved from the goat livers and processed for scanning electron microscopy. In control flukes, the anterior region was adorned with sharply pointed spines <b>projecting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the surface, while in the posterior region, spines become shorter and narrower, loosing serration and {{with the appearance of}} distinct furrows and papillae. The dorsal surface retained the same pattern of surface architecture similar to that of ventral surface. Flukes obtained from 24 h post-treatment did not show any apparent change and were still very active. However, there were limited movements and some blebbing, swelling, deposition of tegumental secretions and some flattening displayed by the flukes of 48 h post-treatment. All the worms were found dead 72 h post-treatment and showed advanced level of tegumental disruptions, consisting of severe distortion of spines, sloughing off the tegument to expose the basal lamina, formation of pores and isolated patches of lesions. By 96 h post-treatment, the disruption was extremely severe and the tegument was completely sheared off causing deeper lesions that exposed the underlying musculature. The disruption was more severe at posterior than anterior region and on ventral than dorsal surface. The present study further establishes the time-course of TCBZ action in vivo with 100 % efficacy against the juvenile tropical liver fluke. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic cilia/flagella are the {{evolutionary}} conserved microtubule-based organelles. <b>Projecting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the cell surface, they perform {{a variety of}} sensing, signaling, and motility-based functions. In humans, defective cilia lead to an array of pleiotropic disorders, which are collectively referred to as ciliopathies. The aim of my study is to identify and characterize the factors that play roles in the ciliary/flagellar assembly by using a simple model organism, Chlamydomonas. This study focuses on three flagellar assembly mutants, ift 57 - 1, ift 56 - 2, and arl 3, which are identified from a mutant library using a PCR-based method called restriction enzyme cassette mediated PCR. ift 57 - 1 and ift 56 - 2 carry mutations in two subunits of intraflagellar transport complex B (IFT-B), IFT 57 and IFT 56, respectively. In many ciliopathies, mutations {{have been identified in}} components of IFT complexes, which are mainly used for delivering cargos in and out of cilia. The ift 57 - 1 mutant expresses a reduced amount of IFT 57 (? 5 %) and assembles short motility-defective flagella with variable lengths. Although IFT 57 is proposed to play an essential role in bridging two IFT-B subcomplexes, IFT-B 1 and IFT-B 2, our results show that IFT 57 is not essential for the IFT-B assembly but rather functions to prevent IFT-B from degradation. Moreover, IFT 57 may deliver specific motility-related cargos including an inner dynein arm subunit IC 97. On the other hand, the null mutant ift 56 - 2 possesses evenly shortened flagella. We verify that IFT 56 is a bona fide IFT-B subunit. However, it is neither essential for the IFT-B assembly nor for the stability. Possible reasons leading to the shorter flagellar length in ift 56 mutants, including precursor pool size, axonemal disassembly rate, and known length regulators, are explored but are found to play insignificant roles. Recently, several small GTPases are reported to be involved in ciliogenesis. The small GTPase ARL 3 mutant arl 3 presents a variety of subtle flagellar defects. The mutant cells expressing the GTP-dominant form of ARL 3 possess significantly shortened flagella, indicating that GTPase activity of ARL 3 is involved in flagellar length control. Previous studies propose that ARL 3 is important for the flagellar transport of lipid-modified peripheral membrane proteins. Our data show that a myristoylated protein CrPKG is likely to be affected in arl 3. Using isolated pure flagella, we found that the amount of a few hydrophobic proteins, probably membrane proteins, are altered in the arl 3 flagella, suggesting that ARL 3 is involved in transport or retention of certain flagellar membrane proteins...|$|E
