5|$|After {{learning}} of the film adaptation from Nichols, Ben Stiller joined the project and signed a two-picture directing deal with Savoy. He spent nine months working on the script with Smith. During <b>preproduction,</b> however, Stiller had a falling out with Savoy over budget disputes—among them was how the studio's reported $4 million offer to Nicolas Cage would affect the film’s budget. Unable to secure financing from another studio, Stiller left the production.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} from December 12, 2007, to March 19, 2008, at Vancouver Film Studios, Vancouver Forum, Deer Lake, Jericho Park, and Simon Fraser University. The film was {{originally}} {{scheduled for release}} on May 9, 2008, but it was delayed until December 12, 2008, because filming commenced later than scheduled. By the time <b>preproduction</b> had started, Scarpa had written 40 drafts of the script. The film was mostly shot on sets because it was winter in Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|Fortress is {{the code}} {{name of a}} {{cancelled}} action role-playing video game that was in development by Grin. Director Ulf Andersson devised the concept for Fortress and <b>preproduction</b> began {{in the second half}} of 2008. During development, Square Enix approached the developer and proposed making the game a spin-off of Final Fantasy XII. Grin reconceived the game in the recurring Final Fantasy world of Ivalice, and included elements of Final Fantasy XII such as stylistic motifs and character designs; additional elements included chocobos and other recurring creatures from the Final Fantasy series. It was to be released on the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms.|$|E
5|$|Approval {{was given}} on 26 January 1973 for {{full-scale}} {{development of the}} AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three <b>preproduction</b> aircraft, {{the first of which}} performed its maiden flight in February 1975. To save costs, the endurance requirements were relaxed, allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in JOVIAL. A Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in Iceland, Europe, and Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A).|$|E
5|$|Philip DeGuere, whose {{credits include}} the TV series Alias Smith and Jones, {{developed}} a script {{in the late}} 1970s for Universal, who planned to film it initially as a six-hour mini-series for CBS Television, and later as a two- or three-hour telemovie for ABC. However, Universal discovered that its contracts with Arthur C. Clarke - some of which dated back to 1957 - were out of date. These contractual difficulties were resolved in 1979 and DeGuere worked with legendary comic book artist Neal Adams on <b>preproduction</b> drawings and other material. The project had Clarke's approval. However Universal decided that the budget required would be nearly $40 million and they were only prepared to spend $10 million, so the movie was not made.|$|E
5|$|Production of Skyfall was {{suspended}} throughout 2010 because of MGM's financial troubles. <b>Preproduction</b> resumed following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010; in January 2011, {{the film was}} officially given a release date of 9 November 2012 by MGM and the Broccoli family, with production scheduled to start in late 2011. Subsequently, MGM and Sony Pictures announced that the UK release date would be brought forward to 26 October 2012, two weeks ahead of the US release date, which remained scheduled for 9 November 2012. The film's budget is estimated to have been between US$ and $, compared to the $ spent on Quantum of Solace. Skyfall was part of year-long celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Dr. No and the Bond film series. According to producer Michael G. Wilson, a documentary crew was scheduled to follow production of the film to celebrate the anniversary.|$|E
5|$|Universal Pictures {{reported}} that it greenlit American Gangster with a budget of $80million, which escalated to $93million, with $10million for development costs and $3million for the delay of the production start date. Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93million from the beginning. The studio also sought for American Gangster to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company General Electric received tax credits in New York City, so production {{was moved to the}} city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as Ray Liotta and John C. Reilly in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the <b>preproduction</b> process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.|$|E
5|$|While HBO {{entertainment}} president Carolyn Strauss felt Carnivàle {{had come}} to a natural end with its second season and gave this as the network's explanation for not renewing Carnivàle, it was reported HBO president Chris Albrecht had originally wanted to conclude the second season of Carnivàle with a satisfying and close-ended confrontation between Brother Justin and Ben. Albrecht allegedly preferred a definite demise of Brother Justin to a cliffhanger, but show creator Daniel Knauf stated Albrecht might have been misquoted. According to Knauf, Albrecht had wished in <b>preproduction</b> discussions to conclude season 2 with a fight between Brother Justin and Ben, which had always been Knauf's intention. HBO had then approved the open ending by greenlighting the final scene in the writing phase, budgeting the filming including the final shot, and owning the rights of the final cut of all episodes. There was never a plan to cancel Carnivàle prematurely, and HBO had only decided the cancellation shortly before their announcement. However, Clancy Brown (Brother Justin) remembers the original last shot of the series as Iris watching the corn die, not of Ben in Management's trailer.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} in the series gradually changed during <b>preproduction,</b> with adjustments made to the names, genders and ethnicity. When the cast was announced at first, LeVar Burton was the main actor highlighted because of {{his work on the}} Roots mini series; his character, Geordi La Forge was named for a disabled fan. Although the casting was managed by producers Rick Berman and Robert H. Justman, Roddenberry intervened to switch the characters assigned to Marina Sirtis and Denise Crosby. Sirtis took over Crosby's role as Deanna Troi, and Crosby became Tasha Yar, who had been named Macha Hernandez while Sirtis held the part. Behind the scenes, the writing team became chaotic. Eddie Milkis had quit prior to casting, with Berman taking over from him. Roddenberry's insistence on re-writing scripts and unusual behaviour alienated some staff. Longtime Star Trek contributor D.C. Fontana quit, filing a claim with the Writer's Guild of America as she had been acting as story editor but was unpaid in the role. Such were the troubles that the series had a problem recruiting potential writers halfway through the season. By the end of the , all the writing staff recruited during season one except for Rick Berman had quit.|$|E

25|$|The F.5 {{prototype}} first flew on 19 February 1939. The aircraft displayed {{very high}} maneuverability during official testing, prompting {{an order for}} both a second prototype and 12 <b>preproduction</b> models.

25|$|The AH-64A then entered phase 2 of the AAH program. This {{called for}} {{building}} three <b>preproduction</b> AH-64s, and upgrading the two YAH-64A flight prototypes {{and the ground}} test unit up to the same standard. Weapons and sensor systems were integrated and tested during this time, including the new Hellfire missile.|$|E
25|$|In response, Bell {{built the}} Model 533 from a YH-40-BF, {{one of the}} six <b>preproduction</b> UH-1s. The dynamic {{components}} of the YH-40 were updated with components designed for the UH-1B. The research for the contract was split into two phases; phase one would be to determine the benefits of an overall reduction in drag, phase two would determine the benefits of auxiliary thrust.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 647 Bf 109Ds of all {{versions}} were built by Focke-Wulf, Erla, Fieseler, Arado and AGO. Messerschmitt {{is listed as}} having produced only four Bf 109Ds, probably the D-0 <b>preproduction</b> series with the serial production transferred to the licensed manufacturers. Several Bf 109Ds were sold to Hungary. Switzerland bought 10 109D-1s (Serial Numbers from 2301 until 2310) which had been built by the Arado-Flugzeugwerke GmbH factory located in Warnemünde.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} of the U-2, powered by a 74kW (99hp) Shvetsov M-11 air-cooled five-cylinder radial engine, first flew on 7 January 1928 piloted by M.M. Gromov. Aircraft from the <b>preproduction</b> series were tested {{at the end of}} 1928 and serial production started in 1929 in Factory number 23 in Leningrad. Production in the Soviet Union ended in 1953, but license-built CSS-13s were still produced in Poland until 1959.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Falcon 7X, at {{approximately}} $35 million (<b>preproduction</b> order price), was nearly $10 million cheaper than its nearest {{competitors in the}} long-range, large cabin market segment, including the Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier Global Express. It was targeted to be priced for 2004 at 12% more than the $33 million top-of-the-range Falcon 900EX equipped: $ million. Its 2005 price was $37 million, and $41 million in 2007. In 2008, the smaller Global Express 5000 was priced at $40M.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{announced}} Bell as {{the winner}} of a contract for 368 helicopters on 29 July 2005. There was some confusion as Bell figures placed the contract value at US$2.2 billion while Army estimates were over US$3 billion, compared to its earlier estimate of US$2.36 billion. The contract called {{for the development of}} prototypes and the delivery of <b>preproduction</b> aircraft to the Army for the Limited User Test (LUT), with the first unit equipped by the end of September 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} contract {{called for}} 11 YC-76 <b>preproduction</b> aircraft, {{and the first}} aircraft would be built and tested at Curtiss-Wright's St. Louis, Missouri Division plant. Subsequently, orders for five C-76 production aircraft and nine revised YC-76As were placed by the USAAF, with line production to commence at the Curtiss-Wright plant in Louisville {{as well as a}} Higgins Aircraft factory in New Orleans, Louisiana. To keep the plywood flexible during construction the factory was kept hot and damp. The prototype YC-76 first flew on May 1, 1943.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, the Danish {{military}} tested two <b>preproduction</b> rifles delivered from Norway, {{and were}} impressed enough to manufacture slightly modified 115 Krag–Peterssons in 1877 for troop trials. Despite the good results, the Danes {{decided not to}} adopt the Krag–Petersson. Krag did not receive any royalties on the production in Denmark, but was later made a knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, as thanks for his efforts both with the Danish Krag–Peterssons and for his efforts with the Krag–Jørgensen the Danes adopted in 1889.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, {{director}} Barry Levinson {{intended to}} direct a film based on Darin's life, and had begun <b>preproduction</b> on the project by early 1997. He abandoned the project, the rights to which were subsequently bought by actor Kevin Spacey, along with Darin's son, Dodd. The resultant biopic, Beyond the Sea, starred Spacey as Darin, with the actor using his own singing voice for the musical numbers. The film covers much of Darin's life and career, including his marriage to Sandra Dee, portrayed by Kate Bosworth.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} summer of 1943 it was clear the UBS was too great a {{challenge}} and could delay the entire program. At a 22 October meeting {{the decision was made}} to use a simplified bomb aiming system for the immediate future, with a radar operator calling information to the bombardier, who would use a simple mechanical calculator to time the drop. It was clear this was not satisfactory, but with no other option available in the short term, an order for 40 <b>preproduction</b> Eagle Mark I systems was placed for delivery in August 1944.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, {{prior to}} {{full-time}} production, Hughes provided five <b>preproduction</b> Model 269 examples to the U.S. Army for evaluation {{as a light}} observation helicopter to replace the aging OH-13 Sioux and OH-23 Raven. Designated as the YHO-2HU the helicopter was eventually turned down. 9 April 1959, the 269 received certification from the FAA and Hughes continued to concentrate on civil production. With some design changes, deliveries of the Model 269A version began in 1961. By mid-1963 about 20 aircraft were being produced a month and {{by the spring of}} 1964, 314 had been built.|$|E
25|$|A raft of new {{problems}} appeared as each part {{was prepared for}} production, {{and it was not}} until 1 May 1944 that Western Electric was finally satisfied that the design was ready to be manufactured. The company eventually settled on a dilapidated building on 42nd Street in New York City as the assembly site, and began ordering the 1813 separate parts from a host of manufacturers across the country. The first five sets were assembled at Bell Labs in July 1944, and another 33 were completed by August and the last of the 50 <b>preproduction</b> sets in September. The first production sets from the new plant arrived on 28 September, with 40 more in October, and another 142 in November.|$|E
25|$|The AI-20 was {{the first}} gas turbine engine {{developed}} by the design bureau led by Oleksandr Ivchenko based at Zaporizhia, USSR, which had previously concentrated on small piston engines such as the Ivchenko AI-14 and AI-26 radials. It {{was designed as a}} prospective powerplant for the new, large Ilyushin Il-18 airliner and the Antonov An-10, to be powered by four turboprops, in competition with the Kuznetsov NK-4 engines. Both engines were tested on the <b>preproduction</b> batch of 20 Il-18s, but the Ivchenko engine was chosen for full production, possibly due to a crash caused by an inflight failure of an NK-4 engine, and possibly due to the desire for the engines of the Ukrainian An-10 to also be built in Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|The game officially premiered on February 10, in a {{red carpet}} event held in Little Italy, with James Caan, Robert Duvall and Johnny Martino (who played Paulie Gatto in the film) in attendance. At the event, it was {{announced}} that a playable demo would not be available until the E3 event in May. David De Martini explained the game had already been in development for two years, including a full year of <b>preproduction</b> and research. He revealed the developers had worked closely with Mark Winegardner, author of The Godfather Returns, to ensure the storyline stayed within the canon of the narrative, and maintained the correct tone. De Martini also stated that as well as Rota's score, Bill Conti and Ashley Irwin had composed one-hundred minutes of new music for the game.|$|E
25|$|Filming {{which was}} {{initially}} scheduled for July commenced in August 2013, with the actors' first reading {{taking place on}} 5 August, after four months of <b>preproduction.</b> Shooting began at the old Railway Quarters in Lagos from where they proceeded to Ilara-Mokin, a small village in Ondo State; The director with some other crew members had previously been to Ilara-Mokin to scout for filming locations in May 2013. Scenes were also filmed at Federal College of Agriculture, Akure and few neighbouring villages around Akure. Toyota Nigeria provided transportation for the cast, crew and filming equipment {{throughout the course of}} filming. It also provided accommodation for the cast and crew while shooting in Ilara-Mokin, which is the hometown of the company's Chairman. The film was shot using RED cameras. Modern inventions captured during principal photography were all digitally removed during post-production.|$|E
