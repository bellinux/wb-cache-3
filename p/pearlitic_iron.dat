40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} and properties of {{grey cast iron}} castings are considerably influenced by the cooling rate during solidification. In order to obtain grey cast iron parts with a hard superficial layer (wear resistant), external metallic coolers are placed on those surfaces during casting. This {{is the case of}} cam pushers, camshafts, driving shafts, metalworking rolls, etc. Cast iron coolers or steel coolers are mostly used in practice.

40|$|First {{phase was}} to develop a {{laboratory}} technique for evaluating the machinability of gray and ductile iron; longer term goal is to learn how to modify the foundry process to produce castings meeting all specified mechanical properties while providing improved machining behavior. Microcarbides present in the irons were found to dominate the machinability of <b>iron.</b> <b>Pearlitic</b> <b>irons</b> with acceptable machinability contain 8. 9 to 10. 5 wt% microcarbides. The weight fraction microcarbides in the iron is influenced by carbide forming element concentrations, presence of elements that retard carbon diffusion, and cooling rate from the eutectic through the eutectoid temperature range. Tool wear rate increased at higher surface machining speeds and fraction microcarbides; all irons containing above 11. 5 % microcarbides had poor machinability. Graphite size, shape, distribution, etc. had a lesser effect on machinability.

The procedure developed to evaluate machinability involved drilling holes with a feed rate of 0. 009 in/rev at various surface speeds. High speed steel drills were used so wear was observed more quickly. Microcarbides present in the irons were found to dominate the machinability. <b>Pearlitic</b> <b>irons</b> considered to have ``acceptable`` machinability (indicated either by tool life measured in the laboratory using high speed steel (HSS) drills or reports from commercial machine shops using other cutters) were found to contain from 8. 9 to 10. 5 % by weight microscopic carbides. The tool wear rate increased when machining at higher surface speeds or machining irons containing higher weight percentage of microcarbides. All irons containing above 11. 5 % microcarbides consistently exhibited poor machinability. Tool wear results obtained using cubic boron nitride (CBN) cutters paralleled those obtained with HSS.

40|$|International audienceThe {{corrosion}} {{mechanisms by}} liquid aluminum of three industrial materials have been studied: unalloyed steel (UAS), and ferritic and modified <b>pearlitic</b> cast <b>irons</b> (FCI and PCI, respectively). The behavior {{of these materials}} when in contact with liquid aluminum is different. Aluminum diffuses deep into the UAS and forms intermetallic compounds with iron at the surface and in the steel matrix. At the surface, only Fe 2 Al 5 and FeAl 3 are found. In the matrix, FeAl 2 also is formed {{in agreement with the}} equilibrium Fe-Al diagram. From the matrix to FeAl 2, the Al content in the ferrite increases progressively until Al saturation is reached. At this step, black elongated precipitates (Al 4 C 3 and/or graphite) appear. Graphite lamellas present in both FCI and PCI constitute an efficient barrier to the Al diffusion. The high silicon content of the FCI leads to the formation of a phase free from Al and saturated in Si.

40|$|International audienceCopper, {{manganese}} {{and essentially}} tin {{are used as}} alloying elements for obtaining cast irons with a fully pearlitic matrix in the as-cast state. Addition of tin, {{at a level of}} about 0. 10 - 0. 15 mass%, seems to be the only practical way for avoiding growth of ferrite in the stable eutectoid reaction and to fully transform the matrix of the material to pearlite in the metastable eutectoid system. While the role of copper and manganese has been previously rationalized, the way tin affects the eutectoid transformation in cast irons is still a matter of debate. The present work makes use of an assessment of the Fe-Sn system and of experimental data in the Fe-C-Sn system to evaluate the effect of tin on phase equilibria in this latter system.

40|$|The {{amount and}} {{morphology}} of the graphite phase largely controls the resulting properties of cast iron. For instance, in flake graphite cast irons the mechanical properties are low while the thermal conductivity is high. This {{is in contrast}} with spheroidal graphite cast irons where the mechanical properties are high and the thermal conductivity is low. These differences are due to the different graphite morphologies and must be accounted for in the design work and material selection of cast iron components. In this work {{the influence of the}} graphite phase on the elastic and plastic deformation behaviour of cast irons has been studied. The material grades studied originate from castings for marine diesel engine piston rings with different chemical analyses. Two groups of <b>pearlitic</b> cast <b>iron</b> materials were studied; one with differences in graphite morphology and one with grey irons that differed in graphite content. For these different material grades the mechanical properties were correlated to microstructural parameters. In addition to standard uniaxial tensile tests, acoustic emission measurements were used for the study of deformation. When studying the modulus of elasticity of the cast iron {{it was found that the}} modulus of elasticity of the inherent graphite phase depends on the roundness of the graphite particles and is due to the strong anisotropy of the graphite phase. A linear correlation between nodularity and the modulus of elasticity of the graphite phase was derived. This correlation made it possible to account for the anisotropy of the graphite phase in the model used. By applying the linear function when modelling the effective modulus of elasticity, a high accuracy between experimental and theoretical values was achieved. Another factor affecting the elastic response when subjecting a cast iron component to tensile load was found to be the plastic deformation that actually occurs at very low strains for all of the studied cast iron grades. It was observed that the plastic deformation in the low strain elastic region, quantified by using acoustic emission measurements, increased linearly with decreasing modulus of elasticity. These measurements showed that the amount of plastic deformation in the elastic region was largely controlled by the graphite morphology. It was concluded that as the roundness of the graphite particles increases, the plastic deformation activity in the elastic region decreases. The plastic deformation activity continued linearly into the pronounced plastic region of the tensile tests. A decrease in roundness or increase in graphite fraction resulted in an increase of the amount of plastic deformation and the strain hardening exponent. A dependence between strength coefficient and graphite fraction was observed. Models for the flow curves for <b>pearlitic</b> cast <b>irons</b> were developed and shown to accurately reproduce the observed experimental curves.

This was achieved by shake-out at temperatures above the eutectoid transformation range followed by subsequent cooling in air, mould or in a furnace. The pearlite interlamellar spacing ranged from 90 to 330 nm for the matrices studied. Comparing the strength of the fine structured and coarse structured materials, the tensile and yield strength was reduced by almost 50 %. Regarding the elastic deformation, a weak increase in the tangent modulus with increasing alloying content was observed. It was also observed that lower cooling rate decreased the tangent modulus. The tangent modulus ranged between 70 and 110 GPa. Analysing the plastic deformation of the materials, in terms of strain hardening exponent, n, and strength coefficient, K, a strong dependence on the pearlite coarseness was observed. It was concluded that the effect of graphite particle length on tensile strength was negligible and the major improvement on the strength was due to refinement of the pearlite...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface of}} <b>pearlitic</b> grey cast <b>iron</b> was treated using a 2 kW Nd:YAG laser beam {{with the final}} aim to improve its surface properties, mainly for {{automotive}} applications. Two kinds of laser surface treatments were experimentally applied. In the laser surface hardening approach the surface of cast iron was hardened simply by passing a laser beam at travel speeds 1 - 50 mm/s keeping the surface temperature constant in the irradiated area. Detailed structural analysis of the layer modified by the laser treatment was performed by optical and scanning electron microscopy, EDS and orientation imaging microscopy with the electron back scattered diffraction and microhardness profiles were measured. Conclusions concerning the mechanism and kinetics of pearlite-austenite transformation during the laser surface hardening were drawn. The size of the transformed zone was calculated using a three dimensional model for a Gaussian beam distribution in accordance with direct observations of laser beam energy densities. In the laser surface cladding experiments a thick Co-based alloy coating was created on the cast iron surface using so-called side-cladding set-up when the powder of additional material is locally molten together {{with a small amount}} of substrate and then rapidly solidified creating a coating with the metallurgical bond to the substrate. A gradual change of a single processing parameter was used for an appropriate experimental analysis and statistical correlation study between main processing parameters and geometrical characteristics of an individual laser track...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Prepared bimetallic layered castings consist two fundamental parts i. e. bearing part and working part (layer). The bearing part of bimetallic layered casting is typical foundry material i. e. <b>pearlitic</b> grey cast <b>iron,</b> whereas working part (layer) is depending on accepted variant plates of alloy steels sort X 6 Cr 13, X 12 Cr 13, X 10 CrNi 18 - 8 and X 2 CrNiMoN 22 - 5 - 3. The ratio of thickness between bearing and working part is 8 : 1. The verification of the bimetallic layered castings was evaluated {{on the basis}} of ultrasonic NDT (non-destructive testing), structure and macro- and microhardness researches. Moreover was made computer simulation of solidification of bimetallic layered casting in NovaFlow&Solid software. Findings: The results of studies and their analysis show efficiency of new, innovative technology of corrosion and heat resisting layered castings. Research limitations: In further research, authors of this paper are going to application of different material on bearing part of bimetallic layered casting. Practical implications: Prepared bimetallic layered castings according to work out technology can work in conditions, which require from working surface layer of element a high heat resistance and/or corrosion resistance in medium for example of industrial water.
