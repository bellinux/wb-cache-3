40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{summarize}} the legal framework relating to the legal responsibility of Information Service Providers (ISP). This field is regulated by the Directive 2000 / 31 /EC ('Directive on electronic commerce') and the Czech Act No. 480 / 2004 Coll., on certain information society services. The secondary purpose of this thesis is to compare these two legal frameworks, consider the differences between them and identify their consequences. The legal definition of ISP is fully analyzed in this thesis however this basically means any provider of information society service, i. e service provided at a distance, by electronic means, at the individual request of a recipient of services and normally <b>provided</b> <b>for</b> <b>remuneration.</b> The thesis is composed of four chapters dealing with different issues. The first chapter is the short introduction into legal responsibility as a legal instrument. The main attention {{is given to the}} article 420 of the Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll. (Civil Code) and the changes which will be brought by the Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., i. e. the "new" Civil Code effective from 1. 1. 2014. The second chapter deals with the first rulings concerning the ISP liability abroad (Godfrey v. Demon Internet, LICRA v. Yahoo, A&M Records v. Napster).

30|$|The Renewable Energies Act (EEG) is {{the central}} {{instrument}} {{for the development of}} renewable electricity production in Germany. It regulates the remuneration by sector; that is, the power produced by renewable energies will be rewarded according fixed feed-in rates. For offshore wind farms going into operation before 2020, the EEG 2014 currently <b>provides</b> <b>for</b> two different <b>remuneration</b> models (Foundation Offshore-Windenergie 2014). Roughly speaking, the first model allows the operator to claim 15.4 Cent/kWh over an initial period of at least 12 years. The second so-called optional acceleration model plans <b>for</b> <b>remuneration</b> of 19.4 Cent/kWh for an initial period of 8 years. After the initial period has passed remuneration in both models decreases to 3.9 Cent/kWh. Further regulations depending on the water depth at the site and its distance from the coast may further modify these figures.|$|R
50|$|Deposit {{bonds are}} an assurance, {{which is a}} type of {{financial}} coverage that <b>provides</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>for</b> an event that is certain to happen. Assurance is similar to insurance, with the two terms often mistakenly used interchangeably. However, insurance specifically protects policyholders from events that might happen and provides remuneration to them if and when those adverse events happen. An assurance policy covers an event that definitely will happen, while the insurance policy covers an event that might occur.|$|R

Further analysis suggests that remuneration committee independence and diligence enhance the quality of remuneration committees.

50|$|New President John Quincy Adams did not {{consider}} the treaty to be valid, and pressured Troup to stop white incursions into Indian lands. Creek leaders were summoned to Washington, D.C. to negotiate a peaceful agreement. A new treaty was negotiated {{between the government and}} a widespread gathering of various Creek leaders, unified under their spokesman, Opothleyahola. It voided the Treaty of Indian Springs and ceded to the United States all the land belonging to the Creeks {{on the east side of}} the Chattahoochee River for a one-time payment of $217,600 and a yearly annuity of $20,000. The treaty stipulated that the signers of the Treaty of Indian Springs would have the same privileges as those who signed the new treaty, and made funding allowances for the Lower Creeks under the late William McIntosh to send a 5-person deputation to explore lands west of the Mississippi River for potential resettlement. The government would then fund the relocation, as well as <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> a full year's subsistence, a full-time Federal Indian Agent, interpreter, blacksmith and wheelwright. The treaty <b>provided</b> financial <b>remuneration</b> <b>for</b> the damages caused by the infighting between McIntosh's Lower Creeks and the rest of the Creek Nation. The Creeks legally retained possession of all their lands until January 1, 1827, after which they would retain a small portion on the Alabama-Georgia border.|$|R
