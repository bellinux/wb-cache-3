40|$|In this work, {{we showed}} that in a {{delivery}} scheduling problem where replenishment activities can be staggered, minimizing the <b>peak</b> <b>inventory</b> storage requirement is equivalent to maximizing the minimum safety inventory (i. e. lowest inventory level), {{under the assumption that}} the items are consumed at constant rates. We have also used this observation to derive several results for the classical inventory staggering problem. The delivery scheduling problem is motivated by the first author’s earlier consulting work un-dertaken together with Dr Leong Thin Yin (currently with the Singapore Management University). The consulting work focused on building a multivendor kanban-type inventory system to handle the stochastic demands of the items in the system, assuming a fixed delivery schedule.

40|$|This Licentiate thesis {{addresses}} {{the topics of}} Joint Replenishment and Multi-Echelon Inventory Systems. Both are important parts in the concepts and current trends in Supply Chain Management and Logistics. The objective of Supply Chain Management is to manage {{the flow of information}} and goods from the supplier to the final customer with respect to high customer value and low costs. A common inventory and coordination problem is the so called Joint Replenishment Problem. The problem often occurs when several items are replenished at a single stocking point. This can happen in many different situations, e. g. when several items are procured from the same supplier or when a product after manufacturing, is packaged in different quantities. Cost savings can be obtained by coordinating the replenishments, compared to when items are replenished independently. Coordination of several levels in a supply chain, often referred to as multi-echelon inventory control, is another important part of Supply Chain Management. A frequently encountered problem in practice is the One-warehouse N-retailer problem, which can found in divergent distribution systems where a central warehouse supplies several retailers with goods. The thesis contains an introductory part and three research papers. The first two papers deal with the Joint Replenishment Problem and the second with the One-warehouse N-retailer problem. Paper I provides a novel heuristic method to solve joint replenishment problems using a spread-sheet technique. The principle of the recursion procedure is to find a balance between the replenishment and inventory holding costs for the different items by adjusting the replenishment frequencies. Paper II is an extension of the area and presents a new method that may help reduce <b>peak</b> <b>inventory</b> levels and arrival quantities in joint replenishment problems. The replenishments are re-scheduled during the cycle periods and if necessary individual replenishments are delayed single time periods. Paper III deals with the problem of prioritizing retailers when {{there is a shortage of}} supply at a warehouse. All customers are often not equally important and a warehouse that suffers from stock-outs may therefore want to give higher priority to some retailers when new goods are ready for delivery. The paper presents an approximation of the inventory holding and shortage cost when retailers are prioritized according to two groups, high and low priority retailers.

40|$|Thousands of {{different}} chemicals {{are used in}} our daily life for household, industry, agriculture and medical purpose, {{and many of them}} are discharged into water bodies by direct or indirect ways. Thus, monitoring and identification of organic pollutants in aquatic ecosystem is one of the most essential concerns with respects to human health and aquatic life. Althrough liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) has made huge advancements in recent years, allowing non-target screening without initial information and reference stardards, the detection and identification of unknown compoundsfrom the large datasets generated is still challenging. To overcome this, various software-based approaches have been developed, particulalry by the metabolomics community, covering one or more steps such as peak detection and alignment, or fragmentation and retention prediction. However, an evaluation and optimization of these approaches for the nontarget screening of environmental samples is largely lacking. Thus, the main objective of this PhD thesis is evaluation and optimization of the performance of two important steps in the nontarget screening workflow to improve their application for environmental pollutants, and to demonstrate its use the prioritisation of catchment-specific organic micropollutants in rivers. In general, nontarget screening workflows start from detection of peaks and extracted their information (m/z, retention times, and intensities) as peak lists from raw data files by the peak picking software which plays an important role in deconvolution and detection of chromatographic peaks from huge LC–HRMS dataset. In order to maximum the quality and number of detected peaks the performance of one of the widely used data processing software MZmine 2 was assessed and optimized for data acquired on a LTQ Orbitrap (Chapter 2). To this end, a design of experiments (DoE) approach was used. The results show that full scan acquisition is recommended for data acquisition in nontarget screening since short cycle time (CT) significantly improves the performance of automatic peak detection. Compared to manual peak detection, MZmine 2 with the optimized parameter settings detected 75 - 100 % of compounds at an intensity level of 105 on both spiked and real surface water samples. In the end, an optimization workflow for MZmine 2 is provided and which can be easily applied on other LC-HRMS instruments data. While the determination of the molecular formula of an unknown peak based on accurate masses and isotope peaks is often straightforward, it is challenging to find the most likely structure for the obtained molecular formula among hundreds or thousands of possible candidates retrieved from a database search. Different software-based predictions are helpful to prioritise candidates with the most likely structure, however, their performance has rarely been evaluated. Hence, in Chapter 3, a dataset of 78 diverse known micropollutants analyzed both in ESI+ and ESI- mode was used to assess two different MS/MS fragmentation and two retention prediction approaches. For MS/MS analysis, different fragmentation technologies and energies were applied for fragmentation prediction and the rank positions the “correct” candidates were compared. Additionally, application domains of two retention prediction models were investigated according to the relatively rank of the “correct” structure and prediction accuracy of the models. To combine scores from multiple candidate selection tools, consensus score values with optimal weights were calculated to show the contribution of each approach and whether the combination could improve candidate selection. It seems unlikely that a complete identification of all peaks in sample will be ever feasible, thus identification efforts have to focus on a limited number of peaks of interest, calling for a thorough prioritization. In Chapter 4, a recently proposed approach to prioritise peaks and identify compounds solely from HRMS data was used on a set of river water samples. Frequency Scores were calculated as a combined measure for the intensity and frequency of occurrence of a peak and peak attribute information (isotopes, adducts, and homologue series) was generated automatically obtained from peak lists using the R nontarget package. Water sample extracts from 19 sites distributed over four European catchments (Saale, Danube, Sava and Emme) were analyzed using a LTQ Orbitrap instrument and the data analyzed using the outlined approach. Results show that both ubiquitous peaks in all catchment and specific peaks in each catchment occur among the top peaks ranked by Frequency Scores. About 10 to 50 % of the top ranked peaks were assigned to homologue series, indicating the huge contribution of surfactants and their transformation products to the <b>peak</b> <b>inventory.</b> A number of unknown compounds could be (tentatively) identified, including several high production volume industrial chemicals and surfactants...|$|E

The LOS analysis procedure followed in India is that developed by HCM 2000.

For developing countries like India where the traffic flow is highly heterogeneous, LOS should be defined correctly {{taking into account the}} traffic and geometric characteristics. In this study an attempt has been made to define the LOS criteria of urban streets.

40|$|For many {{products}} such as cars, electronic appliances and furniture, the price that a customer pays is negotiated from the posted price. In such transactions, negotiation {{plays an important role}} in determining whether a customer purchases, and if so, at what price. A retailer may adopt negotiation because negotiation allows retailers to price discriminate among customers with heterogeneous willingness-to-pay. However, negotiating the price with customers often comes at a cost, which offsets the benefit generated from price discrimination. We have seen many retailers actively choose between posted pricing and negotiation. Hence, this dissertation visits two problem domains in operations management, assuming that a retailer can make an active choice about sales formats. We first consider a retailer's revenue management problem in the presence of inventory considerations, assuming that the retailer can negotiate. Second, we consider a capacity-constrained manufacturer's wholesale pricing problem, assuming that the retailer is free to choose sales formats. The first problem considers a stochastic dynamic programming formulation embedded by a negotiation model, which produces a number of interesting analytical and numerical results. As one would expect, the optimal posted price of a negotiating retailer includes a premium on top of the price that a retailer would choose in the take-it-or-leave-it pricing. This price premium helps the retailer extract more revenues from high willingness-to-pay customers, and <b>peaks</b> at moderate <b>inventory</b> levels. In addition, the results show that negotiation acts as a substitute or complement to dynamic pricing. The second problem considers a supply chain has limited capacity and the retailer chooses either posting pricing or negotiation, when selling to customers who are heterogeneous in their willingness-to-pay. We find that the supply chain may lie in one of the three different types of equilibria. Two of these three are cases where the supply chain ends up doing as if the sales format were exogenously determined. The third equilibrium type, however, arises when the manufacturer wants to enforce negotiation, but cannot induce the retailer to do so without sacrificing some of its profit margin. This is an equilibrium where the retailer benefits from its discretion over the sales format...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{containerization}} and its continuous development involves changes and technological innovations in containerships and maritime container terminals. In the current era of "gigantism", despite existing fleet overcapacity, shipping companies are booking larger and fuel-efficient vessels {{to benefit from}} economies of scale and to reduce operating costs. Consequently, port terminals {{have to cope with}} unprecedented container volumes and increasing demands, as a result, handling operations are likely to be subject to delay. In this context, container terminals are dealing with the huge challenge of readjusting themselves in order to, on one hand, improve productivity and level of service offered to the customers (minimize turnaround time) and, on the other hand, to manage terminal handling operations efficiently with the aim of reducing operating costs and becoming more competitive. Moreover, considering that adapting facilities and terminal infrastructures involves large investment and given the lack of space in many urban ports for expanding the operational area, the improvement of handling operations efficiency is more important than ever. Thus, many efforts are required to improve the productivity of container terminals by introducing efficient solutions and optimization techniques to decision-making processes and, on the other side, introducing technological improvements such as the automation of handling equipment. In light of this, this thesis is focused on the optimization of handling operations in the storage yard, which is considered to be the most complex terminal subsystem since terminal performance depends on its efficiency. In particular, it attempts to: (1) determine optimal storage space utilization by considering the yard inventory and congestion effects on terminal performance; (2) introduce new allocating storage strategies with the aim of minimizing the amount of rehandling moves, which are considered {{to be the most important}} cause of inefficiency in container yard terminals, and; (3) develop a generic storage pricing schedule to encourage customers to pick up their containers promptly and, as a consequence, reduce the average duration of stay, avoiding yard congestion. In order to tackle these issues, two different analytical models are introduced in this thesis. The first one aims to forecast storage yard inventory by dealing explicitly with stochastic behavior, yard <b>inventory</b> <b>peaks</b> and seasonal fluctuations. The second one, which is based on probabilistic and statistical functions, is derived to estimate the average number of rehandles when containers with different departure probabilities are mixed in the same stack. Finally, the numerical experiments presented in this thesis prove the usefulness of the different analytical models, yard design methods, cost models and operative and tactical strategies developed herein. These can be applied by other researchers, planners and terminal operators to optimize the yard handling processes, to improve their efficiency rates and to increase terminal throughput without incurring large investment. By being technically efficient, the terminal will be more cost-efficient as well, resulting in the overall optimization of terminal performance. Postprint (published version...|$|R

Speed ranges of LOS categories for various urban street classes defined by HCM are appropriate for developed countries having homogenous type of traffic flow. India being a developing country its traffic is very much heterogeneous having vehicles of different operational characteristics. So LOS criteria in Indian context should be defined correctly considering the traffic and geometric characteristics of urban streets. Defining LOS is very important as {{this is the first}} step of LOS analysis. LOS analysis is necessitated as this affects planning, design, operational aspects of transportation projects and also allocating resources to the competing projects. Defining LOS is basically a classification problem and application of cluster analysis is found to be a suitable technique to solve the problem. Advanced clustering techniques like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Affinity Propagation (AP), Genetic Algorithm-Fuzzy(GA-Fuzzy), Partition around Medoid (PAM) can be used to solve the classification problems. Before applying these algorithms for clustering purpose various cluster validation parameters are used to determine the optimal number of cluster for the input data set. This cluster validation parameter holds significance as this decides the numbers of urban street class the free flow speed (FFS) data should be clustered into. After deciding the number of urban street class, the above four algorithms are used in this research in two steps. First, the free flow speed data were clustered to determine the urban street class of each segment. After determination of the urban street class of each segment average travel speed in peak and off peak hour is used in clustering methods to determine the speed ranges of LOS categories. For this study lot of speed data is required for which GPS is found to be the most suitable method of data collection and hence extensively used. Free flow speed and average travel speed during peak and of <b>peak</b> hours and <b>inventory</b> details of road segments are used in this study. All these data are collected from secondary source for this research work. The FFS speed ranges of different urban street class and travel speed ranges of different LOS categories found from different algorithms are found to be different. So to decide the best clustering algorithm for this study four cluster quality evaluation parameters are used. The best clustering algorithm for this study is decided and the FFS and travel speed ranges resulted from this algorithm is suggested for Indian context. These FFS and travel speed ranges are found to be significantly lower than that mentioned in HCM- 2000. Heterogeneous traffic flow and roads having varying geometric and surrounding environmental characteristics are the major reasons for these lower values in FFSs. Presence pedestrians, slow moving vehicles, roadside vendors and on-street parking creates side friction that reduces the travel speed of a commuter. From the clustering analysis of FFS data it can be seen less number of roads in Mumbai are of high speed design (street class-I) or highly congested (street class-IV). More number of road segments is of suburban (street class II) or intermediate (street class III) type. It can be suggested that Greater Mumbai region needs substantial geometric improvements to mitigate the demand of exponentially growing traffic...|$|R
