5|$|This {{problem was}} first {{addressed}} by C.R. Illingworth in 1950. In incompressible flow, the velocity <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> linear because the fluid temperature is constant. When {{the upper and}} lower walls are maintained at different temperatures, the velocity <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> complicated, but it turns out it has an exact implicit solution.|$|E
5|$|A {{saturation}} <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> {{one which}} all the tissues considered by the decompression model have become saturated with inert gas from the breathing mixture. Most decompression models will take this to be at six tissue half-times for the slowest tissue considered. Further bottom time at the same depth will not affect the inert gas loading of any tissue and will not affect the decompression required.|$|E
5|$|The band-pass of {{an atomic}} line filter is usually {{equal to the}} Doppler profile of the vapor cell, the natural range of {{frequencies}} at which a vapor cell will be excited by a pure light source. The Doppler <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> {{the width of the}} spectrum of Doppler shifted radiation emitted by the vapor cell due to its thermal motion. This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system considered more ideal.|$|E
50|$|Forensic <b>profiling</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} {{conducted using}} datamining technology, {{as a means}} by which relevant patterns <b>are</b> discovered, and <b>profiles</b> <b>are</b> generated from large quantities of data.|$|R

5|$|The dive <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> often {{recorded}} {{in some way}} {{as part of a}} permanent record of the dive. Maximum depth, bottom time and any decompression required are routinely logged by most professional divers, for whom it may be a legal requirement, and by many recreational divers, for whom it is usually a recommendation of the training agencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} dive <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> {{useful as}} a planning tool {{as an indication of}} the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity for the exposure, and also for estimating the volume of open-circuit breathing gas needed for a planned dive, as these depend in part upon the depth and duration of the dive. A dive profile diagram is conventionally drawn with elapsed time running from left to right and depth increasing down the page.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting has a {{very similar}} profile to {{other members of the}} genus Sillago, with a {{slightly}} compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of feeble spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single feeble spine, while the ventral <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> straight. The species is known to grow to a maximum size of 51cm and around 1.25kg weight.|$|E
50|$|Examples of G.hn devices {{based on}} high {{complexity}} <b>profiles</b> <b>are</b> Residential Gateways or Set-Top Boxes. Examples of G.hn devices based on low complexity <b>profiles</b> <b>are</b> home automation, home security and Smart Grid devices.|$|R
30|$|Each MySpace <b>profile</b> <b>was</b> viewed {{one time}} by the lead investigator. <b>Profiles</b> <b>were</b> not archived, printed nor saved. A 10 % random {{sub-sample}} of <b>profiles</b> <b>was</b> coded by an additional investigator within several hours of the initial coding {{in order to assess}} inter-rater reliability. This was analyzed using the Cohen’s Kappa statistic and the degree of agreement between the two investigators for the variable of sexual references was 0.87.|$|R
5000|$|Geographic <b>profiling</b> <b>is</b> a {{sub-type of}} {{offender}} or criminal profiling (the inference of offender characteristics from offence characteristics). It is therefore related to psychological or behavioral profiling. If psychological <b>profiling</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "who," [...] geographic <b>profiling</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "where." [...] All certified geographic profilers {{are members of}} the International Criminal Investigative Analysis Fellowship (ICIAF), a professional profiling organization first begun by investigators trained by the FBI in the mid-1980s.|$|R
5|$|This type of <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> {{common for}} dives at sites {{where there is}} a flat sea-bed or where the diver remains at the same place {{throughout}} the dive to work. It is the most demanding profile for decompression for a given maximum depth and time because inert gas absorption continues at maximum rate for most of the dive. Decompression tables are drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a square profile.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|Christianity is {{the largest}} {{religion}} within Birmingham, with 46.1% of residents identifying as Christians in the 2011 Census. The city's religious <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> highly diverse, however: outside London, Birmingham has the United Kingdom's largest Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist communities; its second largest Hindu community; and its seventh largest Jewish community. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the proportion of Christians in Birmingham decreased from 59.1% to 46.1%, while the proportion of Muslims increased from 14.3% to 21.8% {{and the proportion of}} people with no religious affiliation increased from 12.4% to 19.3%. All other religions remained proportionately similar.|$|E

30|$|Whilst XML <b>profiles</b> <b>are</b> {{suitable}} for machine processing, they are difficult for human users to edit. Since {{the costs and}} specifications of cloud providers are subject to constant change, it was essential that the <b>profile</b> could <b>be</b> easily edited by an administrator.

5|$|With dive tables, it is {{generally}} assumed that the dive <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> a square dive, meaning that the diver descends to maximum depth immediately and stays at the same depth until resurfacing (approximating a rectangular outline when drawn in a coordinate system where one axis is depth {{and the other is}} duration). Some dive tables also assume physical condition or acceptance of a specific level of risk from the diver. Some recreational tables only provide for no-stop dives at sea level sites, but the more complete tables can take into account staged decompression dives and dives performed at altitude.|$|E
25|$|The Foundation <b>Profile</b> <b>is</b> a Java ME Connected Device Configuration (CDC) profile. This <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} {{to be used by}} devices requiring a complete implementation of the Java virtual machine up to and including the entire Java Platform, Standard Edition API. Typical implementations will use some subset of that API set depending on the additional profiles supported. This specification was developed under the Java Community Process.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the number}} of {{supported}} <b>profiles</b> <b>is</b> quite large, the <b>Profiles</b> specification (SAMLProf) <b>is</b> simplified since the binding aspects of each <b>profile</b> have <b>been</b> factored out into a separate Bindings specification (SAMLBind).|$|R
30|$|Each <b>profile</b> <b>was</b> {{evaluated}} {{for the presence}} (“Displayer”) or absence (“Non-Displayer) of displayed references to sexual behavior.

3000|$|Space (Heap) <b>Profiling</b> <b>was</b> used to {{investigate}} whether any cost centre of the application may consume too much memory because of excessive laziness (also called “space leak”). Time <b>profiling</b> <b>was</b> used to identify functions that are possible CPU hogs.|$|R
25|$|The flow <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> {{produced}} from the chamber geometry, flow rate, and particular turbulence model selected. The radiation <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> developed from inputs {{such as water}} quality, lamp type (power, germicidal efficiency, spectral output, arc length), and the transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve. Proprietary CFD software simulates both the flow and radiation profiles. Once the 3D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that comprises thousands of small cubes.|$|E

25|$|Virtual {{profiling}} is {{a method}} of creating profiles without attaching the thermocouples (TCs) or having to physically instrument a PCB each and every time a <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> run for the same production board. All the typical profile data such as slope, soak, TAL, etc., that are measured by instrumented profiles are gathered by using virtual profiles. The benefits of not having attached TCs surpass the convenience of not having to instrument a PCB every time a new <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> needed.|$|E

25|$|In graded-index fiber, {{the index}} of {{refraction}} in the core decreases continuously between the axis and the cladding. This causes light rays to bend smoothly as they approach the cladding, rather than reflecting abruptly from the core-cladding boundary. The resulting curved paths reduce multi-path dispersion because high angle rays pass more through the lower-index periphery of the core, rather than the high-index center. The index <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> chosen to minimize the difference in axial propagation speeds of the various rays in the fiber. This ideal index <b>profile</b> <b>is</b> very close to a parabolic relationship between the index and {{the distance from the}} axis.|$|E

Further, the microstructure of the cast iron, which crystallized out inside the cellulose <b>profile,</b> <b>was</b> analysed and the cellulose, thermally degraded after the experiment, was verified with the use of the chemical analysis method. Moreover, a quality analysis of the original as well as the degraded cellulose <b>profile</b> <b>was</b> run with the use of the FTIR infrared spectroscopy. The presented results revealed that the cellulose blend is aluminium silicate enriched and contains organic binder additives. The cast iron, which crystallized out, tended to have an equilibrium pearlitic structure with the release of graphite and carbides. The generation of disequilibrium ausferrite phases was also observed in the structure...|$|R
