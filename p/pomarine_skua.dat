50|$|Genetic {{studies have}} found {{surprising}} similarities between the great skua and the <b>pomarine</b> <b>skua,</b> despite their dissimilar appearance. Many ornithologists now believe either that the great skua originated as a hybrid between the <b>pomarine</b> <b>skua</b> {{and one of the}} southern-hemisphere species, presumably as a result of vagrancy or migration across the equator by the southern species, or that the <b>pomarine</b> <b>skua</b> evolved from hybridization of the great skua and one of the small Arctic species (see pomarine jaeger for details).|$|E
50|$|The pomarine jaeger (Stercorarius pomarinus), <b>pomarine</b> <b>skua,</b> or pomatorhine skua, is a seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae. It is a migrant, {{wintering}} at sea in {{the tropical}} oceans.|$|E
50|$|Local and scarce bird {{records for}} the area include: black-throated diver, red-necked grebe, sooty shearwater, Balearic shearwater, Leach's storm-petrel, spoonbill, pink-footed goose, garganey, European honey buzzard, red grouse, dotterel, wood sandpiper, grey phalarope, <b>pomarine</b> <b>skua,</b> long-tailed skua, Sabine’s gull, ring-billed gull, yellow-legged gull, Iceland gull, roseate tern, black guillemot, little auk, long-eared owl, hoopoe, wryneck, waxwing, yellow-browed warbler, golden oriole, great grey shrike, twite and snow bunting.|$|E
50|$|This bird {{feeds on}} fish, carrion, scraps, smaller birds {{up to the}} size of common gull and rodents, {{especially}} lemmings. It robs gulls, terns and even gannets of their catches. Like most other skua species, it continues this piratical behaviour throughout the year, showing great agility as it harasses its victims. Only the white-tailed eagle and the golden eagle are known to take adult, healthy <b>pomarine</b> <b>skuas.</b>|$|R
40|$|Land-based {{counts of}} {{migrating}} seabirds remain essential to increase knowledge about their numbers and movements. To assess {{the value of}} Cabo Carvoeiro (Peniche, Portugal) as a monitoring site in the East Atlantic, we studied seabird species composition, passage patterns and flock size during mid-October 2014. During standardized counts, we observed nearly 8 000 seabirds of 17 species. The ratio of individuals passing in a southerly to southwesterly direction was > 96 % in all species, showing that genuine migrants were counted. The passage rate (birds/hour) was higher for Northern Gannets Morus bassanus than for any other species, {{by a factor of}} approximately 50 (morning mean 906 /h, afternoon mean 1 153 /h). The globally endangered Balearic Shearwaters Puffinus mauretanicus, Great Skuas Stercorarius <b>skua</b> and <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Skuas</b> S. pomarinus had passage rates of 10 – 25 /h. Flock size distribution in the 11 most numerous species showed that most migrated singly or in groups of two. Flock size was larger in Balearic Shearwaters than in both Cory’s Calonectris borealis and Manx Shearwaters P. puffinus. Among skuas, flock size was larger in Pomarine than in Great Skuas. The passage rate of Manx Shearwaters was positively correlated with that of Northern Gannets, Great Skuas and Sandwich Terns Sterna sandvicensis. Northern Gannets showed a positive co-variation with <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Skuas.</b> Balearic and Sooty Shearwaters Ardenna griseus were the only species that did not show any significant co-variation with another species. Morning and afternoon passage rates did not differ significantly in any of the six most numerous species (Northern Gannets, Cory’s and Balearic Shearwaters, Great and <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Skuas,</b> and Sandwich Terns), or in Sooty Shearwaters (less numerous). Thus, the passage rates at Cabo Carvoeiro in October of Balearic Shearwaters and five other species were as high or higher than those reported from any other seawatch in Portugal, indicating the international value of seabird monitoring at Cabo Carvoeiro during the autumn migration...|$|R
50|$|DNA-DNA {{hybridization}} {{results have}} however sometimes led to misleading conclusions about species, {{as with the}} <b>pomarine</b> and great <b>skua.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hybrid {{speciation}} {{in animals}} is primarily homoploid. While not very common, a few animal {{species have been}} recognized as being the result of hybridization, mostly insects and fish. The Lonicera fly {{is an example of}} a novel animal species that resulted from natural hybridization. The great skua has a surprising genetic similarity to the physically dissimilar pomarine skua; most ornithologists now assume the great skua is a hybrid species between the <b>pomarine</b> <b>skua</b> and one of the northern skua species.|$|E
50|$|Gedser Odde {{is a good}} {{site for}} observing migratory birds, {{especially}} on windy days. Common eiders {{can be seen in}} large numbers around the point in the spring (from the end of March to the beginning of April) and autumn. It is not uncommon for as many as 40,000 per day to fly past. The common scoter is viewable throughout the year in flocks of as many as 3,000. In the autumn, migratory geese can be seen in their thousands. Other species crossing the area include the red-throated loon, <b>pomarine</b> <b>skua,</b> the long-tailed jaeger, and great skua. Gedser Odde is probably the area with the most little gulls in both the spring and the autumn with up to a thousand per day.|$|E
50|$|In its history, many {{rare and}} scarce {{migrating}} birds {{have turned up}} {{on the north side}} of the lake. The island that has 3 resident goats to graze the vegetation, is primarily for bird life. Many common bird species breed on the spit that can be viewed from the only hide on the lake, the north hide. Here are some of the most notable visitors to the lake: Red-throated Diver (1986), Great Northern Diver (1994), Fulmar (2001) Great Shearwater (1999), Leach's Petrol (1987), Gannet (2002), Night Heron (1987), Glossy Ibis (1987), Spoonbill (1995), Pink footed Goose (1992), White-Fronted Goose (1992), Green-Winged Teal (1994), Ring-Necked Duck (1996), Long-Tailed Duck (1981), Velvet Scoter (2006), Spotted Crake (1995), Avocet (2011), Kentish Plover (1981), Temmick's Stint (2004), Pectoral Sandpiper (1995), Purple Sandpiper (1977), Red-Necked Phalarope (1995), Grey Phalarope (1987), Wilson's Phalarope (2007), <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Skua</b> (1982), Great Skua (1987), Sabine's Gull (1981), Caspian Tern (2001), Roseate Tern (1994), Whiskered Tern (2001), Cetti's Warbler (2011), Great Reed Warbler (2008), Golden Oriole (1997), Lapland Bunting (1966), Snow Bunting (1997), and a pair of Black-winged Stilt staying the summer of 1988.|$|E
50|$|Distinguishing this skua {{from the}} {{northern}} hemisphere Arctic, <b>pomarine</b> and long-tailed <b>skuas</b> is relatively straightforward. The large size, massive barrel chest, and white wing flashes of this bird are distinctive even at a distance. The flight is direct and powerful. Identification of this skua is more complicated when {{it is necessary to}} distinguish it from the closely related great skua of the North Atlantic, and the other large southern hemisphere skuas. Identification problems make claims of any southern hemisphere skua in the eastern North Atlantic problematic, and few records of south polar skua have been accepted in Western Europe. Similar problems occur, of course, with extra-limital claims of great skua.|$|R
40|$|Plate 252. I was {{surprised}} to see a <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Skua</b> flying west along Loch Ness in the Great Glen, Highland, on 20 May 2007; it did not stop and later on 23 & 24 May I saw several, together with Arctic Skuas, further west around the salmon cages at Ardgour in Loch Linnhe. I had no such sightings on a trip at the same time of year in 2009, and noted that the cages were then so covered in netting they were inaccessible to skuas and gulls. On 24 May 2011, after exceptionally stormy weather with severe south-westerly gales the previous day, the <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Skua</b> shown here appeared from the east and followed the barge westwards {{for a couple of hours}} along Loch Lochy, another of the chain of lochs which form part of the Caledonian Canal along the Great Glen. It frequently circled and occasionally landed and rested on the barge before continuing westwards. It is well known that in late summer and autumn, skuas pass Chanonry Point on the Black Isle and continue westwards presumably down the Great Glen, but a spring passage in this direction seems less usual. I assume that most or all the skuas seen at Ardgour in 2007 had also flown down the Glen rather than turned eastwards a considerable distance from their more usual spring passage north up the west coast. A small passage of skuas along the Glen itself would be difficult to observe from the shore, so could easily be overlooked, especially in spring when few birds are likely to take this route...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{sources of}} {{evidence}} {{show that the}} skuas (Aves: Stercorariidae) are a monophyletic group, closely related to gulls (Laridae). On morphological and behavioural evidence the Stercorariidae are divided into two widely divergent genera, Catharacta and Stercorarius, consistent with observed levels of nuclear and mitochondrial gene divergence. Catharacta skuas are large-bodied and with one exception breed in the Southern Hemisphere. Stercorarius skuas (otherwise known as jaegers) are smaller bodied and breed exclusively in the Northern Hemisphere. Evidence from both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes and from ectoparasitic lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) shows that the <b>Pomarine</b> <b>skua,</b> S. pomarinus, which has been recognized as being somewhat intermediate in certain morphological and behavioural characteristics, is much {{more closely related to}} species in the genus Catharacta, especially to the Northern Hemisphere-breeding Great skua, C. skua, than it is to the other two Stercorarius skuas, the Arctic skua, S. parasiticus an...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of scavenger seabirds at fishing trawlers was studied off Galicia, Spain. A total of 9, 368 seabirds of 23 species were recorded during 92 fishing operations in 1998 and 1999. The most common species were the yellow-legged and {{lesser black-backed gull}} (Larus cachinnans and L. fuscus), Sabine´s gull (L. sabini), the northern gannet (Morus bassanus), the great shearwater (Puffinus gravis), sooty shearwater (P. griseus), the Manx and Balearic shearwater (P. puffinus and P. mauretanicus), the great skua (Catharacta skua) and terns (mainly Sterna hirundo and S. paradisaea). Other species occurred in small numbers: Leach´s petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa), the storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus), the little shearwater (Puffinus assimilis), Cory´s shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), the parasitic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus), the <b>pomarine</b> <b>skua</b> (S. pomarinus), the black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus), the glaucous gull (L. hyperboreus), the kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), the sandwich tern (Sterna sandvicensis), the black tern (Chlidonias niger), the guillemot (Uria aalge) and the little auk (Alle alle). The maximum number of seabirds recorded at a haul was 320. The maximum number of a particular species ranged from 120 great shearwaters to 250 yellow-legged/lesser black-backed gulls during a single haul. The differences in ship-follower species abundance are related to migratory movements but fisheries could also have a strong influence at a smaller scale {{on the distribution of}} seabirds off Galicia. The degree to which seabirds rely on fishery discards as food was not quantified, but may be important for several species...|$|E
40|$|This {{report by}} the Slovenian Rarities Committee {{presents}} records of rare bird species in Slovenia in 2014, with some addenda for previous years. The numbers in brackets refer {{to the number of}} records (first number) and individuals (second number) recorded between 1 Jan 1950 and 31 Dec 2013. Since 1 Jan 2013, submission to the Committee has been required for 37 additional species, 17 of which are regional rarities. Records of these species are not numbered, since records from previous years were not collected by the Committee. One new species was added to category C 5 : Sacred Ibis Threskiornis aethiopicus. One species, Spotted Dove Streptopelia chinensis, was added to category E. Breeding was confirmed for Muscovy Duck Cairina moschata and Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus; the two species were thus transferred to subcategory E*. Other notable observations were the third and fourth records of Black Vulture Aegypius monachus, fourth and fifth records of Gannet Morus bassanus, fourth record of <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Skua</b> Stercorarius pomarinus and fourth record of Richard’s Pipit Anthus richardi. The flocks of four Gannets and 23 Flamingos Phoenicopterus roseus have been the largest recorded in Slovenia to date. The list of birds recorded in Slovenia (as of 31 Dec 2014) contains 385 species (369 in category A, 7 in category B, 9 exclusively in category C; 4 species are both in categories A and C). Category D contains 6 species, while category E contains 34, two of which are classified into subcategory E*. These two categories {{are not part of the}} list...|$|E
40|$|Situated in West Africa, Senegal has 700 km of {{coastline}} {{characterized by}} a large Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystem providing significant biological productivity. Small-scale fishing {{plays an important role}} in the national economy of Senegal. The fishing gear used has a potentially direct or indirect impact on seabirds. To examine and evaluate this impact surveys were conducted on eight landing sites. Field surveys (2 - 3 days) took place in 2015 based on a standardized interview with questionnaire conducted with 225 small-scale fishermen. The results obtained indicate that longlines are the fishing gear that causes the highest rate of annual accidental seabird catch (63 % of seabird caugth (n = 702)), followed by handlines (16 %) and anchored gillnet (6 %). The <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Skua</b> (Stercorarius pomarinus) is the most captured bird annually (29 % of total captured birds), closely followed by the Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) (28 % of captured birds) and the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) (13 % of captured birds). The village of Yoff is the landing site which has the highest rate of annual seabird catch with 39 % of the total catch indicated, followed by Kayar with 19 % and Saint Louis with 14 %, both situated on the Grande Côte. Further studies should be conducted in the entire Senegalese-Mauritanian coast in particular in the northern part of Senegal, to better evaluate the annual catch of seabirds. A great collaboration should also be established with longliners, handliners and anchored gillnet fishers to better quantify incidental catch of seabirds by the artisanal fishing gear and set up mitigation actions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Bird {{migration}} {{was recorded}} by tracking radar and visual observations at 15 study sites, situated between 50 ˚E and 170 ˚E along the Northeast Passage, during a ship-based expedition in July and August 1994. A total of 1087 radar tracks (average duration 220 s) of bird flocks on postbreeding migration were recorded. Migration {{was dominated by}} waders and {{to a certain degree}} also skuas (especially <b>pomarine</b> <b>skua</b> Stercorarius pomarinus). Terns, gulls, ducks, and geese were also among the migrants tracked by radar. The radar data revealed a major migratory divide at about 100 ˚E (Taymyr Peninsula), with mainly eastbound migration to the east of this divide, and mainly westbound migration to the west of it. The main stream of eastbound migration was directed toward the sector 90 – 120 ˚ and that of westbound migration toward the sector 240 – 270 ˚; these directions are broadly in parallel with the coasts of the Arctic Ocean east and west of the Taymyr Peninsula, respectively. There was also important ENE migration, which provided strong indications of long-distance flights along orthodrome-like routes directly between Siberia and North America, across vast expanses of the Arctic Ocean pack ice. Analysis of flight directions in relation to wind indicated complete compensation for wind drift. Mean flight altitude was 1. 3 km, and the birds regularly travelled at high altitudes above 3 km (9 % of the tracks) up to a maximum height of 4. 8 km. They preferred to migrate on occasions and at altitudes with following winds; such conditions provided an average gain in speed of 4. 6 m/s. There were also recurrent cases of birds migrating in tailwinds of gale force, between 18 and 24 m/s. The birds ’ airspeed varied between 8 and 22 m/s, with a mean of 14 m/s. Airspeed was significantly correlated with altitude, wind, and vertical speed and seemed to be intermediate between the speeds for minimu...|$|E

40|$|Differences between ages, sexes and {{populations in}} the timing of {{migration}} at Falsterbo, Sweden and {{in the choice of}} wintering site among raptors in Scania were investigated. Competition and dominance is the best primary explanation to the results. In most cases the more competitive adults winter north of juveniles and the larger females north of males. Moult strategy {{is probably one of the}} most important reasons why females in general migrate south earlier than males, and juveniles ahead of adults, in some short-distance migrants. The proportion of adults and juveniles in Swedish raptors leaving via Falsterbo is calculated. The concentration rate is generally highest in species with a more southerly distribution and in raptors primarily using thermal migration. With a few exceptions juveniles are more concentrated at Falsterbo than adults. An analysis of the long-term systematic migration counts from Falsterbo, shows that in all raptors where the Swedish population trends are reasonably well known from other studies, the fluctuation in numbers is very well reflected in the autumn figures from Falsterbo. The proportion of juvenile birds among the migrants gives a good measure of the annual reproduction in several species. By separating Common Buzzards with a white plumage (mainly with a relatively southerly breeding range) at Falsterbo it was possible to demonstrate some differences in migration pattern compared to darker and more northerly birds. Studies of three species of skuas on the Russian tundra demonstrated interesting differences in the proportion of dark phase. While no dark phase birds seem to occur in Long-tailed Skua the proportion was close to 8 % dark birds in <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Skua</b> all the way from Norway to Wrangel Island. This strongly indicates a gene flow all along the transect in this nomadic species. In Arctic Skua on the other hand there was an abrupt change from 64 % dark phase on the Kola Peninsula to an almost complete dominance of light birds all along the Russian tundra. Satellite transmitters constitute an invaluable tool enabling detailed studies of the migration strategies of individual birds. Thirteen Ospreys were tracked on autumn migration from Sweden to the wintering grounds in tropical Africa. The average speed for the whole journey was 174 km/day. This is similar to migration speeds in other raptors studied by satellite telemetry, but considerably faster than results from ringing recoveries. There was large individual variation with few major differences between sexes and ages. The birds made between 0 and 4 stopovers along the way. Migration took place only during the light hours and the Ospreys spent about nine hours in active flight on travelling days...|$|E
