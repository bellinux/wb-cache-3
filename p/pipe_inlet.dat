40|$|Hot gas is {{fed into}} a heat {{exchanger}} and is cooled down there. High local heat transfer coefficients {{arise in the}} inlet region of the water-cooled nozzle due to the entrance effect in the boundary layer which may result in the wall becoming locally overheated. In order to specify the most,favourable form possible for the inlet, the local heat transfer is calculated for cylindrical pipe geometries with a rounded inlet andfor conical pipe geometries similarly with a rounded inlet. To this end, the velocity field of the flow is first determined {{with the aid of}} the potential theory. The resulting velocity distribution along the inlet contour is used, via a boundary laver calculation, to determine the velocity and temperature profile and thus also the local Nusselt number along the contour. Studies are made both of laminar and also of the subsequent turbulent,fow, including the transition point. The properties mqy be regarded as variable. The differential equation system is solved by a numerical finite-difference method after implementation of the Mangier and the Blasius transformations. The theoretical results are in good agreement with own experimental results. The maximum Nusselt numbers are determinedfor the cylindrical <b>pipe</b> <b>inlet</b> at the transition point 'laminar-turbulent' which is observed near the transition from the inlet curvature into the pipe. Even for large curvature radii they are clearly above the maximum values occurring for the conical <b>pipe</b> <b>inlet.</b> For the latter geometry the critical position is at the transition from the cone to the cylindrical pipe.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper investigates numerically and {{theoretically}} the axisymmetric {{vortex breakdown}} occurring in a constricted pipe of infinite extension, i. e., {{the transition from}} a smooth columnar state to a breakdown state exhibiting a recirculation bubble. Velocity distributions are prescribed at the <b>pipe</b> <b>inlet</b> under the form of Batchelor vortices with uniform axial velocity and variable levels of confinement. A numerical continuation technique is developed to follow the branches of nonlinear steady solutions when varying the swirl parameter. In the most general case, vortex breakdown occurs abruptly owing to a subcritical, global instability of the non-parallel, viscous columnar solution, and results in the coexistence of multiple stable solutions over a finite range of swirl. For highly confined vortices, a second scenario prevails, where the flow transitions smoothly from the columnar to the breakdown state without any instability. The effect of a low-flow rate jet positioned at the pipe wall is then characterized in the perspective of control. Its effectiveness is evaluated in light of several practically meaningful criteria, namely, the ability of the control to optimize either the stability domain or the topology of the columnar state and its ability to alleviate hysteresis. For each criterion, an optimal jet position is determined from nonlinear simulations, the results being in good agreement with that issuing from an asymptotic expansion of the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, we illustrate the importance of physically motivated control strategies by demonstrating how the wall jet technique can be outdone by an appropriate manipulation of the axial velocity profile prescribed at the <b>pipe</b> <b>inlet...</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{simplified}} {{hydraulic ram}} {{is shown in}} Figure 2. Initially, the waste valve 4 is open, and the delivery valve 5 is closed. The water in the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> 1 starts to flow under {{the force of gravity}} and picks up speed and kinetic energy until the increasing drag force closes the waste valve. The momentum of the water flow in the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> against the now closed waste valve causes a water hammer that raises the pressure in the pump, opens the delivery valve 5, and forces some water to flow into the delivery pipe 3. Because this water is being forced uphill through the delivery pipe farther than it is falling downhill from the source, the flow slows; when the flow reverses, the delivery check valve closes. Meanwhile, the water hammer from the closing of the waste valve also produces a pressure pulse which propagates back up the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> to the source where it converts to a suction pulse that propagates back down the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe.</b> This suction pulse, with the weight or spring on the valve, pulls the waste valve back open and allows the process to begin again.|$|R

The SAFL Baffle is a stormwater treatment device created at the University of Minnesota's St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. Previous research by Howard et al. 2011 showed {{that when the}} SAFL Baffle is retrofitted into a sump manhole, it improves {{the ability of the}} sump to collect sediment at low flow rates and retain captured sediment at high flow rates. The purpose of this research was to know how a SAFL Baffle performs when: 1. Clogged with debris like trash and vegetation 2. Installed in a sump manhole with an outlet pipe 90 degrees to the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> 3. Installed in a sump manhole with water entering through an inlet grate and <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> Tests were performed at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory on a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 6 -ft (1. 8 m) deep sump, a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 3 -ft (0. 9 m) deep sump, a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 1 -ft (0. 3 m) deep scale model sump, and a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 0. 5 -ft (0. 15 m) deep scale model sump. All of the sumps were equipped with the SAFL Baffle, and were evaluated using two metrics: 1. How well the system captures sediment at low flow rates (Removal Efficiency Testing) 2. How well the system retains the previously captured sediment at high flow rates (Washout Testing) When a SAFL Baffle was clogged with stormwater debris, water traveled underneath of the SAFL Baffle. If the sump was deep, performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle did not change significantly. However, if the sump was shallow, significant washout was exhibited in the sump. This washout problem in shallow sumps was mitigated when a SAFL Baffle with hole diameters equal to 5 -in (12. 7 cm) was installed in the sump. Sumps with outlet pipes located 90 degrees to the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> exhibited significant washout of previously captured sediment during high flow rates. With a SAFL Baffle installed at an angle between 90 - 120 degrees of the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe,</b> washout sharply decreased. At low flow rates, a SAFL Baffle installed at a 113 degree angle with respect to the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> captured more sediment than a SAFL Baffle installed in a standard, straight flow-through sump. In the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle that received water from an <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> and an <b>inlet</b> grate from above, washout rates were highest when the flow rate from the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> was less than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Similarly, the ability of the device to capture sediment decreased when the flow rate from the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> was less than three times greater than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Through extensive testing, it was determined that the standard sumps equipped with the SAFL Baffle should be used downstream of stormwater sewers such that the drainage basin of the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> is at least three times the drainage basin of the inlet grate. Under this condition, the flow from an inlet grate from above does not impact the performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle...|$|R
