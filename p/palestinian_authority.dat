Muslim rule continued in Bethlehem until its conquest in 1099 by a crusading army, who replaced the town's Greek Orthodox clergy with a Latin one. In the mid-13th century, the Mamluks demolished the city's walls, which were subsequently rebuilt under the Ottomans in the early 16th century. Control of Bethlehem passed from the Ottomans to the British {{at the end of}} World War I. Bethlehem came under Jordanian rule during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Bethlehem has been administered by the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authority.</b>|$|E

The services and functions of the municipality include city planning, infrastructure maintenance and repair, providing utilities, school administration and garbage collection.|$|E

A <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authority</b> spokesman denied the allegations and said that Arafat had ordered the renovations and for the synagogue to be rebuilt. Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor, claimed that city officials simply wanted to return the building to the way it looked before it came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war. Under intense U.S. and international pressure the dome was repainted white.|$|E

5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authority</b> and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E

The paper looks in depth at the movement between Palestine and Israel as well as border crossings with the rest of the world. Owing to its sovereignty deficit, the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authorities</b> have not legislated directly on migration, but some legal norms do have an indirect impact. Further, the paper reviews legal obstacles to leaving the country and the question of dual nationality is also addressed and, the issuing of work permits by the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authorities</b> to non-Palestinian workers is explained.

5|$|Gaza {{experienced}} destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914. In 1917, during World War I, British forces {{captured the}} city. Gaza grew {{significantly in the}} first half of the 20th century under Mandatory rule. The population of the city swelled as a result of the Palestinian exodus during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Gaza came under Egyptian rule until it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. Gaza became a center of political resistance during the First Intifada, and under the Oslo Accords of 1993, it was assigned to be under the direct control of the newly established <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authority.</b> Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. By 2007, Hamas emerged both as the victor in Palestinian elections and in factional fighting with rival Fatah in the city and in the wider Gaza Strip and has since been the sole governing authority. Israel subsequently blockaded the Strip and launched assaults against it in 2008–2009, 2012 and 2014, as a response to rocket attacks.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of the Oslo Peace Process was {{the establishment of the}} autonomous governmental authority, the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authority</b> and its associated governing institutions to administer Palestinian communities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. During the Oslo peace process throughout the 1990s, the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authority</b> was ceded authority from Israel over various regions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This process gave it governmental and economic authority over many Palestinian communities. It also gave the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authority</b> many of the components of a modern government and society, including a Palestinian police force, legislature, and other institutions. In return for these concessions, the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authority</b> was asked to promote tolerance for Israel within Palestinian society, and acceptance of Israel's right to exist.|$|E

On 14 February 2011, amid pan-Arab calls for reform, <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Authority</b> Prime Minister Salam Fayyad submitted his resignation along with that of his cabinet to President Mahmoud Abbas.
