40|$|Houses {{invested}} in roof-mounted solar cell need protection from direct lightning. This paper presents {{the application of}} numerical method in designing the height and location of masts based on <b>protection</b> <b>angle</b> method according to international standard IEC 62305. An isolated external lightning protection system using two isolated masts is designed. The protected zone {{which is in the}} volume according to the <b>protection</b> <b>angle</b> method, depends on the protection level, the rolling sphere radius and the height of the masts which must be less than the rolling sphere radius defined in IEC standard. Furthermore, separation distance between the protected house and mast depends on the height of the mast. This paper develops a program using heuristic numerical method to design masts to protect a house with roof-mounted solar cell. Input data such as the house dimensions and the lightning protection class should be provided. This program is tested on houses with different dimensions. The height and location of two masts are obtained. The numerical results show that this program can be used effectively and correctly...|$|E

40|$|Lightning {{shielding}} {{failure is}} an important issue in addressing the lightning performance of HVAC transmission lines. In this paper, an improved electro-geometric model (EGM) is proposed to evaluate the shielding failure outage rate of UHVAC transmission lines. In the Improved model, the striking distances to phase conductors, shielding wires and the ground are differentiated, respectively. Furthermore, the influences of ground obliquity, wind deflection and instantaneous operating voltage of phase conductors are taken Into account. The proposed improved EGM Is applied to calculate the lightning shielding failure outage rate of a UHVAC transmission line to be built In a demonstration project in China. The simulation results show that the maximal difference of shielding failure outage rate due to the phase angle change of the conductor voltage in a period can reach 0. 12 times/ 100 kma. The shielding failure outage rate increases monotonously with the increment of ground obliquity and wind speed. The shielding failure outage rate of the transmission line with the 'cup' tower ZBS 2 Is 0 due to its lower tower height and negative <b>protection</b> <b>angle.</b> The shielding failure outage rate of the transmission line with the 'cathead' tower ZMP 2 is less than the standard limit of 0. 1 times/ 100 kma if the ground obliquity is smaller than 10 °.

40|$|Since 2011 {{fishing is}} fully or {{partially}} prohibited in marine protected areas (MPAs) {{of the natural}} park “Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina” (PNSACV, SW Portugal). In other areas of this park, {{as well as in}} adjacent marine areas, intensive fisheries are made for subsistence, commercial use or recreation. Recreational fishing is common along this coast, namely on rocky bottoms and through shore or boat <b>angling.</b> <b>Protection</b> effects were assessed in 2012 and 2013 with experimental shore and boat angling, involving skilled recreational anglers. Rocky habitats of the northern half of PNSACV were sampled in one or two MPAs (“Ilha do Pessegueiro”, “Cabo Sardão”) and several control areas. Shore angling used fresh sardines as bait and ground bait during ca. 90 minutes per area, period and angler. Shore anglers (3 - 4 in each period) sampled one MPA (two areas in “Ilha do Pessegueiro”) and four control areas in three periods from July to November 2013. Boat angling used fresh bait (mostly shrimps, squids or clams) during ca. 60 minutes per area, period and angler (average depth - 17. 6 m). Boat anglers (3 - 5 in each period) sampled four periods per year during summer 2012 (two areas in “Ilha do Pessegueiro” MPA and four control areas) and 2013 (two areas in each MPA and four control areas per MPA). Fish or shellfish caught were identified to species and measured (total length) or fresh weighted, respectively, and released when caught in MPAs. Multivariate analyses of the abundance of fish caught by size class found significant effects of <b>protection</b> in shore <b>angling</b> total weight (higher values in MPA).

5|$|On 12 June 1917, {{well before}} Mutsu was laid down, Hiraga {{proposed}} a revised {{design for the}} ship that reflected the lessons from the Battle of Jutland that had occurred the previous year, and incorporated advances in boiler technology. Given project number A-125, his design added an extra twin main-gun turret, using space and weight made available by {{the reduction of the}} number of boilers from 21 to 12, while the power remained the same. He reduced the secondary armament from 20 guns to 16, although they were raised in height to improve their ability to fire during heavy weather and to improve their arcs of fire. To increase the ship's <b>protection</b> he proposed <b>angling</b> the belt armor outwards to improve its resistance to horizontal fire, and increasing the thickness of the lower deck armor and the torpedo bulkhead. Hiraga also planned to add anti-torpedo bulges to improve underwater protection. He estimated that his ship would displace as much as Nagato, although it would cost about a million yen more. Hiraga's changes would have considerably delayed Mutsus completion and were rejected by the Navy Ministry.|$|R
40|$|Prince Edward Island, Salmon Fishing Area 17, {{is part of}} the {{southern}} Gulf - Gaspé Designatable Unit which COSEWIC assessed as Special Concern in 2010. Atlantic salmon probably occupied about 71 PEI rivers at the time of European contact. Rivers containing salmon fell to 28 in 2000 - 2002 and to 22 in 2007 - 2008, with salmon presence detected in one additional river in 2011. Original salmon populations were largely late-run and multi-sea-winter, but stocking fish of mainland origin has led to early run components in seven PEI rivers. Reported harvest in aboriginal Food, Social, and Ceremonial fisheries were 0 - 1 fish per year in 2009 - 2011 (only one of two licenced groups provided harvest information in 2011). Recreational salmon angling is permitted in all PEI rivers, but salmon in small rivers receive de facto <b>protection</b> from <b>angling</b> because seasons close on 15 September, before fish return to these rivers. Salmon fishing is permitted up to 31 October in parts of larger rivers which have early-run components. Recreational angling has been catch-and-release since 2009. Estimated mortalities in the angling fishery due to catch-and-release mortality (assumed to be 3 %) were 1 - 4 fish per year in 2009 - 2011. Angler card surveys indicate that fishing effort, small salmon kept, and small and large salmon released have followed declining trends since the mid- 1990 s. Total conservation requirements for current salmon rivers (4, 668, 586 eggs) are based on all habitat types in these rivers, including habitat blocked by dams. Egg deposition was estimated from historic biological characteristics and redd counts, using a redd:female spawner ratio (3. 357) measured in a single year in the West River, PEI. Total estimated egg deposition in current salmon rivers is 67. 7 % of requirements for these rivers. Estimated deposition exceeds requirements in six rivers. Total conservation requirements for all 71 probable current and historic salmon rivers on PEI are 10, 565, 273 eggs. Estimated total egg deposition is 29. 9 % of this total. Atlantic salmon on PEI are negatively affected by sedimentation, blockages to upstream passage due to artificial and beaver dams, excessive water temperatures and low dissolved oxygen levels caused by some dams, pesticide inputs, and competition with rainbow trout. Fishing mortality from aboriginal fishery harvests and from angling is currently low and probably has little impact on salmon populations. Major sources of uncertainty in this assessment include low sample sizes in angler card surveys, use of historic rather than current data on biological characteristics, and use of a redd:spawner ratio measured at only one site in one yea...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the behaviour of a granular scour protection around piles when the bed is subjected to bed degradation. Furthermore, engineering guidelines are provided to account for bed degradation {{in the design of}} the initial scour protection. To address the behaviour of the protection, a physical model is used and to obtain the engineering guidelines, a theoretical approach is used which includes the phenomena that are observed during the physical model tests. As stated by many authors [Breusers et al., 1991; Chiew, 2004; Melville et al., 2000], a granular scour protection around a pile can fail due to several mechanisms. In clear-water conditions these mechanisms include shear failure, winnowing and edge scour and in live-bed conditions two other mechanisms can be added, namely bed degradation and bed form induced failure. This {{research focuses on}} the bed degradation mechanism, which can endanger the granular scour protection around a pile. Just like Van der Hoeven [2002] observed during his research on falling aprons, the stones spread evenly over the front and side slopes of the mound, which form after undermining of the protection has led to the ‘falling’ of the edge stones of the protection. This coverage of stones on the slopes of the mound effectively rearmoured the slopes and prevented further erosion. At the back of the mound this rearmouring is not observed, because the high turbulence levels, introduced by both the mound and the pile, caused stones to become unstable in this area. Furthermore, at the front and side slopes, where the slope of the mound was totally covered by the stones of the <b>protection,</b> the slope <b>angles</b> were constant and comparable to the slope angles that Van der Hoeven found in his research, namely 1 : 2, 0. However, a remarkable difference between the observations of Van der Hoeven and the observations of the current research concerns the layer thickness of the protection on the slope. Van der Hoeven observed that the layer thickness after launching of the apron was only 1 *df, 50 thick, while the current observations show a decreasing layer thickness from the top of the slope to the toe of the mound. The theoretical approach that is used to develop a design formula focuses on the side slopes, where the flow is parallel to the interface between stones and base material. A balance between the volume of the initial protection and the required volume of stones after bed degradation has led to the formulation of the internal slope angle, ?. This angle describes the assumed linearly decreasing thickness along the slope, starting with a certain required thickness at the top, Df,A, to a thickness of only 1 *df, 50 at the bottom. Because the hydraulic load decreases with increasing distance from the pile and the thickness of the initial protection is based on the maximum load near the pile, the assumption that Df,A is equal to the initial thickness of the protection, leads to a conservative design formula. This approach is however taken in the development of the simplified design formula, which results in a linear relation between the bed degradation and the extra extent of the initial protection that should be constructed to deal with that bed degradation.
