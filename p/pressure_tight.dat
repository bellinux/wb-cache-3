50|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of various types}} of respirators was measured in laboratories and in the workplace. These measurements showed that in practice, the {{effectiveness of}} negative <b>pressure</b> <b>tight</b> fitting respiratory protective devices (RPD) depends on leakage between mask and face, rather than the filters/canisters. This decrease in efficiency due to leakage manifested {{on a large scale}} during World War I, when gas masks were used to protect against chemical weapons. Poor fit or poorly situated masks could be fatal. The Russian army began to use short-term exposure to chlorine at low concentrations to solve this problem in 1917. Such testing helped convince the soldiers that their gas masks were reliable - because respirators were a novelty. Later, industrial workers were trained in gas chambers in the USSR (in preparation for the Second World War), and late'. German firefighters used a similar test between the First and Second World Wars. Diluted chloropicrin was used to test industrial gas masks. The Soviet Army used chloropicrin in tents with a floor space of 16 square meters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thermomechanical {{processing}} (TMP) involves both thermal {{and mechanical}} treatments that define both product shape and microstructure/properties. Since the industrial revolution, machines of augmented power, size and precision have {{given rise to}} TMP that challenged explanation of the crystal mechanisms. In wrought iron, lamellar ferrite exhibited high transverse crack resistance due to fine slag stringers that as flux facilitated welding of puddled bars in forging of shafts or rolling of plates for bell-welding into <b>pressure</b> <b>tight</b> pipes; the substructure developed in the iron as working continued below 900 ˚C strengthened it. Patenting of high C steel wire led to an optimum cold-drawn structure for outstanding strength and toughness. Hot forming technology, combined with the refining potential for austenite decomposition gave rise to controlled rolling for enhanced ferrite nucleation, ausforming to refine martensite and intercritical rolling to deform the ferrite or to spheroidize the carbides. Cold rolling and annealing have been scheduled to impart suitable strength, grain size, substructure and texture...|$|E
40|$|Polymer seals {{are used}} {{throughout}} the automobile {{for a variety of}} purposes, and the consequences of a failure of such a seal can range from annoying in case of an A/C component to catastrophic in the case of brake components. With the constantly increasing demands for these components regarding e. g. <b>pressure,</b> <b>tighter</b> tolerances or new refrigerants come more stringent requirements for ensuring surface properties according to the specification for the specific application. While automatic inspection systems are available for a variety of defects, the area of seal inspection is still dominated by manual labor, partly because handling of these small, inexpensive parts is difficult and partly because visual coverage of the entire sealing surface poses a problem. It is also difficult for a human inspector to objectively assess whether or not a surface defect is critical, especially given that inspection of each seal must be completed within a few seconds. The high cost of manual labor can also result in unnecessary delays if quality assessment has been outsourced. This paper describes a fully automatic optical inspection system for ring sealing surfaces using sheet-of-light laser measurement and custom image processing on PC hardware keeping pace with production. The paper presents the system concept and the experiences gained using this system at the plant of one of the world's largest producers of hydraulic seals...|$|R

40|$|The {{final design}} of an {{electro-mechanical}} drill {{is very simple}} both in shape and in mechanism. It is a straight tube consisting of an antitorque section, motor and computer section, chip chamber and core barrel. Three cutters (rake angle : 30 to 40 degrees, pitch : 5 to 7 mm) are attached to cut an ice core 94 mm in diameter and bore hole 135 mm in diameter. The maximum core length is 2. 1 m long. Chips are transported between the core barrel and the outer tube by spiral rim attached to the core barrel. No motor for sucking chips up to the chip chamber is installed. The chips are separated from liquid by the filter at top of the chip chamber, and are compacted to the density of 500 kg/m^ 3.

40|$|The main {{research}} on the energy from thermonuclear fusion uses deuterium plasmas magnetically trapped in toroidal devices. To suppress the turbulent eddies that impair thermal insulation and <b>pressure</b> <b>tight</b> of the plasma, current drive (CD) is necessary, but tools envisaged so far are unable accomplishing this task while efficiently and flexibly matching the natural current profiles self-generated at large radii of the plasma column [1 – 5]. The lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) [6] can satisfy this important need of a reactor [1], but the LHCD system has been unexpectedly mothballed on JET. The problematic extrapolation of the LHCD tool at reactor graded high values of, respectively, density and temperatures of plasma has been now solved. The high density problem is solved by the FTU (Frascati Tokamak Upgrade) method [7], and solution of the high temperature one is presented here. Model results based on quasi-linear (QL) theory evidence the capability, w. r. t linear theory, of suitable operating parameters of reducing the wave damping in hot reactor plasmas. Namely, using higher RF power densities [8], or a narrower antenna power spectrum in refractive index [9, 10], the obstacle for LHCD represented by too high temperature of reactor plasmas should be overcome. The former method cannot be used for routinely, safe antenna operations, Thus, only the latter key is really exploitable in a reactor. The proposed solutions are ultimately necessary for viability of an economic reactor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: With the {{restrictions}} on online downhole measuring during petroleum drilling, mathematical reconstruction of the bottomhole pressure (BHP) is desired to improve control of the pressure profile throughout the well. With sufficient <b>pressure</b> management, increasingly <b>tight</b> <b>pressure</b> margins, that are imposed by the worsening accessibility of the remaining oil reservoirs, might be met. A regularized and adaptive Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) approach is proposed to estimate the BHP.

The employed observer model is nonlinear, as required by the process, and chosen to be third order to mitigate computational load. The algebraic BHP equation includes two unknown parameters and an unmeasured state. Accuracy of the model is enhanced by estimation of selected parameters.
