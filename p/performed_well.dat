5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, media {{coverage}} of the game focused on Auburn's exclusion from the national championship game, a controversial point for Auburn fans and other observers in the {{weeks leading up}} to the game. In addition, both teams boasted high-ranked defenses that had <b>performed</b> <b>well</b> during the year. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom were considered among the best players at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall <b>performed</b> <b>well</b> for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E

50|$|Let us {{assume that}} we {{evaluate}} solutions in a specific problem situation using several criteria. Let us further assume that more is better in each criterion.

40|$|This paper compares several {{tests for}} {{specification}} error in regression models when {{the alternative is}} nonspecific. The author considers the Durbin-Watson, RESET, Chow, and differencing tests. Perhaps not surprisingly, each test tends to <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> only against their "designed" alternatives. That is, {{with only a few}} exceptions, the differencing tests <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> against omitted dynamics, the Durbin-Watson test <b>performs</b> <b>well</b> when the omitted is autocorrelated, RESET <b>performs</b> <b>well</b> against incorrect functional form, and the Chow test <b>performs</b> <b>well</b> against structural shifts. These results are disappointing in that the tests have been proposed as tests against "general" or "nonconstructive" alternatives.

40|$|One {{decision}} procedure dominates a {{given one}} if it <b>performs</b> <b>well</b> {{on the entire}} class of problems the given decision procedure <b>performs</b> <b>well</b> on, and {{then goes on to}} <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> on other problems that the given decision procedure does badly on. <b>Performing</b> <b>well</b> will be defined as generating higher expected utility before entering a problem. In this paper it will be argued that the timeless decision procedure dominates the causal and evidential decision procedures. It will also be argued in turn that the updateless decision procedure dominates the timeless decision procedure. The difficulties of formalizing a modern variant of the ”smoking gene” problem will then be briefly examined. ...|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} noticing {{that there are}} two main things in iterations. One is to select the next node to insert, and the other is to find an {{insertion}} position to insert. The following heuristics, RI, CHRI and RA are to select the next node randomly in iterations. As shown in Figs.  8 and 9, RI and CHRI <b>perform</b> <b>well.</b> However, Fig.  10 shows that RA does not <b>perform</b> <b>well,</b> and <b>performs</b> the worst for NY. This suggests that such random heuristics need to explore a certain number of insertion positions on the current circuit, in order to achieve a better accuracy. The same occurs to the furthest heuristics. Both FI and CHFI <b>perform</b> <b>well,</b> but FA does not <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> on the other hand due to the limited number of exploring insertion positions.|$|R
