40|$|In this paper, two new {{analytical}} {{approaches are}} presented {{on the basis}} of convergence-confinement method to compute both the ultimate convergence of circular tunnel and its plastic zone having been reinforced by systematically <b>pre-tensioned</b> fully grouted rockbolts. The models have two basic assumptions: (1) the grouted rockbolts increase the radial internal pressure within a broken rock mass by both the <b>pre-tensioned</b> force and the probable following induced force due to rock mass movement (2) tunnel convergence (specially short-term) occurs only due to reducing and diminishing of the radial constrained stress on tunnel surface provided by the working face. Hence, the values of both the <b>pre-tensioned</b> pressure and the mentioned radial constrained stress are specially taken into consideration in this paper. That is, according to their magnitudes, two different conditions occur: the magnitude of <b>pre-tensioned</b> pressure is greater than that of the constrained stress at bolt installation time and vice versa. The solutions are extended to each of conditions, and illustrative examples are solved. The proposed approaches predicting almost identical results show that <b>pre-tensioning</b> of grouted rockbolts will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of rockbolts...|$|R

50|$|When {{the wind}} turbine nacelle is {{positioned}} on {{the tower and}} the yaw bearing assembly is completed {{it is necessary to}} adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (<b>pre-tension)</b> elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.|$|E
50|$|Seatbelts {{restrain}} the passengers so they don't {{fly through the}} windshield, and are in the correct position for the airbag and also spread the loading of impact on the body. Seat belts also absorb passenger inertial energy by being designed to stretch during an impact, again to reduce the speed differential between the passenger's body and their vehicle interior. In short: a passenger whose body is decelerated more slowly due to the crumple zone (and other devices) over a longer time survives much more often than a passenger whose body indirectly impacts a hard, undamaged metal car body which {{has come to a}} halt nearly instantaneously. It is like the difference between slamming someone into a wall headfirst (fracturing their skull) and shoulder-first (bruising their flesh slightly) is that the arm, being softer, has tens of times longer to slow its speed, yielding a little at a time, than the hard skull, which isn't in contact with the wall until it has to deal with extremely high pressures. The stretching of seatbelts while restraining occupants during an impact, means {{that it is necessary to}} replace them if a vehicle is repaired and put back on the road after a collision. They should also be replaced if their condition has deteriorated e.g. through fraying or mechanical or belt mounting faults. In New Zealand it is officially mandatory to replace worn inertia reel type seatbelts only with 'webbing grabber' type belts that have less play and are more effective on older cars. Newer cars have electronically fired <b>pre-tension</b> seatbelts that are timed to work with the airbag firing. Buying used seatbelts is not a good idea even in countries where it is legal to do so, because they may have already been stretched in an impact event and may not protect their new users as they should.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} bond (or adhesion) {{achievable}} between the freshly set concrete {{and the surface}} of the tendons is critical to the <b>pre-tensioning</b> process, as it determines when the tendon anchorages can be safely released.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wire <b>pre-tension</b> in the Ilizarov {{frame is}} {{considered}} to be important in order to reduce movements that can impair fracture healing. Wires will eventually lose part of their <b>pre-tension,</b> however. In order to gain more insight into the need for wire <b>pre-tension,</b> we investigated: (1) the amount of pre-ten-sion loss, (2) the relationship between <b>pre-tension</b> loss and bolt-tightening torque, (3) the cause of a possible loss of <b>pre-tension,</b> and (4) the effect of <b>pre-tension</b> on cyclic micromotions and total displacement of the bone segments. METHODS: 3 Ilizarov configurations, with various wire pre-tensions and bolt-tightening torques, were tested 3 times with an MTS machine. For each wire, slippage and tensions were measured {{for the duration of the}} whole experiment. RESULTS: A loss of wire <b>pre-tension</b> (up to 75 %) due to slippage was found. Higher bolt-tightening torques significantly reduced the amount of <b>pre-tension</b> loss. Furthermore, a higher wire <b>pre-tension</b> reduced the maximal axial displacement of the bone fragment. There was, however, least cyclic axial micromotion when no wire <b>pre-tension</b> was present [...] probably due to the lack of wire recoil. INTERPRETATION: Wires in an experimental Ilizarov external fixator lose <b>pre-tension</b> within a limited period of time, and probably also in the clinical setting. This does not seem to lead to increased cyclic axial micromotions of the bone fragements. However, the question remains as to how excessive axial displacement of the bone fragment and other loading configurations will affect the process of fracture healing in a patient...|$|E
40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} studies on {{reversible}} adhesion mechanisms of geckos and insects, we investigate {{the effect of}} <b>pre-tension</b> on the orientation-dependent adhesion strength of an elastic tape adhering on a substrate. Our analysis shows that the <b>pre-tension</b> can significantly increase the peel-off force at small peeling angles while decreasing it at large peeling angles, leading to a strongly reversible adhesion. More interestingly, we find that there exists a critical value of <b>pre-tension</b> beyond which the peel-off force plunges to zero at a force-independent critical peeling angle. We further show {{that the level of}} <b>pre-tension</b> required for such force-independent detachment at a critical angle can be induced by simply dragging a spatula pad along a substrate at sufficiently low angles. These results provide a feasible explanation of relevant experimental observations on gecko adhesion and suggest possible strategies to design strongly reversible adhesives via <b>pre-tension...</b>|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{our earlier}} {{study on the}} effect of <b>pre-tension</b> in gecko adhesion, here we {{investigate}} whether and how <b>pre-tension</b> in cytoskeleton influences cell adhesion by developing a stochastic-elasticity model of a stress fiber attached on a rigid substrate via molecular bonds. By comparing the variations in adhesion lifetime and observing the sequences of bond breaking with and without <b>pre-tension</b> in the stress fiber under the same applied force, we demonstrate that the effect of <b>pre-tension</b> is to shift the interfacial failure mode from cracklike propagation toward uniform bond failure within the contact region, thereby greatly increasing the adhesion lifetime. Since stress fibers are the primary load-bearing components of cells, as well as the basic functional units of cytoskeleton that facilitate cell adhesion, this study suggests a feasible mechanism by which cell adhesion could be actively controlled via cytoskeletal contractility and proposes that <b>pre-tension</b> may be a general principle in biological adhesion...|$|E

The most important challenge is to improve strength and durability of these materials.

40|$|Thermally-induced {{forces in}} a fully {{cemented}} geothermal production casing can cause compressive failure during production of high temperature formation fluids.

The results of the investigations have shown that deformational characteristics (F, N and H max, mm) in longitudinal and transverse directions differ {{with the increase of}} <b>pre-tension</b> level. Thus, seam allowances can be defined more accurately in more deformable direction at the stage of product development. Cotton fabric (100  %) of plain weave was used as base material for fused systems. Biaxial tension testing was performed with three types of interlinings: woven, nonwoven and knitted, which differed not only in surface density, but in the density of adhesive layer, which was 52 and 76 dots/cm 2, as well. The samples of fused systems were punched {{from the side of the}} main cotton fabric in order to maintain the same friction force between the punch and the specimen. Obtained results have shown that different number of force peaks, i. e. breakings is characteristic for different fused systems.

5000|$|First {{used in the}} late-nineteenth century, {{prestressed}} concrete has developed beyond <b>pre-tensioning</b> to include post-tensioning, which occurs after the concrete is cast.
