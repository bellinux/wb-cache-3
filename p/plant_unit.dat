40|$|The {{problem of}} {{cooperative}} effect and competition between trees in forest has been considered. Special {{attention has been}} paid to the possibility of twofold increase in timber yield due to the dramatic decrease of intraspecific competition between individual trees. Use has been made of a large experimental area (about 50. 000 hectares in mountainous Kirghizia) to demonstrate that the drastic increase in timber yield takes place if the number of trees in the <b>planting</b> <b>unit,</b> spacing between individuals within the <b>planting</b> <b>unit</b> and spacing between the <b>planting</b> <b>units</b> correlate with sufficient precision. The phenomenon has been analyzed by means of computer models developed. A Temporal-spatial structure of the forest is formed under the influence of many factors. The main of them are trees competition for living area and the factor of cooperation of trees to provide better stability in competition with other plant communities (grass, bushes) and to defend from the destructive influence of wind.
