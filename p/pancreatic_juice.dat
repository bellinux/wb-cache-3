Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>juice</b> from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|E

While Lohr was able to find p53 mutations via TGGE in a few subjects, none subsequently developed pancreatic carcinoma. Thus, the researchers conclude by noting that the p53 mutation may not be the sole indicator of pancreatic carcinoma oncogenesis.|$|R

25|$|The most {{prominent}} effect of JBS is pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Varying degrees of decreased secretion of lipases, pancreatic juices such as trypsin, trypsinogen and others, {{as well as}} malabsorption of fats and disruptions of glucagon secretion and its response to hypoglycemia caused by insulin activity are major concerns when JBS is diagnosed. Associated with developmental errors, impaired apoptosis, and both prenatal and chronic inflammatory damage, necrosis and fibrosis of the pancreatic acini (clusters of pancreatic exocrine gland tissue, where secretion of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>juice</b> and related enzymes occurs), pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in JBS can additionally stem from congenital replacement of the acini with fatty tissue. Near total replacement of the entire pancreas with fatty tissue has also been reported. This is a progressive, sometimes fatal consequence of the disorder.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pancreas}} [...] is a glandular organ in {{the digestive}} system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, {{it is located}} in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. [...] It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide, all of which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting <b>pancreatic</b> <b>juice</b> containing bicarbonate to neutralize acidity of chyme moving in from the stomach, as well as digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is known as a mixed gland.|$|E

These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a 'hydrophobic pocket' (the S1 position) of the enzyme. It is activated {{in the presence of}} trypsin. The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P1 sidechain and the enzyme S1 binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme.

50|$|The first {{reported}} partial pancreaticoduodenectomy {{was performed by}} the Italian surgeon Alessandro Codivilla in 1898, but the patient only survived 18 days before succumbing to complications.

Later it was thought, also mistakenly, that the pancreatic duct could simply be tied up without serious adverse effects; in fact, it will very often leak later on.

30|$|Kuo et al. and Lubianskii et al. {{suggested}} {{the possibility that}} contraction at the Vater papilla during the perioperative period might induce acute pancreatitis [6, 13]. Fentanyl was administered to our patient through an epidural catheter to control perioperative pain. Fentanyl causes constriction of the sphincter of Oddi, but the contraction caused is weaker than that caused by morphine [14]. As fentanyl, which is administered into the epidural space, is transferred from the plexus venous in the epidural space to the blood [15], the effect of fentanyl on the sphincter of Oddi may promote spasms of the Vater papilla. This may damage the mechanism by which <b>pancreatic</b> <b>juices</b> are excreted, thereby inducing the onset of acute pancreatitis.|$|R
2500|$|Digestion {{begins in}} the mouth with the {{secretion}} of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage {{the walls of the}} stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, <b>pancreatic</b> <b>juice</b> and intestinal juice. [...] The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine.|$|E
60|$|Section 28. The <b>pancreatic</b> <b>juice,</b> the {{secretion}} of {{the pancreas}} is remarkable as acting {{on all the}} food stuffs that have not already become soluble. It emulsifies fats, that is, it breaks, the drops up into extremely small globules, forming a milky fluid, and it furthermore has a fermentive action upon them; it splits them up into fatty acids, and the soluble body glycerine. The fatty acids combine with alkaline substances (Section 26) to form bodies which belong to the chemical group of Soaps, and which are soluble also. The <b>pancreatic</b> <b>juice</b> also attacks any proteids that have escaped the gastric juice, and converts them into peptones, and any residual starch into sugar. Hence by this stage, in the duodenum, all the food constituents noticed in Section 17 are changed into soluble forms.

An important factor in the diet of the herbivorous animals, and one absent from the food of the carnivora, is that carbohydrate, the building material of all green-meat- [food], cellulose, and there is some ground for thinking that the caecum is probably a region of special fermentive action upon it.

SO dysfunction is best diagnosed by manometry, which is able to correctly stratify patient groups and determine therapy. Biliary scintigraphy, which is noninvasive, has shown promise as a screening tool for patients with suspected SO dysfunction.

40|$|AbstractIn {{contrast}} to procarboxypeptidase B {{which has always}} {{been reported to be}} secreted by the pancreas as a monomer, procarboxypeptidase A occurs as a monomer and/or associated to one or two functionally different proteins, depending on the species. Recent studies showed that, in the human pancreatic secretion, procarboxypeptidase A is mainly secreted as a 44 kDa protein involved in at least three different binary complexes. As previously reported, two of these complexes associated procarboxypeptidase A to either a glycosylated truncated protease E or zymogen E. In this paper, we identified proelastase 2 as the partner of procarboxypeptidase A in the third complex, thus reporting {{for the first time the}} occurrence of a proelastase 2 /procarboxypeptidase A binary complex in vertebrates. Moreover, from N-terminal sequence analyses, the 44 kDa procarboxypeptidase A involved in these complexes was identified as being of the A 1 type.

The first stage in this process is the robust segmentation of the pancreatobiliary system.
