40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{maximum power point}} tracking algorithm for PV systems useful in case of non-uniform irradiance conditions. This algorithm takes into account the number of bypass diodes in a PV string to calculate the voltage bands associated with the peak power points that appear in the power–voltage characteristic of the PV system. The main contribution {{of this study is to}} state that the global maximum power point can be tracked by considering only the possible voltage bands which can be found by using the proposed analytical equation in a simple manner. The algorithm is based in the evaluation and analysis of these voltage bands and in the selection of the PV system voltage related to the maximum power <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The proposed algorithm has been validated by means of simulation and also in an experimental study.

It is {{shown that a}} singular <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> space can be mapped either as a critical or a noncritical point of the autonomous system, depending on the direction of approach to the singular point. Making use of the noncritical mapping, a closed-loop kinematic controller with asymptotic stability and velocity limits along degenerate singular or near-singular paths is designed. The authors introduce {{a specific type of}} motion along the reference path, the so-called natural motion. This type of motion is obtained in a straightforward manner from the autonomous dynamical system and always satisfies the motion constraint at a singular point. In the vicinity of the singular point, natural motion slows down the end-effector speed and keeps the joint velocity bounded. Thus, no special trajectory replannin...|$|E
