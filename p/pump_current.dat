5000|$|A {{variation}} on the zirconia sensor, called the [...] "wideband" [...] sensor, was introduced by NTK in 1992 and has been widely used for car engine management systems {{in order to meet}} the ever-increasing demands for better fuel economy, lower emissions and better engine performance at the same time. It is based on a planar zirconia element, but also incorporates an electrochemical gas pump. An electronic circuit containing a feedback loop controls the gas <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> to keep the output of the electrochemical cell constant, so that the <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> directly indicates the oxygen content of the exhaust gas. This sensor eliminates the lean-rich cycling inherent in narrow-band sensors, allowing the control unit to adjust the fuel delivery and ignition timing of the engine much more rapidly. In the automotive industry this sensor is also called a UEGO (for Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen) sensor. UEGO sensors are also commonly used in aftermarket dyno tuning and high-performance driver air-fuel display equipment. The wideband zirconia sensor is used in stratified fuel injection systems, and can now also be used in diesel engines to satisfy the upcoming EURO and ULEV emission limits.|$|E

In particular, we investigate the nature of <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> for systems with resonance as well as anti-resonance. It is found that in the adiabatic regime, the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> changes sign across the sharp resonance with long lifetime while the non-adiabatic <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> at finite frequency does not. When the lifetime of resonant level is short, the behaviors of adiabatic and non-adiabatic <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> are similar with sign changes. Our results show that at the energy where complete transmission occurs the adiabatic <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> is zero while non-adiabatic <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> is non-zero. Different from the resonant case, both adiabatic and non-adiabatic <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> are zero at anti-resonance with complete reflection. We also investigate the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> when the other system parameters such as magnetic field, pumped frequency, and pumping potentials. Interesting behaviors are revealed. Finally, we study the symmetry relation of <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> for several systems with different spatial symmetry upon reversal of magnetic field. Different from the previous theoretical prediction, we find that a system with general inversion symmetry can pump out a finite current in the adiabatic regime. At small magnetic field, the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> has an approximate relation I(B) ≈ I(-B) both in adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|The Na+-K+ <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> was {{studied in}} smooth muscle cells from {{mesenteric}} resistance arteries of guinea-pigs {{by the use}} of the perforated patch-clamp technique in the presence of blockers for various ion channels and exchangers. When the Na+ concentration in the pipette solution ([Na+]i) was 50 mM, an increase in the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) from 0 to 10 mM caused an outward current. Both the removal of K+ from the bath solution and the application of 10 μM ouabain abolished this current. Thus, this K+-induced and ouabain-sensitive current was considered to be the Na+-K+ <b>pump</b> <b>current.</b> The amplitude of the Na+-K+ <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> increased as the membrane potential was made more positive until around 0 mV, while the amplitude saturated at more positive potentials than 0 mV. An increase in [K+]o or [Na+]i amplified the Na+-K+ <b>pump</b> <b>current.</b> For [K+]o, the binding constant (Kd) was 1. 6 ± 0. 3 mM and the Hill coefficient (nH) was 1. 1 ± 0. 2 (n = 6). For [Na+]i, Kd was 22 ± 5 mM and nH was 1. 7 ± 0. 5 (n = 4 – 19). The presence of various monovalent cations other than Na+ in the bath solution also evoked the Na+-K+ <b>pump</b> <b>current.</b> The order of potency was K+ ≥ Rb+ > Cs+ ≫ Li+. Ouabain inhibited the Na+-K+ <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> in a dose-dependent manner with a Kd of 0. 35 ± 0. 03 μM and an nH of 1. 2 ± 0. 1 (n = 6 – 8).

A device for exchanging the solution inside the pipette permitted investigation of Na/K pump current-voltage (I-V) relationships at several levels of pipette [Na] ([Na]m) in a single cell; the effects of changes in external [Na] ([Na]o) or external [K] ([K]o) were also studied.

The <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> can be either positive or negative under different system parameters.

Extracellular application of these quaternary amines competitively inhibited extracellular K+ (K+o) activation of Na,K pump current; however, the concentration for half maximal inhibition of Na,K <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> at 0 mV (K 0 Q) by BTEA, 4. 0 ± 0. 3 mM, was {{much lower than the}} K 0 Q for TEA, 26. 6 ± 0. 7 mM. Even so, the fraction of the membrane electric field dissipated during K+o activation of Na,K <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> (λK), 39 ± 1 %, was similar to λK determined in the presence of TEA (37 ± 2 %) and BTEA (35 ± 2 %), an indication that the membrane potential (VM) dependence for K+o activation of the Na,K <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> was unaffected by TEA and BTEA. TEA was found to inhibit the Na,K <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> in a VM-independent manner, i. e., inhibition of current dissipated 4 ± 2 % of the membrane electric field.

Basolateral membrane current-voltage (I-V) curves were obtained in conditions where the ratio of the <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> to the total basolateral membrane current had been maximized by loading the cells with Na t (exposure to low-K + bath), and by blocking the basolateral K + conductance with barium. The <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> was defined as the difference of the current across the basolateral membrane measured before and 10 - 15 s after the addition of strophanthidin (20 #M) to the bath solution. With a bath solution containing 3 mM K +, the <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> was nearly constant in the V~ range of- 20 to- 80 mV (52 -+ 5 t~A. cm- ~ at- 60 mV) but showed a marked voltage dependence at higher negative Vm (<b>pump</b> <b>current</b> decreased to 5 _+ 9 gA. cm- ~ at- 180 mV). In a 1. 0 mM K bath, the shape of the pump I-V curve was similar but the amplitude of the current was decreased (24 _+ 4 #A. cm- 2 at- 60 mV). In a 0. 1 mM K bath, the <b>pump</b> <b>current</b> was not significantly different from 0. Our results indicate that the basolateral Na-K pump generates a current which depends on the extracellular potassium concentration. With physiological peritubular concentration of K + and in the physiological range of potential, the pump activity, measured as the pump-generated current, was independent of the membrane potential...|$|E

Two different geometries are studied in detail, a normal metal [...] ferromagnetic [...] normal metal (NFN) junction and a ferromagnetic [...] normal metal [...] ferromagnetic (FNF) junction. Using a scattering matrix approach, we first calculate the tunneling conductance and then the adiabatically <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> using different <b>pumping</b> mechanisms for both types of junctions. We explain the oscillatory behavior of the conductance by studying the condition for resonant transmission in the junctions and find that each time a new resonant mode appears in the transport window, the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> diverges. We also predict an experimentally distinguishable difference between the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> and the rectified current...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} adiabatic quantum pumping of ballistic Dirac fermions on {{the surface}} of a strong three-dimensional topological insulator. Two different geometries are studied in detail, a normal metal–ferromagnetic–normal metal (NFN) junction and a ferromagnetic–normal metal–ferromagnetic (FNF) junction. Using a scattering matrix approach, we show that each time a new resonant mode appears in the transport window the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> exhibits a maximum and provide a detailed analysis of the position of these maxima. We also predict a characteristic difference between the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> in NFN- and FNF-junctions: whereas the former vanishes for carriers at normal incidence, the latter is finite due to the different nature of wavefunction interference in the junctions. Finally, we predict an experimentally distinguishable difference between the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> and the conductance. Quantum NanoscienceApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a general theory for a parametric pump consisting of a nonmagnetic system with two ferromagnetic leads whose magnetic moments orient at an angle θ with respect to each other. In this theory, the leads can maintain at different chemical potential. As a result, the current is driven due to both the external bias and the pumping potentials. When both θ and external bias are zero, our theory recovers the known theory. In particular, two cases are considered: (a). in the adiabatic regime, we have derived the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> for arbitrary <b>pumping</b> amplitude and external bias. (b). at finite frequency, the system is away from equilibrium, we have derived the <b>pumped</b> <b>current</b> up to quadratic order in pumping amplitude.
