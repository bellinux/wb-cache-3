5|$|In 1992 {{an attempt}} was made to extract a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare its relationship to other Canis species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains had been removed from the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{predominantly}} populated by humans, Spira features {{a variety of}} races. The people of Spira mainly reside in small towns and villages and cities like Bevelle and Luca.

With the collapse of the teachings of Yevon and the wider acceptance of machina at the end of Final Fantasy X, prejudice against the Al Bhed seems to have eased significantly by the time of Final Fantasy X-2, though it is still present.|$|E

5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears to be {{authentic}} pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century. A number of non-destructive techniques have been applied to the codex {{in an effort to}} authenticate it, and the results were published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> paper. The researchers commented that the staining appeared {{to be the result of}} drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{previously}} {{believed that}} the skin was an effective barrier to inorganic particles. Damage from mechanical stressors {{was believed to be}} the only way to increase its permeability. Recently, however, simpler and more effective methods for increasing skin permeability have been developed. For example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has been used to slightly damage the surface of skin, causing a time-dependent defect allowing easier penetration of nanoparticles. The UVR’s high energy causes a restructuring of cells, weakening the boundary between the stratum corneum and the epidermal layer. The damage of the skin is typically measured by the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), though it may take 3–5 days for the TEWL to reach its peak value. When the TEWL reaches its highest value, the maximum density of nanoparticles is able to <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> skin. Studies confirm that UVR damaged skin significantly increases the permeability. The effects of increased permeability after UVR exposure can lead to an increase in the number of particles that <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> skin. However, the specific permeability of skin after UVR exposure relative to particles of different sizes and materials has not been determined.|$|E
25|$|The first {{solution}} in the 1970s was {{the development of}} water-free electrolyte systems based on organic solvents. Their advantages, among other things were lower leakage currents and nearly unlimited shelf life. But now another problem was observed. The growing mass production with automatic insertion machines requires a washing of the PCB's after soldering. The cleaning solutions contain chloroalkanes (CFC) agents. These halogens solutions sometimes <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> sealing of the capacitors and start chlorine corrosion. Again there was a leakage current problem.|$|E

25|$|Two {{hundred years}} later, {{there was a}} rebirth of the {{popularity}} of the doctrines in the Azores; their religious manifestations, rituals and symbols began to <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> islands and, consequently, persist until today. These acts of faith were heavily influenced by Franciscan spiritualists, who were members of the first religious order that colonized the Azores, and brought with them traditions that were being extinguished on the mainland by Catholic Church orthodoxy. Here, in isolated communities under environmental pressures and the uncertainties of life, the millenarian rites of the Holy Spirit were accepted and fostered. The Azores, and those communities that had their origins in the archipelago, became the last outposts of Joachimite doctrines.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{synthetic}} glucocorticoids, some far more potent than cortisol, {{have been created}} for therapeutic use. They differ in both pharmacokinetics (absorption factor, half-life, volume of distribution, clearance) and pharmacodynamics (for example the capacity of mineralocorticoid activity: retention of sodium (Na+) and water; renal physiology). Because they <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> intestines easily, they are administered primarily per os (by mouth), but also by other methods, such as topically on skin. More than 90% of them bind different plasma proteins, though with a different binding specificity. Endogenous glucocorticoids and some synthetic corticoids have high affinity to the protein transcortin (also called corticosteroid-binding globulin), whereas all of them bind albumin. In the liver, they quickly metabolize by conjugation with a sulfate or glucuronic acid, and are secreted in the urine.|$|E
25|$|The Man on a Balcony leans nonchalantly {{against a}} {{balustrade}} occupying the foreground of the composition. At first glance he appears bathed in natural light. But upon close examination {{there is no}} clear light source or direction from which the light emanates, giving the overall work the theatrical feeling of a stage set. Aimed at a wide audience, the models monumental three-dimensional presence 'gazes' at the spectator, while the spectator contemplates the painting in return. Just as in Gleizes' Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon (1911) and Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) of the same year, there is present throughout an interplay of perpendicular lines and hyperbolic arcs that produce a rhythm that <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> complex urban backdrop; here of smokestacks, train tracks, windows, bridge girders and clouds (the view from the balcony of the doctors office on the avenue de l'Opéra).|$|E
25|$|Other {{emerging}} PV technologies include organic, dye-sensitized, quantum-dot, and Perovskite photovoltaics. OPVs {{fall into}} the thin-film category of manufacturing, and typically operate around the 12% efficiency range which {{is lower than the}} 12–21% typically seen by silicon based PVs. Because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases cost of manufacturing and meaning that they are not feasible for large scale up. Dye-sensitized PVs are similar in efficiency to OPVs but are significantly easier to manufacture. However these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> plastics used in the cell. Quantum dot solar cells are quantum dot sensitized DSSCs and are solution processed meaning they are potentially scalable, but currently they peak at 12% efficiency. Perovskite solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectric properties for photovoltaic purposes, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, PR Sen. Marco Rigau {{presented}} a free association project that received {{the rejection of}} conservative governor Rafael Hernández Colón, establishing the sides that would <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> internal debate of the PPD during the following decades. The option made its debut backed by an independent group in the inconclusive 1998 status referendum, where none of the actual status options won. The 2000s brought forth a re-emergence of the free association movement with the prominence of new leaders such as mayors William Miranda Marín, José Aponte de la Torre and Rafael Cordero Santiago. In 2008, the ELA Soberano was adopted as the PPD's institutional position by governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, a transcental move for the movement that resounded beyond the re-election campaign. Despite being inherited by two conservative leaders, the soberanistas have continued to gain a stronghold within the PPD, seizing prominent positions including the mayorship of the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan. The exposition also {{led to the creation}} of other movements that supported the ideal, such as Alianza pro Libre Asociación Soberana (ALAS) and Movimiento Unión Soberanista (MUS). As of the Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012, sovereign free association is the option with the largest growth margin among all, experiencing a hundredfold (4,536 to 454,768) expansion in only 14 years.|$|E
