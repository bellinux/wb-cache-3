5|$|Compounding matters was {{the fact}} that the {{supposedly}} deceased actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion <b>pictures,</b> <b>or</b> commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that Cannibal Holocaust was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.|$|E

Such an approach in science is entirely intolerable in that it idealizes the material at hand, and obscures the very fragmentary nature of the fossils, and their poor state of preservation.|$|E
