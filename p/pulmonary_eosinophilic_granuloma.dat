40|$|Two histologically proven oases of eosinophilic {{granuloma}} {{limited to the}} lung are reported. The roentgen examination of the chest reveals a generalised granulomatous infiltrate throughout title lung fields with a background pattern of fibrosis and localised areas of emphysema. Clinically, these patients are almost asymptomatic {{in spite of the}} extensive radiographic changes in the lungs. The pathological examination of the surgical specimens obtained from these cases reveals a process identical to that found in the lesions of {{eosinophilic granuloma}} of the bone. One histologically proven case of eosinophilic granuloma of the bone with associated lung changes is reported. The roentgen examination of this patient’s chest reveals identical changes to those found in the first two cases. Although no pathological confirmation of the lung changes was obtained, it Is felt that this too represents a ease of eosinophilic granuloma of the lung.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe the CT characteristics of confirmed idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>eosinophilic</b> granulomatosis {{in a group of}} dogs. Five dogs met inclusion criteria. All patients were young adult dogs of variable breeds. No dog had concurrent occult heartworm disease. Computed tomographic characteristics most commonly included pulmonary masses and nodules of variable size, and lesions were most commonly located in the caudal lung lobes. Four dogs had large pulmonary masses with or without additional nodules and one dog had nodular lesions disseminated throughout the entire lung parenchyma. All large <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> were smoothly margined, heterogeneous pulmonary masses displaying heterogeneous contrast enhancement. A honeycomb-like enhancement pattern was observed in all but one mass and consisted of multiple hyperattenuating rims delineating central hypoattenuating areas, suggestive of bronchiectatic lung with peripheral enhancing airway walls and fluid-filled, necrotic bronchial lumen. One dog had evidence of tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy. Findings indicated that canine <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> granulomatosis should be included as a differential diagnosis for dogs with CT characteristics of multiple pulmonary masses and/or nodules in caudal lung lobes, and a honeycomb-like enhancement pattern in masses after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast medium. © 2013 American College of Veterinary Radiology...|$|R
40|$|Abundant {{evidence}} currently {{exists to}} suggest that immune complexes {{play an important role}} in inflammatory diseases of the lung. Clinically, idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis, <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> of lung, and systemic lupus erythematosus have been shown to be associated with the presence of immune complexes both in lung and in the serum. Experimentally, there is compelling evidence that acute lung injury can be triggered by the deposition of complexes in vascular walls or by the presence of performed immune complexes instilled into the airways. The observed reactions are, as expected, complement- and neutrophil-dependent. The morphologic changes in lung caused by products of complement activation (C 5 a and related peptides) depend on whether complement activation occurs within the vasculature or within the airways. Airway activation is associated with intraalveolar accumulations of neutrophils, while intravascular activation leads to intracapillary sequestration of neutrophils. The chronic formation of immune complexes within the vasculature (in the model of “chronic serum sickness”) leads to an interstitial fibrotic reaction and a thickening of basement membranes. Recent studies of intravascularly infused preformed immune complexes indicate a proclivity for certain types of complexes to localize within lung. These “lung-seeking” complexes differ from non-lung-seeking complexes only in the ratio of antigen to antibody. Complement does not seem to alter the tendancy for certain complexes to localize within lung. These studies emphasize the potential importance of immune complexes in lung injury and point out the variety of mechanisms involved in both the localization process and the injury process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Synchronous {{composite}} {{tumors are}} uncommon. Simultaneous, rather than metachronous or consecutive, occurrences of <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> and Hodgkin's lymphoma in children are very rare. This {{is the first}} report of this kind in the medical literature. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 12 -year-old Iranian boy with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> localized in his leg around the knee and Hodgkin's lymphoma in a cervical lymph node. The two tumours occurred synchronously before the patient had received any treatment. Conclusion Several cases of an association between <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> and lymphoproliferative disorder have been reported. Some of these cases involve Hodgkin's lymphoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurring in the same patient. Genetic or environmental etiologies have been postulated for <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> which occur following Hodgkin's lymphomas, but have as yet not been proven. To our knowledge, synchronous occurrence of these two malignant processes in a patient who has not received any prior treatment is rare in children. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} {{associated}} with hyperplasia of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and variably increased levels of bombesin-like peptides in the lower respiratory tract. Because the neuropeptide bombesin is a chemoattractant for monocytes and a mitogen for 3 T 3 fibroblasts, we hypothesized that an excess of neuroendocrine cells and bombesin-like peptides could contribute to lung inflammation and fibrosis in certain cigarette smokers. <b>Eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> is a fibrotic lung disease of unknown etiology that in adults occurs almost invariably in cigarette smokers. We quantitated neuroendocrine cells with bombesin-like immunoreactivity in open lung biopsies from patients with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> (n = 6) and compared these with cigarette smokers (n = 6) who underwent lung resection {{for reasons other than}} primary lung disease. In addition, we compared them with patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 8), a disease not associated with cigarette smoking. Finally, we also examined the mitogenic effect of bombesin on cultured human adult lung fibroblasts. The patients with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> exhibited a 10 -fold increase in neuroendocrine cells with bombesin-like immunoreactivity compared to both smokers (P = 0. 005) and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (P = 0. 005). In addition, bombesin produced a significant mitogenic effect on cultured human adult lung fibroblasts at concentrations of 1 nM and above. We conclude that increased numbers of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells with bombesin-like immunoreactivity are commonly found in patients with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> and, since bombesin-like peptides are chemotactic for monocytes and mitogenic for human lung fibroblasts, we speculate that neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia may be important in the pathogenesis of <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> in adult cigarette smokers...|$|R

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case {{review of}} {{children}} with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> of the cervical spine. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical features, radiographic findings, management, and results of 7 pediatric patients with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> of the cervical spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Management of the <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> of the pediatric cervical spine is challenging, and must be adapted according to the patient, as no level I evidences have been produced. The therapeutic goals in these children are spinal stability, preservation of neurologic function, and relief of pain, always {{keeping in mind that}} patients are still growing. The localization in the cervical spine of children is extremely rare, with less than 50 patients reported in literature between 1966 and 2008. METHODS: We reviewed the 7 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> of the cervical spine who were managed between 1970 and 1990 by the senior author. All patients presented with isolated cervical spine involvement, and all of them had a histologic diagnosis of <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> (EG). All had open physes. RESULTS: There were 5 boys and 2 girls (mean age: 10 years; range 4 - 16). We followed-up patients for 19 years (range 8 - 29). The symptoms at presentation varied according to the localization of the tumor in the cervical spine. CONCLUSION: Management of pediatric patients with EG of the cervical spine is challenging, especially when there is neurologic involvement. Observation alone, prolonged immobilization, systemic chemotherapy, curettage with or without bone grafting, corticosteroid injection, and low dose radiation therapy have been proposed for the management of patients with EG. Surgery is required when the child presents neurologic involvement.
