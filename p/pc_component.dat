Our research concentrates on improving visual user interface (VUI) methods and extend-ing existing visual representation techniques.

However, the changes that occur in the brain are not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: The N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component</b> has previously been associated with visuo-spatial attention. In this study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate whether the N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component</b> changed during long-term visual perceptual learning. Thirteen subjects completed several days of training in an orientation discrimination task, and were given a final test 30 days later. The results showed that behavioral thresholds significantly decreased across training sessions, and this decrement was also present in the untrained visual field. ERPs showed training significantly increased the N 2 pc amplitude, and this effect could be maintained for up to 30 days. However, the increase in N 2 pc was specific to the trained visual field. Conclusion/Significance: Training caused spatial attention to be increasingly focused on the target positions. However, this process was not transferrable from the trained to the untrained visual field, which suggests that the increase in N 2 pc ma...|$|E

40|$|To {{compare the}} speed and {{efficiency}} of item-based and category-based attentional control during visual search for real-world objects, we measured N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> as electrophysiological markers of attentional target selection. In different blocks, participants searched for 1 or 2 specific target objects or for any object in a target category (items of clothing or kitchen objects). Search displays contained 6 line drawings of different objects, and targets always appeared together with 5 distractors from the other object category. The presence of N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> to categorically defined targets demonstrated that category-based search can operate at visuoperceptual processing stages. In contrast to previous findings for letter/digit search (Nako, Wu, & Eimer, 2014), target N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> were delayed by 40 ms during category-guided search relative to single-target search. This suggests that for objects and object categories that are less familiar than alphanumerical stimuli, category-guided target selection operates less efficiently than selection {{that is based on}} a physical match with an attentional template...|$|R
40|$|Finding target objects among {{distractors}} {{in visual}} search display is often {{assumed to be}} based on sequential movements of attention between different objects. However, the speed of such serial attention shifts is still under dispute. We employed a search task that encouraged the successive allocation of attention to two target objects in the same search display and measured N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> to determine how fast attention moved between these objects. Each display contained one digit in a known color (fixed-color target) and another digit whose color changed unpredictably across trials (variable-color target) together with two gray distractor digits. Participants' task was to find the fixed-color digit and compare its numerical value with that of the variable-color digit. N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> to fixed-color targets preceded N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> to variable-color digits, demonstrating that these two targets were indeed selected in a fixed serial order. The N 2 pc to variable-color digits emerged approximately 60 msec after the N 2 pc to fixed-color digits, which shows that attention can be reallocated very rapidly between different target objects in the visual field. When search display durations were increased, thereby relaxing the temporal demands on serial selection, the two N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> to fixed-color and variable-color targets were elicited within 90 msec of each other. Results demonstrate that sequential shifts of attention between different target locations can operate very rapidly at speeds that are in line with the assumptions of serial selection models of visual search...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Salient visual {{singleton}} stimuli produce spatial cueing effects {{indicative of}} attentional capture {{only when they}} match current task sets, suggesting that capture is subject to top-down control. However, such task-set contingent capture effects could {{be associated with the}} top-down controlled disengagement of attention from non-matching stimuli that follows their initial bottom-up salience-driven selection. Using the N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component</b> as an event-related potential marker of attentional capture, we demonstrate that top-down task set already controls the initial rapid selection of salient visual singleton stimuli prior to any subsequent attentional disengagement. These findings provide new evidence for the primacy of top-down control over bottom-up salience in attentional capture...|$|E

We used an electrophysiological technique with macaque monkeys analogous to procedures for recording scalp event-related potentials from humans and found that monkeys exhibit short-latency visual components sensitive to sensory processing demands and lateralizations related to shifting of covert attention similar to the human N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component.</b> These findings begin {{to bridge the gap}} between the disparate literatures by using electrophysiological measurements to study the deployment of visual attention in the brains of humans and nonhuman primates...|$|E

These results confirm the early capture of spatial attention by threat-related stimuli, and demonstrate that this early bias is modulated by trait anxiety. Enhanced P 1 amplitudes to targets after presentations of angry expressions were also found; however, this effect was not modulated by trait anxiety levels. Our findings indicate that individual differences in temperament are an important determinant of the early neural response to threat...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} electrophysiological {{correlates of}} change detection, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants monitored displays containing four faces {{in order to}} detect a face identity change across successive displays. Successful change detection was mirrored by an N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>component</b> at posterior electrodes contralateral {{to the side of}} a change, suggesting close links between conscious change detection and attention. ERPs on undetected-change trials differed from detected-change and no-change trials. We suggest that short-latency ERP differences between these trial types reflect trial-by-trial fluctuations in advance task preparation, whereas differences in the P 3 time range are due to variations in the duration of perceptual and decision-related processing. Overall, these findings demonstrate that ERPs are a useful tool for dissociating processes underlying change blindness and change detection...|$|E
30|$|Another {{method in}} the CS family is {{principal}} component substitution (PCS) {{that relies on}} the principal component analysis (PCA) mathematical transformation. The PCA, {{also known as the}} Karhunen-Loéve transform or the Hotelling transform, is widely used in signal processing, statistics and many other areas. This transformation generates a new set of rotated axes, in which the new image spectral components are not correlated. The largest amount of the variance is mapped to the first component, with decreasing variance going to each of the following ones. The sum of the variances in all the components is equal to the total variance present in the original input images. PCA and the calculation of the transformation matrices can be performed following the steps specified in [20]. Theoretically, the first principal component, PC 1, collects the information that is common to all bands used as input data to the PCA, i.e., the spatial information, while the spectral information that is specific to each band is captured in the other principal components [42, 33]. This makes PCS an adequate technique when merging MS and PAN images. PCS is similar to the IHS method, with the main advantage that an arbitrary number of bands can be considered. However, some spatial information may not be mapped to the first component, depending on the degree of correlation and spectral contrast existing among the MS bands [33], resulting in the same problems that IHS had. To overcome this drawback, Shah et al.[53] proposed a new adaptive PCA-based pansharpening method that determines, using cross-correlation, the appropriate <b>PC</b> <b>component</b> to be substituted by the PAN image. By replacing this <b>PC</b> <b>component</b> by the high spatial resolution PAN component, adaptive PCA method will produce better results than traditional ones [53].|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that when two color-defined target objects appear in rapid succession at different locations, attention is deployed independently and in parallel to both targets. This study investigated whether this rapid simultaneous attentional target selection mechanism can also be employed in tasks where targets are defined by a different visual feature (shape) or when alphanumerical category is the target selection attribute. Two displays that both contained a target and a nontarget object on opposite sides were presented successively, and the SOA between the two displays was 100, 50, 20, or 10 msec in different blocks. N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> were recorded to both targets as a temporal marker of their attentional selection. When observers searched for shape-defined targets (Experiment 1), N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> to the two targets were equal in size and overlapped in time when the SOA between the two displays was short, reflecting two parallel shape-guided target selection processes with their own independent time course. Essentially the same temporal pattern of N 2 <b>pc</b> <b>components</b> was observed when alphanumerical category was the target-defining attribute (Experiment 2), demonstrating that the rapid parallel attentional selection of multiple target objects is not restricted to situations where the deployment of attention can be guided by elementary visual features but that these processes can even be employed in category-based attentional selection tasks. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the cognitive and neural basis of top-down attentional control...|$|R
