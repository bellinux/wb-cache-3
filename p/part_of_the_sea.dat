5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the most}} stable and secure <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> otter's range is Russia. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the Kuril Islands, with more near Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. After {{the years of the}} Great Hunt, the {{population}} in these areas, currently part of Russia, was only 750. By 2004, sea otters had repopulated all of their former habitat in these areas, with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting the numbers are reaching carrying capacity.|$|E
5|$|In a few {{northern}} areas, {{fish are}} also eaten. In studies performed at Amchitka Island in the 1960s, where the sea otter population was at carrying capacity, 50% of food found in sea otter stomachs was fish. The fish species were usually bottom-dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus and family Tetraodontidae. However, south of Alaska on the North American coast, fish are a negligible or extremely minor <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> otter's diet. Contrary to popular depictions, sea otters rarely eat starfish, and any kelp that is consumed apparently {{passes through the}} sea otter's system undigested.|$|E

5|$|Today {{the site}} of the church, {{including}} the upper <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> defences there, is managed by English Heritage, and the village has all but disappeared. The present appearance of the cliff below the church, a grassy slope above a large stone apron, was the work of central government and was in place by April 1867. In 2000 the surviving fragments of an early medieval cross that once stood inside the old church were used to design a Millennium Cross to commemorate two thousand years of Christianity. This stands {{at the entrance to the}} car park and was commissioned by Canterbury City Council.|$|E
5|$|Whales were {{historically}} {{common in}} continental and marginal waters such as Hallaniyat Islands, along Indian coasts, Persian Gulf and Gulf of Aden and recent migrations {{into the gulf}} including by cow-calf pairs. It is unknown whether whales seen in the Red Sea originate in this population, however sightings increased since in 2006 even in the northern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> such as in Gulf of Aqaba. Individuals may reach the Maldives, Sri Lanka, or further east. Humpbacks have been considered rather vagrant into Persian Gulf, however new studies indicate more regular presences can be expected.|$|E
5|$|Spalding {{had been}} a port from before any of the river {{improvements}} were made. The townspeople had refused to repair the river {{during the reign of}} Henry III, as they claimed it was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> here. Its importance as a port increased with the river improvements and the Stamford Canal, and although it did not have a customs house, by 1695 it had various officials who acted as customs officers for goods arriving at the quays and warehouses. Exports included oats, coleseed, rape oil, hides and wool, with a much greater variety of imports, including stone, timber, coal, groceries, glass and beeswax. More exotic imports included French and Spanish wines, and some of the first imports of tea, coffee and chocolate.|$|E

5|$|The Coastal Discovery Museum, in {{conjunction}} with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> Turtle Protection Project. The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, move them to more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to educate the public about this endangered species. To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance stipulates that artificial lighting must be shielded so that it cannot be seen from the beach, or it must be turned off by 10:00p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.|$|E

25|$|There may be {{locations}} in the Sea of Okhotsk where right whales can reliably be found in summer. In the Sea of Okhotsk, the right whales are currently distributed far from shore in the southern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> The Sea is mainly Russian territorial waters, so Russian cooperation is required for any surveys. The remoteness of the location and the enormous demand for ships and aircraft associated with {{oil and gas exploration}} near Sakhalin Island, make any ship or aerial surveys difficult and expensive.|$|E

25|$|The Caribbean Sea is an oceanic sea largely {{situated}} on the Caribbean Plate. The Caribbean Sea is separated from the ocean by several island arcs of various ages. The youngest stretches from the Lesser Antilles to the Virgin Islands to the north east of Trinidad and Tobago {{off the coast of}} Venezuela. This arc was formed by the collision of the South American Plate with the Caribbean Plate and includes active and extinct volcanoes such as Mount Pelee, the Quill (volcano) on Sint Eustatius in the Caribbean Netherlands and Morne Trois Pitons on Dominica.

500|$|Light is {{only able}} to {{penetrate}} the top [...] {{so this is the}} only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> where plants can grow. The surface layers are often deficient in biologically-active nitrogen compounds. The marine nitrogen cycle consists of complex microbial transformations which include the fixation of nitrogen, its assimilation, nitrification, anammox, and denitrification. Some of these processes take place in deep water so that where there is an upwelling of cold waters or near estuaries where land-sourced nutrients are present, plant growth is higher. This means that the most productive areas, rich in plankton and therefore also in fish, are mainly coastal.|$|E
500|$|There is a {{proposal}} to reopen the Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR which would connect Cornwall and Plymouth {{to the rest of}} the UK railway system on an all weather basis.

On the night of 4 February 2014, amid high winds and extremely rough seas, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> wall at Dawlish was breached washing away around [...] of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind. The line was closed. Network Rail began repair work and the line reopened on 4 April 2014. In the wake of widespread disruption caused by damage to the mainline track at Dawlish by coastal storms in February 2014, Network Rail are considering reopening the Tavistock to Okehampton and Exeter section of the line as an alternative to the coastal route.|$|E
500|$|MacLaren {{was invited}} by the Melbourne Cricket Club {{to bring a}} team to Australia during the English winter of 1901–02. This was the last privately {{organised}} team to represent England at Test level in Australia, with subsequent ones playing under the colours of the MCC. Many leading players were unavailable—Yorkshire's Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst were not permitted to tour by their captain Lord Hawke. The team was judged to be weak, but contained several players {{at the beginning of}} their careers who went on to success at Test level. Sydney Barnes was chosen by MacLaren after playing only a handful of county matches. Barnes' success on his single appearance for Lancashire in 1901 convinced MacLaren of his worth, to the surprise and disparagement of commentators, most of whom had never seen him. Barnes began the tour well, but did not get on with his captain. During a storm on <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> journey, MacLaren, speculating on their chances of survival, commented to a team member: [...] "If we go down, at least that bugger Barnes will go down with us." [...] The team lost their first match and continued to struggle. MacLaren clashed with authorities in Melbourne over his right to choose an umpire, but he began to bat well at Sydney, where he scored 145 and 73 in a tour match.|$|E
