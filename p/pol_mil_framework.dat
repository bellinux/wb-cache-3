However, this dependence severely limits scalability to large-scale datasets where fine resolution annotations are {{too expensive to}} obtain. In this paper, we propose a multiple instance learning (<b>MIL)</b> <b>framework</b> for multi-class AED using weakly annotated labels. The proposed <b>MIL</b> <b>framework</b> uses audio embeddings extracted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network as input features. We show that by using audio embeddings the <b>MIL</b> <b>framework</b> can be implemented using a simple DNN with performance comparable to recurrent neural networks. We evaluate our approach by training an audio tagging system using a subset of AudioSet, which is a large collection of weakly labeled YouTube video excerpts. Combined with a late-fusion approach, we improve the F 1 score of a baseline audio tagging system by 17 %. We show that audio embeddings extracted by the convolutional neural networks significantly boost the performance of all <b>MIL</b> models. This <b>framework</b> reduces the model complexity of the AED system and is suitable for applications where computational resources are limited.

40|$|Abstract — Many {{important}} {{applications in}} Health Sciences and Biology have underlying datasets that have ambiguous class membership, that is, individual labels {{are difficult to}} establish. In such cases, many times, the training examples are easier to label as a group {{rather than at the}} instance level. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a supervised learning strategy that addresses this labeling difficulty by employing training example given as positive and negative bags of instances. In this paper we describe a fuzzy variation of the <b>MIL</b> Diverse Density <b>framework</b> (FUMIL) based on ordered weighted geometric operator (OWG) and fuzzy complement operators. We apply FUMIL for early illness recognition of elderly living alone in their home. The available data consists of wireless non-wearable sensor values aggregated at hour level (instance) and ground truth (medical data) available at day level (bag).

40|$|When supervising {{an object}} {{detector}} with weakly labeled data, most existing approaches {{are prone to}} trapping in the discriminative object parts, e. g., finding {{the face of a}} cat instead of the full body, due to lacking the supervision on the extent of full objects. To address this challenge, we incorporate object segmentation into the detector training, which guides the model to correctly localize the full objects. We propose the multiple instance curriculum learning (MICL) method, which injects curriculum learning (CL) into the multiple instance learning (<b>MIL)</b> <b>framework.</b> The MICL method starts by automatically picking the easy training examples, where the extent of the segmentation masks agree with detection bounding boxes. The training set is gradually expanded to include harder examples to train strong detectors that handle complex images.

40|$|Abstract. Visual {{recognition}} requires {{to learn}} object models from training data. Commonly, training samples are annotated by marking only the bounding-box of objects, since {{this appears to}} be the best tradeoff between labeling information and effectiveness. However, objects are typically not box-shaped. Thus, the usual parametrization of object hypotheses by only their location, scale and aspect ratio seems inappropriate since the box contains a significant amount of background clutter. Most important, however, is that object shape becomes only explicit once objects are segregated from the background. Segmentation is an ill-posed problem and so we propose an approach for learning object models for detection while, simultaneously, learning to segregate objects from clutter and extracting their overall shape. For this purpose, we exclusively use bounding-box annotated training data. The approach groups fragmented object regions using the Multiple Instance Learning (<b>MIL)</b> <b>framework</b> to obtain a meaningful representation of object shape which, at the same time, crops away distracting background clutter to improve the appearance representation. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{multiple}} instance learning (<b>MIL)</b> <b>framework,</b> {{an object}} {{is represented by}} a set of instances referred to as bag. A positive class label is assigned to a bag if it contains at least one positive instance; otherwise a bag is labeled with negative class label. Therefore, the task of MIL is to learn a classifier at bag level rather than at instance level. Traditional supervised learning approaches cannot be applied directly in such kind of situation. In this study, we represent each bag by a vector of its dissimilarities to the other existing bags in the training dataset and propose a multiple instance learning based Twin Support Vector Machine (MIL-TWSVM) classifier. We have used different ways to represent the dissimilarity between two bags and performed a comparative analysis of them.

40|$|When objects undergo large pose change, {{illumination}} variation {{or partial}} occlusion, most existed visual tracking algorithms tend to drift away from targets and even fail in tracking them. To address this issue, in this study, the authors propose an online algorithm by combining multiple instance learning (MIL) and local sparse representation for tracking {{an object in}} a video system. The key idea in our method is to model the appearance of an object by local sparse codes that can be formed as training data for the <b>MIL</b> <b>framework.</b> First, local image patches of a target object are represented as sparse codes with an overcomplete dictionary, where the adaptive representation {{can be helpful in}} overcoming partial occlusion in object tracking. Then MIL learns the sparse codes by a classifier to discriminate the target from the background. Finally, results from the trained classifier are input into a particle filter framework to sequentially estimate the target state over time in visual tracking. In addition, to decrease the visual drift because of the accumulative errors when updating the dictionary and classifier, a two-step object tracking method combining a static MIL classifier with a dynamical MIL classifier is proposed.

40|$|PURPOSE: Providing {{care for}} terminally ill family members places an {{enormous}} burden on informal caregivers. Meaning in life (MiL) {{may be a}} protective factor, but is jeopardised in caregiving and bereavement. This study evaluates the following questions: To what extent do bereaved informal caregivers of palliative care (PC) patients experience meaning in their lives? What differences emerge in carers compared to the general German population? How does MiL relate to well-being in former caregivers? METHODS: Eighty-four bereaved PC caregivers completed the Schedule for Meaning in Life Evaluation, the Brief Symptom Inventory, the WHOQOL-BREF, a single-item numerical rating scale of quality of life, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. The experience of MiL of bereaved caregivers was compared to a representative population sample (n= 977). RESULTS: The overall MiL fulfillment of bereaved caregivers (69 % female, age 55. 5 ± 12. 9 years) was significantly lower than {{in the general population}} (68. 5 ± 19. 2 vs. 83. 3 ± 14, p<. 001), as was the overall importance ascribed to their meaning framework (76. 6 ± 13. 6 vs. 85. 6 ± 12. 3, p<[*]. 001). PC caregivers {{are far more likely to}} list friends, leisure, nature/animals, and altruism. Higher MiL was correlated with better life satisfaction and quality of life.

Individual MiL is associated with well-being in PC caregivers during early bereavement.

40|$|Cell {{differentiation}} is {{a natural}} process occurring in all higher organisms, since the early fetal stage of life. It is, also, a part of disease – such as cancer – as the cell cycle becomes deregulated and cells behave differently compared to healthy ones. Differentiation occurs although the genome of all cells is identical across all cell types of the same organism. The motivation behind the current work is to understand why this happens. Cells differentiate because of different gene expression patterns. The genomic features close or around a gene determine its expression. One of these genomic features is the binding of Transcription Factors (TFs), which are proteins that bind in the promoter region of genes and are responsible for their (non-) expression. Other genomic features in?uence the binding of TFs close to genes, such as the accessibility of DNA, the levels of DNA methylation or the modi?cation of histones. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify the genomic features that in?uence the binding of the TFs that are responsible for gene expression. Normal classi?cation cannot express that multiple TFs need to bind in a gene’s promoter region for it to be expressed and the number of TFs varies among genes. The TF labels are also unknown, meaning that it is not known which TF, or TFs, is/are responsible for gene expression. For these reasons, this problem – and the data – ?ts the Multiple Instance Learning (<b>MIL)</b> <b>framework.</b> A method is formulated, where a gene is treated as a bag and all the TF binding sites are instances. The results are promising, as TFs that were selected as important for gene expression were found to be so in a biological example.

Here, two different force fields available in the literature to represent the H- 2 /H- 2 and H- 2 /MOF framework interactions have been considered to capture such experimental findings via molecular dynamics simulations. We have shown that (i) a similar magnitude of the energetic contribution for the H- 2 /H- 2 and H- 2 /MOF framework interactions and (ii) a smoothness of the potential energy,surfaces are required in order to match the supermobility of H- 2 at low loading.

40|$|Enabling {{machines}} to understand non-verbal facial behavior from visual data {{is crucial for}} building smart interactive systems. This thesis focusses on human behavior analysis in videos. Previous state-of-the-art methods generally employed global temporal pooling approaches that, (i) assume presence of a single uniform event spanning the sequence, and (ii) discard temporal ordering by squashing all information along the temporal dimension. In this dissertation we focus on two specific modeling challenges unaddressed by previous approaches. First issue is training with weak labels that only provide video-level annotations and are much cheaper to obtain than fine (frame-level) annotations. The second concerns modeling temporal dynamics during prediction, as facial expressions are dynamic actions with sub-events. We propose to tackle these issues by proposing methods based on Weakly Supervised Latent Variable Models (WSLVM) and evaluate them on real-world spontaneous expressions. We begin with addressing these challenges by combining Multiple Instance Learning (<b>MIL)</b> <b>framework</b> and Multiple Segment representation (MS-MIL). MS-MIL can simultaneously classify and localize target behavior in videos despite training with weak annotations. However, this method lacks the capability to explicitly model multiple latent concepts or global temporal order. We address this issue in the next chapter by explicitly modeling temporal orderings by learning an exemplar Hidden Markov Model for each sequence. This algorithm models dependencies between segments but is limited in its modeling capacity due {{to the use of}} generative modeling. Chapter~ 4 extends MIL to learn multiple discriminative concepts in a novel formulation for joint clustering and classification. This algorithm shows consistent performance improvement but does not capture temporal structure. We finally present a unified learning framework that combines the strengths of the previously proposed algorithms in that it (i) addresses weakly labeled data (ii) learns multiple discriminative concepts, and (iii) models the temporal ordering structure of the concepts. This method is a novel WSLVM that models a video as a sequence of automatically mined, multiple discriminative sub-events with a loose temporal structure.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 55 - 61. The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm arises to {{be useful}} in many application domains, whereas it is particularly suitable for computer vision problems due {{to the difficulty of}} obtaining manual labeling. Multiple Instance Learning methods have large applicability to a variety of challenging learning problems in computer vision, including object recognition and detection, tracking, image classification, scene classification and more. As opposed to working with single instances as in standard supervised learning, Multiple Instance Learning operates over bags of instances. A bag is labeled as positive if it is known to contain at least one positive instance; otherwise it is labeled as negative. The overall learning task is to learn a model for some concept using a training set that is formed of bags. A vital component of using Multiple Instance Learning in computer vision is its design for abstracting the visual problem to multi-instance representation, which involves determining what the bag is and what are the instances in the bag. In this context, we consider three different computer vision problems and propose solutions for each of them via novel representations. The first problem is image retrieval and re-ranking; we propose a method that automatically constructs multiple candidate Multi-instance bags, which are likely to contain relevant images. The second problem we look into is recognizing actions from still images, where we extract several candidate object regions and approach the problem of identifying related objects from a weakly supervised point of view. Finally, we address the recognition of human interactions in videos within a <b>MIL</b> <b>framework.</b> In human interaction recognition, videos may be composed of frames of different activities, and the task is to identify the interaction in spite of irrelevant activities that are scattered through the video.

Each of the outlined problems are tested on benchmark datasets of the problems and compared with the state-of-the-art.

In the last decade, discriminative learning approaches have proven effective in detecting rigid objects, achieving very low false positives rates.

Our method, Multiple Component Learning (MCL), automatically learns individual component classifiers and combines these into an overall classifier. Unlike previous methods, which rely on either fairly restricted part models or labeled part data, MCL learns powerful component classifiers in a weakly supervised manner, where object labels are provided but part labels are not.

The source and target classes might share similar appearance (e. g. bear fur is similar to cat fur) or appear against similar background (e. g. horse and sheep appear against grass). To exploit this, we acquire three types of knowledge from the source set: a segmentation model trained on both thing and stuff classes; similarity relations between target and source classes; and co-occurrence relations between thing and stuff classes in the source. The segmentation model is used to generate thing and stuff segmentation maps on a target image, while the class similarity and co-occurrence knowledge help refining them. We then incorporate these maps as new cues into a multiple instance learning <b>framework</b> (<b>MIL),</b> propagating the transferred knowledge from the pixel level to the object proposal level.

40|$|The goal of {{a machine}} {{learning}} problem is to learn useful patterns from observations so that appropriate inference {{can be made from}} new observations as they become available. Based on whether labels are available for training data, a vast majority of the machine learning approaches can be broadly categorized into supervised or unsupervised learning approaches. In the context of supervised learning, when observations are available as labeled feature vectors, the learning process is a well-understood problem. However, for many applications, the standard supervised learning becomes complicated because the labels for observations are unavailable as labeled feature vectors. For example, in a ground penetrating radar (GPR) based landmine detection problem, the alarm locations are only known in 2 D coordinates on the earth's surface but unknown for individual target depths. Typically, in order to apply computer vision techniques to the GPR data, it is convenient to represent the GPR data as a 2 D image. Since {{a large portion of the}} image does not contain useful information pertaining to the target, the image is typically further subdivided into subimages along depth. These subimages at a particular alarm location can be considered as a set of observations, where the label is only available for the entire set but unavailable for individual observations along depth. In the absence of individual observation labels, for the purposes of training standard supervised learning approaches, observations both above and below the target are labeled as targets despite substantial differences in their characteristics. As a result, the label uncertainty with depth would complicate the parameter inference in the standard supervised learning approaches, potentially degrading their performance. In this work, we develop learning algorithms for three such specific scenarios where: (1) labels are only available for sets of independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) observations, (2) labels are only available for sets of sequential observations, and (3) continuous correlated multiple labels are available for spatio-temporal observations. For each of these scenarios, we propose a modification in a traditional learning approach to improve its predictive accuracy. The first two algorithms are based on a set-based framework called as multiple instance learning (MIL) whereas the third algorithm is based on a structured output-associative regression (SOAR) <b>framework.</b> The <b>MIL</b> approaches are motivated by the landmine detection problem using GPR data, where the training data is typically available as labeled sets of observations or sets of sequences. The SOAR learning approach is instead motivated by the multi-dimensional human emotion label prediction problem using audio-visual data, where the training data is available in the form of multiple continuous correlated labels representing complex human emotions. In both of these applications, the unavailability of the training data as labeled featured vectors motivate developing new learning approaches that are more appropriate to model the data. A large majority of the existing MIL approaches require computationally expensive parameter optimization, do not generalize well with time-series data, and are incapable of online learning. To overcome these limitations, for sets of observations, this work develops a nonparametric Bayesian approach to learning in MIL scenarios based on Dirichlet process mixture models. The nonparametric nature of the model and the use of non-informative priors remove the need to perform cross-validation based optimization while variational Bayesian inference allows for rapid parameter learning. The resulting approach is highly generalizable and also capable of online learning. For sets of sequences, this work integrates Hidden Markov models (HMMs) into an <b>MIL</b> <b>framework</b> and develops a new approach called the multiple instance hidden Markov model. The model parameters are inferred using variational Bayes, making the model tractable and computationally efficient. The resulting approach is highly generalizable and also capable of online learning. Similarly, most of the existing approaches developed for modeling multiple continuous correlated emotion labels do not model the spatio-temporal correlation among the emotion labels. Few approaches that do model the correlation fail to predict the multiple emotion labels simultaneously, resulting in latency during testing, and potentially compromising the effectiveness of implementing the approach in real-time scenario. This work integrates the output-associative relevance vector machine (OARVM) approach with the multivariate relevance vector machine (MVRVM) approach to simultaneously predict multiple emotion labels. The resulting approach performs competitively with the existing approaches while reducing the prediction time during testing, and the sparse Bayesian inference allows for rapid parameter learning. Experimental results on several synthetic datasets, benchmark datasets, GPR-based landmine detection datasets, and human emotion recognition datasets show that our proposed approaches perform comparably or better than the existing approaches.

In this study adsorption as a purification tool was used to obtain high H 2 content of gas mixture from SMR off gas. Zeolites and metal organic framework were used as an adsorbent. CO 2 equilibrium studies on K rich NaX zeolites, prepared with ultrasonic and traditional methods, and metal organic <b>framework</b> <b>MIL</b> 53 (Al) shows high adsorption on zeolites than MIL 53 (Al) up to 1 atm. K rich zeolites give lower adsorption than NaX zeolite. Adsorption isotherms obtained for MIL 53 (Al) is linear (favorable for zeolites). This makes MIL 53 (Al) is an promising adsorbent for high pressure application. Adsorption equilibrium at 5 atm shows that NaX zeolite is good adsorbent for the SMR off gas with the following orders: CO 2 >CH 4 >CO> H 2. Kinetics of SMR off gas in MIL 53 (Al) were studied by using Zero Length Column (ZLC) method. The results show that the calculated diffusivities are strongly dependent on temperature but weakly dependent on purge flow rate. The study reveals that transport is controlled by intracrystalline diffusion. The activation energy on diffusion are nearly same (about 41 kJ/mol) and not change with respect to kinetic diameter of SMR off gases. Heat of SMR off gas adsorption on MIL 53 (Al) obtained from Henry’s constant shows that adsorption is exothermic. The study shows that the ZLC method is an effective tool to investigate the diffusion kinetics of SMR off-gas gases in MIL 53 (Al) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{global climate}} change induced by {{greenhouse}} gases has stimulated active research for developing efficient strategies to mitigate CO 2 emission. In the present study, we prepared a series of polyamine/ metal-organic framework (MOF) composites as highly selective CO 2 adsorbents from a CO 2 /N- 2 mixture, which is relevant to CO 2 capture in flue gas. We show that loading polyethyleneimine (PEI) into <b>MIL</b> 101 (Cr) <b>frameworks</b> can significantly enhance the selective CO 2 adsorption capacity at low pressure and ambient temperature. Further, the comparative study reveals that both the particle size of the MOF and the molecular-weight of PEI {{play an important role}} in the CO 2 capture ability. Regarding the particle size, smaller MIL- 101 (Cr) particles can facilitate the loading of PEI into the inner pores and result in lower surface area/pore volume. Thus, the resulting PEI/MIL- 101 (Cr) composites possess lower CO 2 adsorption capacity, but are compensated by higher selectivity of CO 2 over N- 2. On the other hand, lower molecular-weight linear PEI could readily diffuse into the inner pores and effectively block the N- 2 adsorption. As a result, the as-prepared A-PEI- 300 sample in this work exhibits an excellent CO 2 uptake of 3. 6 mmol g(- 1) and ultrahigh CO 2 /N- 2 selectivity at 0. 15 bar and 25 degrees C. In contrast, the higher molecular-weight branched PEI is advantageous at elevated temperature, since the composites can retain high CO 2 adsorption capacity owing to the large amount of primary amine groups. Overall, polyamine/MOF composites are shown to be good candidate adsorbents for CO 2 capture from flue gas. To achieve the optimal CO 2 capture ability, comprehensive optimization of the polyamine and MOF structures should be performed...|$|R
