Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town. In a short time the area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.|$|E

With an area of , it was located in the {{imperial}} <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Shandong</b> (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Qingdao was its administrative center. According to Dr. Wilhelm Matzat, of the University of Bonn, [...] "The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) {{was nothing more than}} the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east." [...] On gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply. The buildings were built in a European style. The area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. This area is what later became Shinan District.|$|E
500|$|After {{departing from}} Suzhou and {{continuing}} up the Grand Canal, Choe's party reached the LÃ¼liang Rapids on April 13, which interrupted canal {{traffic in the}} northern part of South Zhili. He wrote that a teams of ten oxen were used to pull their boats through the rapids, while teams of 100 men were used at the next stage of river rapids, the Xuzhou Rapids. He noted the pound locks here that controlled water levels in sections of the canal for safe passage of ships. He described the bustling cities of Linqing and Dezhou in the northern <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Shandong,</b> although he stated that the merchant activity and sizes of these two cities did not match the grandeur of Hangzhou and Suzhou in the south. In fact, Choe remarked that only these two and a handful of other cities in northern China matched the prosperity of southern China, stating that the north was quite poverty-stricken and underdeveloped compared with the south. He also believed that southern Chinese displayed a finer degree of cultivation, social order, literacy, and industriousness than those from the north. Choe wrote that while people of the south were well-dressed and had plenty to spare, people in the north often lacked supplies of everything and feared bandits. Brook writes: ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1947, the CPC Politburo {{assigned}} Kang {{to inspect}} land reform {{in his home}} <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Shandong.</b> [...] Early in 1948, he was appointed deputy chief of the Party's East China Bureau, under Rao Shushi. [...] Some commentators speculate that the private humiliation of being placed under a former subordinate {{may be one reason}} why Kang [...] "fell ill" [...] and largely disappeared from view until after Rao's fall in 1954. [...] Of course, Kang may really have been ill. [...] Mao's personal physician, Li Zhisui, later recorded that doctors responsible for Kang's treatment at Beijing Hospital told him that Kang was suffering from schizophrenia. [...] Writing before Li's book was published, Byron and Pack offered other possible diagnoses based on symptoms Kang seems to have displayed, including manic-depressive psychosis and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E

In Shandong, Zhang told a gathering of assembled local officials, [...] "whether it is my relatives, children, friends; if they go to where you are, please do not go out of your way to receive them, do not curry favour with them, and do not offer to do things for them." [...] This was seen as Zhang trying to send a signal that he intended to distance himself from a political culture rife with corruption and complex rules around guanxi. In Shandong, Zhang was known to conduct 'undercover visits' to survey the lives of ordinary people. When Zhang left office, Shandong's GDP had exceeded 2 trillion yuan (~$300 billion), ranking second among provinces in the country.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the bao {{technique}} (...) of stir-frying on a high flame was typical of cuisine from the northern Chinese <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Shandong.</b> The wok is first heated to a dull red glow over a high fire. The oil, seasonings, and meats are then added in rapid succession. The food is continually tossed, stopping only to add other ingredients such as broths, vegetables, or more seasonings. The purpose of Bao is to highlight natural tastes, so minimal seasoning is added. Because of the high heat, bao is ideal for small amounts of food that cook quickly, so the juices do not flow out of the items. Meat is coated with egg white or starch in order to contain the juices. When the food is cooked it is poured and ladled out of the wok. The wok must then be quickly rinsed to prevent food residues from charring and burning to the wok bottom because of residual heat.|$|E
