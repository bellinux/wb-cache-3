The use of the various methods in mapping the state of employment relations, in 'description', is first considered.

In this light, the contributions of the case and variable oriented approaches to explanation, or 'analysis', are assessed. Particular attention is given to the deficiencies of the 'hard science' often confidently presented as the proper vehicle of social research. Finally, a synthetic approach to research in the area is proposed, and the vital role of theoretical pluralism in advancing understanding is stressed...|$|R

40|$|When {{implementing}} a system specified {{as a number}} of layers of abstraction, it is tempting to implement each layer as a process. However, this requires that communication between layers be via asynchnonous inter-process messages. Our experience, especially with implementing network protocols, suggests that asynchronous communication between layers leads to serious performance problems. In <b>place</b> <b>of</b> this <b>structure</b> we propose an implementation methodology which permits synchronous (procedure call) between layers, both when a higher layer invokes a lower layer and in the reverse direction, from lower layer upward. This paper discusses the motivation for this methodology, as well as the pitfalls that accompany it. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the interdependence of}} visual and material cultures {{in the home and}} seeks to understand <b>of</b> the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> mass consumption and mass visual communication in the making of personhood. It brings together the study of the photograph with that of the memento and the collection. Through an eighteen-month ethnography of eighty households in South London, material culture categories and consumer genres are dissolved in favour of exploring the precise relationships between images and objects in the representational, memorial and ancestral practices that establish kinship and friendship, and shape experiences of migration and belonging, death and memory. Cross-cultural comparison sheds light on the themes of inalienability, memory, materiality, reproduction and ancestralisation. In particular, works on photography in non-Western settings have established its ‘other histories’, embedding photography in everyday social and ritual lives. Turning to the Euro-American cultural region, this thesis abandons the search to define the essence of ‘the photograph’, offering instead a guide to the range of practices in which specific types of photographic images and mementos establish the sociality, time and memory of households in Britain. The thesis transforms the photograph as an object of analysis, shifting the gaze from the image-in-itself to its place among the sensuous materials and values of the interior. Secondly, it explores the consequences of the labour that householders invest in the material transformation of memory and experience. This is summarised in the three parts of the thesis as the work of display, collection and dispersal. This perspective develops the theorisation of the mutual implication of images, objects and persons in establishing different forms of knowledge and community, illuminates relations between domestic, museum and consumer landscapes, and allows for the productive convergence of new and established anthropological literatures...|$|R
