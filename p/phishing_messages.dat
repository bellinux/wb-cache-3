5000|$|Targeted {{threats are}} {{a class of}} malware destined for one {{specific}} organization or industry. A type of crimeware, these threats are of particular concern because {{they are designed to}} capture sensitive information. Targeted attacks may include threats delivered via SMTP e-mail, port attacks, zero day attack vulnerability exploits or <b>phishing</b> <b>messages.</b> Government organisations are the most targeted sector. [...] Financial industries are the second most targeted sector, most likely because cybercriminals desire to profit from the confidential, sensitive information the financial industry IT infrastructure houses. Similarly, online brokerage accounts have also been targeted by such attacks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of phishing email messages in a corpus of over 380, 000 <b>phishing</b> <b>messages</b> collected from August 2006 to December 2007. Our first result is a classification of <b>phishing</b> <b>messages</b> into two groups: flash attacks and non-flash attacks. Phishing message producers try to extend the usefulness of a phishing message by reusing the same message. In some cases this is done by sending a large volume of <b>phishing</b> <b>messages</b> over {{a short period of}} time (flash-attack) versus the same phishing message spread over a relatively longer period (nonflash attacks). Our second result is a corresponding classification of phishing features into two groups: transitory features and pervasive features. Features which are present in a few attacks and have a relatively short life span (transitory) are generally strong indicators of phishing, whereas features which are present in most of the attacks and have a long life span (pervasive) are generally weak selectors of phishing. One explanation of this is that phishing message producers limit the utility of transitory features in time (by avoiding them in future generations of phishing) and limit the utility of pervasive features by choosing features that also appear in legitimate messages. While useful in improving the understanding of <b>phishing</b> <b>messages,</b> our results also show the need for further study...|$|E

When contacted about an account needing to be [...] "verified" [...] (or any other topic used by phishers), it is a sensible precaution to contact the company from which the email apparently originates to check that the email is legitimate. Alternatively, the address that the individual knows is the company's genuine website can be typed into the address bar of the browser, rather than trusting any hyperlinks in the suspected <b>phishing</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Email-based online {{phishing}} is {{a critical}} security threat on the Internet. Although phishers have great flexibility in manipulating both the content and structure of phishing emails {{so that they can}} be made as close as possible to legitimate messages, phishers have much less flexibility in concealing the information related to the sender of a <b>phishing</b> <b>message.</b> Such sender-related information is often inconsistent with the target institution of the phishing email, and thus, can help detect phishing emails. In this paper we advocate and develop a sender-centric approach to detecting phishing emails by focusing on the information related to the sender of a message instead of the content or structure of the message. Our evaluation studies based on realworld email traces show that the sender-centric approach is a feasible and effective method in detecting phishing emails. For example, using an email trace consisting of both <b>phishing</b> and legitimate <b>messages,</b> the sender-centric approach can detect 98. 7 % of phishing emails with a zero false positive rate, that is, the approach can correctly classify all legitimate messages while achieving a high detection rate of phishing emails.

40|$|Phishing is {{a growing}} threat to Internet users and causes {{billions of dollars in}} damage every year. In this paper, we present a {{theoretical}} yet practical model to study this threat in a formal manner. While it is folklore knowledge that a successful phishing attack entails creating messages that are indistinguishable from the natural, expected messages by the intended victim, this concept has not been formalized. Our model captures phishing in terms of this indistinguishability between the natural and <b>phishing</b> <b>message</b> distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that places phishing on a concrete theoretical framework and offers a new perspective to analyze this threat. We propose metrics to analyze the success probability of a phishing attack taking into account the input used by a phisher and the work involved to create deceptive email messages. Finally, we describe and study a new class of phishing attacks called collaborative spear phishing that may stem from the latest threat posed by the Epsilon email breach in the recent past and point out fundamental flaws in the current email-based marketing business model. In this sense, our study is very timely and presents new and emerging trends in phishing...|$|R
40|$|Current {{approaches}} ofÂ  phishing filters {{depend on}} classifying messages based on textually discernable {{features such as}} IP-based URLs or domain names as those features {{that can be easily}} extracted from a given phishing message. However, in the same sense, those easily perceptible features can be easily manipulated by sophisticated phishers. Therefore, it is important that universal patterns of <b>phishing</b> <b>messages</b> should be identified for feature extraction to serve as a basis for text classification. In this paper, we demonstrate that user perception regarding phishing message can be identified in central and peripheral routes of information processing. We also present a method of formulating quantitative model that can represent persuasive information structure in <b>phishing</b> <b>messages.</b> This paper makes contribution to phishing classification research by presenting the idea of universal information structure in terms of persuasive communication theories. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to report on research to construct a model, which should provide guidance to an organization on how to address all dimensions associated with phishing and assist in solving the problem holistically. The emphasis will be placed on the human and organizational dimensions. Most research in this area has shown that only certain dimensions used to combat phishing attacks, in an organization, are addressed in isolation and not holistically. Anti-phishing research literature studied has either focused on algorithms for detecting phishing attacks in web browsers (Egelman, 2008; Fette, 2007; Garera, 2007; Patel, 2007) or on evaluating the user interfaces of anti-phishing web browser toolbars (Wu, 2006). From research studied, there has been little work conducted on preventing users from falling for <b>phishing</b> email <b>messages.</b> It has been proven that phishing does indeed pose an ongoing threat to an organization through its employees. Therefore, a suitable solution to this problem should be devised. This paper attempts to present such a holistic solution in the form of a model...|$|R

We then consider future modes of attack, specifically looking at combining the phenomenon of <b>phishing</b> (sending unsolicited <b>messages</b> by email, post or phone to trick users into divulging their account details) with chip card sabotage. Our proposed attacks exploit covert channels through the payments network to allow sabotaged cards to signal back their PINS.

Two potential approaches to disabling a phishing site are (1) {{to eliminate the}} required DNS records to reach the site and (2) to remove the site from the machine itself. While previous work has focused on DNS take-down efforts, we focus on determining how long a phishing site remains on a machine after the DNS records have been removed. We find that on the day a site is reported, as many as 56 % of phishing sites remain present on the hosting machines even after the DNS records have been removed. While many of these sites are removed within a few days, the DNS caching behavior at ISP resolvers may preserve the phishing site accessibility until the phishing site itself is completely removed. 1...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} derive and examine a multidimensional definition of information security awareness, investigate its antecedents, and analyze {{its effects on}} compliance with organizational information security policies. The above research goals are tested through the theoretical lens of technology threat avoidance theory and protection motivation theory. Information security awareness {{is defined as a}} second-order construct composed of the elements of threat and coping appraisals supplemented by the responsibilities construct to account for organizational environment. The study is executed in two stages. First, the participants (employees of a municipality) are exposed to a series of <b>phishing</b> and spear-phishing <b>messages</b> to assess if there are any common characteristics shared by the phishing victims. The differences between the phished and the not phished group are assessed through multiple discriminant analysis. Second, the same individuals are asked to participate in a survey designed to examine their security awareness. The research model is tested using PLS-SEM approach. The results indicate that security awareness is in fact a second-order formative construct composed of six components. There are significant differences in security awareness levels between the victims of the phishing experiment and the employees who maintain compliance with security policies. The study extends the theory by proposing and validating a universal definition of security awareness. It provides practitioners with an instrument to examine awareness in a plethora of settings and design customized security training activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss a}} classification-based {{approach}} for filtering phish-ing messages {{in an e-mail}} stream. Upon arrival, various features of every e-mail are extracted. This forms {{the basis of a}} classification process which detects potentially harmful <b>phishing</b> <b>messages.</b> We introduce various new features for identifying phishing e-mail and rank established as well as newly introduced features according to their significance for this classi-fication problem. Moreover, in contrast to classical binary classification approaches (spam vs. not spam), a more refined ternary classification ap-proach for filtering e-mail data is investigated which automatically distin-guishes three message types: ham (solicited e-mail), spam, and phishing. Experiments with representative data sets illustrate that our approach yields significantly better classification results than existing phishing de-tection methods. Moreover, the direct ternary classification proposed is compared to a sequence of two binary classification processes. Direct one-step ternary classification is not only more efficient, but is also shown to achieve better accuracy than repeated binary classification. ...|$|E

We harvested URLs linking to web sites from dierent sources and corpora, and conducted a study to examine these URLs in-depth. For each URL, we extract its domain name, determine its frequency, IP address and geographic location, and check if the web site is accessible. Using 3 search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live), we check if the domain name appears in the search results; and using McAfee SiteAdvisor, we determine the domain name's safety rating. Our study shows that users can encounter URLs pointing to fraudulent and malicious web sites not only in spam and <b>phishing</b> <b>messages</b> but in legitimate email messages and the top search results returned by search engines. To provide better countermeasures against these threats, we present a proxy-based approach to dynamically block access to fraudulent and malicious web sites based on the safety ratings set by McAfee SiteAdvisor...|$|E
40|$|User ignorance {{towards the}} use of {{communication}} services like Instant Messengers, emails, websites, social networks etc. is becoming the biggest advantage for phishers. It is required to create technical awareness in users by educating them to create a phishing detection application which would generate phishing alerts for the user so that <b>phishing</b> <b>messages</b> are not ignored. The lack of basic security features to detect and prevent phishing has {{had a profound effect}} on the IM clients, as they lose their faith in e-banking and e-commerce transactions, which will have a disastrous impact on the corporate and banking sectors and businesses which rely heavily on the internet. Very little research contributions were available in for phishing detection in Instant messengers. A context based, dynamic and intelligent phishing detection methodology in IMs is proposed, to analyze and detect phishing in Instant Messages with relevance to domain ontology (OBIE) and utilizes the Classification based on Association (CBA) for generating phishing rules and alerting the victims. A PDS Monitoring system algorithm is used to identify the phishing activity during exchange of messages in IMs, with high ratio of precision and recall. The results have shown improvement by the increased percentage of precision and recall when compared to the existing methods. Comment: 20 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Computer users often behave insecurely, and do {{not take}} the {{precautions}} they ought to. One reads almost daily about people not protecting their devices, not making backups and falling for <b>phishing</b> <b>messages.</b> This impacts all of society since people increasingly carry a computer in their pockets: their smartphones. It could be that smartphone owners simply do not know enough about security threats or precautions. To address this, many official bodies publish advice online. For such a broadcast-type educational approach to work, two assumptions must be satisfied. The first is that people will deliberately seek out security-related information {{and the second is}} that they will consult official sources to satisfy their information needs. Assumptions such as these ought to be verified, especially with the numbers of cyber attacks on the rise. It was decided to explore the validity of these assumptions by surveying students at a South African university, including both Computer Science and Non-Computer Science students. The intention was to explore levels of awareness of Smartphone security practice, the sources of advice the students used, and the impact of a Computer Science education on awareness and information seeking behaviours.

40|$|In recent years, {{mobile phones}} have evolved from {{supporting}} only telephonic functions to supporting multiple features, ranging from capturing and playing digital media, to e-mail access, to e-banking [10, 11], to remote access to personal files. As {{the capabilities of}} mobile phones increased, the threat of more and more malicious software (malware) targeting them also increased. It is widely believed that the evolution of malware for mobile devices will take a similar direction as the evolution of PC malwares.

Many critical operations such as financial transactions, online selling and buying of goods are being done excessively through mobiles. Therefore security {{is one of the}} most important issues to be considered for mobiles. The security issues of mobile phones is very much similar to the ones that arise with the PCs. Open platforms are becoming popular in Smartphones, for example the Symbian Operating System is used in millions of mobile phones.

However, potential harm from future malware can be severer in the form of handset downtime, service disruption due to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and theft of sensitive data on the device.
