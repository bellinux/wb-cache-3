40|$|ABSTRACT: Considering the {{importance}} of cassava starch for Brazilian industries, the current work aimed at evaluating the effects of extrusion parameters on the physical characteristics, mainly viscosity properties of extruded cassava starch. A factorial central composite design (23) with three independent variables and the response surface methodology were {{used to evaluate the}} results of expansion index, specific volume, water absorption index, water solubility index, color and paste properties, according to the variations in the moisture content, barrel temperature and screw speed. Results indicated that barrel temperature influenced the expansion index, specific volume, water absorption index, all the color parameters, the initial viscosity, peak and final viscosity. Feed moisture influenced the specific volume, color parameters, final viscosity and retrogradation. The screw speed had effects on water absorption index, color components {{as well as on the}} final viscosity and retrogradation of extruded starch. High moisture, low screw speed and intermediate temperature provided lower starch degradation, which is desirable for <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>starch...</b>|$|E
