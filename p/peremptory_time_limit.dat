The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Two looks at the extension of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three deals with the interruption of time [...] ...|$|R

Five issues were related to program implementation: deciding on phase-in strategies, conveying the time-limit message, tracking the clock, determining when exemptions apply, and handling cases that reach the <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> Early findings on whether <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> make a difference were as follows: Florida and Vermont {{found no evidence that}} <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> reduced the number of applicants who went on to receive benefits; all four programs for which employment data wer...|$|R

40|$|A {{consensus}} {{has formed}} in the welfare reform literature suggesting that welfare eligible households (WEH) “bank ” benefits {{in the presence of}} <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> either by delaying enrollment in welfare or exiting well before the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is reached. In this study, we use the standard labor-leisure lifetime utility to analyze the behavioral effects of imposing <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> on welfare use. Our approach is different from our predecessors (which model welfare participation) in that we model delayed enrollment in and early exit from welfare. Our results suggest that prior to <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> WEH enroll in welfare as soon as eligibility is established and remain on assistance programs until their youngest children reach adulthood. Moreover, <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> do not alter this behavior in WEH with older children. As such, being “forward looking ” in an era of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> is not a sufficient condition for banking welfare benefits...|$|R

Results showed that different <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> affected total recall, but not main ideas recalled. Regardless of proficiency level, the 20 -minute group (Group 2) recalled a greater number of idea units than the 8 -minute group (Group 1). However, no significant difference was found between Groups 1 and 2 regarding the recall of main ideas, although a longer time period of reading was given for Group 2. Furthermore, irrespective of differences in <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> the high-proficiency students recalled the overall text and main ideas of paragraphs better than the lowproficiency students. However, the lack of interaction between <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and proficiency level in terms of total recall, and the recall of main ideas as well as paragraph recall indicated that differing <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> did not affect the differences between the high- and low-proficiency students in the following: 1) the total number of idea units recalled; 2) the recall of main ideas; and 3) paragraph recall.

40|$|ABSTRACT Key {{provisions}} of the Texas TANF waiver, Achieving Change for Texans (ACT), allowed the state to implement variable <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> sanctions, and geographically-targeted work assistance programs. An innovative aspect of ACT was the provision that the state's variable <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> did not begin until a case was notified of an available slot in the job assistance program. Thus, state <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> were directly linked with the provision ofjob services while sanction penalties were applicable to the entire caseload. In this paper, we examine the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and sanction effects on the duration of cash assistance for all families that entered the caseload from January 1997 to September 1999. The findings suggest that nonrnetropolitan families {{are more likely to}} be sanctioned and have longer spell durations than metropolitan families.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} changes {{brought about by the}} Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) is the imposition of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> In this paper, we analyze a simple model in which a potential welfare recipient chooses how to allocate her time-limited endowment of benefits so as to maximize her expected lifetime utility. Not surprisingly, the model reveals that <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> provide an incentive for the consumer to conserve, or bank, her benefits. More interesting is the prediction that these incentives to conserve one's benefits vary inversely with the age of the youngest child in one's family. This implies that the reduction in welfare payments that results from PRWORA will fall disproportionately on families with young children. We estimate age group-specific effects of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> and test the prediction of the model using data from a welfare reform demonstration in Florida. Subject to some assumptions that are necessary to distinguish the effects of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> from the effects of other provisions of the demonstration, we find that <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> indeed reduce welfare use by the greatest amount among the families with the youngest children. Moreover, <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> have substantial effects on welfare utilization, reducing monthly utilization probabilities by 19 percent. <b>Time</b> <b>limits</b> lead families to exit the welfare rolls well before they exhaust their benefits, suggesting that welfare mothers are rational in the sense of being forward-looking. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{whether a}} five-year <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on welfare participation encourages behaviors {{that lead to}} less reliance on public assistance. Using a dynamic discrete choice model, it describes young women 2 ̆ 7 s decisions about childbearing, schooling, working and welfare participation over time. The parameters underlying these decisions are estimated by fitting the model to data on observed choices obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Estimation is done using a simulated maximum likelihood procedure. Parameter estimates are used to simulate choices under current policy and under a policy of a five-year <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on welfare participation. This provides a way of assessing effects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> The results suggest that a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> has {{a significant impact on}} the behavior of those at highest risk for welfare participation. When faced with a <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> they have fewer children, work and attend school more and rely on less welfare. In fact, a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> leads to shorter-term welfare participation, apart from the purely 2 ̆ 2 mechanical 2 ̆ 2 effect of making long-term recipients categorically ineligible. Thus a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> does encourage self-sufficiency in the sense that individuals rely more on other sources of support. At the same time, it appears that the shift occurs towards sources of support other than full-time work to a greater extent than towards full-time school attendance or full-time work. ...|$|R
40|$|The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity and Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 {{dramatically}} {{altered the}} social safety net. The federal legislation ended cash assistance as an entitlement program, shifted the funding stream to state block grants, and introduced <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> for individuals receiving cash assistance. According to federal guidelines, persons {{may not receive}} cash assistance for more than 60 months. Although states possess the option of implementing shorter <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> Missouri, like many other states, adopted the federal guidelines of 60 months. Other states varied on both {{the length of a}} periodic <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and the lifetime limit. Arizona, for example, does not have a lifetime limit but does not allow for more than 24 months of cash assistance within a 60 month period of time. Because of these variations in guidelines, the largest number of cases closed due to <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> are concentrated in states with shorter <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> such as Connecticut (21 months), Idaho (24 months), and Utah (36 months).
