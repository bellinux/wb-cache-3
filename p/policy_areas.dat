5|$|In February 2011, King's College London {{students}} founded London's first student-led think tank, the King’s Think Tank (formerly {{known as}} KCL Think Tank). With a membership {{of more than}} 2000, {{it is the largest}} organisation of its kind in Europe. This student initiative organises lectures and discussions in seven different <b>policy</b> <b>areas,</b> and assists students in lobbying politicians, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other policymakers with their ideas. Every September, it produces a peer-reviewed journal of policy recommendations called The Spectrum.|$|E
25|$|The {{programme}} also {{consists of}} a new category of projects, jointly funded integrated projects, which will operate on a large territorial scale. These projects will aim to implement environmental and climate policy and to better integrate such policy aims into other <b>policy</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Treaty of Amsterdam {{transferred}} {{responsibility for}} {{free movement of}} persons (e.g., visas, illegal immigration, asylum) from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) pillar to the European Community (JHA was renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCC) as a result). Both Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice also extended codecision procedure to nearly all <b>policy</b> <b>areas,</b> giving Parliament equal power to the Council in the Community.|$|E
25|$|EU {{member states}} retain all powers not {{explicitly}} handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are {{areas in which}} member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate {{to the extent to}} which the EU has not. In other <b>policy</b> <b>areas</b> the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.|$|E

Located in Washington, D.C., the nonpartisan Center works with academics, experts, and policymakers in order to create proposals for these 21st century issues. The Center works to highlight these specific topics and their implications, as well as educating the public on them.

25|$|Prominent changes {{included}} {{the move from}} unanimity to qualified majority voting in at least 45 <b>policy</b> <b>areas</b> in the Council of Ministers, a change in calculating such a majority to a new double majority, a more powerful European Parliament forming a bicameral legislature alongside the Council of Ministers under the ordinary legislative procedure, a consolidated legal personality for the EU {{and the creation of}} a long-term President of the European Council and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The Treaty also made the Union's bill of rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, legally binding. The Treaty for the first time gave member states the explicit legal right to leave the EU and the procedure to do so.|$|E
25|$|The EU traces {{its origins}} from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome. The {{original}} members of {{what came to}} be known as the European Communities, were the Inner Six; Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. The Communities and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of <b>policy</b> <b>areas</b> to its remit. While no member state has left the EU or its antecedent organisations, the United Kingdom enacted the result of a membership referendum in June 2016 and is currently negotiating its withdrawal. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union in 1993 and introduced European citizenship. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.|$|E

25|$|One of the Conservatives' key <b>policy</b> <b>areas</b> of 2010 was {{to reduce}} the number of people in the UK {{claiming}} state benefits, and increase the number of people in the workforce. They have stated that all those in the UK claiming incapacity benefit will face a review of their cases. Until 1999, Conservatives opposed the creation of a national minimum wage, citing that they believed it would cost jobs, and businesses would be reluctant to start business in the UK from fear of high labour costs. However the party have since pledged support and in the July 2015 budget, Chancellor George Osborne announced a national living wage of £9/hour, to be introduced by 2020, for those aged 25 and over. They support, and have implemented, the restoration of the link between pensions and earnings, and seek to raise retirement age from 65 to 66.|$|E

500|$|New Labour was {{influenced}} by the political thinking of Anthony Crosland, the leadership of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell's media campaigning. The political philosophy of New Labour {{was influenced}} by the party's development of Anthony Giddens' [...] "Third Way", which attempted to provide a synthesis between capitalism and socialism. The party emphasised the importance of social justice, rather than equality, emphasising the need for equality of opportunity, and believed in the use of free markets to deliver economic efficiency and social justice. In 2002, Giddens named spin as New Labour's biggest failure, but commended the party's success in certain <b>policy</b> <b>areas</b> and at marginalising the Conservative Party.|$|E

The meetings are small and give students opportunity to ask questions about the <b>policy</b> <b>area.</b> Students are required to attend one dialogue per year.|$|R
500|$|The 2009 Lisbon Treaty brought {{nearly all}} <b>policy</b> <b>areas</b> (including the budget) under the codecision {{procedure}} (renamed [...] "ordinary legislative procedure"), hence increasing {{the power of}} the Parliament. The rules for the distribution of seats in the parliament were also changed to a formula system. The High Representative merged with the European Commissioner for External Relations and joined the Commission. The appointment of the Commission President became dependent upon the last EU elections. The Council of Ministers adopted more qualified majority voting and the European Council was made a distinct institution with a permanent president. The Court of Justice had some minor renaming and adjustments. In addition, the central bank became a full institution.|$|E
500|$|The {{ordinary}} {{legislative procedure}} is used in nearly all <b>policy</b> <b>areas</b> and provides an equal footing between the two bodies. Under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. They then send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a [...] "common position". That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament. If the Council does not approve those, then a [...] "Conciliation Committee" [...] is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus {{an equal number of}} MEPs who seek to agree a common position. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament again by an absolute majority. There are other special procedures used in sensitive areas which reduce the power of Parliament.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{spoke of}} a need to {{recognise}} [...] "that Scottish politics has changed and it can't be business as usual." [...] <b>Policy</b> <b>areas</b> she intended to focus on included improvements in employment, housing, and public services, which she said were [...] "prevented for too many by wealth being held {{in the hands of}} a minority." [...] She also spoke of reaching out to people she claimed had [...] "abandoned hope in Labour" [...] or voted for independence, and said that the party needed to [...] "take a new path" [...] because people wanted social and economic change, which previous Labour governments had not delivered. Among the policies she supported were renationalisation of the railways, introducing free childcare for children over the age of twelve months, introducing a living wage, and the abolition of both the Trident programme and student tuition fees. She also claimed that Labour in Scotland had [...] "been taken to the political abyss" [...] by [...] "New Labour and its architects". She claimed that Labour would find it harder to be re-elected unless she was chosen as its deputy leader.|$|E

500|$|Since the {{institution}} {{is composed of}} national leaders, it gathers the executive power of the member states and has thus a great influence in high-profile <b>policy</b> <b>areas</b> as for example foreign policy. It also exercises powers of appointment, such as appointment of its own President, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the President of the European Central Bank. It proposes, to the European Parliament, a candidate for President of the European Commission. Moreover, the European Council influences police and justice planning, {{the composition of the}} Commission, matters relating to the organisation of the rotating Council presidency, the suspension of membership rights, and changing the voting systems through the Passerelle Clause. Although the European Council has no direct legislative power, under the [...] "emergency brake" [...] procedure, a state outvoted in the Council of Ministers may refer contentious legislation to the European Council. However, the state may still be outvoted in the European Council. Hence with powers over the supranational executive of the EU, in addition to its other powers, the European Council has been described by some as the Union's [...] "supreme political authority".|$|E
500|$|In the 1991 general election, the Vlaams Blok for {{the first}} time surpassed the People's Union, going from two to 12 seats in the Chamber, and from one to five seats in the Senate, in what was {{afterwards}} referred to by its opponents as [...] "Black Sunday". In the following years, the party saw a systematic upwards trend in all elections it participated in. In July 1992, the first Vlaams Blok motion was accepted in the Flemish Parliament, which rejected the right of francophone inhabitants in Flemish Brabant and Voeren to vote for Wallon institutions. In late 1992, it was announced that [...] Neel, a popular Antwerp city councillor for 22 years for the Socialist Party went over to the Vlaams Blok, thereby causing the SP and CVP to lose their majority in the city council. In 1992, the party ideologue Filip Dewinter and chairman Karel Dillen established the party's comprehensive immigration program, titled the 70-point plan. The plan sought to close the borders towards non-European immigrants, gradually repatriate those already in the country, and implement an [...] "own people first" [...] principle in all <b>policy</b> <b>areas.</b> Over the course of the 1990s, the party however increasingly distanced itself from the plan as it had alienated the party from gaining political influence, until it was finally officially discarded in 2000.|$|E

30|$|Studying {{the effects}} of crisis and {{representations}} of crisis on the <b>policy</b> <b>area</b> of immigrant incorporation is therefore urgently needed in contemporary migration scholarship, and this mini-symposium represents a step forward in this area. Crisis and representations of crisis can provide a rupture for ways of working, stretch existing resources, alter the priorities of policymakers, and trigger the transformation of existing practices. Over the past decades, the <b>policy</b> <b>area</b> of immigrant incorporation has experienced a number of conceptual changes, and some adaptations of resources and practices, often based on a discourse of crisis. Yet, overall, this <b>policy</b> <b>area</b> has become increasingly established and many European countries today, for example, have a dedicated ministry working on immigrant policy. Also, the greater value ascribed to this <b>policy</b> <b>area</b> {{is reflected in the}} various exchanges organised across cities and countries on immigrant incorporation. All this points to the consolidation of a policy field and it is unclear how recurrent crisis and representations of crisis are correlated to such patterns of institutionalisation and path-dependency. Recent cuts to human resources and the dismantling of institutional structures dedicated to immigrant and diversity policies provide a puzzle that calls for investigations into the ways in which different representations of crises play a role in shaping immigrant incorporation efforts.|$|R
40|$|This thesis makes a {{comparative}} study of local government autonomy in Britain and Sweden within the local economic development <b>policy</b> <b>area.</b> It argues for local government autonomy to be viewed {{in terms of both}} a vertical dimension concerning local government's autonomy vis-à-vis national government (national context) and a horizontal dimension relating to its autonomy vis-à-vis local social and economic forces (local context). A <b>policy</b> <b>area</b> approach is advocated as the strength of, and the balance between, factors influencing local government autonomy, both vertically and horizontally, may be modified by the particular characteristics of the <b>policy</b> <b>area.</b> For example, the local economic development <b>policy</b> <b>area</b> is characterized as a grey zone respecting the intergovernmental relationship and a "mixed-economy" concerning the public-private sector relationship. The concept of autonomy is distinguished into policy-making independence (measured as local authority cooperation with other actors in economic development policies) and capacity for action (measured in terms of four local authority roles in the local economy). These are tested empirically regarding the influence of the local context and the relationship between them examined. The dominant trend in both countries is that the more local authorities intervene in the local economy (extend their capacity for action), the greater their cooperation with other actors (the more restricted their policy-making independence). digitalisering@um...|$|R
