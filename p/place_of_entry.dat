In accepting the award on October 12, 1988, Morrison said,"that 'there is no suitable memorial or plaque or wreath or wall or park or skyscraper lobby'" [...] honoring {{the memory of the}} human beings forced into slavery and brought to the United States. 'There’s no small bench by the road,' she continued. 'And because such a place doesn’t exist (that I know of), the book had to.' Inspired by her remarks, the Toni Morrison Society began to install benches at significant sites in the history of slavery in America.

Morrison said she was extremely moved by the memorial. In 2017 the 21st bench was placed at the Library of Congress.

The Key will open any hinged door with a pin tumbler lock anywhere in the world, turning that door into a portal accessing the Room regardless of where it would normally open into.

When exiting the Room, its door opens not necessarily to the original <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> but to any room the holder of the Key has in mind, or to a random room if the user does not focus. To reach a specific room the user must have a clear picture of the room's door and the area around it. The [...] "Lost" [...] Room thus serves as a means of instant travel between similar doors anywhere on Earth. Hinged doors with types of locks other than a tumbler lock or with no lock at all, sliding doors and rotating doors cannot be used to access the Room. The door used does not have to be installed in a wall and can be a smaller prop door or a freestanding doorway; the only important elements are the lock and that it be a hinged door.|$|E

40|$|A good {{predictor}} {{of a domestic}} burglary is whether the property suffered a prior victimization. Using officially reported burglaries, most houses appear to be victimized once and most repeat victims suffer twice only. Defining high-risk properties by waiting for the second burglary has its operational limitations. A police database of burglaries over 45 months is examined to explore whether the modus operandi distinguishes houses burgled once only, from those suffering a revictimization. The use of force, searching behaviour, type of property, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> place of exit, alarm activation and use of a bogus official method of entry are discriminating features. Comparing non-repeats with ‘quick’ Repeats (ie within 365 days), searching behaviour, type of property, entry method and a bogus official strategy are discriminating features. Survival analyses on the latter group reveals that ramming and removing glass are significantly associated with being revictimized sooner rather than later. Conversely, exit via a window indicates a longer period to revictimization. The findings demonstrate the value of crime scene information held by the police and, when guided by an appropriate criminological or operational framework, the benefits of more substantive analyses to prevention and detection initiatives...|$|E
40|$|The urethra is {{the main}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> for sexually {{transmitted}} pathogens. However, there is little literature on the morphology of the urogenital system, principally the urethra and ducts of the sex accessory glands. The Mongolian gerbil is an insectivorous, herbivorous and monogamous rodent with nocturnal habits; {{it has been used}} successfully as a laboratory animal since the 1960 s. Therefore, the objective of the present paper was to describe the structure and ultrastructure of the urethra and its relations to the ducts of the accessory sex glands of the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus), contributing {{to the understanding of the}} reproductive biology of the rodent and aiming to provide data for future experimental studies. Conventional techniques of light and scanning electron microscopy were utilized. The urethra and ducts of the accessory sex glands are similar to those of the albino rat and the mouse. However, there is variation in drainage type among accessory sex glands for the inner urethra. The ducts of the seminal vesicle, the ductus deferens, drain their contents independently into the ampullary duct that opens in the urethra. The ducts of the prostate, coagulating and bulbourethral glands drain their contents independently into the urethra...|$|E

40|$|Stiles and Crawford showed over 75 {{years ago}} that the {{sensitivity}} of the retina varies with the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> of the light into the pupil, and thus with the direction of incidence of light upon the retina. The effect is a property of the cones. Rods have a very limited directional sensitivity with a common centre of symmetry with the hotopic SC-function. One reason, amongst others, for the existence of the Stiles–Crawford effect {{is supposed to be the}} suppression of stray light in the ocular media. The light from, for example, the sun or the bright sky, will be scattered in the ocular media, and cause a haze over the visual scene, thereby decreasing contrast. Thanks to the Stiles–Crawford effect, this scattered light will not be perceived. In order to judge the weight, with respect to other reasons, of this stray light theory, a quantitative study of the amount of stray light is required. This suggestion is based on indications that the scattering in the ocular media is mainly forward scattering, and that stray light coming from the retina seems not to contribute much either. Indirect evidence in favour of the stray light hypothesis is that in nighttime conditions, the visual surround is dark, disturbing stray light does not exist, and the rods therefore do not need directional sensitivity. This is indeed the case, and therefore the pupil size is fully used for the few incoming light quanta. At mesopic levels, the disturbing effects of a large pupil, such as spherical and chromatic aberrations, will be limited for the cones by their directional sensitivity, in the same way as a small pupil does at high luminance levels. It is therefore proposed to consider the directional sensitivity of cones as a virtual pupil...|$|E
