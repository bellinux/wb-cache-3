40|$|Abstract—A novel <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> <b>control</b> {{scheme for}} {{high-power}} gate-turn-off thyristor current-source converters is proposed in this paper. Using both feedforward and feedback control tech-niques, the proposed scheme guarantees that the input power factor of the converter {{can be kept}} at unity or a maximum achievable value. Another feature of this scheme is parameter insensitive, that is, variations in the line and load impedance or changes in the filter capacitor size will not affect the process of tracking the maximum input power factor. No parameters in the control scheme should be adjusted to accommodate such variations or changes. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the operating principle of the scheme.

In this work, the <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> (∈[0, 1]) is evaluated based on three parameters namely: average transmit power, coverage probability and average rate. In other words, we evaluate <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> such that average transmit power should be low, coverage probability of cell-edge users should be high and also average rate over all the uplink users should be high. We show through numerical studies that the <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> should be close to 0. 5 in order to achieve an acceptable trade-off between these three parameters.

40|$|Operating the {{automatic}} voltage regulator (AVR) of a water turbine-driven synchronous generator in constant power factor mode may lead to excessive voltage variations. Depending on {{the capacity of the}} hydro-generator and the inherent voltage variation in the network, operating in constant voltage mode may lead the machine and AVR into excess excitation and shut-down or failure. Furthermore, network operators need not accept this method of operation, since an unconstrained machine may attempt to define voltages that will conflict with their automatic voltage control equipment.
