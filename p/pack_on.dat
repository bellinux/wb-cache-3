Meanwhile, the Canadian national junior team wanted the Rangers to loan him to them for the 2000 World Junior Championships.

5|$|According to Haga, the story's main {{theme was}} saving Elena from the curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was {{kept to a minimum}} so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman {{who did not want to}} be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large <b>pack</b> <b>on</b> their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E

The film was released once again as a 2-disc Platinum Edition DVD on October 2, 2007 to commemorate its 40th anniversary.

The second Disney DVD release and final issue in the VHS format premiered {{as part of the}} Walt Disney Gold Classics Collection VHS/DVD line on March 7, 2000. A special edition VHS and DVD of the film was released in the United Kingdom on March 3, 2003. The fourth DVD release and first Blu-ray Disc release (the second Blu-ray in the Walt Disney Platinum Editions series) was released on March 10, 2009. Like the 2008 Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray release, the Pinocchio Blu-ray package featured a new restoration by Lowry Digital in a two-disc Blu-ray set, with a bonus DVD version of the film also included.

5|$|On {{release of}} Guitar Hero 5, 35 {{of the songs}} from World Tour and 21 from Smash Hits are importable into Guitar Hero 5 for a small fee (approximately $0.10 per song), and are treated as {{downloadable}} content for the game playable in all game modes; the World Tour export was available on release, while the Smash Hits export was available a few days afterwards. Furthermore, 61 of the 65 tracks from Band Hero are importable into Guitar Hero 5. All transferred songs are also playable in Band Hero. However, Guitar Hero 5 is not backwards-compatible with World Tour. The transfer process requires the player to enter a unique code from the World Tour or Smash Hits manual {{to be able to}} redownload available songs in a <b>pack</b> (<b>on</b> the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3) or individual songs (on the Wii) that have been updated to include the new features. Players on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 can delete individual songs after downloading the pack. Some songs are not transferable because of licensing issues—not technical issues—according to Bright. Tim Riley, the head of music licensing at Activision, stated that the company will continue to seek licenses for more songs from previous games and downloadable content to be exported into Guitar Hero 5, but cannot guarantee that these songs will be licensed for future Guitar Hero games. While reviewers appreciated Activision's efforts to allow the importing of songs from previous games, they felt that the small number of tracks that were available at launch was at odds with the impression that Activision had made of the process before the game's release.|$|E
