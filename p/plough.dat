5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden <b>plough</b> the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the <b>plough</b> and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and <b>plough</b> with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. If basal-water {{discharge}} {{and pressure}} are sufficiently high, a soft-bedded glacier will slip over its bed by <b>ploughing,</b> {{the process in}} which particles that span the ice–bed interface are dragged across the bed surface. Results of laboratory experiments indicate that resistance to <b>ploughing</b> can decrease with increasing <b>ploughing</b> velocity (velocity weakening). During <b>ploughing</b> at various velocities (15 – 400 ma– 1), till was compacted in front of idealized particles, causing pore pressures there that were orders of magnitude higher than the ambient value. This excess pore pressure locally weakened the till in shear, thereby decreasing <b>ploughing</b> resistance {{by a factor of}} 3. 0 – 6. 6 with a six-fold increase in <b>ploughing</b> velocity. Characteristic timescales of pore-pressure diffusion and compaction down-glacier from <b>ploughing</b> particles depend on till diffusivity, <b>ploughing</b> velocity and sizes of <b>ploughing</b> particles. These timescales accurately predict the ranges of these variables over which excess pore pressure and velocity weakening occurred. Existing <b>ploughing</b> models do not account for velocity weakening. A new <b>ploughing</b> model with no adjustable parameters predicts <b>ploughing</b> resistance to no worse than 38 % but requires that excess pore pressures be measured. Velocity weakening by this mechanism may affect fast glacier flow, sediment transport by bed deformation and basal seismicity. 1...|$|R

The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of <b>ploughing</b> reduction on the structure and composition of adult carabid beetle communities. Three soil treatments, normal <b>ploughing,</b> light <b>ploughing</b> and no <b>ploughing,</b> were applied in four kinds of crop. Carabid beetles were sampled weekly using pitfall traps.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of soil tillage depth is {{of special interest}} in organic farming. However, shallow <b>ploughing</b> often results in higher weed abundances in comparison to deep <b>ploughing.</b> Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate whether the high weed suppressive ability of spring and winter pea-cereal intercrops can compensate for the higher weed growth in shallow <b>ploughing</b> compared to deep <b>ploughing</b> in organic farming. Peas and cereals were grown as sole crops and intercrops under shallow and deep <b>ploughing</b> in experiments on a sandy loam soil in Northern Germany in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats, semi-leafless winter peas-triticale and regular-leaf type winter peas-triticale intercrops were examined. At harvest, weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless spring and winter pea sole crops under deep <b>ploughing</b> were slightly higher than those of the corresponding intercrops under shallow <b>ploughing.</b> Whereas weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless winter peas-triticale intercrops under deep <b>ploughing</b> was comparable to shallow <b>ploughing,</b> the cultivation of spring peas-oats intercrops under shallow <b>ploughing</b> led to a significantly higher weed growth than did deep <b>ploughing.</b> The regular-leaf type winter pea grown as a sole crop, or an intercrop with triticale, showed a higher weed suppressive ability than the semi-leafless peas. The tillage system had no significant influence on the weed infestation of sole and intercropped regular-leaf type winter peas. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats and winter peas-triticale intercrops could compensate for weed infestation differences under shallow <b>ploughing</b> compared to the corresponding pea sole crops under deep <b>ploughing.</b> Due to the high weed suppressive ability of regular-leaf type winter peas, shallow <b>ploughing</b> and deep <b>ploughing,</b> as well as sole cropping and intercropping, led to comparable weed infestation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is a {{challenging}} task to avoid <b>ploughing</b> effects in micro-milling. When one tooth of {{the cutting tool}} crosses the minimum chip thickness boundary, the tool would enter into the <b>ploughing</b> zone with no chip formation. Therefore, it is significant to predict the <b>ploughing</b> volume and forces in micro-milling. In this work, the <b>ploughing</b> mechanism for micro-milling is proposed by considering the minimum chip thickness effects. A 3 D chip geometry is developed to calculate chip thickness, <b>ploughing</b> volume and <b>ploughing</b> forces in micro 5 -axis flat-end milling with a flat-end mill. The local parallel sliced tool based method is then applied to get cutter-workpiece engagement domain where the cutting flutes entry and exit the workpiece, minimum chip thickness and depth of cut are required to predict <b>ploughing</b> forces. Local parallel sliced method divides the cutting tool into several slices that are perpendicular to the tool axis along the local coordinate system. On each layer, the removal chip area is dividing into <b>ploughing</b> zone and shearing zone by the minimum chip thickness. <b>Ploughing</b> zone is the area as chip thickness {{is less than the}} minimum chip thickness. In the shearing zone, chip thickness is larger than the minimum chip thickness. The total chip <b>ploughing</b> volume is obtained by adding all <b>ploughing</b> area along axial direction...|$|R

The burying depth of the litter (13 vs 25 cm) affected the decomposition rate of barely straw more than the different <b>ploughing</b> depths (13 vs 25 cm). From our results we suggest that slowly decomposable organic matter, such as leached barley straw, may be incorporated deeply by <b>ploughing</b> in organic cereal production systems, in order to regulate perennial weeds. In soils with good structure and porosity, the decomposition rate of straw can even be larger with deep <b>ploughing.</b> In dense, clayey soils {{it is important to be}} very accurate in <b>ploughing</b> time in order to secure that the <b>ploughing</b> is in fact loosening the soil.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the impact of different management systems of grass-clover (various cutting and/or mulching combinations) and date of <b>ploughing</b> (autumn or spring) {{on the fate of}} nitrogen (N) and the yield of succeeding wheat.

When <b>ploughed</b> in spring, treatments with frequent cutting and/or mulching induced nitrate leaching below the critical value. In contrast, losses from swards mulched only once were considerably above the threshold value, independently of <b>ploughing</b> time. With swards mulched and <b>ploughed</b> in autumn, nitrate concentrations exceed the EC-limit.
