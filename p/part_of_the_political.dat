5|$|Lørensvingen, {{built in}} 2016, {{connected}} the Ring and Grorud Line. It splits from the Ring Line south of Sinsen, and run part in tunnel and part at-grade until it {{connects to the}} Grorud Line west of Økern. In the tunnel section the new station, Løren, was built. The day section runs parallel to part of the mainline Alnabru–Grefsen Line. The line allows metro trains to run directly from the Grorud Line to the Ring Line, and thus pass {{from east to west}} without passing through the packed Common Tunnel. It was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> compromise Oslo Package 3, completed by 2016.|$|E
5|$|On 11th May, William and Mary {{formally}} {{accepted the}} Scottish throne and on 5th June, the Convention was {{converted into a}} full Parliament. William tried to avoid abolishing Episcopacy but Dundee's 1689 Highland campaign on behalf of James highlighted his reliance on Presbyterian support. He withdrew his opposition and the measures were approved by Parliament in 1690. The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in a Parliament and Kirk far more independent than before but ending Episcopacy isolated a significant <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> class. This was {{a major factor in}} political debates over the 1707 Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement.|$|E

50|$|From {{around the}} year 500 up until <b>the</b> Christianization <b>of</b> Scandinavia (by <b>the</b> 13th century), these large halls were vital <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> center. They were later {{superseded}} by medieval banquet halls.|$|R
5|$|Cochrane's work forms <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> turn {{in animal}} ethics—that is, the {{emergence}} of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He {{is known for his}} interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding prima facie rights, and some prima facie rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. In this picture, the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily prima facie rights, represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against suffering and death ground prima facie rights against the infliction of suffering and death. These prima facie rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|E
5|$|In his {{autobiography}} Belgrano {{declared that he}} did not have any previous knowledge of being included in the junta, and that his appointment took him by surprise. Nevertheless, he accepted the role. He was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> line of Mariano Moreno; they were expecting to use the government to make big changes in the social order. One of his first rulings was the making of a Maths Academy, located in the building of the Consulate and with the purpose of instructing the military. Belgrano was appointed its protector. He supported the banishment of Cisneros and the members of the Real Audience, and the execution of Liniers and other counter-revolutionaries defeated in Córdoba. Some historians suggest that he would have promoted the creation of the Operations plan, a secret document written by Moreno that set harsh ways for the junta to achieve its goals, while others consider the whole document a literary forgery done by royalists to discredit the junta. A few others suspect that some paragraphs or the whole document may have been the result of collaborative writing between Moreno, Belgrano, and Hipólito Vieytes.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s saw high {{inflation}} and large public deficits. Several public committees were created solely to cut costs. One such proposal {{was to build}} a road to Flåm, with the proposal being led by Hans Kristian Seip, who was director of Bergen Public Road Administration. In 1925, following the appointment of Mowinckel's First Cabinet, it was proposed that the railway be built as a road, and the tracks laid later. One of NSB's board members proposed instead building a suspended railway. The plans to cancel the railway were stopped because of parliamentarian support for the railway. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> support was because there was agreement on a national railway plan, and removing parts of it would disrupt the geographical compromise. However, Parliament did vote {{to reduce the number}} of intermediate stations to one, which would allow trains to meet at Berekvam. The cost saving for a road was estimated at 30 percent. The issue of a road was taken up in a new vote in Parliament in 1927, but was again rejected.|$|E
50|$|Opinions on Theresa May's {{proposal}} vary substantially at all <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum. Some libertarian Conservatives, like James Delinpole, have {{condemned the}} policy, and the Labour party leader - Jeremy Corbyn - has branded it a death tax.|$|R
50|$|New Urbanism {{has drawn}} both praise and {{criticism}} from all <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spectrum. It {{has been criticized}} both for being a social engineering scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers.|$|R

25|$|The Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) {{showed up}} {{problems}} of the private railway {{to cope with the}} need to move troops quickly, leading to the second Railway Act of 1872. This transferred control of construction, operation, tariffs and accounting of the railways and the licensing of railway companies from the cantons to the federal government. The possibility of federal government nationalisation of the railways also became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> agenda.|$|E

25|$|Since 1949, {{the most}} {{controversial}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> division system has been the existence of Taiwan Province, as its existence {{was part of a}} larger controversy over the political status of Taiwan.

The much smaller Fukien province, Fujian Provincial Government has been in streamlined form since 1956.|$|E
25|$|Vaca Diez and House of Delegates president, Mario Cossío, {{were the}} two next {{in the line of}} {{succession}} to become President. However, they were strongly disliked by the protesters, and each declared they would not accept succession to the Presidency, finally promoting Edwardo Rodriguez, Supreme Court Chief Justice, to the Presidency. Considered apolitical and hence trustworthy by most, his administration was a temporary one until elections could be held. Protesters quickly disbanded in many areas, and like many times in Bolivia's past, major political upheavals were taken as a normal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> process.|$|E
25|$|White sharecroppers and mill workers {{coalesced}} {{behind the}} candidacy of Tillmanite Cole Blease in the gubernatorial election of 1910.

Once in office, however, Blease did not initiate any policies that were beneficial to the mill workers or poor farmers. Instead, his four years in office were highly erratic in behavior. This helped {{to pave the way}} for a progressive, Richard I. Manning, to win the governorship in 1914.|$|E

25|$|The {{politicization}} {{of science in}} the sense of a manipulation of science for political gains is a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> process. It is part of the controversies about intelligent design (compare the Wedge strategy) or Merchants of Doubt, scientists that are under suspicion to willingly obscure findings. e.g. about issues like tobacco smoke, ozone depletion, global warming or acid rain. However, e.g. in case of the Ozone depletion, global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in a climate of high uncertainty and against strong resistance while in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.|$|E
25|$|On 16 January 1794 Jacques François Dugommier {{replaced}} Eustache Charles d'Aoust as commander-in-chief of the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees. Aoust {{was condemned}} and executed by guillotine on 2 July 1794. Dugommier had {{an advantage over}} previous commanders of the army because he came as the victor of the Siege of Toulon which ended on 19 December 1793. He was {{also a member of}} the National Convention and therefore <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> establishment. Until Dugommier's accession, the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees was under the control of arrogant representatives on mission who abused their authority to remarkable degree. This situation now changed.|$|E
25|$|The film {{industry}} in Argentina reached a pinnacle {{in the late}} 1930s and 1940s when an average of forty-two films were produced annually. The films usually included tango, but even when a tango theme was omitted most cinema from this period still included humble heroes and wealthy villains. In these films, it portrayed hard work and poverty as ennobling and depicted the poor as the primary beneficiaries of Juan Perón's economic policies. These films, in part supported by Perón, were seen as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> agenda of peronism. By supporting a {{film industry}} that attacked greed and supported the working class, Perón was able to influence the attitudes of his constituency to build public appeal.|$|E
