5|$|Alberta uses a unicameral Westminster-style <b>parliamentary</b> <b>government,</b> {{in which}} the premier {{is the leader of}} the party that {{controls}} the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The premier is Alberta's head of government, while the Queen of Canada in right of Alberta is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta. The premier picks a cabinet, usually from the elected members of the Legislative Assembly, to form the Executive Council of Alberta, and presides over that body.|$|E
5|$|Few Privy Counsellors are {{required}} to attend regularly. The settled practice is that day-to-day meetings of the Council are attended by four Privy Counsellors, usually the relevant Minister to the matters pertaining. The Cabinet Minister holding the office of Lord President of the Council, currently the Rt Hon. Andrea Leadsom , invariably presides. Under Britain's modern conventions of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>government</b> and constitutional monarchy, every order made in Council is drafted by a Government Department and has already {{been approved by the}} Minister responsible—thus actions taken by the Queen-in-Council are formalities required for validation of each measure.|$|E

5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>government.</b> For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from the majority of his colleagues, leading to a virtual split in the Conservative Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and at the height of his political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E

Around this period, other ethnic minority groups began forming larger rebel factions, such as the Kachin Independence Army, in response to the new government's refusal to adopt a federal government structure.|$|E
