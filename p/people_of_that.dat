5|$|The {{colored people}} did not intrude {{themselves}} upon us; they were brought here in chains and held in communities {{where they are now}} chiefly bound by a cruel slave code...when and under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? … in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.|$|E
5|$|This {{brings the}} issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture, and why it so {{immediately}} replaced the Oksywie culture. According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least culturally) to some degree, is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{their arrival}} on the Pontic Steppe, the Germanic tribes adopted {{the ways of}} the Eurasian nomads.

The application of that designation to the Goths appears to be not ethnological but rather geographical and cultural - Greeks regarded both the ethnic Scythians and the Goths as barbarians.|$|E

Unfortunately, these Antanosy were faced with raid of their livestock by the Bara and Mahafaly <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> area. They felt further threatened when the Imerina were able to conquer Toliary. They also struggled regarding ethnicity, resulting in separate leaders for the Zafitomany versus the Zafiramania peoples.|$|E

This fact, taken {{in the context of}} 7th-century Arabia, was not an extraordinary feat. <b>People</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time had a penchant for recited poetry and had developed their skills in memorization to a remarkable degree.

25|$|In 320 BC the consul Quintus Publilius Philo and Lucius Papirius Cursor {{marched to}} Apulia. This move threw the Samnites off. Publilius headed for Luceria, where the Roman hostages were held. He routed a Samnite contingent. However, the Samnites regrouped and besieged the Romans outside Luceria. The army of Papirius {{advanced}} {{along the coast}} as far as Arpi. The <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> area were well disposed towards the Romans because they were fed up with years of Samnite raids. They supplied the besieged Romans with corn. This forced the Samnites to engage Papirius. There was an indecisive battle and Papirius besieged the Samnites who then surrendered and passed under the yoke. Luceria was taken and the Roman hostages were freed.|$|E

25|$|Sundar {{felt that}} his {{religious}} pursuits in Sikhism and the questioning of Christian and Hindu priests left him without ultimate meaning.

He asked that whosoever is the 'True God' would appear before him, or else he would kill himself; that very night he had an enlightening vision of Jesus who opened Sundar's soul to the truth. Sundar announced to his father, Sher Singh, that henceforth he would get converted into the missionary work of Christ. His father denounced him, and his brother Rajender Singh attempted to poison him. He was not poisoned just once {{but a number of}} times. <b>People</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> area threw snakes in his house.

25|$|Religious {{nationalist}} parties {{include the}} Shiromani Akali Dal, which is closely {{identified with the}} creation of a Sikh-majority state in Punjab and includes many Sikh religious leaders in its organisation. In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena uses the legacy of the independent Maratha kingdom under famous figures like Shivaji to stir up support, and has adopted Hindutva as well. In Assam, the Asom Gana Parishad is a more state-focused party, arising after the frustration of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) as a benevolent expression of Assamese nationalism. In Tamil Nadu came the first of such parties, the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK). Today the DK stands for a collection of parties, with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK). Caste-based politics invite the participation of the Bahujan Samaj Party and the party of Laloo Prasad Yadav, who build upon the support of poor low-caste and dalit Hindus in the northern, and most populated states of India like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Almost every Indian state has a regional party devoted solely to the culture of the native <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> state.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} the end of any {{noteworthy}} Spanish naval presence in the New World. It forced Spain to re-assess its strategy in Cuba and resulted in an ever-tightening blockade of the island. While fighting continued until August, when the Treaty of Paris was signed, all surviving Spanish capital ships were now husbanded to defend their homeland leaving only isolated units of auxiliary vessels to defend the coast. Uncontested U.S. control of the seas around Cuba made resupply of the Spanish garrison impossible and its surrender inevitable. Admiral Cervera received different treatment than the sailors taken to Portsmouth. For a time, he was held at Annapolis, Maryland, where he was received with great enthusiasm by the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> city. The Battle of Santiago de Cuba brought Cervera peace of mind that he had fulfilled an officer’s duties and that his fleet had upheld Spanish honor. His bravery {{in the face of the}} enemy’s superiority garnered respect from Spanish and American sailors and officers alike. The Spanish prisoners of war were released upon the signing of the 1898 Treaty of Paris and the remaining Spanish forces left Cuba, leaving civil order to the military government that the United States established. The U.S. Army under the overall administration of General Leonard Wood governed the island for some time afterwards and, with help, removed many of the mines laid in the bay.The immediate effect of the Battle of Santiago and the larger Spanish-American War, then, {{was the end}} of any noteworthy Spanish naval presence in the New World. In the imperial vacuum left by Spain’s New World empire, the United States now exerted considerable influence both in annexing formal territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines and in subsequent American military interventions throughout the Caribbean over the next half century.|$|E
