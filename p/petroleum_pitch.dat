40|$|Supercritical fluid {{extraction}} (SFE) {{is currently}} being investigated as a possible technique {{in the production of}} high quality mesophase pitch from coal tar and <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitches.</b> Mesophase pitch is used to make high technology products, such as carbon bre. The conventional production of mesophase pitch initially involves the removal of low molecular weight species from coal tar and <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitches.</b> The remaining residue is then transformed into a mesophase pitch through a polymerisation process. The aim of this study involves the extraction of light molecular weight species using SFE. Both petroleum and coal tar pitch contain complex aromatic molecules with an average molecular weight of 200 to 800, whereas mesophase pitch has a molecular weight range of about 1200 to 1300. Toluene, heptane, pentane and methanol were added to CO 2 as modiers at temperatures between 80 and 200 C and at pressures of 200 to 400 atm.

For example, T400 from Toray with a tensile strength of 4,000 MPa and M40, a modulus of 400 GPa. Intermediate carbon fibers, such as IM 600 from Toho Rayon with up to 6,000 MPa were developed.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} interesting evidences that a low {{softening point}} isotropic <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitch</b> {{can be used}} as a good carbon precursor for the preparation of activated carbons. The activation is carried out by KOH and/or NaOH and the resulting activated carbons present well developed porosity. Such hydroxide activations can be done directly on the pristine <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitch</b> (P) or on the pitch that has been submitted to an air stabilisation followed by a N 2 heat treatment (TAN). In general, KOH activation produces better results than NaOH, both in terms of porosity and yield, the results obtained for the activation of TAN being impressive because of the good porosity developments and high yields reached. The different treatments carried out over the <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitch</b> precursor clearly show that they significantly influence the extent of microporosity development. This is due to different changes occurring in the porous structure of the precursor as a function of the treatment carried out.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of pitch/coke interactions at the mixing stage were studied by a spreading drop test, using {{a bed of}} calcined petroleum coke as substrate. For this purpose, three <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitches</b> and a binder coal–tar pitch, which was selected as a reference, were used. The results show that pitch wetting behaviour is related to both pitch surface tension and pitch viscosity. Low values of surface tension and viscosity are required for the pitch to spread and penetrate into the coke bed at temperatures below 160 °C. The non-wetting behaviour observed in some <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitches</b> was ascribed to oxidation processes, {{as demonstrated by the}} fact that the non-wetting pitch behaviour can be improved by using an inert atmosphere and/or increasing the heating rate during the spreading drop test. Additionally, the use of blends of wetting and non-wetting pitches and the addition of active surface agents contributes significantly to modifying the wetting behaviour of non-wetting pitches.

40|$|Semicokes {{obtained}} from the pyrolysis of <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitches</b> are important materials {{that are used in}} the manufacture of many carbonaceous products. Therefore, new structural information of the semi-cokes will extend their utilization. The structural analysis of anisotropic semicokes of the pyrolysis of <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitches</b> obtained under various experimental conditions of temperature and time was investigated. The overall objective is to provide further detailed information of factors which influence formation of anisotropy or turbostratic structures in resultant semicokes. Experiments were carried out under an argon atmosphere at the temperature range of 500 - 1000 degrees C for 30, 60 and 120 min in a tube furnace. FTIR, H- 1 -NMR, and C- 13 NMR results showed that the aromatic structure of the semicokes was increasing with respect to increasing temperature as well as increasing time. Aromaticity of the semicokes was calculated as 0. 54 and 0. 64, for Pitch A at 500 degrees C after 120 min, and Pitch B at 600 degrees C after 120 min, respectively. The intensity ratio between Raman "D" and "G" peaks, I-D/I-G (commonly used to characterize disorder in graphene structures) was observed to increase approximately linearly from 0. 65 to 0. 92 when the pyrolysis temperature of Pitch A was increased from 500 degrees C to 900 degrees C. XRD patterns of the semicokes showed the formation of some crystalline material with time and temperature. The average number of layers, calculated by the Debye-Scherer technique using the XRD patterns of the semicokes, was between 5 and 10. SEM images of the semicokes indicated the presence of turbostratic structures. All the results of characterizations were consistent and indicated the formation of highly amorphous hydrocarbon materials that contain turbostratic structures. Treatments at higher temperatures increased formations of aromatic structure with increased crystallinity. Temperature seemed to be the dominating parameter of the pyrolysis reactions. As the pyrolysis temperature was increased, aromatic structure formation was favored with increased crystallinity in the semicokes.

40|$|This Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory {{sponsored}} project developed carbon products, using mildly hydrogenated solvents {{to extract}} the organic portion of coal to create synthetic pitches, cokes, carbon foam and carbon fibers. The focus of this effort was on development of lower cost solvents, milder hydrogenation conditions and improved yield in order to enable practical production of these products. This technology is needed because of the long-term decline in production of domestic feedstocks such as <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitch</b> and coal tar pitch. Currently, carbon products represents a market of roughly 5 million tons domestically, and 19 million tons worldwide. Carbon products are mainly derived from feedstocks such as <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitch</b> and coal tar pitch. The domestic supply of <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitch</b> is declining because of the rising price of liquid fuels, which has caused US refineries to maximize liquid fuel production. As a consequence, the long term trend has a decline in production of <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitch</b> over the past 20 years. The production of coal tar pitch, {{as in the case}} of <b>petroleum</b> <b>pitch,</b> has likewise declined significantly over the past two decades. Coal tar pitch is a byproduct of metallurgical grade coke (metcoke) production. In this industry, modern metcoke facilities are recycling coal tar as fuel in order to enhance energy efficiency and minimize environmental emissions. Metcoke production itself is dependent upon the production requirements for domestic steel. Hence, several metcoke ovens have been decommissioned over the past two decades and have not been replaced. As a consequence sources of coal tar are being taken off line and are not being replaced. The long-term trend is a reduction in coal tar pitch production. Thus import of feedstocks, mainly from Eastern Europe and China, is on the rise despite the relatively large transportation cost. To reverse this trend, a new process for producing carbon products is needed. The process must be economically competitive with current processes, and yet be environmentally friendly as well. The solvent extraction process developed uses mild hydrogenation of low cost oils to create powerful solvents that can dissolve the organic portion of coal. The insoluble portion, consisting mainly of mineral matter and fixed carbon, is removed via centrifugation or filtration, leaving a liquid solution of coal chemicals and solvent. This solution can be further refined via distillation to meet specifications for products such as synthetic pitches, cokes, carbon foam and fibers. The most economical process recycles 85 % of the solvent, which itself is obtained as a low-cost byproduct from industrial processes such as coal tar or petroleum refining. Alternatively, processes have been developed that can recycle 100 % of the solvent, avoiding any need for products derived from petroleum or coal tar...|$|E

To this end, semicontinuous (or semibatch) dense-gas/supercritical extraction (DGE/SCE) was used to produce monomer, dimer, and trimer fractions of selected pitches (i. e., M- 50 and pyrene pitch) during the course of this work. Matrix-assisted, laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was then used to develop a reliable quantitative analysis method for these polydisperse mixtures of petroleum macromolecules. The interrelationships among MALDI sample preparation methods, analyte MWD, and MALDI response for well-defined, oligomeric pitc...|$|R
