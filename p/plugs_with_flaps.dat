40|$|Abstract Background Low trans{{sphincter}}ic fistulas {{less than}} 1 / 3 of the sphincter complex {{are easy to}} treat by fistulotomy with a high success rate. High transsphincteric fistulas remain a surgical challenge. Various surgical procedures are available, but recurrence rates of these techniques are disappointingly high. The mucosal flap advancement is considered {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of high perianal fistula of cryptoglandular origin by most colorectal surgeons. In the literature a recurrence rate between 0 and 63 % is reported for the mucosal flap advancement. Recently Armstrong and colleagues reported on a new biologic anal fistula plug, a bioabsorbable xenograft made of lyophilized porcine intestinal submucosa. Their prospective series of 15 patients with high perianal fistula treated with the anal fistula plug showed promising results. The anal fistula plug trial is designed to compare the anal fistula <b>plug</b> <b>with</b> the mucosal <b>flap</b> advancement in the treatment of high perianal fistula in terms of success rate, continence, postoperative pain, and quality of life. Methods/design The PLUG trial is a randomized controlled multicenter trial. Sixty patients with high perianal fistulas of cryptoglandular origin will be randomized to either the fistula plug or the mucosal advancement flap. Study parameters will be anorectal fistula closure-rate, continence, post-operative pain, and quality of life. Patients will be followed-up at two weeks, four weeks, and 16 weeks. At the final follow-up closure rate is determined by clinical examination by a surgeon blinded for the intervention. Discussion Before broadly implementing the anal fistula plug results of randomized trials using the plug should be awaited. This randomized controlled trial comparing the anal fistula plug and the mucosal advancement flap should provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of the anal fistula plug in the treatment of high perianal fistulas.

40|$|Hinge {{moment of}} hinged-plate wing {{spoilers}} were measured during flight of a twin turboprop airplane modified {{by the addition}} of upper and lower wing-surface spoilers. The spoiler-actuating hydraulic cylinders were instrumented to measure the forces required to extend the spoiler panels. Those measurements were converted to moment coefficient form, and are presented as a function of spoiler deployment angle. The hinge-moment data were collected at three flight conditions: <b>with</b> <b>flaps</b> extended at approach speed; <b>with</b> <b>flaps</b> retracted at a low speed; and <b>with</b> <b>flaps</b> retracted at a high speed (C sub L = 1. 4, 1. 0, and 0. 5). In general, the magnitude of measured spoiler hinge moments were lower than predicted. Furthermore, for upper surface spoilers <b>with</b> <b>flaps</b> extended, the hinge moments increased in a discontinuous manner between spoiler deflection 10 and 10...|$|R
