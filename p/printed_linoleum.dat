50|$|Perilla oil {{made from}} untoasted seeds {{can be used}} for non-culinary purposes, {{including}} in paint, varnish, <b>printing</b> ink and <b>linoleum.</b> As a drying oil similar to tung oil or linseed oil, perilla oil has been used for paints, varnishes, <b>linoleum,</b> <b>printing</b> ink, lacquers, and for protective waterproof coatings on cloth. Perilla oil can also be used for fuel. It is used along with synthetic resins in the production of varnishes. It dries faster than linseed oil and on drying forms a film that is harder and yellows more than that formed by linseed oil. The paint and varnish industry accounts for the largest usage. Perilla oil is also important in the manufacture of <b>printing</b> inks and <b>linoleum,</b> and in more ancient times was a critical component in creating durable earthen floors.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Art) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 1958. The {{positive}} {{values of}} printmaking {{in public school}} education are generally recognized by educators. Block <b>printing</b> (<b>linoleum</b> or wood) and serigraphy (silk-screen), for example, are usually included in public school printmaking courses because the mediums require inexpensive materials, simple tools, am no press. On the other hand, lithography rarely appears at this educational level because, in common practice, it necessitates complex and expensive equipment and materials. Its use, therefore, is prohibitive except in {{institutions of higher learning}} and commercial printing plants. The purpose of this problem shall be to formulate a simple method whereby such materials and procedures can be used in public school printmaking classes by: (1) conducting a series of sixteen experiments in direct process technique, using zinc and aluminum lithographic plates: and (2) identifying, recognizing, and organizing the materials and procedures necessary for a successful technique in the use of these metal plates for artistic expression.

50|$|Although most work is {{executed}} throughout by one {{or another}} of the seven distinct processes mentioned above, combinations are frequently employed. Sometimes a pattern is printed partly by machine and partly by block, and sometimes a cylindrical block is used along with engraved copper-rollers in an ordinary printing machine. The block in this latter case is in all respects, except for shape, identical with a flat wood or coppered block, but, instead of being dipped in colour, it receives its supply from an endless blanket, one part of which works in contact with colour-furnishing rollers and the other part with the cylindrical block. This block is known as a surface or peg roller. Many {{attempts have been made to}} print multicolour patterns with surface rollers alone, but hitherto with little success, owing to their irregularity in action and to the difficulty of preventing them from warping. These defects are not present in the <b>printing</b> of <b>linoleum</b> in which opaque oil colours are used, colours that neither sink into the body of the hard linoleum nor tend to warp the roller.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the attitudes of the participants towards the legends in terms of environment and cultural values and to identify their views. With this aim in mind, 60 MA students who participated in Ecology Based Environmental Education that took place in 2008 Summer term in Kazdağı National Park and its immediate vicinity were asked to replay (via drama) the artistic expressions of tragic love stories such as Hasan Boğuldu and Sarıkız legends of the Zeytinli vicinity of Edremit township in Balıkesir. The participants were also asked to individually represent the different ideas and formations in their minds by using a visual high <b>print</b> technology (<b>linoleum).</b> The study used a data collection method which relied on the beliefs, opinions, experiences, perceptions and feelings. Since the Kazdağları environment and cultural values were tried to be depicted in their natural atmosphere and formation, the study also carries qualitative characteristics. The data obtained by utilizing observation and interview techniques were categorized and studied in the directions of the subproblems in the study. The participants were informed about the legends of Hasan Boğuldu and Sarıkız through watching movies, reading texts and listening to speeches. Some parts of the texts were interrupted in the middle and drama technique was used. By using drama via group activities the process was perpetuated and the students were asked to express any location from the text by image sketches. The sketches that were created were developed by corroboratively discussing the events in the legends. The designs that were improved by each participant according to his/her text provided them to see the legend in its entirety. The participants found the chance of approaching the legends through different perspectives, expressing the legends through drama and <b>print</b> techniques (<b>linoleum),</b> imagining, dreaming and applying their imagination by feeling the satisfaction of observing the concept of creating the whole together and expressing themselves. By comprehending the place and significance of print pictures in the historical process, the students created a product that can render their experiences permanent and at the same time they had the opportunity to learn about the Hasan Boğuldu and Sarıkız legends by direct, hands-on experiences.

40|$|The Modular System {{draws on}} {{traditional}} wood engraving, woodcut and letterpress practices. It comprises two printing surfaces and printing furniture specifically devised to facilitate offset and transfer relief printing. Rigid acetal resin tint blocks, hand or laser engraved, generate tone or colour {{that may be}} applied {{to more than one}} image. Multiple overprinting produces variant colour mixtures. Their function is similar to late nineteenth-century tints devised for colour letterpress printing. Compound <b>printing</b> surfaces of <b>linoleum</b> or vinyl are segmented and joined to make removable and replaceable parts. They print variable configurations in a process that resembles historical solutions to simultaneous colour printing: from the Mentz Psalter (1475), to the compound plates of William Congreve (1820) and the segmented wood engravings of John Holt Ibbetson (1819). These compound surfaces also act as receptors for impressions from the tint blocks. Repositioning and offsetting them is expedited by press furniture especially devised for the project. Registration devices are based on the simple Japanese kent? system and laser-cut circular chases derived from traditional letterpress furniture. Printing the tint blocks directly onto the flexible compound surfaces produce two viable prints that are offsets of each other. They are reversed, but one offset is also tonally inversed. It is this unpredictable tonality that has driven this experimental project. Both the construction and processes developed using the Modular System directed historical research into functional colour relief printing which consequently unearthed examples that would influence the further development of the project. This has generated both devices and processes capable of wider applications. Printing surfaces employed in the Modular System may be laser engraved or cut and adapted to use in both lithography and intaglio printmaking...|$|R

She was familiar {{with many of the}} more famous artists of the time; in one of her journals, she stated that she wanted to learn from the avant-garde artists in France. By 1907, Münter had filled several sketchbooks, over 450 pages. She made a number of <b>linoleum</b> <b>prints</b> during her time studying Gauguin’s work. She sometimes painted with a palette knife. In Paris, she began to perfect her woodcut technique, which became faster and more accurate. Münter’s work remained figurative.In 1909 Münter began using glass as a different medium. This was a process that had been adopted by Kandinsky, Franz Marc, August Macke, and Heinrich Campendonk. But Münter {{was the first one to}} actually copy the traditional practices that this kind of work had to offer. Soon enough Münter and Kandinsky, along with the other artists, began painting their own designs on the glass pieces. This was a process she had learned after discovering Bavarian and Bohemian Hinterglasmalerei, which was basically glass painted on its back side. This was one step that the group the Blaue Reiter had taken towards primitive art. This kind of art could be observed in many places in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Münter loved Kandinsky and worked hard to bring him and his paintings to the public eye.Kandinsky’s and Münter’s professional and personal relationship lasted for about twelve years, between 1902 and 1916. During this time their relationship affected Münter’s art. Kandinsky was married for fifteen years while he was in a relationship with Münter. They spent a great deal of time together traveling through Europe including the Netherlands, Italy, and France, as well as North Africa. It was during this time that they met Rousseau and Matisse. Münter and Kandinsky fell in love with the small market town of Murnau in southern Bavaria. Later on, Münter bought a house in Murnau and spent much of her life there. Münter and Kandinsky helped establish the Munich-based avant-garde group called the New Artists’ Association (Neue Künstlervereinigung). She contributed to a number of the most significant avant-garde exhibitions in Germany up till World War I.|$|R

This thesis {{explores the}} uses, appearance and making of Linoleum in Sweden {{in the twentieth}} century with focus on Linoleum {{as a part of the}} modernistic movement. 2 ̆ 028 Linoleum was invented by Fredrick Walton in the eighteen-sixties and had one hundred years of popularity until its decline in the nineteen-sixties. It is composed of oxidised linseed oil mixed with cork or wooden flour and pigment. Patterns are made in several different ways. The most common method was to make <b>prints</b> on <b>linoleum.</b> This way it was possible to achieve complicated and detailed patterns using many different colours, and to an affordable price. Many of the patterns of the early twentieth century were made to imitate more exclusive materials such as carpets and parquet wooden flooring. Tile and stone imitations were also common. A more durable pattern could be created by mixing different coloured granulats and produce a streaked pattern such as granite, marble or jaspé. Inlaid linoleum is the third version of making patterns. It is made my puzzling different coloured pieces together by hand or in a mold. Sweden has only had one linoleum factory. This is Forshaga Linoleum, a company that was established in 1891. There was a lot of collaborations between Forshaga Linoleum and the manufacturers in the rest of Europe, as the knowledge and the machines were all imported from already existing factories. In 1928 there was a business treaty between Forshaga linoleum and thirteen other factories in Europe, among them Deutsche linoleum werke (DLW). DLW exited the organisation at the start of World War II. There were also other similar resilient flooring materials invented during this period. During World War II there was a shortage of linseed oil and there were experiments with other binders. For the Swedish factory this resulted in a material known as forbolin, a material based on cellulose nitrate that was produced 1942 - 44. Another material produced was the felt base flooring, a flooring that only has a thin printed protective surface and is made as a cheap and less lasting alternative. Vinyl flooring also began being produced in the nineteen-forties, and eventually came to dominate the market. In the very beginning of the twentieth century linoleum was a very novel and exclusive material. In Swedish middle class homes it was often bought as a smaller carpet and given a prominent place under the dining room table. A few decades later this had changed and linoleum had become an ordinary flooring often used in kitchens and hallways where easy cleaning was essential. Modernism in Sweden brought big changes regarding how linoleum was viewed and how it was used in homes and public spaces. It was the perfect material for the new architecture, since it was practical, affordable and very versatile as it came in various colours and patterns. Forshaga Linoleum wanted to be closely associated with the modernism movement and this is visible in their marketing strategies. Due to Sweden’s strong economic growth there was big increase in housing construction with the intention to improve living standards for the population, and linoleum was widely used in the new architecture. 2 ̆ 02...|$|R
