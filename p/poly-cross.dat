40|$|The new {{breeding}} programme was initiated in 1991 {{after a visit}} of Dr Du Plooy to California. This new {{breeding programme}} consists of two parts namely rootstock breeding and scion breeding. Both of these programmes {{are based on the}} establishment of a genesource, introduction of promising overseas materials, self-pollination, cross pollination and <b>poly-cross</b> nurseries. Satisfactory progress was made since the strategy for the new breeding programme was announced. This progress is discussed in the various sections that were mentioned...|$|E
40|$|Due to poor root quality {{traits in}} improved, disease {{resistant}} cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz.) varieties and hence low acceptability among farmers, a study was undertaken to improve these varieties by crossing them with disease susceptible, farmer preferred local landraces. Five improved varieties and four local landraces were used and hybridisations {{among them were}} made in a <b>poly-cross</b> nursery block. Starch isolated from the nine cassava varieties and their F 1 progenies was analysed for physicochemical and functional properties. Significant differences were observed between varieties, progenies and within the F 1 progenies. The amylose content ranging between 19. 0 - 25. 0 % was negatively correlated to swelling power and solubility but positively correlated to starch content. Average starch granule sizes ranged between 7. 0 - 12. 0 mm, though smaller granules ranged between 2 - 6. 9 mm and large granules between 13 – 20 mm. Granules were mainly truncated in shape and similar across varieties and their progenies. Individual parents had peak viscosity, set back viscosity and viscosity at breakdown higher than the progenies suggesting inherent genetic and biochemical differences among parents used in the study. Variations were also observed in the parents and progenies for starch swelling power, solubility and starch content on dry basis. Starch associated molecules such as proteins and lipids did not vary significantly but dietary fibre significantly (P 0. 45) were observed among starch properties including swelling power and breakdown viscosity. Based on these results, selections for lines with different starch quality and quantity properties can be made among the F 1 families for future dietary and industrial uses...|$|E
40|$|Four {{trials were}} {{analysed}} to provide taxa comparisons {{for growth and}} stem quality as well as genetic parameters for Queensland bred Pinus elliottii (Pee) and P. elliottii × P. caribaea var. hondurensis (Pch) F 1 hybrids. Of particular interest was the genetic correlation between related progenies in pure species and hybrid combination (rph), or equivalently {{the correlation between the}} general combining ability (GCA) and general hybridising ability (GHA). Pee families produced less volume than either the PCH controls or the F 1 hybrid families and exhibited slightly more crown defects than either of the other two taxa. The heritability estimates were very high for the F 1 hybrid trials but moderate to low in the pure Pee trials. Type-B genetic correlations were high within the same taxa giving further evidence of the low levels of genotype by environment interaction found within southeast Queensland for these two taxa. Pearson correlations between univariate GCA and GHA estimates provided similar rph estimates to those obtained directly from multivariate analyses. There was no correlation between the GHA and GCA estimates for the 56 Pee parents represented in this study for growth traits; however, a high and positive correlation was found for straightness. While straightness in hybrids may be selected for using pure Pee progeny trial data, growth traits in pure and hybrid progeny of Pee appear to be uncorrelated. Field testing of F 1 hybrid families or <b>poly-crossed</b> Pee parents prior to operational deployment or inclusion in more intensive clonal screening programs will continue to be necessary if resources are to be focused on the very best hybrid families...|$|R
