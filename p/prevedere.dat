5000|$|A trial, {{which lasted}} from September 2011 until October 2012, found six {{scientists}} {{and a former}} government official guilty of involuntary manslaughter. According to the prosecution, they had spread [...] "inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory" [...] statements after preliminary tremors could be felt on the days before 6 April 2009. While scientists were found guilty for failing to give adequate warning, {{the full text of}} the decision said that [...] "science was not being tried for failing to predict the April 6, 2009 earthquake" [...] ("Non Ã¨ sottoposta a giudizio la scienza per non essere riuscita a <b>prevedere</b> il terremoto del 6 aprile 2009"). The seven members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Major Risks who were convicted were: Franco Barberi, head of Serious Risks Commission; Enzo Boschi, former president of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology; Giulio Lorenzo Selvaggi, director of National Earthquake Centre; Gian Michele Calvi, director of European Centre for Earthquake Engineering; Claudio Eva, physicist; Mauro Dolce, director of the Civil Protection Agency's earthquake risk office; Bernardo De Bernardinis, former vice-president of Civil Protection Agency's technical department.|$|E
