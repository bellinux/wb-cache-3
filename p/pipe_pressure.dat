25|$|If the {{pressure}} in the train line is {{lower than that of}} the reservoir, the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder.

This action continues until equilibrium between the brake <b>pipe</b> <b>pressure</b> and reservoir pressure is achieved. At that point, the airflow from the reservoir to the brake cylinder is lapped off and the cylinder is maintained at a constant pressure.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{train braking}} systems use {{pneumatic}} valves {{to control and}} generate brake applications on the cars {{along the length of}} the train. In general, this conventional system consists of a brake pipe that runs the length of the train which supplies air to reservoirs mounted on each of the cars. When the brake pipe and car components are charged with air, the brakes release. When the engineer needs to make a brake application, control valves in the locomotive reduce the brake <b>pipe</b> <b>pressure.</b> As the brake <b>pipe</b> <b>pressure</b> reduces, the service portion on each car divert air from their reservoirs to their brake cylinders. To release the brakes, the engineer charges the brake pipe.
