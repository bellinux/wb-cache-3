2500|$|A combo amp {{contains}} the amplifier {{and one or}} more speakers in a single cabinet. In a [...] "head and speaker cabinet" [...] configuration, the amplifier and speaker each have their own cabinet. The amplifier (head) may drive one or more speaker cabinets. In the 1920s, guitarists played through <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> but by the 1940s, this was uncommon. A rare exception in the 1990s was grunge guitarist Kurt Cobain, who used four 800 watt PA amplifiers in his early guitar set-up.|$|R

5000|$|In {{common with}} all 'E' prefix tubes, using the Mullard-Philips tube designation, the EL34 has a heater voltage of 6.3V. According {{to the data}} sheets found in old vacuum tube {{reference}} manuals, a pair of EL34s with 800V plate voltage can produce 90 watts output in class AB1 in push-pull configuration. However, this configuration is rarely found. One application of this type was in [...] "Australian Sound" [...] <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>amplifiers</b> commonly used in government schools in Australia in the 1950s, using four EL34s for ≈200 watts. More commonly found {{is a pair of}} EL34s running class AB1 in push-pull around 375-450V plate voltage and producing 50 watts output (if fixed bias is used), while a quad of EL34s running class AB1 in push-pull typically run anywhere from 425 to 500V plate voltage and produces 100 watts output. This configuration is typically found in guitar amplifiers.|$|R

40|$|In many <b>public</b> areas, <b>public</b> <b>address</b> systems play {{a central}} role in {{broadcasting}} important messages. Consider e. g., air-ports or train stations. The intelligibility of messages broad-cast by such <b>public</b> <b>address</b> systems gets reduced due to en-vironmental noise sources. Usually, these systems therefore employ a pre-processing module to modify the original mes-sage such that its intelligibility in the noisy environment is increased. Most of the pre-processing methods for intelli-gibility improvement require an estimate of the environmen-tal noise PSD. However, existing noise PSD estimators over-estimate the noise PSD in reverberant environments, leading to an overamplification of the speech by the speech intelli-gibility pre-processing module. In this paper, we propose a new MMSE-based noise PSD estimator that can be utilized in <b>public</b> <b>address</b> systems considering reverberation.
