The startups variable increased the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> through several positive feedback loops. The startups-products link began a direct feedback loop, which was reinforced by a products-awards-papers path. A longer loop, such as the startups-patents-news-URs-coordinators-papers loop, included the mutualistic relationships. These links suggest that the KCI had a positive impact on rejuvenating the academic performance for the participating universities.|$|E

Methods The Ph. D. database of the Lattes Platform (CNPq) was used as the source of information for the period 1970 - 2014. We searched for the terms &# 8220;benthos&# 8221;, &# 8220;macroinvertebrates&# 8221;, and &# 8220;zoobenthos&# 8221; in the titles and keywords of the papers listed on the platform. Papers were classified into the following categories: Systematics, Life History, Ecology, and Divulgation. These categories were further divided into subcategories. The percentage of papers in every major category and subcategory was calculated. Results The search introduced 1, 573 papers, which were mainly related to Ecology and Systematics. From 1970 to 2009, the number of papers published per decade increased exponentially, and the upward trend continues. The number of papers concerning Systematics, especially in Taxonomy, is increasing. Of the papers in Ecology category, those about Structure, Dynamics, and Distribution of the fauna have been increasing since the 1980 s, and there has been an evident increase in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> related to environmental damage in the last decade. The rate of <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> concerning the role of invertebrates in ecosystems and the effects of different Spatial Scales has been increasing since the 2000 s. Conclusion There is a clear tendency towards the increased continuity of paper production concerning freshwater benthic invertebrates, and relatively new approaches as Conservation and Exotic Species are becoming relevant...|$|E

40|$|Generalist {{mathematics}} journals exhibit {{bias toward}} {{the branches of}} mathematics by publishing articles about some subjects in quantities far disproportionate to the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> in those areas within all of mathematics. Bias is used here {{because it is the}} shortest English word with Webster’s meaning of “a tendency of a statistical estimate to deviate in one direction from a true value. ” This paper quantifies the bias, which seems not to be discussed previously, and suggests some consequences of it. The mathematical topics that are generally agreed to be the major branches of mathematics and the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> about them can be determined from the Mathematical Subject Classification and from two databases based on the classification [3]. The classification dates in some form to 1931, when Zentralblatt für Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete began publishing annual reviews of papers grouped into broad subject areas; Math-ematical Reviews started publishing similar material in 1940. The American Mathematical Society created hierarchical codes to classify papers for its de-funct Mathematical Offprint Service in the late 1960 s [8]. This AMS (MOS) Classification quickly became the de facto index for mathematical literature. Both Zentralblatt and Mathematical Reviews maintain historical databases of indexed papers that can be accessed now through the world wide web. The data presented here for the decade 2000 – 2009 were gathered from the Zentralblatt database in January, 2010. The 854, 547 items that were available at the time will increase as Zentralblatt completely assimilates pa-pers from the recent past. All the records can be retrieved by Mathematical Subject Classification. Figure 1 displays the percent of all mathematics papers that address each of the major branches of mathematics enumerated by Subject Classifi-cation.

We further examine the correlation between these two viewpoints. This study {{has shown that the}} negative correlation between (1) and (2) is greater in the application area. It suggests that, in computer science, the two roles (i. e., the leader and the follower) are more clearly separated from each other in the application area than in the theoretical area...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of a multidisciplinary Minor programme in Sports Innovation at Delft University of Technology in 2011 provided the teaching staff with a unique challenge; not only how to get students with different backgrounds to cooperate in efficient multidisciplinary teams, but also {{how to do this}} effectively and cost efficient. The answer to this question proved to be the “Pressure cooker kick-off”; a four day program that allowed students to integrate theory on innovation methodology with practical experience, perceived by students as ‘play’. The program focuses on a series of short integrated exercises that challenge students to leave their personal ‘comfort zones’. Student ratings of this kick-off are high and provided the minor sports innovation with a unique selling point over other minor programs. The results of this teamwork are reflected in a high yearly return rate of companies providing the minor sports innovation with assignments and the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> accepted by international conferences...|$|E

A great number of samples have been taken in 13 pulp and paper mills and about 200 PCDD/F analyses of raw materials, intermediates, final products as well as stock additives, waste waters and sludges were made. In the paper and board manufacturing process no formation of PCDD/F has been found, this statement is also valid for the deinking process of wastepapers. No evaporation of PCDD/F could be observed in the dryer section of the paper machine. The main input of PCDD/F in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> containing only primary fibers is the imported chlorine bleached kraft pulp. PCDD/F mass balances for paper mills producing wastepaper-containing papers and cardboards showed the wastepaper as the main input.
