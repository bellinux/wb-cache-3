Eugenicists had mixed feelings about birth control: they worried that it would exacerbate the birth rate differential between [...] "superior" [...] and [...] "inferior" [...] races, but they also recognized its value as a tool to [...] "racial betterment". Leaders of the birth control movement never considered eugenics to be their primary goal, focusing instead on free speech and women's rights, but around 1920 they started to make common cause with eugenicists, hoping to broaden the support base of the birth control movement.Free speech as primary goal: McCann (2010), pp. 750–751.McCann (1994), p. 59. Eugenics buttressed the birth control movement's aims by correlating excessive births with increased poverty, crime and disease.Engelman, p. 134. Sanger published two books in the early 1920s that endorsed eugenics: Woman and the New Race and The Pivot of Civilization. Sanger and other advocates endorsed negative eugenics (discouraging procreation of [...] "inferior" [...] persons), but did not advocate euthanasia or <b>positive</b> <b>eugenics</b> (encouraging procreation of [...] "superior" [...] persons).Engelman, p. 134. Many eugenicists refused to support the birth control movement because of Sanger's insistence that a woman's primary duty was to herself, not to the state.|$|E

50|$|During {{the postwar}} years, one of Osborn's lasting {{influences}} was shifting {{the emphasis of}} American eugenics to <b>positive</b> <b>eugenics,</b> which seeks to achieve eugenic goals through encouraging the spread of desired traits, as opposed to negative eugenics, which seeks to achieve eugenic goals through discouraging the spread of undesired traits.|$|E

40|$|In a {{time when}} the United States was {{undergoing}} significant sociocultural, economic, and demographic change, the eugenics movement found widespread support among the dominant white bourgeois class who had become increasingly concerned about the survival of the nuclear family and of the so-called “American race. ” Concomitantly, this era saw the rise of a mass consumer culture that was closely tied to the increasingly professionalized and influential advertising industry. In looking more closely at print advertisements for consumer products that appeared in a variety of mass-market publications between 1910 and 1935, it becomes apparent that a relationship existed between this period’s <b>positive</b> <b>eugenic</b> ideology and the way that consumer products were marketed to a specific female audience. By presenting an aspirational “eugenic ideal” that promoted motherhood and cast middle-class white women as primarily responsible for the health and strength of the next generation of Americans, these advertisements reflected broader cultural anxieties surrounding race, social and technological change, and shifting gender roles. Drawing upon visual semiotics and historical studies on American advertising, this paper examines a selection of these advertisements to explore how the country’s consumer culture became a space where women’s roles were represented and reinforced, and it looks at how print advertising reflected the widespread ambivalence toward modernity that has come to characterize this period of American history...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Recombinant DNA {{technology}} will soon allow physicians {{an opportunity to}} carry out both somatic cell- and germ-line gene therapy. While somatic cell gene therapy raises no new ethical problems, gene therapy of gametes, fertilized eggs or early embryos does raise several novel concerns. The first issue discussed here relates to making a distinction between negative and positive eugenics; the second issue deals with the evolutionary consequences of lost genetic diversity. In distinguishing between <b>positive</b> and negative <b>eugenics,</b> the concept of malady is applied as a definitional criterion for identifying genetic disorders that could qualify for germ-line therapy. Because gene replacement techniques are currently unavailable for humans, and because {{even if they were}} possible the number of people involved would be quite small, the loss of diversity concern seems moot. Finally, we dissuss the issue of iatrogenic disorders associated with gene therapy and discuss several 'real world considera-tions/ Key Words: germ-line therapy, malady, slippery slop...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} American {{writers in the}} 1920 s demonstrated the eugenic influence on motherhood through fictional representations of violent resistance. My project charts {{the ways in which}} fictional, dramatic, and cinematic texts displayed negative visualizations of maternity {{as a response to the}} early twentieth-century preoccupation with eugenics. In this project, I argue that these methods of opposition took place through actions of child abuse, maternal neglect, and infanticide. Part of this dissertation identifies eugenically motivated cultural discourse, including various forms of the media, that used both overt and subliminal messages to encourage pronatalism among the white upper and middle classes while promoting sterilization and the use of birth control for minority populations. By addressing this rhetoric, I draw attention to the pervading dialogue that influenced and shaped the texts used in the dissertation. In addition, to analyze depictions of <b>positive</b> and negative <b>eugenics</b> is to reveal a social policy powerful enough to go beyond issues of class and race and drastically impact American mothers as a united group; instead of being labeled as a problem of race, color, or class, I argue instead that these American modernist writers interpreted eugenic rhetoric as a problem of gender, common to any woman who found herself with child. While many studies exist on eugenics and literature, as well as on motherhood and literature, the combination of the two topics is one that has previously gone unanalyzed. Therefore, addressing the problems raised by this subject also highlights how both male and female writers were compelled to construct situations of subversive mothering. By situating my project in the 1920 - 1930 time frame, I limit my commentary to how writers approached eugenics during its most popular and influential time period in the United States. My chapters argue that these constructs of subversive motherhood appear through cinematic portrayals of dysgenic children and the negative effects on their maternal figures (The Phantom of the Opera and The Black Stork), unhappiness in the role of mother and outward expressions of anger toward the offspring in question (Edith Summers Kelley 2 ̆ 7 s Weeds), decisive participation in the act of abortion and infanticide (Nella Larsen 2 ̆ 7 s Quicksand), and daughters who refuse to participate in the act of mothering because of their negative upbringings (Edith Wharton 2 ̆ 7 s The Children). By incorporating the genres of fiction, drama, and cinema alongside historical and cultural documents, I inform my audience of the threatening and harmful realities of childbearing during this time period, and will show that the connection between eugenics and motherhood reflects a desire of American writers to reveal the grim repercussions of eugenic practice...|$|R
5000|$|Published in 1913, Racial Hygiene in the United States in America {{discussed}} the similarities of eugenics theories such as negative and <b>positive</b> <b>eugenics</b> and so-called practical social policies like sterilization and immigration. He endorsed “negative” eugenic policies on the practical level, while simultaneously emphasizing their theoretical value, Negative eugenics programs included any activities that discourage or stop the reproduction or continuation of certain peoples deemed inferior. It could also include programs that simply limit certain {{people to the}} state. These programs would include sterilization, immigration bans, separate institutions for different groups, marriage restrictions and more. The people typically picked for negative eugenics were placed in racialized groups or somehow physically or mentally deemed [...] "unfit". <b>Positive</b> <b>eugenics</b> entailed any programs that encourage reproduction, success or admittance into the state of certain groups considered superior. These programs could include restricting abortions, providing financial aid for additional children and more. According to his book, he viewed marriage limits, immigration laws, and forced sterilization as {{the best ways to}} practice eugenics as he observed it in the United States. They were all negative, which was the main criticism about both his work and United States' practice of eugenics.|$|E

Galton suggested that negative eugenics (i.e. an attempt {{to prevent them from}} bearing offspring) should be applied only to those in the lowest social group (the [...] "Undesirables"), while <b>positive</b> <b>eugenics</b> applied to the higher classes.

5000|$|Eugenic {{policies}} have been conceptually divided into two categories. [...] <b>Positive</b> <b>eugenics</b> is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged; for example, the reproduction of the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, in vitro fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning. The movie Gattaca provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to decided what you are capable of and your place in the world. Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally [...] "undesirable". This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning. Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; abortion for fit women, for example, was illegal in Nazi Germany.|$|E

In his early years at Texas, Muller's Drosophila work was slow going; the data from his mutation rate studies were difficult to interpret. In 1923, he began using radium and X-rays, but the relationship between radiation and mutation was difficult to measure because such radiation also sterilized the flies. In this period, he also became involved with eugenics and human genetics. He carried out a study of twins separated at birth that seemed to indicate a strong hereditary component to I.Q.

As Weindling (1989) explained, there had been several movements in Germany since the end of World War I concerned with the 'degeneration' of German racial purity that culminated with the founding in 1927 of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics. [...] Although there had been demands since the early 1920s for legislation on sterilisation and euthanasia, these were rejected because it was believed that <b>positive</b> <b>eugenics</b> was more representative of the Weimar political structures and the nation's social needs.

5000|$|Eugenics {{eventually}} {{referred to}} human selective reproduction with an intent to create children with desirable traits, generally through {{the approach of}} influencing differential birth rates. These policies were mostly divided into two categories: <b>positive</b> <b>eugenics,</b> the increased reproduction of those seen to have advantageous hereditary traits; and negative eugenics, the discouragement of reproduction by those with hereditary traits perceived as poor. Negative eugenic policies {{in the past have}} ranged from paying those deemed to have bad genes to voluntarily undergo sterilization, to attempts at segregation to compulsory sterilization and even genocide. Positive eugenic policies have typically taken the form of awards or bonuses for [...] "fit" [...] parents who have another child. Relatively innocuous practices like marriage counseling had early links with eugenic ideology. Eugenics is superficially related to what would later be known as Social Darwinism. While both claimed intelligence was hereditary, eugenics asserted new policies were needed to actively change the status quo towards a more [...] "eugenic" [...] state, while the Social Darwinists argued society itself would naturally [...] "check" [...] the problem of [...] "dysgenics" [...] if no welfare policies were in place (for example, the poor might reproduce more but would have higher mortality rates).|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, the concept of {{eugenics}} swept through the American scientific community and lay public. Concerned with the production of "better babies" through "better breeding," eugenics found a place among other Progressive Era social movements, such as public health and home economics, that thought to use science to improve social conditions. Eugenists promoted both "negative" eugenics—the use of coercion, isolation, and sterilization to prevent childbearing among those deemed genetically inferior—and "positive" eugenics—the encouragement of increased or improved voluntary childbearing among those of "superior stock. " My research will identify why <b>positive</b> <b>eugenics</b> became so popular among middle-class white women in the United States. By examining newspaper and magazine articles dating from 1900 – 1945, I argue that many middle-class white women supported <b>positive</b> <b>eugenics</b> because 1) it assured women that they could experience more independence, happier marriages, healthier children, and superior parenthood; and 2) it formed areas in which women could exercise authority and build interpersonal relationships with other women. While scholars have portrayed eugenics as simply a tactic to coerce and subjugate women's sexuality and fertility, I instead contend that some middle-class white women supported eugenics because of its promises for self-empowerment...|$|E

Incarceration is no longer related to stated eugenic goals, yet incapacitation in prisons still exerts a prophylactic effect on human reproduction.
