60|$|The {{first thing}} we heard was that Karain's mysterious sword-bearer had died a few days ago. We did not attach much {{importance}} to the news. It was certainly difficult to imagine Karain without his inseparable follower; but the fellow was old, he had never spoken to one of us, we hardly ever had {{heard the sound of}} his voice; and we had come to look upon him as upon something inanimate, as a part of our friend's trappings of state--like that sword he had carried, or the fringed red umbrella displayed during an official progress. Karain did not visit us in the afternoon as usual. A message of greeting and a present of fruit and vegetables came off for us before sunset. Our friend paid us like a banker, but treated us like a prince. We sat up for him till midnight. Under the stern awning bearded Jackson jingled an old guitar and sang, with an execrable accent, Spanish love-songs; while young Hollis and I, sprawling on the deck, had a game of chess by the light of a cargo lantern. Karain did not appear. Next day we were busy unloading, and heard that the Rajah was unwell. The expected invitation to visit him ashore did not come. We sent friendly messages, but, fearing to intrude upon some secret council, remained on board. Early on the third day we had landed all the powder and rifles, and also a six-pounder brass gun with its carriage which we had subscribed together for a present for our friend. The afternoon was sultry. Ragged edges of black clouds peeped over the hills, and invisible thunderstorms circled outside, growling like wild beasts. We got the schooner ready for sea, intending to leave next morning at daylight. All day a merciless sun blazed down into the bay, fierce and pale, as if at white heat. Nothing moved on the land. The beach was empty, the villages seemed deserted; the trees far off stood in unstirring clumps, as if painted; the white smoke of some invisible bush-fire spread itself low over the shores of the bay like a settling fog. Late in the day three of Karain's chief men, dressed in their best and armed to the teeth, came off in a canoe, bringing a case of dollars. They were gloomy and languid, and told us they had not seen their Rajah for five days. No one had seen him! We settled all accounts, and after shaking hands in turn and in profound silence, they descended one after another into their boat, and were paddled to the shore, sitting close together, clad in vivid colours, with hanging heads: the gold embroideries of their jackets flashed dazzlingly as they went away gliding on the smooth water, and not one of them looked back once. Before sunset the growling clouds carried with a rush the ridge of hills, and came tumbling down the inner slopes. Everything disappeared; black whirling vapours filled the bay, {{and in the midst of}} them the schooner swung here and there in the shifting gusts of wind. A single clap of thunder detonated in the hollow with a violence that seemed capable of bursting into small pieces the ring of high land, and a warm deluge descended. The wind died out. We panted in the close cabin; our faces streamed; the bay outside hissed as if boiling; the water fell in <b>perpendicular</b> <b>shafts</b> as heavy as lead; it swished about the deck, poured off the spars, gurgled, sobbed, splashed, murmured in the blind night. Our lamp burned low. Hollis, stripped to the waist, lay stretched out on the lockers, with closed eyes and motionless like a despoiled corpse; at his head Jackson twanged the guitar, and gasped out in sighs a mournful dirge about hopeless love and eyes like stars. Then we heard startled voices on deck crying in the rain, hurried footsteps overhead, and suddenly Karain appeared in the doorway of the cabin. His bare breast and his face glistened in the light; his sarong, soaked, clung about his legs; he had his sheathed kriss in his left hand; and wisps of wet hair, escaping from under his red kerchief, stuck over his eyes and down his cheeks. He stepped in with a headlong stride and looking over his shoulder like a man pursued. Hollis turned on his side quickly and opened his eyes. Jackson clapped his big hand over the strings and the jingling vibration died suddenly. I stood up.|$|E

She was greatly disconcerted when she saw what consequences he meant and at his reminding her of them. What on earth was the use of a lover if he was to speak only like one's grandmother and one's aunt?

He evidently also believed that she would be dragged down; in other words that she would not be asked out. It was his idea that her mother would contaminate her, so that he should find himself interested in a young person discredited and virtually unmarriageable. All this was more obvious to him than the consideration that a daughter should be merciful. Where was his religion if he understood mercy so little, and where were his talent and his courage if he were so miserably afraid of trumpery social penalties? Rose's heart sank when she reflected that a man supposed to be first-rate hadn't guessed that rather than not do what she could for her mother she would give up all the Engineers in the world.

A series of static and dynamic numerical simulations is conducted using a nonlinear {{finite element analysis program}} to investigate the bearing behavior and responses of the bridge foundation under rock impact. The rock impact load is evaluated according to the site conditions. The deflection histories at the striking point and the internal forces in the drilled shafts during rock impacts in different directions are analyzed. The bridge pier exhibits significant system effects: the failure of the bridge pier is initiated by the failure of one pier column or one drilled shaft first, followed by the failure of the entire pier. The effects of impact loading direction, striking location, and characteristics of impact load on the behavior of the bridge pier are examined through a parametric study. The capacities of the pier along different loading directions are different due to differences in the group effects of the drilled shafts.

50|$|Mathematically, {{the moment}} of inertia of the wheel is a tensor. That is, to a first {{approximation}} (neglecting deformations due to its elasticity) the wheel and axle assembly are a rigid rotor to which the engine and brakes apply a torque vector aligned with the axle. If that torque vector is not aligned with the principal axis of {{the moment of}} inertia, the resultant angular acceleration {{will be in a}} different direction from the applied torque. Whenever a rotor is forced to rotate about an axis that is not a principal axis, an external torque is needed. This is not a torque about the rotation axis (as in a driving or braking torque), but is a torque perpendicular to that direction. If the rotor is suspended by bearings, this torque is created by reaction forces in the bearings (acting <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>shaft).</b> These reaction forces turn with the shaft as the rotor turns, at every point producing exactly the torque needed to keep the wheel rotating about the non-principal axis. These reaction forces can excite the structure to which they are attached. In the case of a car, the suspension elements can vibrate giving an uncomfortable feel to the car occupants. In practical terms, the wheel will wobble. Automotive technicians reduce the wobble to an acceptable level when balancing the wheel by adding small weights to the inner and outer wheel rims.|$|R

6000|$|... § XVIII. While, however, we {{have been}} thus subdividing or {{assembling}} our shafts, how far has it been possible to retain their curved or tapered outline? So long as they remain distinct and equal, however close to each other, the independent curvature may evidently be retained. But when once they come in contact, it is equally evident that a column, formed of shafts touching at the base and separate at the top, would appear as if in {{the very act of}} splitting asunder. Hence, in all the closely arranged groups, and especially those with a central shaft, the tapering is sacrificed; and with less cause for regret, because it was a provision against subsidence or distortion, which cannot now take place with the separate members of the group. Evidently, the work, if safe at all, must be executed with far greater accuracy and stability when its supports are so delicately arranged, than would be implied by such precaution. In grouping shafts, therefore, a true perpendicular line is, in nearly all cases, given to the pier; and the reader will anticipate that the two schools, which we have already found to be distinguished, the one by its <b>perpendicular</b> and pieced <b>shafts,</b> and the other by its curved and block shafts, will be found divided also in their employment of grouped shafts;--it is likely that the idea of grouping, however suggested, will be fully entertained and acted upon by the one, but hesitatingly by the other; and that we shall find, on the one hand, buildings displaying sometimes massy piers of small stones, sometimes clustered piers of rich complexity, and on the other, more or less regular succession of block shafts, each treated as entirely independent of those around it.|$|R
40|$|Displaced {{fractures}} of the radial neck {{are rare}} in children, and most attempts at closed reduction of these fractures are unsuccessful’. This case report describes the complete {{reversal of the}} position of the proximal end of the radius, which mimicked proper alignment, after attempted closed reduction. Case Report A nine-year-old girl fell on the outstretched left upper extremity. Pain and swelling developed about the left elbow and persisted for two days after the injury. The patient was then brought to a local attempted with the patient under general anesthesia. With fluoro-scopic imaging. the fragment then appeared to be in proper alignment. Some limitation of motion and crepitus persisted. however, and plain radiographs, made in the operating suite, revealed that the radial head and neck had rotated 180 degrees from the normal position (Fig. 2). An arthrotomy was done. at which time the suspected malalign-ment was confirmed. The fracture was reduced. and the bones were fixed with a single oblique Kirschner wire. The distal end of the wire was left protruding through the skin (Fig. 3). A splint was applied. After four weeks, the splint and the wire were removed. A low-grade infection of the pin track was noted. Ten days later, because of increased inflammation and radiographic evidence of osteo-myelitis of the radial head. incision and drainage was performed. hospital. where the left elbow was found to be moderately swollen and tender about the proximal end of the radius. The ranges of motion of the elbow were severely painful and limited. There was no sensory or motor deficit in the extremity. Radiographs revealed a complete fracture of the proximal end of the left radius. The fragment of the radial head and neck lay posterior to the elbow joint and <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>shaft</b> of th...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 In {{the search}} for clean, {{renewable}} energy, the kinetic energy of water currents in oceans, rivers, and estuaries is being studied as a predictable and environmentally benign source. We investigate the flow past a cross flow hydrokinetic turbine (CFHT) in which a helical blade turns around a <b>shaft</b> <b>perpendicular</b> to the free stream under the hydrodynamic forces exerted by the flow. This type of turbine, while {{very different from the}} classical horizontal axis turbine commonly used in the wind energy field, presents advantages in the context of hydrokinetic energy harvesting, such as independence from current direction, including reversibility, stacking, and self-starting without complex pitch mechanisms. This thesis develops a numerical simulation methodology that applies the Reynolds Average Navier Stokes equations and the three-dimensional sliding mesh technique to model CFHTs. The methodology is validated against small scale experiments, available within NNMREC at the University of Washington and is used to investigate the efficiency of the energy capture and the hydrodynamic forces acting on the blades. First, we study the stationary turbine and conclude that the developed methodology accurately models the starting torque of a turbine initially in static conditions; some limitations are found, however, in predicting separated flow. The dynamic performance of the rotating turbine is predicted with reasonable accuracy using the sliding mesh technique. Excellent qualitative agreement with experimental trends is found in the results, and the actual predicted values from the simulations show good agreement with measurements. Though limitations in accurately modeling dynamic stall for the rotating turbine are confirmed, the good qualitative agreement suggests this methodology can be used to support turbine design and performance over a wide range of parameters, minimizing the number of prototypes to build and experiments to run in the pursuit of an optimized turbine. This methodology can also provide a cost-effective way of evaluating detailed full scale effects, such as mooring lines or local bottom bathymetry features, on both turbine performance and environmental assessment...|$|R
