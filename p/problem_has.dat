5|$|Apollonius' <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> other applications. In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his Principia, Isaac Newton {{used his}} {{solution}} of Apollonius' problem {{to construct an}} orbit in celestial mechanics {{from the center of}} attraction and observations of tangent lines to the orbit corresponding to instantaneous velocity. The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are tangent is used in the Hardy–Littlewood circle method of analytic number theory to construct Hans Rademacher's contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an infinite set of Ford circles each of which touches several others. Finally, Apollonius' <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> been applied to some types of packing problems, which arise in disparate fields such as the error-correcting codes used on DVDs and the design of pharmaceuticals that bind in a particular enzyme of a pathogenic bacterium.|$|E

5|$|When {{platinum}} {{was declared}} a strategic government resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were {{made out of}} palladium. As recently as September 2001, palladium was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting. Currently, the casting <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> been resolved and use in jewelry has increased because platinum has increased in price while palladium decreased.|$|E

5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> stimulated {{much further}} work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} circles and the given circles, now known as Descartes' theorem. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket, {{which is one of}} the earliest fractals to be described in print, and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} below, Apollonius' <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> ten special cases, {{depending on}} the nature of the three given objects, which may be a circle (C), line (L) or point (P). By custom, these ten cases are distinguished by three letter codes such as CCP. Viète solved all ten of these cases using only compass and straightedge constructions, and used the solutions of simpler cases to solve the more complex cases.|$|E
30|$|Three-point {{boundary}} value <b>problems</b> <b>have</b> been studied {{extensively in the}} literature. For a discussion of existence and uniqueness results and for applications of three-point problems, see [9 – 12] and the references cited in them. Some approaches to approximating this type of <b>problem</b> <b>have</b> also been considered [13, 14]. However, the algorithms developed in the papers cited above are mainly concerned with regular cases (i.e., when boundary layers are absent). Fitted difference scheme on an equidistant mesh for the numerical solution of the linear three-point reaction-diffusion <b>problem</b> <b>have</b> been studied in [15]. A uniform finite difference method, which is first-order convergent, on an S-mesh (Shishkin type mesh) for a singularly perturbed semilinear one-dimensional convection-diffusion three-point {{boundary value}} <b>problem</b> <b>have</b> also been studied in [16].|$|R

In the past few years, fractional-order boundary value <b>problems</b> <b>have</b> received much attention, and the subject has been developed in an extensive manner. In fact it is a hot topic of research in mathematics and its applications. For some recent results on boundary value problems of fractional differential equations, we refer the reader {{to a series of}} papers [7 – 18] and the references cited therein.|$|R

5|$|Dr. Paul Steiner (Bryant Haliday) and Dr. Christopher Mitchell (Ronald Allen) {{work on a}} {{projection}} device {{that enables them to}} transmit any object within a few miles of the machine.

When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E
5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become more prone to erosion; even {{in areas that are}} no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> been exacerbated by the inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E

5|$|If {{the three}} given circles are {{mutually}} tangent, Apollonius' <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself {{and to the}} other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure12) correspond to the inscribed and circumscribed circles, and are called Soddy's circles. This special case of Apollonius' problem is also known as the four coins problem. The three given circles of this Apollonius problem form a Steiner chain tangent to the two Soddy's circles.|$|E
5|$|The flow of {{the river}} has {{decreased}} in power in recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends {{a good deal of}} silt into the system, slowing the flow and creating a risk of flooding downstream. This <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to be relatively clean.|$|E
5|$|The region, {{as defined}} above, has a total {{population}} of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as Macedonian on a national level, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both Macedonian on a regional, and Greek on a national level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, {{the use of the}} term on a national level lays claims to their history. This disambiguation <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section.|$|E

5|$|The signs s1, s2 and s3 on the {{right-hand}} sides of the equations may be chosen in eight possible ways, and each choice of signs gives up to two solutions, since the equation for r's is quadratic. This might suggest (incorrectly) that there are up to sixteen solutions of Apollonius' problem. However, due to a symmetry of the equations, if (r's, x's, y's) is a solution, with signs s'i, then so is (−r's, x's, y's), with opposite signs −s'i, which represents the same solution circle. Therefore, Apollonius' <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> at most eight independent solutions (Figure2). One way to avoid this double-counting is to consider only solution circles with non-negative radius.|$|E
5|$|The water {{also appears}} murky {{due to a}} high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, {{prevents}} photosynthetic stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.|$|E
5|$|Transport in Cameroon {{is often}} difficult. Except for the several {{relatively}} good toll roads which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained {{and subject to}} inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred. Roadblocks often serve little other purpose than to allow police and gendarmes to collect bribes from travellers. Road banditry has long hampered transport along the eastern and western borders, and since 2005, the <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> intensified in the east as the Central African Republic has further destabilised.|$|E

5|$|The all-pairs widest path <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> {{applications}} in the Schulze method for choosing a winner in multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, {{and the winner is}} the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results of an election using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{difficulty of}} the clique <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> led it {{to be used to}} prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a clique of a given size is a monotone graph property, meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it will exist in any supergraph. Because this property is monotone, there must exist a monotone circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices. Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial. Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded fan-in must be at least a polynomial in the clique size.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then any circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
