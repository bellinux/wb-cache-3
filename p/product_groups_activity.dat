This paper summarizes significant US national contributions to the current SISO Coalition Battle Management Language (C-BML) <b>Product</b> Development <b>Group</b> <b>activities.</b> It focuses on application of the well-known principles of BML in the joint warfighting context to enable command and control of simulated Joint and Coalition forces. The JBML design is characterized by three layers that enable configurable solutions, {{not only from the}} information system perspective, but also from a domain-specific information exchange view. The main ideas are to assemble meaningful sentences of domain-specific information elements in an unambiguous structure that captures the commander’s intent (domain services), defined in terms of meaningful objects that compose data into information elements of general application (composite services), and represented using standardized data elements that are entities of the JC 3 IEDM (atomic services), which provides a standard vocabulary for all three layers.

This paper summarizes significant US national contributions to the current Coalition Battle Management Language (C-BML) <b>Product</b> Development <b>Group</b> <b>activities.</b> It focuses on application of the well-known principles of BML in the joint warfighting context that will support a Joint Event in 2007. The JBML design is characterized by several layers that enable configurable solutions, {{not only from the}} information system perspective, but also from a domain-specific information exchange view. The main ideas are to capture standardized data elements (atomic services), compose the elements into meaningful objects representing data in context of a general application (composite services) and use the resulting information elements to form domain-specific information elements (domain services). The services are implemented as Web services supporting C-BML Phase 1. The domain configuration is based on a general Grammar schema derived from initial work in formal languages to support C-BML Phase 2. Finally, an initial version of the domain-specific knowledge is formalized as an initial step toward the development of ontologies in C-BML Phase 3. All information exchange specifications are tightly connected with the Joint Command, Control and Consultation Information Exchange Data Model (JC 3 IEDM), although the higher levels of JBML introduce abstractions that encapsulate the complexity of the underlying data model intended to make the consistent application of JBML easier for the user.

40|$|Does {{competitive}} pressure foster innovation? In addressing this important question, prior studies ignored {{a distinction between}} discrete innovation aiming at entirely new technology and continuous improvement consisting of numerous incremental improvements and modifications made upon the existing technology. This paper shows that distinguishing between {{these two types of}} innovation will lead to a much richer understanding of the interplay between firm’ incentives to innovate and {{competitive pressure}}. In particular, our model predicts that, in contrast to previous theoretical findings, an increase in competitive pressure measured by product substitutability may decrease firms’ incentives to conduct continuous improvement, and that an increase in the size of discrete innovation may decrease firms’ incentives to conduct continuous improvement. A unique feature of this paper is its exploration of the model’s real-world relevance and usefulness through field research. Motivated by recent declines in levels of continuous improvement in Japanese manufacturing, we conducted extensive field research at two Japanese manufacturing firms. After presenting our findings, we demonstrate that our model guides us to focus on several key changes taking place at these two firms; discover their interconnectedness; and finally ascertain powerful underlying forces behind each firm’s decision to weaken its investment in traditional continuous improvement activities.
