50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method is}} gravity casting where the resin is {{poured into the}} mold and pulled down into all the parts by gravity. When the two part resin is mixed air bubbles tend to be introduced into the liquid which can be removed in a vacuum chamber. The casting can also {{be done in a}} vacuum chamber (when using open molds) to either extract these bubbles, or in a <b>pressure</b> <b>pot,</b> to reduce their size {{to the point where they}} aren't visible. Pressure and/or centrifugal force can be used to help push the liquid resin into all details of the mold. The mold can also be vibrated to expel bubbles.|$|E
50|$|Pressurized mold castingDue to {{the nature}} of oxygen {{entrapment}} in epoxy during the pouring and curing period it is common to have distortions and cavitation in the final injection mold. Pressurizing epoxy during the curing period is a form of surface quality retention. External pressures can be created {{with the use of a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>pot</b> connected to an air compressor. The external pressure causes air to be trapped inside the epoxy mold and crushed during curing. As time passes over a 24-hour period the oxygen bubbles will not be able to escape and will cure directly inside the mold. With sufficient pressure these small cavitation holes will be invisible to the naked eye.|$|E

40|$|Batch {{cultures}} of mouse LS cells were grown in suspension at controlled dissolved oxygen partial <b>pressures</b> (<b>pOt).</b> At low pOt (i- 6 mmHg) {{the growth and}} respiration rates and the final cell population were all limited. At high pOt (320 mmHg), cell division was inhibited after an initial doubling of the cell number. At intermediate values of pOt, the growth rate was constant but the final cell population varied. Within the^>O 2 range of 40 - 100 mmHg, the final cell population was constant and maximal at 1 - 2 x 10 s viable cells/ml. Except at 320 mmHg pOt, about 90 % of the glucose consumed served as an energy source and could be accounted for as lactate and CO,. In the culture at 320 mmHg, only 60 % of the glucose consumed could be accounted for in this way. During growth the production of lactate and pyruvate was highest at low pOt. A sharp increase in lactate production was observed as logarithmic growth ceased in each culture, except at high pO % (160 mmHg). These observations indicate that pOt markedly influences cell growth and carbohydrate metabolism in these cells...|$|R

40|$|A maxillary {{obturator}} for the edentulous patient {{must be as}} lightweight {{as possible}} and provide for retention, stability, patient comfort, and cleanliness. The weight of a maxillary obturator is often a dislocat-ing factor. Patients who have hollow obturators may complain of food, fluid, and mucous accumulations that result in bad odors and altered taste sensation. This tip describes a simple, quick technique for using an autopolymerizing resin to convert an existing hol-low obturator into a hollow bulb (Fig. 1). PROCEDURE 1. Use utility wax to fill in and shape the bulb por-tion of the obturator (Fig. 2). 2. Use impression plaster to fabricate a matrix of the obturator bulb (Fig. 3). 3. Remove the utility wax, and relieve the area where bonding with autopolymerizing resin will take place. Make dovetail groves with an inverted cone bur for added retention. Wet the obturator area with fresh monomer. 4. Place mixed autopolymerizing acrylic resin into the matrix, making sure the acrylic touches and coats all surfaces of the matrix (Fig. 4). 5. Firmly place the prosthesis into the matrix, keeping the lid side down. Allow ample time for it to cure with a rubber band wrapped firmly around the prosthesis and matrix (Fig. 5). Use the unused portion of the autopolymerizing acrylic as a gauge for determining when the acrylic has set. It is crucial that the obturator not be placed in warm water or a <b>pressure</b> <b>pot</b> during curing. Heat will cause the gas inside the bulb to expand and push through the seal, cre-ating a hole; a <b>pressure</b> <b>pot</b> will cause the gas to shrink, creating a suck-in defect that will disrupt the bulb’s seal. 6.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for many years from {{theoretical}} consideration that the first arrival part of a refracted seismic wave should have a waveform given by the time integral of the original wave (Jeffreys 1926). Quantitatively this is difficult to verify experimentally from field refraction records, although {{it is one of the}} causes of the “rounding ” of the first part of the refracted waveform. However, by using seismic model techniques the experimental verification both of the wave shape and of the amplitude predicted by equation (I) becomes possible, and this note describes such experiments. Liquid media were used throughout the experiments. An electric spark immersed in the medium overlying the refractor simulated the seismic explosive source, and a lead zirconate transducer horizontally separated from the source by distance R (see figure) received the refracted wave.

40|$|In the {{tropical}} fresh water fish, Synbranchus marmoratus, transition from water breathing to air breathing, induced {{by reduction of}} oxygen partial <b>pressure</b> (<b>Pot)</b> in the environmental water below 16 mmHg, causes a con-siderable rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pcojt from 5 - 6 to 26 mmHg on the average (half time of the rise between 2 and 6 - 5 h). The associated fall in arterial plasma pH by about o- 6 units is not com-pensated {{by an increase in}} plasma bicarbonate concentration, whereas the intracellular pH of white skeletal muscle and heart muscle is kept almost constant by elevation of the intracellular bicarbonate concentration. The additional bicarbonate is generated by intracellular non-bicarbonate buffer-ing, and by net transfer into the intracellular space of bicarbonate formed by buffering in blood. Only a relatively small quantity of bicarbonate is taken up from environmental water. This type of acid-base regulation, with almost complete intracellular pH compensation and only minor bicarbonate uptake (equivalent H+ release or OH ~ uptake) from water, is attributed to several factors. Probably {{the most important of these}} is the lack of continuous contact of the gills, which are the main site of ion transfer processes, with the environmental water during air breathing. Regardless of the mechanisms involved, this particular strategy of acid-base regulation provides a constant milieu for the intracellular structures and demonstrates the prevalence of intracellular over extra-cellular acid-base regulation...|$|E
40|$|Provisional crowns may be {{used for}} many weeks during healing of soft tissues, while other dental {{procedures}} are being performed and whilst the permanent restorations are being fabricated. The provisional occlusion they present serves a diagnostic purpose for fine tuning biological and biomechanical requirements. They need to be strong enough to withstand masticatory forces during this time, as it is costly, inconvenient and time consuming to repair breakages. There is no ideal provisional crown material, and new products appear on the market regularly. Dentists need to know which perform best in terms of strength, durability, ease of use, aesthetics and cost to facilitate selection and purchase. This study was undertaken to compare the compressive strengths of seven different provisional crown materials, consisting of three acrylic resins, three composites and one CAD/CAM fabricated sample set. A custom-made stainless steel split mould was constructed having a circular opening of 4 mm in diameter and 6 mm in-depth and was used to prepare ten specimens for each material. For the composites, the various materials were syringed into the circular openings and compacted using a ball burnisher. After five minutes, specimens were removed.

40|$|Summary Pressure {{transducers}} {{were attached}} to twigs of or-chard trees and potted trees of walnut (Juglans regia L.) to measure winter stem xylem <b>pressures.</b> Experimental <b>potted</b> trees were partially defoliated {{in the late summer}} and early au-tumn to lower the amount of stored carbohydrates. Potted trees were placed in cooling chambers and subjected to various tem-perature regimes, including freeze–thaw cycles. Xylem pres-sures were inversely proportional to the previous 48 -h air temperature, but positively correlated with the osmolarity of the xylem sap. Defoliated trees had significantly lower concen-trations of stored carbohydrates and significantly lower xylem sap osmolarities than controls. Plants kept at 1. 5 °C developed xylem pressures up to 40 kPa, just 7 % of the theoretical os-motic pressure of the xylem sap. However, exposure to low, nonfreezing temperatures followed by freeze–thaw cycles re-sulted in pressures over 210 kPa, which was 39 % of the theo-retical osmotic pressure. A simple osmotic model could account for the modest positive winter pressures at low, nonfreezing temperatures, but not for the synergistic effects of freeze–thaw cycles...|$|R

Condensate liquids are very non-ideal, suggesting that results of previous attempts to model their formation using ideal solution models are highly inaccurate. As is the case for the Berman (1983) liquid model itself, results of the present calculations are in very good agreement with experimentally determined liquid-crystal phase relations except where intermediate members of solid so-lution series, such as melilite and fassaite, are predicted to be in equilibrium with liquid, in which cases liquid-crystal equilibration temperatures are overestimated by 50 to 100 K. CMAS liquids are stable in a solar gas at a P " at least as low as 5 × 10 - 2 atm and perhaps as low as 1 × 10 2 atm, much lower than previous estimates for liquids of pure forsterite composition, due to the colligative ffects of Cat and A 1203.

Proximal geometric deformation increases the rate of in-stent restenosis and target lesion revascularization. MethodsA bifurcation bench model {{was used to compare}} KBI alone, KBI after POT, KBI with asymmetric inflation <b>pressure</b> after <b>POT,</b> and 2 sequences without KBI: initial POT plus SBI, and initial POT plus SBI with final POT (called “re-POT”). For each protocol, 5 stents were tested using 2 different drug-eluting stent designs: that is, a total of 60 tests. ResultsCompared with the classic KBI-only sequence and those associating POT with modified KBI, the re-POT sequence gave significantly (p < 0. 05) better geometric results: it reduced SB ostium stent-strut obstruction from 23. 2 ± 6. 0 % to 5. 6 ± 8. 3 %, provided perfect proximal stent apposition with almost perfect circularity (ellipticity index reduced from 1. 23 ± 0. 02 to 1. 04 ± 0. 01), reduced proximal area overstretch from 24. 2 ± 7. 6 % to 8. 0 ± 0. 4 %, and reduced global strut malapposition from 40 ± 6. 2 % to 2. 6 ± 1. 4 %. ConclusionsIn comparison with 5 other techniques, the re-POT sequence significantly optimized the final result of provisional coronary bifurcation stenting, maintaining circular geometry while significantly reducing SB ostium strut obstruction and global strut malapposition. These experimental findings confirm that provisional stenting may be optimized more effectively without KBI using re-POT...|$|R

This idea will be tested with a 120 GeV/c proton beam on the LSS 5 straight section at the SPS accelerator ring (CERN) using several crystal technologies and a high performance tracking system based on high resolution (5 pm) double-side microstrip silicon detectors. The first silicon detector will be positioned in a roman pot at about 50 m from the crystal, where the phase difference of 90 maximizes the distance of the steered particles (due to the crystal) from the beam core; after around 20 m a second tracking station will be able to measure the steering angle. Each detector side is readout by three 128 channel VA 1 TA self-triggering ASICs, which contain a preamplifier, two shapers and a sample and hold circuit; the analog signals are digitized by one 10 MHz ADC (per ASIC) and are carried to the DAQ system (which is located on ground) by a series of fiber links (GOH).

30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable seedling tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the seedling tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the seedling tray is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling tray conveyor belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the seedling tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the seedling tray enters the conveyor belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by <b>pressure</b> sensor. The <b>potted</b> vegetable seedling is taken out from the seedling tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism.
