40|$|Definition of {{back pain}} {{is one of}} the main {{problems}} associated with epidemiological studies of back pain which is generally acknowledged to be a disabling but not fatal condition. Certainly the sickness absence attributable to it is substantial though one can argue inter-minably about the exact number of days lost per thousand men at work, principally because of poor certification and lack of agreement on definition. Some personal characteristics such as age, weight, and structural defects of the spinal column do seem to predispose to back pain. Apart from the rather blunt instrument of secondary prevention either by <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> or by routine screen-ing during employment (particularly of those doing heavy work) it is doubtful if any preventive measures can be undertaken in relation to these factors.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{concerned}} with obtaining evidence to explore {{the proposition that the}} provision of occupational health services as arranged at the present time represents a misallocation of resources. The research has been undertaken within the occupational health service of a large Midlands food factory. As the research progressed it became evident that questions were being raised about the nature and scope of occupational health as well as the contribution, in combating danger at work, that occupational health services can make to the health and safety team. These questions have been scrutinized in depth, as they are clearly important, and a resolution of the problem of the definition of occupational health has been proposed. I have taken the approach of attempting to identify specific objectives or benefits of occupational health activities so {{that it is possible to}} assess how far these objectives are being achieved. I have looked at three aspects of occupational health; audiometry, physiotherapy and <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examinations</b> as these activities embody crucial concepts which are common to all activities in an occupational health programme. A three category classification of occupational health activities is proposed such that the three activities provide examples within each category. These are called personnel therapy, personnel input screening and personnel throughput screening. I conclude that I have not shown audiometry to be cost-effective. My observations of the physiotherapy service lead me to support the suggestion that there is a decline in sickness absence rates due to physiotherapy in industry. With <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examinations</b> I have shown that the service is product safety oriented and that benefits are extremely difficult to identify. In regard to the three services studied, in the one factory investigated, and because of the immeasurability of certain activities, I find support for the proposition that the mix of occupational health services as provided at the present time represents a misallocation of resources...|$|R
40|$|In a {{questionnaire}} survey {{the prevalence of}} back pain in 163 helicopter pilots was compared {{to that in a}} control group of 297 non-flying air force officers who underwent the same <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examination.</b> Since pilots document their hours of flight in a personal flight log, an accurate estimate of the duration of exposure could be made.

'Transient' back pain of a short duration was more frequent amongst the pilots compared to the control group, and the prevalence of 'chronic' back pain of a persistent nature was also higher amongst the helicopter pilots. Transient back pain seemed to be most strongly related to the average hours of flight per day, whereas chronic back pain was more closely related to total hours of flight or the accumulative vibration dose. A significant higher prevalence of this chronic back pain was observed only after 2000 hours of flight or a vibration dose of 400 m 2 h/s 4.

40|$|Men with {{different}} patterns of sickness absence behaviour {{have been identified}} from a refinery population by simple epidemiological techniques. A detailed clinical study is described of four groups: 56 men with five or more sickness spells in I 964 and a matched control of 56 men; 35 men who had 6 o or more days of sickness absence in I 964; and finally 47 men who had not had one day off sick for at least eight years. Whereas {{the men who were}} frequently sick tended to be younger and mostly on day work, those with long periods of sickness were reasonably representative of the whole population, and the men without any sickness absence were older and mostly on shift work. An analysis of records both before and since i 964 showed that the groups had maintained a consistent pattern of sickness absence, but when individuals were considered their behaviour was less consistent.

40|$|I {{read with}} great {{interest}} the paper of Mclouglin and Jenkins [1]. They address a vital issue in clinical aviation medicine, and conclude that {{the current system of}} <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> is of limited value. I would like to add some remarks from my personal point of view. The Royal Air Force is in a privileged position if they can obtain a general practitioner report for applicants prior to training to confirm the medical history. For legal reasons, this is impossible in Germany, possibly leading to a devaluation of the initial examination. For future changes in the content and frequency of aircrew periodic medical examinations, two points of view should be considered: the aero medical community should establish a consensus (like the 1 % rule) for the amount of medical risk that can be accepted for aviation safety. If the magnitude of the acceptable risk is known and clear, pre-employment medical examinations can be tailored to detect that risk. A second important issue would be a consensus on the acceptable amount of false-positive findings obtained in the pre-employment medical examinations. Since the prevalence of any disorder in the flying community is presumed to be low, the positive predictive value of any test will be low. In the normal care-giving medical situation, the a priori probability for the target disorder can be determined by history and physical examination. As the authors have outlined, withholding of information cannot be ruled out in the aircrew examination, thus necessitating the use of screening tests in the pre-employment medical exam-ination without clinical indication...|$|E

40|$|In 2013, {{the number}} of foreigners working as factory labor-ers in Korea was {{approximately}} 500, 000 [1].

These nations are still known as endemic areas of parasitic infections, for ex-ample, {{according to a recent survey}} conducted in Vietnam, 47 % of the study population was positive for parasites such as Ascaris lumbricoides (24 %), Trichuris trichiura (40 %), and Ent-amoeba histolytica (6 %) [2]. The prospective foreigner workers undergo a pre-employment medical examination; however, no screening test for parasitic infections is included. Most par-asitic diseases are easily treatable after early diagnosis, but can cause severe complications if undetected and untreated, there-by negatively impact upon worker’s productivity. Recently in Korea, a 25 -year-old Uzbek male complaining of abdominal pain was admitted to a hospital, and finally was diagnosed as cystic echinococcosis [3]. Since he had already been working for 3 years in his home country, early diagnosis through <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> certainly would have proved helpful for him and his industry, not to mention Ko-rea.

40|$|Aim. As pre-employment {{screening}} and selection is a main {{function in the}} protection of susceptible applicants from developing an occupational disease, we need insight into {{the effectiveness of this}} intervention under different exposure conditions. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of three indicators {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} pre-employment examinations. Method. We used a pre-employment medical evaluation table to gather the data needed for the indicators for effectiveness. The first indicator chosen is the predictive value of a positive test result (PPV) corresponding to the percentage of applicants who will develop an occupational disease after a positive test result. The second indicator is the number of pre-employment medical examinations needed to reduce the number of new cases of an occupational disease by one (number needed to test, NNT). The third is the number of rejections for the job, as the consequence of a positive test result, needed to reduce the number of new cases of an occupational disease by one (number needed to reject, NNR). To illustrate feasibility and usefulness, we used the example of potroom asthma in the primary-aluminium industry. We used data on personal risk factors and on the incidence of potroom asthma from a nested case-control study in the Netherlands. Results. The three indicators for effectiveness could be applied. For high incidence rates, defined as 0. 04 (40 cases/ 1, 000 employees per year), the PPV values for personal risk indicators varied from 5 % to 27 %. The NNT varied from 116 to 667. Finally, the NNR varied from 4 to 20. For low incidence rates, defined as 0. 005 (5 cases/ 1, 000 employees per year), the PPV values were low (0. 6 % to 5 %). The NNT were high (1, 111 to 5, 000). The NNR varied from 23 to 155. Conclusion. The three indicators for effectiveness are applicable under the condition of the availability of relevant empirical data. The indicators provided useful information for the evaluation of the effectiveness of specific tests, which might be added as selection criteria. The personal risk factors studied were far from effective as selection instruments, especially in situations where a low incidence of potroom asthma exists. Personal risk factors at the pre-employment stage should not be added to the standard procedure to select susceptible applicants. Under conditions, they may be taken into account in a workers' health surveillance programme. As a contribution to evidence-based occupational medicine, we recommend the use of the pre-employment medical evaluation table and the three chosen indicators for effectiveness as a standard tool to evaluate the effectiveness of <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examination...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Hepatitis B (HBV) and C viruses (HCV) {{are among}} the most {{frequent}} blood borne pathogens. According to WHO, 5 % of healthcare workers (in central Europe), are exposed to at least one sharps injury contaminated with HBV per year, 1, 7 % - contaminated with HCV. Aims: The aims of the study were to determine prevalence of HCV and HBV infections, vaccination efficacy against hepatitis B and usefulness of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing in prophylactic examinations in healthcare workers (HCWs). Material and Methods: In a group of 520 healthcare workers, a survey, laboratory and serologic tests such as ALT, HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBcT and anti-HCV were carried out. Results: The study revealed a low rate of workers with presence of HBsAg and anti-HCV (1, 2 % and 0, 8 % respectively). Anti-HBcT was found in 99 subjects (19 %) without a significant association with experiencing an occupational percutaneous injury. Being vaccinated against HBV was declared by 90 % of the subjects. There was no relationship between ALT level rise and positive HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HBcT tests. Conclusion: A seroprevalence of HBV and HCV markers in HCWs found in the study is low and similar to the one found in general population. Current or past hepatitis B infections were independent of needle stick injuries. Vaccination against HBV coverage, although found to be high, should improve to 100 %. Occupational prophylactic <b>medical</b> <b>examinations</b> found performing ALT test (obligatory in Poland for HCWs) not helpful.

40|$|We {{developed}} an evidence-based practice guideline to support {{occupational safety and}} health (OSH) professionals in assessing the risk due to lifting and in selecting effective preventive measures for low back pain (LBP) in the Netherlands. The guideline was developed {{at the request of the}} Dutch government by a project team of experts and OSH professionals in lifting and work-related LBP. The recommendations for risk assessment were based on the quality of instruments to assess the risk on LBP due to lifting. Recommendations for interventions were based on a systematic review of the effects of worker- and work directed interventions to reduce back load due to lifting. The quality of the evidence was rated as strong (A), moderate (B), limited (C) or based on consensus (D). Finally, eight experts and twenty-four OSH professionals commented on and evaluated the content and the feasibility of the preliminary guideline. For risk assessment we recommend loads heavier than 25 kg always to be considered a risk for LBP while loads less than 3 kg do not pose a risk. For loads between 3 - 25 kg, risk assessment shall be performed using the Manual handling Assessment Charts (MAC) -Tool or National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lifting equation. Effective work oriented interventions are patient lifting devices (Level A) and lifting devices for goods (Level C), optimizing working height (Level A) and reducing load mass (Level C). Ineffective work oriented preventive measures are regulations to ban lifting without proper alternatives (Level D). We do not recommend worker-oriented interventions but consider personal lift assist devices as promising (Level C). Ineffective worker-oriented preventive measures are training in lifting technique (Level A), use of back-belts (Level A) and <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examinations</b> (Level A).

40|$|Anderson, J. A. D. (1971). Brit. J. industr. Med., 28, 103 - 121. Rheumatism in industry: a review. Information about causes, effects, and {{prevention}} of rheumatic disease among industrial workers lacks standardization, {{as shown by the}} literature in this field; one {{reason for this is that}} there are discrepancies about the range of diseases and syndromes which should be included under this heading. The Industrial Survey Unit of the Arthritis and Rheumatism Council defined a rheumatic complaint as musculo-skeletal pain not related to recent (i. e., within six weeks) trauma. A study by the Unit of the social and economic effects of rheumatism among 2 684 male employees from a range of manual occupations is considered in relation to the observations made by other investigators. Sickness absence (at present estimated to be about 29 · 8 million working days per annum in Britain) and premature retirement can be shown to result directly from rheumatic complaints, especially rheumatoid arthritis and disc disease; furthermore, there seems to be general agreement that sickness absence is more marked in heavy manual occupations than in light ones. However, the extent to which job changes ascribed to rheumatic complaints are in fact caused by them is more doubtful. Evidence supporting the view that occupational factors are related to the aetiology of some chronic rheumatic diseases is fairly strong. Chronic tenosynovitis, bursitis, osteoarthrosis, and, to a lesser extent, disc disease are among those in which such a relationship can be demonstrated; however, the reason why some men are more prone to develop these conditions than others working in similar jobs is still in doubt, suggesting that the aetiology is multifactorial. In other rheumatic diseases, notably rheumatoid arthritis, a fairly extensive study of the literature does not indicate any clear correlation between occupation and aetiology. A system of job analysis for individual workers based on effort, posture, and climatic conditions at work is suggested. Its use as an alternative to grouping employees under their occupational titles might help to clarify these points. Prevention of rheumatic disease (including the use of <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examinations)</b> seems impracticable at the present time, but some progress in tackling the problems of rheumatism among industrial workers might be possible by improving rehabilitative services. These improvements would depend on closer collaboration not only between government departments but among doctors themselves and between them and others working in this field...|$|R

In addition, in recent years, the demographics of flight attendants have changed to include increased numbers of females on international routes and of males on domestic services, older age groups (as the average career span of a female flight attendant has increased from 18 months to 15 years), and pregnant crew.

40|$|Policy & {{practice}} Evidence {{base for}} <b>pre-employment</b> <b>medical</b> screening Joseph Pachman a Abstract This paper examines the evidence {{base for the}} use of pre-employment/pre-placement <b>medical</b> <b>examinations.</b> The use of pre-employment examinations is often driven more by cultural practices than evidence. There is a lack of evidence on their effectiveness in preventing health-related occupational risks. Hypertension screening is highlighted as a common pre-employment practice {{for which there is no}} standardized criteria to use to determine fitness for work. There are inherent problems in screening for psychiatric disorders and substance abuse as well as potential for racial bias and other unintended negative effects. This paper questions the economic case for this practice and also expresses concerns about paternalism related to identified risk factors. Health assessments should only be included when appropriate to the task environment and the general use of pre-employment exams and drug screening should be eliminated. Generally, a health assessment by questionnaire should suffice. Occupational health providers should advise against the application of physical or mental standards that are not relevant to fulfilment of the essential job functions. Consensus development regarding best practice, as well as consideration for acquiring outcome data related to pre-employment practice, is recommended.
