However, the overall behaviour of the current-time transient is similar and can be divided into four main stages, which provides a powerful in-situ method to control nanotube-nanowire transition during growth. The palladium nanotube arrays have a polycrystalline structure, but a preferred orientation along the (110) direction was observed for the arrays of nanowires.

40|$|Ocean Drilling Program Leg 120 {{recovered}} basement {{samples that}} consisted of zeolite-facies metabasalts at Sites 747, 749, and 750 on the Kerguelen Plateau. These basalts were metamorphosed in the low to intermediate zones of the zeolite facies, {{as indicated by the}} presence of diagnostic zeolites and the absence of chlorite, epidote, prehnite, pumpellyite, and wairakite. Chabazite, natrolite, thompsonite, mesolite, stilbite, huelandite, and smectites occur as amygduloidal fillings in basalts <b>from</b> <b>Holes</b> 747 C and 750 B, whereas only stilbite, laumontite, and pure and mixed-layered smectites were identified in amygduloidal basalts <b>from</b> <b>Hole</b> 749 C. In the lower sections of Hole 749 C, only laumontite and mixed-layered smectites coexist. Based on calculations with published experimental phase equilibria, the absence of wairakite in basalts <b>from</b> <b>Hole</b> 749 C and of laumontite in basalts <b>from</b> <b>Holes</b> 747 C and 750 B suggests that metamorphic temperatures did not exceed approximately 225 ° and 120 °C, respectively. The presence of well-developed zeolite mineral assemblages and the absence of carbonate and clay mineral assemblages restricts XCO 2 in the fluid to approximately <= 0. 0075. Low- to intermediate-zone zeolite-facies mineral assemblages in basalts from the Kerguelen Plateau can be accounted for by metamorphism in an active geothermal area such as present-day Iceland...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIODP Expedition 352 cored {{igneous rocks}} from the Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc crust. Cores from Sites U 1440 and U 1441 {{recovered}} Eocene basalts and related rocks and cores from Sites U 1439 and U 1442 recovered Eocene boninites and related rocks. We selected samples <b>from</b> <b>Holes</b> U 1439 C, U 1440 B and U 1442 A for palaeointensity measurements. Hysteresis measurements and high and low-temperature magnetization curves show that samples <b>from</b> <b>Hole</b> U 1440 B undergo magneto-chemical changes when heated and are mostly composed of single-domain (SD) or pseudo-single-domain (PSD) titanomaghemite. In contrast, the same measurements {{show that most}} selected samples <b>from</b> <b>Holes</b> U 1439 C and U 1442 A are thermally stable and are composed of either SD or PSD titanomagnetite with very little titanium content, or SD ferromagnetic grains with a large paramagnetic contribution. Thellier–Thellier palaeointensity experiments carried out on U 1439 C and U 1442 A samples give a good success rate of 25 / 60 and Virtual Dipole Moment (VDM) values between 1. 3 and 3. 5 × 1022 Am 2.

However, they do not support an inverse relationship between field intensity and reversal rate for this period of time, since the Eocene reversal rate was low...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} basement in DSDP Holes 597 C, 599 B and 601 B is examined in this chapter. These holes were drilled during Leg 92 west of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) crest along 19 °S. Hole 597 C reached a depth of 91 m into the basement with a recovery of about 55 %, so {{it is the most}} successful hole drilled in fast-spreading crust. On the other hand, only drilling breccia and some basaltic cobbles were recovered <b>from</b> <b>Holes</b> 599 B and 601 B. In total, 60 samples of the least altered basalts <b>from</b> <b>Hole</b> 597 C were analyzed. All these basalts were altered to some extent, as is evident from alteration-sensitive parameters. Oxidative seawater alteration influences the upper portion of basement, with considerable uptake of K, Rb, and H 2 O, loss of sulfur, and increased iron oxidation. The lowermost basement was affected by a non-oxidative alteration process, showing only enrichment in H 2 O; the other parameters have values typical of fresh basalts. Despite the alteration, the primary basaltic composition and variations can be established. According to their major and trace element data, the magmas appear to have undergone different degrees of high-level crystal fractionation. Several eruption episodes may have caused the observed downhole variations in Hole 597 C. Four basalt samples <b>from</b> <b>Hole</b> 599 B show the same features as the basalts recovered <b>from</b> <b>Hole</b> 597 C. The three basalt samples <b>from</b> <b>Hole</b> 601 B, on the other hand, are more evolved and can be defined as Fe-Ti basalts, which are commonly described from young EPR crust...|$|R
