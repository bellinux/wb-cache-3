50|$|A burette (also buret) is a {{laboratory}} equipment used in analytical chemistry for the dispensing of variable, and for measuring amount {{of a chemical}} solution. It is a long glass tube with taper end that are attached with a stopcock at {{the opposite of the}} terminal valve. The flow of liquid from the tube to the burette tip is controlled by the stopcock valve.  In General Chemistry lab, the burette utilized a 50-mL volume with a stopcock without lubrication. Mainly, {{there are two types of}} Burette which are volumetric burette and <b>Piston</b> <b>burette</b> or Digital burette. A volumetric burette delivers measured volumes of liquid. Piston burettes are similar to syringes, but with a precision bore and a plunger. Piston burettes may be manually operated or may be motorized. A weight burette delivers measured weights of liquid.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of the chlorinity in natural sea water with a motor driven <b>piston</b> <b>burette</b> is described. A 20 ml burette is sufficient for the entire range of chlo-rinities from 0 to 45 %o. A correction number "k " is tabulated for easy conversion of normalized silver nitrate consumption into chlorinity. The reproducibility and accuracy of this method is the same as for the conventional titration with Knudsen burettes. Rinsing and reading errors and other disadvantages of conventional burettes are eliminated in the new method. A compact and portable set up for the titration is described...|$|E
