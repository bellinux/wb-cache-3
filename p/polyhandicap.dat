30|$|Introduction: Children with <b>polyhandicap</b> are {{a complex}} medical and ethical situation. There are few studies about their {{admission}} {{in intensive care}} units, despite them having a strong risk of acute diseases. Our objetive was to describe the hospitalization of children with <b>polyhandicap</b> in intensive pediatric care units.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion: {{children}} with <b>polyhandicap</b> admitted {{in intensive care}} units are at school age and are mostly having respiratory or neurological failures. There is a strong rate of rehospitalisation. There are few therapeutic limitations that have been found. Anticipating a crisis is a major point {{to provide the best}} care for these children.|$|E
30|$|Patients and methods: This is a {{retrospective}} study in 4 pediatric intensive care units in Paris. Children with <b>polyhandicap</b> hospitalized in emergency from January 1 st 2013 to December 31 st 2015 were included. We looked at epidemiological datas, medical supports and medications at admission and treatment level (respiratory, circulatory, neurologic, invasive procedures), {{and limitations of}} treatments.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesTo date, {{there is}} no {{validated}} tool allowing the assessment of cognitive and motor capacities of patients with <b>polyhandicap</b> (PLH) because of their profound and multiple disabilities because of their severe mental deficiencies and motor handicaps, {{as well as their}} extremely low possibilities to communicate. However, as these patients hardly ever reach the cognitive and motor development of infants older than two years, we hypothesized the level of their development may be assessed by means of an adapted version of the Brunet-Lézine (BL) Scale. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the relevance of the use of the Brunet-Lézine Scale among PLH patients. PatientsForty patients (21 males and 19 females aged 4 to 54) were enrolled in two specialized French Rehabilitation Centers. They were all PLH patients with a combination of motor (pyramidal, extra pyramidal, cerebellar, neuromuscular) deficiencies and a profound mental retardation (IQ could not be assessed); they fully depended on caregivers for their everyday needs (FIM< 30) and they had a very restricted mobility (GMFCS II to V). MethodsThe relevance of the use of Brunet-Lézine Scale among PLH patients was first assessed by describing the distribution of patients’ scores on the four dimensions of the scale. Then the structure of the scale was verified and the convergence of the scores at this scale with other relevant – while not sufficient – scores was assessed: FIM, GMFCS, and a clinical evaluation of sociability and verbalization by another independent caregiver. ResultsPLH patients tend to present low scores on the Brunet-Lézine Scale, which correspond to early developmental stages. Among PLH patients, it sounds more relevant to group the four dimensions of the Brunet-Lézine into two factors: motor activity (posture and coordination) and social interactions (language and sociability). Discussion/conclusionConvergence analyses suggest that the motor and social development of PLH patients may be reliably estimated by means of the Brunet-Lézine Scale...|$|E
