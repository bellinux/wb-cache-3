40|$|International audienceThe {{molecular}} genetics of flower development {{have been studied}} extensively {{for more than two}} decades. Fusion of organs and the tendency to oligomery, important characteristics of flower evolution, so far have remained fairly elusive. We present a geometric model for shape and fusion in the corolla of Asclepiads. Examples demonstrate how fusion of petals creates stable centers, a prerequisite for the formation of complex pollination structures via congenital and postgenital fusion events, with the formation of de novo organs, specific to Asclepiads. The development of the corolla reduces to simple inequalities from the MATHS-BOX. The formation of stable centers and of bell and tubular shapes in flowers are immediate and logical consequences of the shape. Our model shows that any study on flowers, especially in evo-devo perspective should be performed within the wider framework of <b>polymery</b> and oligomery and of fusion and synorganization...|$|E

One {{of the most recent}} approaches covering both the drug delivery as well as the imaging aspects is benefitting from the unique properties of nanomaterials. Therefore a new field called nanomedicine is attracting continuously growing attention. Nanoparticles, including fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) and magnetic nanoparticles, have proven their excellent properties for in vivo imaging techniques in a number of modalities such as magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging, respectively. In this article, we review the main properties and applications of nanoparticles in various in vitro imaging techniques, including microscopy and/or laser breakdown spectroscopy and in vivo methods such as magnetic resonance imaging and/or The {{requirements for}} early diagnostics as well as effective treatment of insidious diseases such as cancer constantly increase the pressure on development of efficient and reliable methods for targeted drug/gene delivery as well as imaging of the treatment success/failure.

40|$|This fort-seventh {{volume of}} the lAC Monographs compries six monographs on organic solvents, one on a solvent stabilizer, three on resin {{monomers}} and modifiers, two on pigments and one on ocupational expsures in paint manufacture and painting. Of the solvents, petroleum solvents, toluene and xylene are used priariy in paints. Cyclohexanone is used priariy as an intermediate {{in the production of}} nylon, although it may be used in sorne paint products. Dimethylformamide is a polymer and resin solvent, and morpholine is used mainly as an intermediate in the production of rubber chemicals and as a corrosion inhibitor. 1, 2 -Epoxyutane is used as a solvent stabilizer, particularly in trichloroethylene. Of the resin monomers, bis(2, 3 -epoxycyclopentyl) ether was used as a resin modifier. Glycidyl ethers have been used similarly; bisphenol A diglycidyl ether is a basic component of many epoxy paints, which <b>polymeries</b> when the uncured resin is mied with a curig agent. Phenol was a common resin monomer used in paints and lacquers when phenolformaldehyde resins were in wide use; such resins are stil used to glue plywoo and other woo products, but other resins have replaced them for the most part in modern paint products. Antimony trioxide is used mainlyin rire retardants; both antimony trioxide and antimon...|$|R
