5|$|Low-pressure {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, reactive sputtering, and other <b>physical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> methods are used as well.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or <b>physical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition).</b>|$|E
5|$|Metal borides {{are used}} for coating tools through {{chemical}} vapor deposition or <b>physical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition.</b> Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through ion implantation or ion beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties {{to those of the}} bulk boride.|$|E

Thin and continuous films can be deposited on carbon substrates, retaining the 3D integrity.

25|$|Thin-film {{deposition}} is {{a process}} applied in the semiconductor industry to grow electronic materials, in the aerospace industry to form thermal and chemical barrier coatings to protect surfaces against corrosive environments, in optics to impart the desired reflective and transmissive properties to a substrate and elsewhere in industry to modify surfaces to {{have a variety of}} desired properties. The deposition process can be broadly classified into <b>physical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In CVD, the film growth takes place at high temperatures, leading to the formation of corrosive gaseous products, and it may leave impurities in the film. The PVD process can be carried out at lower deposition temperatures and without corrosive products, but deposition rates are typically lower. Electron-beam <b>physical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition,</b> however, yields a high deposition rate from 0.1 to 100 μm/min at relatively low substrate temperatures, with very high material utilization efficiency. The schematic of an EBPVD system is shown in Fig 1.|$|E

In this regard, thin film materials for photovoltaic and photoanodes applications have been widely developed in the last decade.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of oxides during annealing and growth in low pressure processes {{is a widely}} known problem. We hence investigate the influence of mere annealing and of growth in vacuum systems {{to shed light on}} the reasons behind the {{reduction of}} perovskites. When comparing the existing literature regarding the reduction of the perovskite model material SrTiO 3 it is conspicuous that one finds different oxygen pressures required to achieve reduction for vacuum annealing and for chemically controlled reducing atmospheres. The unraveling of this discrepancy is of high interest for low pressure <b>physical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>depositions</b> of thin films heterostructures to gain further understanding of the reduction of the SrTiO 3. For thermal annealing, our results prove the attached measurement devices (mass spectrometer/ cold cathode gauge) to be primarily responsible for the reduction of SrTiO 3 in the deposition chamber by shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium to a more reducing atmosphere. We investigated the impact of our findings on the pulsed laser deposition growth at low pressure for LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3. During deposition the reduction triggered by the presence of the laser plume dominates and the impact of the measurement devices plays a minor role. During post annealing a complete reoxidization of samples is inhibited by an insufficient supply of oxygen...|$|R

2500|$|Debate {{over the}} corona's finish {{continued}} into 2014 before being resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts repeatedly urged the architects to use bronze for the scrim, as {{it created a}} [...] "shimmering, lustrous effect under many lighting conditions" [...] and [...] "conveyed dignity, permanence and beauty". Duranar paint was the first substitute proposed by the architects, but the commission members rejected it, noting {{that it had a}} [...] "putty-like appearance under overcast conditions" [...] and visually fell [...] "far short of the beautiful poetic intention promised by the concept design". A second finish, the sprayable metal LuminOre, was rejected by the commission because it was difficult to produce in the high quality needed, and was prone to flaking and discoloration. Electroless plating and anodized aluminum were rejected because they lacked durability. A <b>physical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> process involving a nickel-chrome plating was dismissed for not achieving the right color, luster, or warmth. In early 2014, tests were made with polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF).

2500|$|Metal {{substrates}} {{for use in}} SAMs can {{be produced}} through <b>physical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> techniques, electrodeposition or electroless deposition. Thiol or selenium SAMs produced by adsorption from solution are typically made by immersing a substrate into a dilute solution of alkane thiol in ethanol, though many different solvents can be used besides use of pure liquids. While SAMs are often allowed to form over 12 to 72 hours at room temperature, SAMs of alkanethiolates form within minutes. Special attention is essential in some cases, {{such as that of}} dithiol SAMs to avoid problems due to oxidation or photoinduced processes, which can affect terminal groups and lead to disorder and multilayer formation. In this case appropriate choice of solvents, their degassing by inert gasses and preparation in the absence of light is crucial and allows formation of [...] "standing up" [...] SAMs with free –SH groups. Self-assembled monolayers can also be adsorbed from the vapor phase. In some cases when obtaining an ordered assembly is difficult or when different density phases need to be obtained substitutional self-assembly is used. Here one first forms the SAM of a given type of molecules, which give rise to ordered assembly and then a second assembly phase is performed (e.g. by immersion into a different solution). This method has also been used to give information on relative binding strengths of SAMs with different head groups and more generally on self-assembly characteristics.|$|E
