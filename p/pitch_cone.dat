5000|$|A {{crown gear}} (or a contrate gear) is a gear which has teeth that project {{at right angles}} to the face of the wheel. In particular, a crown gear isa type of bevel gear where the <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> angle is 90 degrees. [...] A <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> of any other angle is simply called a bevel gear. [...] Crown gears {{normally}} mesh with other bevel gears, or sometimes spur gears.|$|E
50|$|Two {{bevel gears}} in mesh is known as bevel gearing. In bevel gearing, the <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> angles of the pinion and gear are to be {{determined}} from the shaft angle, i.e., the angle between the intersecting shafts. Figure shows views of a bevel gearing.|$|E
50|$|The {{spiral angle}} in a {{spiral bevel gear}} is the angle between the tooth trace and {{an element of the}} <b>pitch</b> <b>cone,</b> and {{corresponds}} to the helix angle in helical teeth. Unless otherwise specified, the term spiral angle is understood to be the mean spiral angle.|$|E
40|$|The tooth {{surfaces}} of hypoid pinions are {{generated by the}} 3 rd gear members which are composed of the cutters and their positions or tilting angles on the pinion generators. In such cases, it is useful in the gear factories to apply the cutting <b>pitch</b> <b>cones</b> instead of the <b>pitch</b> <b>cones</b> to the tooth bearing development of hypoid gears. This paper presents relationships between the cutting pitch angles and the tooth bearing patterns introducing the small increment effects of the pinion offset...|$|R
40|$|Tooth bearing {{patterns}} for hypoid gears cannot be described by conventional theory. In gear manufacturing factories, tooth bearing development is still required {{in order to}} obtain good tooth bearing patterns. This paper presents a new method for the development of hypoid tooth bearing patterns which differs from the conventional and experimental gear cutting methods. This report makes it possible to obtain accurate hypoid gear dimensions which consist of the mating pressure angles, spiral angles and <b>pitch</b> angles, <b>pitch</b> <b>cones,</b> and principal directions of the gear tooth surfaces. These dimensions are required in the drawing of the tooth bearing patterns...|$|R

40|$|In general, a {{hypoid gear}} and a {{spiral bevel gear}} for cars {{are made up of}} a formate gear and a {{generated}} pinion. The tooth shape is tapered tooth. Much practice is required to obtain excellent tooth bearing of the tapered tooth. If we convert a tapered tooth to an equi-depth tooth, it is thought that we could easily obtain practical tooth bearing. To date, however, there is no paper that theoretically analyzes tooth bearing of the equi-depth tooth and actually demonstrates it. Therefore the tapered tooth is still used in cars. Thus, we have studied the gear cutting method of the equi-depth tooth hypoid gear. The tooth surface of the hypoid pinion is generated by the 3 rd gear member. In such a case, it is useful to apply the cutting <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> instead of the <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> and to change the generating shaft angle to the tooth bearing development of a hypoid gear. In this report, we present the relationships between the cutting pitch angle or the generating shaft angle and the tooth bearing pattern compared with a tapered tooth...|$|E
40|$|Industrially-manufactured, {{spiral bevel}} gears with {{complementary}} tooth-end surfaces as a rule have reduced tooth thickness and subsequently reduced strength at the tooth ends. The weakened tooth ends of octoid gearing are generally produced by machining, inevitably resulting in a certain lengthwise dimensional discrepancy and slight profile difference. This in turn very often leads to systematic breakage of teeth. Serious, systematic damage occurs irrespective of the transmission tightness of the outer or inner tooth ends. Gear manufacturers currently use several solutions to avoid such breakages, including artificial inclination near to the teeth or deliberately reducing the back or outer cone angle and increasing the front or root cone angle. This paper outlines an improved design of gear blanks, with optimised tooth ends. Our research concluded {{that it is possible}} to optimise rectangular-generated, spiral bevel pinion/gear pairs with constant tooth height and a common <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> apex. We can successfully achieve this through recalculation of the gear blanks, without any changes in the flank geometry or tooth-cutting process. Thus the gear pair with optimised tooth ends can be cut without interference to the customary tooth-cutting process. To prove the concept, an example of the recalculation is provided. These improvements result in increased tooth strength, simplification of the gear blank geometry and more suitable geometry for modern machining, as well as a smaller outer diameter of the gear...|$|E
50|$|First National Bank of Port Jefferson is a {{historic}} bank building located at Port Jefferson in Suffolk County, New York. It is a -story brick building with a 2-story turret that projects from the second story of the southwest corner and rises above the roofline. The turret has a steeply <b>pitched,</b> <b>cone</b> shaped slate roof and three windows on both levels. The main entrance to the building used to be directly below the turret, but {{was made into a}} window around 1949 when a 1-story brick, flat-roofed addition was built {{on the east side of}} the bank building. In 1948, the building ceased being used for a bank and was purchased by the Town of Brookhaven, who completed the 1-story addition the following year.|$|R
2500|$|Cone {{recognized}} {{after the}} 2000 season that his tenure with the Yankees was over. In 2001 <b>Cone</b> <b>pitched</b> for the rival Boston Red Sox, performing with mixed but mostly positive results, including a 9–7 win-loss {{record and a}} 4.31 ERA. His 2001 season included a suspenseful 1–0 loss against Yankees ace Mike Mussina wherein <b>Cone</b> <b>pitched</b> [...] innings giving up one unearned run, keeping the game close even as Mike Mussina came within one strike of completing a perfect game, which would have made Cone the first pitcher to pitch a perfect game and be the losing pitcher in another.|$|R
50|$|July 18 - David <b>Cone</b> <b>pitches</b> the 16th {{perfect game}} against the Montreal Expos, in a 6-0 New York Yankees victory. It is the third perfect game in {{franchise}} history. Don Larsen who authored the first one 43 years prior, throws out the ceremonial first pitch to battery mate Yogi Berra.|$|R
50|$|This {{was seen}} as the end for Jefferies in New York as he would be traded to the Kansas City Royals in the offseason. The season ended on a high note, however, as David <b>Cone</b> <b>pitched</b> a one-hit shutout against the Phillies at Veterans Stadium, in which he struck out 19 batters, tying the National League {{regulation}} game record (first set by former Met Tom Seaver).|$|R
25|$|<b>Cone</b> <b>pitched</b> {{the sixteenth}} perfect game in {{baseball}} history in 1999. On {{the final game of}} the 1991 regular season, he struck out 19 batters, tied for second-most ever in a game. The 1994 Cy Young Award winner, he was a five-time All-Star and led the major leagues in strikeouts each season from 1990–92. A two-time 20 game-winner, he set the MLB record for most years between 20-win seasons with 10.|$|R
25|$|The Yankees re-signed Cone in {{the offseason}} to a three-year {{contract}} worth $19.5 million. Cone was 4–1 with a 2.02 ERA when {{he was diagnosed with}} an aneurysm in his arm in 1996 and went on the disabled list {{for the majority of the}} year. In his comeback start that September against the Oakland Athletics, <b>Cone</b> <b>pitched</b> a no-hitter through seven innings before he had to leave due to pitch count restrictions. Mariano Rivera allowed a single, ending the no-hit bid.|$|R
5000|$|On May 17, 1998, David Wells {{pitched a}} perfect {{game against the}} Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium. On July 18, 1999, which was [...] "Yogi Berra Day" [...] at the Stadium, David <b>Cone</b> <b>pitched</b> a perfect game against the Montreal Expos. The ALCS was the Yankees' first meeting with the Red Sox in a post-season series.

50|$|A {{controversial}} {{call was}} made by umpire Mike Reilly {{in the top of}} the fourth inning with Atlanta leading 1-0 after David Justice scored on a wild <b>pitch</b> from <b>Cone.</b> Roberto Alomar was at third base with John Olerud batting. On the first pitch of the at-bat, Smoltz threw a breaking ball that skipped past Damon Berryhill. Alomar broke for home plate while Berryhill went to retrieve the ball. As Smoltz moved in to receive the throw he nearly collided with a sliding Alomar, who had reached the plate at exactly the same time that both Smoltz and the ball did. Smoltz tagged Alomar and Reilly called him out on the close play, despite an angry Alomar's protest, and the inning came to an end. Replays shown by CBS showed that Alomar might have touched the plate with his hands before Smoltz was able to apply a tag.|$|R
5|$|Humber {{finished}} {{the game with}} nine strikeouts; the other batters were retired with five groundouts and 13 flyouts. Humber threw only 96 pitches, making this the first perfect game thrown in under 100 <b>pitches</b> since David <b>Cone's</b> perfect game on July 18, 1999. Humber had only started 29 Major League games prior to throwing his perfect game, making him the pitcher with the second fewest starts prior to throwing a perfect game, behind fellow White Sox player Charlie Robertson. MLB.com has made available the video of the last out.|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} helical cone-beam CT {{will feature}} pitches around 80 mm. It is predicted that reconstruction algorithms {{to be used}} in these machines with still rather modest cone angles may not necessarily be exact, but rather have an emphasis on simplicity and speed. The PImethods are a family of non-exact algorithms, all of which are based on complete data capture with a detector collimated to the Tam-window followed by rebinning to obliquely parallel ray geometry. The non-exactness is identified as inconsistency in the space invariant one-dimensional ramp-filtering step. It is shown that this inconsistency can be reduced resulting in significant improvement in image quality and increased tolerance for higher <b>pitch</b> and <b>cone</b> angle. A short theoretical background for the PI-methods is given but the algorithms themselves are not given in any detail. A set of experiments on mathematical phantoms illustrate (among other things) how the amount of artefacts grow with increasing cone angles...|$|R
40|$|The boughs of {{the plant}} were used in sweat lodges for muscular pain, as decoctions for {{internal}} hemorrhaging, and as infusions for pediatric treatments. The roots of ponderosa pine were used to make blue dye and needles were used as insulation for underground storage pits. The wood was used extensively for fence posts, boards for general construction, and to fabricate snowshoes. Single logs were used to make dugout canoes. Bark was used to cover houses. Most parts {{of the plant}} were used for food, including the <b>pitch,</b> seeds, <b>cones,</b> bark, buds, and cambium. The pollen and needles were used in healing ceremonies. Ornamental value: Ponderosa pine has a lush green color and pleasant odor that makes it popular for ornamental plantings. It has been planted, sometimes out of its natural range, because of its aesthetic qualities. Ponderosa pine is used as borders of forested highways, but is not planted within the rightof-way. The large stature of the tree limits its use to open spaces...|$|R
40|$|Electrically induced {{reorientation}} {{of liquid}} crystals (LCs) {{is a fundamental}} phenomenon widely used in modern technologies. We observe experimentally an electro-optic effect in a cholesteric LC with a distinct oblique-helicoidal director deformation. The oblique helicoid, predicted in late 1960 -ies, is made possible by recently developed dimer materials with an anomalously small bend elastic constant. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental analysis establishes that both the <b>pitch</b> and the <b>cone</b> angle of the oblique helicoid increase as the electric field decreases. At low fields, the oblique helicoid with the axis parallel to the field transforms into a right-angle helicoid (the ground state of field-free cholesteric) with the axis perpendicular to the field.

5000|$|David Cone {{was famous}} for his splitter, used most often {{in the middle and}} later part of his career. A major strikeout <b>pitch</b> for him, <b>Cone</b> would throw it hard like a fastball to get {{swinging}} strikes. He also was very effective in throwing it slower, using it as a changeup to throw off hitters' timing. Jack Morris learned the pitch from Roger Craig in 1980, and it became an effective [...] "out" [...] pitch for the Tigers' hurler. Mike Scott also learned the pitch from Roger Craig after the 1984 season, and it turned his career around. He won the 1986 NL Cy Young award and posted a league leading 306 strikeouts. Randy Johnson developed a splitter later in his career after losing some of his extremely high fastball velocity.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{design of}} {{main rotor blade}} tips is of {{interest}} to helicopter manufactures since the tip details affect the performance and acoustics of the rotor. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, computation fluid dynamics is used to simulate the flow around hovering helicopter blades with different tip designs. For each type of blade tip a parametric study on the shape is also conducted for comparison calculations were performed the constant rotor thrust condition. The collective <b>pitch</b> and the <b>cone</b> angles of the blades were determined by at an iterative trimming process. Findings: Analysis of the distributed blade loads shows that the tip geometry has a significant influence on aerodynamics and aeroacoustics especially for stations where blade loading is high. Originality/value: The aeroacoustic characteristics of the rotors were obtained using Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equations...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for generation of banded electrostatic emissions by low density, superthermal electrons is developed for application to Jupiter's magnetosphere. The model employs a power law {{form for the}} energy dependence and a loss <b>cone</b> <b>pitch</b> angle distribution of the superthermals to drive convective instability of Bernstein modes. A direct correspondence between spectral features of the 3 / 2 band and resonant superthermal electrons is found. The concept of a critical flux of resonant electrons able to provide 10 e-foldings of electric field amplification yields an explicit relation {{in terms of the}} background thermal electron pressure. This result is used to construct a theoretical/empirical model of thermal electron density and temperature from 6 - 20 Jupiter radii in the Jovian magnetosphere which suggests that the electron temperature is less than the ion temperature which is approximately equal to 10 times the electron temperature in this region. Finally, wave ray paths are computed for propagation in the magnetic equator and in the magnetic meridional plane of a dipole magnetic field. These ray paths suggest that intense wave activity is tightly confined to a small latitudinal extent, less than + or - approximately 4 deg, about the magnetic equator...|$|R
40|$|Landau {{resonance}} and {{cyclotron resonance}} of coherent whistler mode waves and energetic electrons are explored for magnetoplasmas with appreciable gradients in the plasma density and magnetic field strength. It is shown {{that in the}} topside ionosphere of the earth near the ion transition height the gradients in plasma density and magnetic field strength along a magnetic field line may match {{in a way which}} enhances both Landau and cyclotron interactions between waves and electrons at the loss <b>cone</b> <b>pitch</b> angle. The pitch angle scattering induced by a signal from a ground-based VLF transmitter in the ionosphere above the transmitter has been estimated and compared to the pitch angle scattering induced by naturally occurring ELF hiss through cyclotron resonance. It is found that the expected scattering due to plasmapheric hiss is an order of magnitude larger than that due to Landau resonance in the topside ionosphere. Pitch angle scattering due to cyclotron resonance in the topside ionosphere, however, may be larger by a factor of 2. It is suggested that the 'fast Trimpi' effect may be caused by a cyclotron resonance interaction in the topside ionosphere...|$|R
30|$|Figure  1 {{demonstrates}} the fabrication {{procedures of the}} nanocone cluster microstructure. V-shape AAO {{was used as the}} template. The anti-sticking agent (GL-AAC, GermanLitho) was spin coated on the AAO template to make following procedures more easily. Then, the PDMS solution (GL-ML CURE, GL-ML BASE, GermanLitho, 10 : 1 ratio) was drop-cast on the V-shape template followed by a degassing process and then cured at 75  °C for 4  h, as shown in Fig.  1 b, c. The PDMS film was peeled off from the V-shape AAO template after the sample cooling down to the room temperature. The structure was thought to be vertical, just as shown in Fig.  1 d. However, as the <b>pitch</b> between each <b>cone</b> is very small and the height is very high, nanocones will be inclined to the side and aggregated together {{in order to reduce the}} surface energy, thus forming the nanocone cluster microstructure (Fig.  1 e). The aggregation of nanocones could be described in terms of two processes: fractal percolation and general Brownian movement. In the beginning, all the particles involved in PDMS solutions moved chaotically over the lattice points in fractal Brownian motion. When two particles met, they formed stable doublets, lost their mobility, and became the nuclei for the aggregates. When wandering particles approached cells next to aggregates, they were captured and became elements of the aggregate. Thus, more and more free particles were bound into an aggregate and form nanocone cluster microstructure [22].|$|R
