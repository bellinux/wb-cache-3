5|$|During the 19th century, Bond Street {{became less}} {{known for its}} social {{atmosphere}} but increased its reputation as a street for luxury shopping. The auctioneer Phillips was established in 1796 at No.101 Bond Street, specialising in stringed instruments and sheet music. The jewellers Asprey originally opened in 1830 at Nos.165–169 New Bond Street. The Jewish practice of Kabbalah {{has been associated with}} the street after former East End trader Sarah Levenson opened a shop on No.50 New Bond Street in 1856 which immediately became profitable, albeit through exaggerated and questionable <b>product</b> <b>claims.</b> Levenson was twice taken to court and prosecuted for fraud; each prosecution resulted in a five-year prison sentence. She died midway through the second. Nevertheless, the practice regained popularity and a Kabbalah Centre remains on the street.|$|E

25|$|Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., , is a {{decision}} of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court reaffirmed {{the validity of the}} patent exhaustion doctrine, and in doing so made uncertain the continuing precedential value of a line of decisions in the Federal Circuit that had sought to limit Supreme Court exhaustion doctrine decisions to their facts and to require a so-called “rule of reason” analysis of all post-sale restrictions other than tie-ins and price fixes. In the course of restating the patent exhaustion doctrine, the Court held that the exhaustion doctrine is triggered by, among other things, an authorized sale of a component when the only reasonable and intended use of the component is to practice the patent and the component substantially embodies the patented invention by embodying its essential features. The Court also overturned, in passing, the part of decision below that held that the exhaustion doctrine was limited to <b>product</b> <b>claims</b> and did not apply to method claims.|$|E

500|$|Manufacturers {{sometimes}} {{identify the}} products that have received such certification by adding particular graphical symbols to the label. These symbols are known in Judaism as hechsherim. Due to differences in kashrut standards held by different organizations, the hechsheirim of certain Jewish authorities may at times be considered invalid by other Jewish authorities. The certification marks of the various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to list, {{but one of the}} most commonly used in the United States of America is that of the Union of Orthodox Congregations, who use a U inside a circle ("O-U"), symbolising the initials of Orthodox Union. In Britain, a commonly used symbol is the [...] "KLBD" [...] logo of the London Beth Din.

2500|$|First, the Court said, the {{distinction}} between method and <b>product</b> <b>claims</b> is insupportable. In United States v. Univis Lens Co., [...] the most recent decision of the Court on exhaustion, some of the patents held exhausted were method patents. Earlier, in Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, some patents covered a method of combusting gasoline in an automobile engine––and the exhaustion doctrine was held applicable. Furthermore, because {{it is easy to}} write patent claims for the same invention either in method format or apparatus format, the exhaustion doctrine could easily be evaded if reliance on method claims was sufficient to avoid exhaustion: [...] By “including a method claim for the machine’s patented method of performing its task, a patent drafter could shield practically any patented item from exhaustion.” ...|$|E
