40|$|The mid-tropospheric {{geopotential}} height patterns and anomalies associated with temperature and precipitation departures from normal in Saudi Arabia were investigated. The mid-tropospheric teleconnection patterns affecting Saudi Arabia {{and the effect}} of ENSO 2 ̆ 7 s teleconnection on the precipitation of the country were also examined. This investigation covered the seven month period, November to May. MEPA surface data and NMC Northern Hemisphere octagonal grid 700 mb {{geopotential height}} data were used in this study. Various techniques such as compositing analyses, regression analyses and correlation analyses were utilized in this study. ^ It was found that Saudi Arabia experiences below normal temperatures when there are strong positive 700 mb geopotential height anomalies over western Europe and the western Mediterranean, strong negative height anomalies over the Icelandic region, and negative height anomalies over northwestern Asia. Alternatively, when western Europe and the western Mediterranean region experience negative height anomalies and the Icelandic region experiences positive height anomalies, Saudi Arabia experiences above normal temperatures. These patterns control the strength and the location of the Mediterranean trough, which {{plays an important role in}} the climate of Saudi Arabia. The trough is strong and well west of the country during the warm months, but it is weaker and just on the western edge of the country during the cold months. ^ The pattern and temporal behavior of the mid-tropospheric waves over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the western Mediterranean and Europe are related to positive precipitation departures in Saudi Arabia. This pattern and temporal behavior can be described as an eastward progression of a strong trough during the three days preceding a <b>precipitation</b> <b>day</b> in Saudi Arabia. During the <b>precipitation</b> <b>day,</b> this trough is located just west of the country, putting Saudi Arabia under cyclonic activity. ^ An investigation of the teleconnection patterns affecting Saudi Arabia indicates that the centers of action over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the western Mediterranean and Europe are strongly related to the base point over Saudi Arabia. The effect of ENSO teleconnection on the precipitation pattern in Saudi Arabia is represented in a significant lagged relationship between the SOI and precipitation, especially spring precipitation. ...|$|E

The occurrence of potentially significant freezing rain events is not associated with this ice belt. Instead, the frequency of these events has its own trend and has been generally increasing, principally from the 1980 s onward. However, there was a drastic {{decline in the number of}} these events in the early 2000 s.

Our study demonstrates that dendrochronology can be better used to reconstruct {{the number of the}} <b>precipitation</b> <b>day</b> than to reconstruct the precipitation amount in middle Tianshan Mountains. It is found that the residual chronology among the three tree-ring width chronologies has the best relationship with number of spring precipitation days from May 20 to June 8. The chronologies at Haxionggou B site and Zaierdegou site in the Urumiqi drainage have the highest correlation with the observed number of spring precipitation days at Daxigou meteorological station, and are used to reconstruct the spring precipitation days over the last 370 years in the drainage. The main significant decreasing trend of the number of the spring precipitation days occurred during 1665 - 1717, while the significant increasing trends happened during 1805 - 1841 and 1914 - 1943.

40|$|Debris flows, {{triggered}} by extreme precipitation events and rapid snow melt, cause considerable {{damage to the}} Norwegian infrastructure every year. To define intensity-duration (ID) thresholds for debris flow initiation critical water supply conditions arising from intensive rainfall or snow melt were assessed {{on the basis of}} daily hydro-meteorological information for 502 documented debris flow events. Two threshold types were computed: one based on absolute ID relationships and one using ID relationships normalized by the local <b>precipitation</b> <b>day</b> normal (PDN). For each threshold type, minimum, medium and maximum threshold values were defined by fitting power law curves along the 10 th, 50 th and 90 th percentiles of the data population. Depending on the duration of the event, the absolute threshold intensities needed for debris flow initiation vary between 15 and 107 mm day− 1. Since the PDN changes locally, the normalized thresholds show spatial variations. Depending on location, duration and threshold level, the normalized threshold intensities vary between 6 and 250 mm day− 1. The thresholds obtained were used for a frequency analysis of over-threshold events giving an estimation of the exceedance probability and thus potential for debris flow events in different parts of Norway. The absolute thresholds are most often exceeded along the west coast, while the normalized thresholds are most frequently exceeded on the west-facing slopes of the Norwegian mountain ranges. The minimum thresholds derived in this study are in the range of other thresholds obtained for regions with a climate comparable to Norway. Statistics reveal that the normalized threshold is more reliable than the absolute threshold as the former shows no spatial clustering of debris flows related to water supply events captured by the threshold...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Landscape modifications, {{urbanization}} {{or changes}} {{of use of}} rural-agricultural areas can create more favourable conditions for certain mosquito species and therefore indirectly cause nuisance problems for humans. This could potentially result in mosquito-borne disease outbreaks when the nuisance is caused by mosquito species that can transmit pathogens. Anopheles plumbeus is a nuisance mosquito species and a potential malaria vector. It {{is one of the}} most frequently observed species in the Netherlands. Information on the distribution of this species is essential for risk assessments. The purpose of the study was to investigate the potential spatial distribution of An. plumbeus in the Netherlands. METHODS: Random forest models were used to link the occurrence and the abundance of An. plumbeus with environmental features and to produce distribution maps in the Netherlands. Mosquito data were collected using a cross-sectional study design in the Netherlands, from April to October 2010 - 2013. The environmental data were obtained from satellite imagery and weather stations. Statistical measures (accuracy for the occurrence model and mean squared error for the abundance model) were used to evaluate the models performance. The models were externally validated. RESULTS: The maps show that forested areas (centre of the Netherlands) and the east of the country were predicted as suitable for An. plumbeus. In particular high suitability and high abundance was predicted in the south-eastern provinces Limburg and North Brabant. Elevation, <b>precipitation,</b> <b>day</b> and night temperature and vegetation indices were important predictors for calculating the probability of occurrence for An. plumbeus. The probability of occurrence, vegetation indices and precipitation were important for predicting its abundance. The AUC value was 0. 73 and the error in the validation was 0. 29; the mean squared error value was 0. 12. CONCLUSIONS: The areas identified by the model as suitable and with high abundance of An. plumbeus, are consistent with the areas from which nuisance was reported. Our results can be helpful in the assessment of vector-borne disease risk...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to discover people’s daily leisure behavior respond to different weather conditions, and also if the transportations and individual specific characteristics matters regarding to the leisure issues. The factors taken into considerations are {{based on the results of}} previous studies that are related to leisure activities and temperature, transport and individual characteristics. However, until now, as temperatures and transportation issues were more focused, the other factors such as winds and individual characteristics were less been paid attentions to. In contrast, this study aims to explore a more comprehensive understanding, including possible factors in those three aspects. The research was carried out among the residents in Rotterdam. The case of Rotterdam yielded a considerable amount of questionnaires regarding to people’s daily travelling among the city. 1953 respondents have ever participated in the survey program and 13752 records have been collected. For each trips, the related variables concerning the weather conditions, transportations, individual characteristics, geographic coordinators were recorded. Subsequently, statistical analysis and clustering effects have been analyzed by using different statistical or geographical information analyzing methods, in order to answer the research questions. The results indicated that, generally, the people in Rotterdam prefer a warm and no <b>precipitation</b> <b>day</b> with a wind speed around 2 ~ 4 m/s to spend their leisure time. And more specifically, temperature has positive effects to the shopping, like most of the previous studies. It also have negative effects to physical activities. No precipitations is preferred for most of the people, and also there is a ‘threshold’ for the wind speed, which is the most suitable wind speed for leisure activities. A few dominant places for leisure activities has been found, i. e. the Centrum, Vlaardingen, and Spijkenis. However, the attractions of those places contribute more to make those places to be famous for leisure, instead of the environment or municipal transport. Particularly, depends on different transportations, how it matters for people’s leisure activities varies. Temperature will change people’s choices for cycling and walking but do not change the destinations. Meanwhile precipitations have less influences to the transportations, but do change the destinations. Moreover, people who using public transport or private cars are more likely to be unstoppable under adverse weather. In addition, a few correlations has been found between leisure activities and the individual characteristics. It indicated that to some extent the individual characteristics matters. The study therefore advocates a more comprehensive understanding about how Dutch residents acting confront different weather. And as the results could largely depends on the research area, more studies should conducted at the other cities or countries. Quantitative analysis can give answers to research questions, but the understanding is not deep. Future studies should more focused on the individual characteristics. And policy makers should take more care about the weather exposed travelling. All these may result in fairly opportunities for all residents to enjoy a high quality leisure time...|$|E
40|$|Using {{high-quality}} {{precipitation data}} from 524 stations, the trends {{of a set}} of precipitation variables during the main rain season (May-September) from 1961 to 2008 for different climate regions in China were analysed. However, different characteristics were displayed in different regions of China. In most temperate monsoon regions (north-eastern China), total rain-season <b>precipitation</b> and <b>precipitation</b> <b>days</b> showed decreasing trends; positive tendencies in precipitation intensity were, however, noted for most stations in this region. It is suggested that the decrease in rain-season precipitation is mainly related to there being fewer rain days and a change towards drier conditions in north-eastern China, and as a result, the available water resources have been negatively affected in the temperate monsoon regions. In most subtropical and tropical monsoon climate regions (south-eastern China), the rain-season <b>precipitation</b> and <b>precipitation</b> <b>days</b> (11 - 50, with > 50 mm) showed slightly positive trends.

Moreover, the precipitation intensity increases, which is responsible for the decrease in light <b>precipitation</b> <b>days</b> and amount and increase in relatively more intense precipitation since there is no signifi-cant trend in total <b>precipitation</b> <b>days.</b> However, the precipita-tion characteristics are opposite over the Iberian Peninsula. We find that the changes in precipitation characteristics are possibly due to the changes in static stability. In the majority region (the Iberian Peninsula), the static stability weakens (strengthens) during 1951 – 2010. When static stability weakens (strengths), the upward motion increases (decreases) and thus the precipitation intensity increases (decreases).
