5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally <b>publicly</b> <b>funded.</b> In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of <b>publicly</b> <b>funded</b> links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E

For example, the European Union understands career guidance and counseling as an instrument to effectively combat social exclusion and increase citizens' employability.|$|R
5|$|Space {{exploration}} {{has been}} an interest since his fascination with the United States/Soviet Union Space Race during his teenage years.

5|$|Improvements in {{education}} were {{a hallmark of}} Wetherby's term as governor. Over {{the course of his}} administration, he increased funding to education by $20million. He called for the creation of an educational television network and initiated the state's first <b>publicly</b> <b>funded</b> bookmobile program. He supported the 1954 Minimum Foundation Program, an amendment to the state constitution that allowed funding to be allocated to school districts based upon need rather than number of pupils.|$|E

Since the college relocated, the building has been occupied by the London College of Beauty Therapy, the largest <b>publicly</b> <b>funded</b> college of its kind.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, the United Nations Human Rights Committee {{determined}} that Canada was {{in violation of}} article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, because Ontario's Ministry of Education discriminates against non-Catholics by continuing to <b>publicly</b> <b>fund</b> separate Catholic schools, but not those of any other religious groups. For more information see Education in Canada and Waldman v. Canada.|$|R

5|$|Canada's {{approach}} to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, {{which is based}} on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as <b>publicly</b> <b>funded</b> health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E

Similarly, Ontario <b>publicly</b> <b>funds</b> hospitals.|$|R
5|$|The Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine was the world's first <b>publicly</b> <b>funded</b> {{college of}} osteopathic medicine. It has a long-standing {{tradition}} of retaining its alumni in Michigan to practice – {{more than two-thirds}} of the college's graduates remain to practice in Michigan. In 2008, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees approved a resolution endorsing the expansion of the College of Osteopathic Medicine to two sites in southeast Michigan, a move board members and college officials say will not only improve medical education in the state, but also address a projected physician shortage.|$|E
5|$|The National Health Service (NHS) is the <b>publicly</b> <b>funded</b> {{healthcare}} system in England {{responsible for providing}} the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect {{the provisions of the}} National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by economist and social reformer William Beveridge. The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments, and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.|$|E
5|$|The Old Strathcona Foundation, at {{that time}} a <b>publicly</b> <b>funded</b> {{community}} development initiative, leased the struggling Klondike in 1977 and began searching for ways to use the space. A member of the general public, Frank Grisdale, answered the solicitation, writing a paper outlining how the building could be successfully operated as a repertory theatre under its original name. The foundation was apparently impressed by his proposal, and Grisdale was installed as the Princess Theatre's director upon completion of renovations in 1978.|$|E

States that do not fund needle exchange programs are associated with increased rates of HIV/AIDS.|$|R

The Government of Canada has also influenced culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created Crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media and has also tried to protect Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content.|$|E
