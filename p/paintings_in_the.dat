5|$|A pair {{of large}} canvases with hunting dogs by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1742), now {{hanging in the}} Salle du synode, once hung in the Parisian hôtel particulier of Samuel-Jacques Bernard. The three <b>{{paintings}}</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chapel are copies of works by Antonio da Correggio: Adoration of the Shepherds, Virgin and Child with Sts Jerome and Madeleine, and The Rest on the Return from Egypt. They were made in 1724 in Modena and Parma by Robert deSéry (1686–1733) for Armand Gaston, whom he had met in Rome the same year. DeSéry would later provide many other paintings for the cardinal's apartments, all of them copies of paintings by greater masters. Napoleon's green bed is an authentic work by Jacob-Desmalter.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E
5|$|Boydell {{had opened}} up a new market with Niobe and he quickly {{followed}} up this success. With a prospering business and capital in reserve, he embarked on several ambitious projects, often simultaneously. In 1769, he began A Collection of Prints, Engraved after the Most Capital Paintings in England. Its last, and ninth volume, was finished in 1792 to great critical and financial success. In 1773, he began A Set of Prints Engraved after the Most Capital <b>Paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Collection of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress of Russia, Lately in the Possession of the Earl of Orford at Houghton in Norfolk, which was finished in 1788.|$|E
5|$|By mid-August 1942, Stanley had {{recovered}} {{enough to be}} moved to the dysentery wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks. Padres Chambers and Payne had heard that Stanley had decorated the prisoners' chapel at Bukit Batok. So they {{asked him if he}} would do some paintings for St Luke's Chapel, which was recently converted from the ground floor of Block 151, near the area where Stanley was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to St Luke the Physician. Stanley agreed, and sought inspiration for the proposed <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gospels.|$|E

5|$|In February 1834, Etty became seriously ill, and was {{incapacitated}} {{for four}} months. Unable to paint, he exhibited only two already-completed <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1834 Summer Exhibition, Elizabeth Potts and The Cardinal. In June {{of that year}} he left London to convalesce, renting a cottage in York. Weak and unable to concentrate, Etty painted very little, and spend {{the next few months}} visiting friends and touring the sights of Yorkshire. Gradually regaining his health, he returned to London in December 1834, and resumed work on those paintings he had left incomplete on the onset of his illness.|$|E
5|$|Prior to restoration, {{of all the}} <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sistine Chapel, the lunettes and {{spandrels}} {{were the}} dirtiest. Added to this, {{there has always been}} a problem of poor daytime visibility of the panels nearest the windows because of halination. Consequently, they were the least well known of all Michelangelo's publicly accessible works. The recent restoration has made these masterly studies of human nature and inventive depiction of the human form known once more.|$|E
5|$|The {{respective}} remits of the National and Tate Galleries, {{which had}} long been contested by the two institutions, were more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection {{were given to the}} Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by Gauguin and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls.|$|E

5|$|Aalborg has 12 large hotels, most {{within walking}} {{distance}} of the city centre. The Helnan Phønix Hotel is the largest, occupying what was originally built as a lavish private residence in 1783 for a Danish brigadier. It was converted into a hotel in 1853, and in 2011 had 210 rooms, furnished with dark oak. The Chagall was established in the 1950s and has reproductions of Marc Chagall <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rooms. Radisson Blu Limfjord Hotel, operated by the Radisson Hotels chain, contains 188 rooms and has the Italian restaurant Vero Gusto. The Park Hotel, opposite the railway station, was established in 1917. Other hotels include Cabinn Aalborg, Hotel Hvide Hus, Hotel Krogen and Prinsen Hotel. Several banks including Danske Bank, Forex, Jyske Bank, Spar Nord and Nordea have branches in Aalborg.|$|E
5|$|Before {{and after}} the 1913 hiatus, with Bogdan-Pitești and Arghezi at its helm, Seara {{expanded}} its range, encouraging the development of modernist literature, and playing {{a part in the}} transition from Romanian Symbolism to 20th century avant-garde. Its art chronicles celebrated the international success of modern artists Constantin Brâncuși and Pascin, both of whom, Seara argued, were culturally tied to Romania. Revising its stance, the newspaper published Arghezi's account of the new Tinerimea Artistică modern art exhibit (April 1913), mentioning Bogdan-Pitești's role as an art patron and instigator of change. The two intellectuals also promoted the works by young artist Theodor Pallady, most notably with a series of articles in which Arghezi spoke about Pallady <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bogdan-Pitești collection. The magazine, already noted for publishing political cartoons by Nicolae Petrescu Găină, was also joined by Marcel Janco, known later for his work as a Dada and Constructivist artist.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began {{painting}} in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of}} the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.

5|$|Endemic to South Africa, the bluebuck was {{confined}} to the southwestern Cape. A 2003 study estimated the expanse of the historic range of the bluebuck at , mainly along the southern coast of South Africa; fossils, however, have been discovered in a broader area that includes the southern and western CFR and even the highlands of Lesotho. Historical records give a rough estimate of its range. On 20January 1774, Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg recorded a sighting in Tigerhoek, Mpumalanga. In March or April 1783, Levalliant claimed to have witnessed two specimens in Soetemelksvlei, Western Cape. Based on these notes, a 2009 study by the South African zoologist Graham I. H. Kerley and colleagues estimated {{the range of the}} bluebuck to be limited within a triangular area in the Western Cape, bounded by Caledon to the west, Swellendam to the northeast and Bredasdorp to the south. Rock <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caledon river valley of the Free State province in eastern South Africa have been identified as bluebucks, which also confirms the once wider distribution of the species.|$|E

5|$|In 1536 Cleeve {{was closed}} by Henry VIII {{in the course}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the abbey was {{converted}} into a country house. Subsequently, the status of the site declined and the abbey was used as farm buildings until the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains. In the twentieth century Cleeve was taken into state care; the abbey is now looked after by English Heritage and is open to the public. Today Cleeve Abbey is one of the best-preserved medieval Cistercian monastic sites in Britain. While the church is no longer standing, the conventual buildings are still roofed and habitable and contain many features of particular interest including the 'angel' roof in the refectory and the wall <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> painted chamber.|$|E
5|$|In 1821 Johanna Schopenhauer became {{interested}} in the work of Jan van Eyck and his followers, having seen early Netherlandish and Flemish <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection of the brothers Sulpiz and Melchior Boisserée in Heidelberg. Schopenhauer did primary archival research because there was very little historical record of the masters, apart from official legal documents. She published Johann van Eyck und seine Nachfolger in 1822, the same year Gustav Friedrich Waagen published the first modern scholarly work on early Netherlandish painting, Ueber Hubert van Eyck und Johann van Eyck; Waagen's work drew on Schlegel and Schopenhauer's earlier analyses. Waagen went on to become director of the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, amassing a collection of Netherlandish art, including most of the Ghent panels, a number of van der Weyden triptychs, and a Bouts altarpiece. Subjecting the works to meticulous analysis and examination in the course of acquisition, based on distinguishing characteristics of individual artists, he established an early scholarly system of classification.|$|E
5|$|In May 1840, Etty {{finally made}} the trip to Brussels and Antwerp {{which he had been}} forced by {{revolution}} to abandon in 1830. He intended to study the works of Rubens, but the briefness of his tour—in the company of Betsy Etty he visited Ostend, Bruges, Antwerp, Brussels, Aachen, Cologne, Bonn and Rotterdam in the course of ten days—meant he had little time for study. The following year he returned to Antwerp and Mechelen for a longer visit to visit St. Rumbold's Cathedral and to study the substantial collections of Rubens <b>paintings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two cities. On this second journey he twice visited a Trappist monastery outside Antwerp, staying overnight on one visit, and bought a Trappist habit; he also bought a Capuchin habit from a monastery in Bruges. These acquisitions prompted paintings on monastic themes over subsequent years.|$|E
