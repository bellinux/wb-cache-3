Its home is in the East-- not the East of barbarous Pontine countries peopled by men of our own race, where the legend of St. George is allowed to have sprung up, but of the civilised, metaphysical, dark-haired races of Egypt, Syria, and Hindostan. The [...] "objectivity" [...] of the Gothic mind has never had any sympathy with it. The Teutonic races, like the earlier Greeks, before they were tinctured with Eastern thought, had always wanted historic facts, dates, names, and places.

Englishmen especially cannot write allegories. John Bunyan alone succeeded tolerably, but only because his characters and language were such as he had encountered daily at every fireside and in. every meeting-house. But Spenser wandered perpetually away, or rather, rose up from his plan into mere dramatic narrative. His work and other English allegories, are hardly allegoric at all, but rather symbolic; spiritual laws in them are not expressed by arbitrary ciphers, but embodied in imaginary examples, sufficiently startling or simple to form a <b>plain</b> <b>key</b> to other and deeper instances of the same law. They are analogous to those symbolic devotional pictures in which the Madonna and saints of all ages are grouped together with the painter's own contemporaries--no allegories at all, but the plain embodiment of a fact in which the artist believed; not only [...] "the communion of all saints," [...] but also their habit of assisting, often in visible form, the Christians of his own time.|$|E

During the last three decades, the duration of the snow layer reduced a lot compared to that of the first decade. The cause is the air temperature growth during the last years. The poorest decade in snow was the second one (1971 - 1980). The linear tendency also shows that during 1961 - 2002, the duration of the snow layer was decreasing in the West of the country.

The radiocarbon dating indicated that the sediments were deposited during the last ca. 4200 years. Three stages of vegetation development were established: a) distribution of wet meadow and halophilous herbaceous mire communities and groups of deciduous and coniferous trees on the surrounding hills (4200 – 2830 cal. yrs. BP); b) expansion of halophilous vegetation dominated by Chenopodiaceae (2830 – 1330 cal. yrs.

For the multi-segment rupture event, different seismic moments are given by applying two different source-model construction methodologies: (1) a methodology based on seismological scaling relationships and (2) a methodology in an active-fault study based on the cascade model (Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities, 1995). The difference between these methodologies {{is whether or not}} a slip of each segment depends on total rupture length. We investigate which construction methodology is more appropriate for the construction of the source model. We use the two methodologies to construct characterized source models for strong ground-motion simulations of the 1891 Nobi earthquake, which was a multi-segment rupture event occurring in the Nobi active-fault system. We evaluate the constructed source models by comparing the seismic intensities obtained from simulated waveforms with those estimated from the questionnaire-based intensities determined by Muramatu and Kominami (1992). The characterized source model constrained by seismological scaling relationships can give a more adequate distribution of the estimated seismic intensities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sediment {{oxygen demand}} (SOD) is {{believed}} to be an important process affecting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in blackwater streams of the southeastern coastal plain. Because very few data on SOD are available, it is common for modelers to take SOD values from the literature for use with DO models. In this study, SOD was measured in seven blackwater streams of the Suwannee River Basin within the Georgia coastal plain for between August 2004 and April 2005. SOD was measured using four in situ chambers and was found to vary on average between 0. 1 and 2. 3 g O 2 ⁄m ⁄day across the seven study sites throughout the study period. SOD was found to vary significantly between the watersheds within the Suwannee River Basin. However, land use was not found to be the driving force behind SOD values. Statistical analyses did find significant interaction between land use and watersheds suggesting that an intrinsically different factor in each of the watersheds may be affecting SOD and the low DO concentrations. Further research is needed to identify the factors driving SOD dynamics in the blackwater streams of Georgia’s coastal plain. Results from this study will be used by the Geor-gia Department of Natural Resources – Environmental Protection Division as model input data for the develop-ment and evaluation of DO total maximum daily loads in the Georgia coastal <b>plain.</b> (<b>KEY</b> TERMS: sediment oxygen demand; dissolved oxygen; coastal plain; Georgia; blackwater streams; watersheds; water quality. ...|$|E

Small changes in production costs or yields lead to indifference between this {{system and the}} no-tillage wheat-sorghum-fallow and no-till and conventional wheat-fallow systems. Participation in the basic government commodity program generally increases average net returns and lowers variation of returns. Government commodity program payments calculated {{under a variety of}} scenarios do not generally encourage the use of no-till practices for grain sorghum and wheat in the central Great <b>Plains.</b> <b>Key</b> words: commodity programs, conservation tillage, grain sorghum, no-tillage, risk, stochastic dominance, wheat. Dryland production of wheat and grain sorghum in the Great Plains is dependent on sufficient soil moisture. Low humidity and high winds contribute to the loss of soil moisture and soil erosion in this region. Conservation tillage sys-tems, including no-tillage, reduce the potential for soil erosion and soil moisture loss. Eco-nomic evaluations of no-tillage systems are im-portant in order to determine their effects on the level and variability of farm returns. Current government program provisions do not directly restrict tillage system selection, although they do affect crop decisions by dryland wheat-fal-low farmers in the Great Plains. In addition, the assigned program yield provision can penalize a farm manager who selects a tillage system which requires and generates higher yields for in-creased net returns.
