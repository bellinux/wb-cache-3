The Metro originally featured independent Hydragas units, with no fore/aft interconnection (the pipework was deleted on cost grounds, {{against the advice of}} Moulton). While the Metro was praised for its handling, and offered a significant improvement in ride quality over the Mini, it was criticised for its tendency to <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounce</b> on uneven roads - precisely the characteristics the interconnection was intended to remove. The revised Rover Metro had its suspension interconnected and went on to receive plaudits for the quality of its ride.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis outlines a hierarchical modelling methodology for investigation in vehicle dynamics, in particular for combined ride and handling manoeuvres. The methodology {{involves the use of}} detailed multi-degrees of freedom models of vehicles with the inclusion of sources of non-linearity, using a multi-body approach, based on Lagrangian dynamics for constrained systems. It also includes the use of simpler and task-specific models, formulated in Newton-Euler approach. These simpler models with lower degrees of freedom, but with appropriate level of detail are more efficient in the study of specific, but non-trivial problems such as transient behaviour of vehicles in combined ride and handling, as encountered in many routine daily manoeuvres. The modelling methodology is supported by careful vehicle testing, both for validation of the proposed approach, and assessment of the extent of applicability of simple, intermediate and multi-degrees of freedom full-vehicle models. Certain important vehicle handling and ride characteristics in pitch plane dynamics, roll behaviour, vehicle body bounce and combination of these have been studied, as well as the effectiveness of restraining action of chassis elements, such as the semileading and trailing arms for passive control of vehicle squat and dive motions, arising from acceleration from coast to drive and deceleration/brake of vehicle from drive to coast. Combined <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounce</b> motions have been studied when negotiating speed traps such as bumps, which also combine with significant body roll when single event obstacles of this kind are introduced. The novelty of the research is in the detailed integrative numerical-experimental approach, and the development of intermediate models that adequately predict vehicle behaviour under steady and non-steady conditions {{for a wide range of}} ride and handling manoeuvres. The investigations have culminated in a significant number of findings of practical use, particularly the ineffectiveness of anti-squat and dive features when combined <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounce</b> motions limit the usefulness of these devices. On the contrary, excessive roll dynamic behaviour of the vehicle is effectively palliated by the anti-roll bar, even under complex combined pitch, roll and body bounce such as those experienced in negotiating single event speed bumps. Good agreement is found between the predictions of the intermediate model and those of the multi-body model and the actual vehicle tests, particularly for <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounce</b> dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Simulating {{the dynamic}} {{response}} of trucks requires that a model be constructed {{and subjected to}} road inputs. Inclusion or omission of flexible frame effects is often based on intuition or assumption. If frame vibration {{is assumed to be}} sig-nificant, it is typically incorporated in one of two ways. Either a complex finite element model of the frame is used, or a simplified linear modal expansion model (which assumes small motions) is employed. The typical low-order modal expansion model, while computationally efficient and easier to use, is limited by the fact that 1) large rigid body mo-tions and road grade changes are not supported, and 2) longitudinal dynamics are not coupled to vertical and bounce dynamics. In this paper, a bond graph model is presented which includes coupled <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounce</b> motions, longitudi-nal dynamics, and transverse frame vibration. Large rigid body motions are allowed, onto which small flexible vibra-tions are superimposed. Frame flexibility is incorporated using modal expansion of a free-free beam. The model allows for a complete pitch-plane representation in which motive forces can propel the truck forward over varying terrain, in-cluding hills. The effect of frame flexibility on vehicle dynamics can then be studied. This is an extension of the typical half-car model in which suspension motion is assumed vertical, pitch angles are small, and longitudinal dynamics are completely decoupled or omitted. Model output shows the effect of frame flexibility on vehicle responses such as for-ward velocity, pitch angle, and payload acceleration.

30|$|Additionally, the HIS {{system can}} reduce the natural {{frequencies}} of the wheel-dominated motion-modes, involving the wheel pitch mode (the 4 th mode in VHIS, 9.158 Hz), wheel bounce mode (the 5 th mode in VHIS, 10.419 Hz), wheel roll mode (the 6 th mode in VHIS, 11.226 Hz), and wheel warp mode (the 7 th mode in VHIS, 12.530 Hz). In the previous study [23], {{it can be seen}} that the lower warp mode stiffness can improve the ground holding performance. From the comparisons of the mode shapes, the HIS system can decouple the body <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> modes, <b>and</b> intensify the coupling of wheel <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> modes, which is beneficial to balance the distribution of the front and rear tire forces. Furthermore, it is observed that the HIS system can increase the damping ratios corresponding to both the body modes (roll, <b>bounce,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch)</b> <b>and</b> wheel modes (<b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch)</b> of the integrated system, and the high damping can eliminate transient oscillations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the riding robot system named by "RideBot " {{which is a}} riding robot like as a horse. In order to simulate the riding motions, we developed the saddle mechanism which can generate 3 DOF motions including <b>pitch,</b> roll, <b>and</b> <b>bounce</b> movement, <b>and</b> also we controlled the riding motions and the intention of horseman. To generate the riding motions with the bodily sensation, we developed Novel Washout Filter and the algorithms for motion control. And also, we developed some health care service for the health care of horseman. A body state index was proposed that evaluates the personal health state from both the measured physiological variables and the surveyed questions. The physiological variables such as weight, blood pressure, heart rate variability (HRV), accelerated state photoplethysmograph(APG), body fat, and happiness index were measured by the specially designed bio-handle system and survey questions.

40|$|Comfort {{and road}} {{handling}} are two mains {{areas in which}} car engineers {{put a lot of}} efforts. Suspensions are designed to offer the best compromise between well-being and safety. However, leisure market is appreciably increasing those years and more and more people use their car to carry features as boats, motorbikes or caravans. Extra weight is brought on the rear axle of the towing vehicle, the front one tending to lift. Thus, suspensions efficiency decreases leading to nuisances in comfort or handling. The two major motions that have to be controlled are <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounce.</b> The first represents the rotation of the car around its transversal axis, the second deals with the vertical displacement of the vehicle. The purpose of the thesis consists in modelling and designing an air-cushioned hitch that will reduce vibrations on both car and trailer. This kind of product already exists, especially in the truck field. Indeed, many trucks use a system called fifth wheel that absorbs energy due to the motion of the trailer. Then, the challenge of this project is to design a system applicable on common passenger cars and determining adequate structural parameters values for suspension features. MSC. ADAMS/View and MSC. ADAMS/Insight are the softwares used in this purpose. A simplified model based on mass-spring-damper system is implemented and allows obtaining suboptimal stiffness/damping for the air hitch. This simulation is also a way to get insight into the performance of the product. Design development has been established using Solidworks. All parts are created respecting space constraints and regulations and assembled to give the final product. FEM analysis is performed to check if strength requirements are fulfilled. One of the results from this work is a document with dimensions and characteristics of the final product that can reduce about 30 % of vibrations. The air hitch is aimed to be industrialized. However, rig tests and manufacturing cost analysis have to be achieved in order to validate design choices...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles {{are becoming increasingly}} common within the automotive market. Whilst {{there have been a}} large number of studies investigating hybrid electric vehicle drive-train control, for efficiency and active safety purposes, there is little work reflecting the effects of such technologies on pure vehicle dynamics. This thesis investigates the effects of hybrid drive-trains on vehicle ride and handling. A specific case study based on the hybridisation of a conventionally powered vehicle into a series hybrid electric vehicle is utilised as a means of doing so. In order to investigate the effects of the hybrid drive-train components on the vehicle’s ride and handling responses, detailed multibody models of both the Standard Vehicle (SV) and the hybrid General Technology Vehicle (GTV) were produced. As work was conducted in parallel with the Low Carbon Vehicle Technology Project (LCVTP), these models were created in a modular and physical fashion, as to allow for their easy parameterisation and adaption into other hybrid vehicle architectures. Prior to detailed investigation the standard vehicle model was successfully validated against real world test data collected as part of this work. Model responses for both the standard and hybrid vehicle models were investigated and analysed in the ride and handling domain. Ride analysis focused on statistical investigation of contact patch load and occupant comfort levels inside the vehicle. It was shown that there was a higher comfort region within both vehicles around the Cog and spring centre, as these two vehicle parameters moved with changes that were made to the GTV, the occupants within were subjected to different comfort levels. As the weight shifted rearwards in the GTV, occupants seated at the front were subjected to higher levels of discomfort, however those in the rear actually saw a slight increase in comfort levels. Levels of vertical acceleration within the GTV were found to generally be slightly larger, resulting from increased <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounce</b> motions due to an increase in coupling between these modes. Furthermore levels of low speed damping on the GTV were shown to be incorrect for its new mass parameters, which led to a further deterioration in ride quality. The handling analysis took on a novel form of investigating trends in specific handling metrics over the entire vehicle operating range. Said trends were then investigated further through more detailed model outputs. The GTV was shown to have a lower understeer gradient than the SV, due to the rearward shift in mass distribution and stiffer rear suspension. Transient handling responses were shown to be quite speed and manoeuvre specific, but all differences between the two vehicles could be explained by the differences in their dynamic indices and understeer gradients. Lateral acceleration response times were governed by the dynamic index and were always slower for the GTV, the magnitude of these responses were speed dependant, below the GTV’s tangent speed they were smaller than the SV’s, however above this speed they were larger. Yaw rate responses were more mixed, but were also seen to be governed by the dynamics index, at lower speeds or during simple unidirectional manoeuvres the GTV could obtain large faster yaw rates than the SV, during a transient to transient manoeuvre the GTV’s yaw rate responses were generally smaller, this was seen to be due {{to the way in which}} a higher dynamic index effects rear tyre slip angle generation having a larger effect at low speeds but a smaller effect when large slip angles are already present at the rear tyres. The results obtained have given a clear picture of how the inclusion of hybrid drive-trains can affect vehicle ride and handling. Something that was re-enforced by the results being generalised and applied to a few types of hybrid vehicle architecture in order to make recommendations on layout/packaging of these vehicles and highlight areas of importance for future hybrid vehicle design in terms of ride and handling...|$|E

40|$|The {{influences}} of fluidic X-coupling of hydro-pneumatic suspension struts {{on the various}} suspension properties are investigated for a sport utility vehicle (SUV). The stiffness and damping properties in the <b>bounce,</b> <b>pitch,</b> roll <b>and</b> warp modes are particularly addressed together with the couplings between the roll, <b>pitch,</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> warp modes of the vehicle. The proposed X-coupled suspension configuration involves diagonal hydraulic couplings among the different chambers of the four hydro-pneumatic struts. The static and dynamic forces developed by the struts of the unconnected and X-coupled suspensions are formulated using a simple generalized model, which are subsequently used to derive the stiffness and damping properties. The properties of the X-coupled suspension are {{compared with those of}} the unconnected suspension configuration, in terms of four fundamental vibration modes, namely <b>bounce,</b> roll, <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> warp, to illustrate the significant effects of fluidic couplings. The results suggest that the X-coupling could help achieve greater roll <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> stiffness <b>and</b> damping, with negligible effects on the <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> warp mode properties. It is further shown that the X-coupled struts offer greater design flexibility to achieve better compromise among different conflicting measures. From the results, it was concluded that the proposed X-coupling of the suspension struts could help achieve improved roll stability, handling <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> control, without sacrificing the <b>bounce</b> ride quality <b>and</b> road-holding performance of SUVs during both the on- and off-road driving conditions...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the major findings from recent work carried out by the England and Wales Cricket Board's Pitches Research Group. The findings are comprised from three major studies which are briefly outlined below: Pitch coring programme Soil cores were taken from pitches by groundsmen at the start of County Championship matches over the period of 1996 to 2002. Cores were sent to either the Sports Turf Research Institute (STRI), Bingley or the University of Wales, Aberystwyth where their soil composition was ascertained through a detailed analysis. Detailed pitch monitoring programme Detailed measurements of <b>pitch</b> condition <b>and</b> surface performance were recorded at the eng of 69 County Championship cricket matches from 1998 to 2003. The information recorded included; ball bounce, hardness, grass cover and condition, cracking and surface damage. Surface friction was determined on some pitches from 2000. High speed video analysis of pitch performance Objective measurements of <b>pitch</b> pace, <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> consistency were achieved using a high speed video system. These measurements were carried out during 40 match visits when 100 ball impacts were filmed on the third day of each match...|$|R

5000|$|As a result, {{since the}} mid-80s {{the number of}} wedges {{available}} to players has grown from 2 (<b>pitching</b> <b>and</b> sand) to 5 (adding gap, lob and ultra lob), {{most of which are}} now available in a wide array of lofts <b>and</b> <b>bounces</b> to allow a player to [...] "fine-tune" [...] their short game with the wedges that best meet their needs. In some cases, with the high degree of customization, companies have done away with the traditional names for each club, and instead simply label each club with its loft <b>and</b> <b>bounce</b> angles. A 52-8 wedge, for example, would have 52 degrees of loft and 8 degrees of bounce, generally placing it in the [...] "gap wedge" [...] class. Most players carry three or four wedges on the course, and sometimes more, usually sacrificing one or two of their long irons and/or higher-lofted fairway woods to meet the 14-club limit.|$|R

40|$|A twin-gas-chamber {{hydropneumatic}} suspension strut concept is proposed to achieve enhanced <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> ride, <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> attitude control. The response {{characteristics of the}} twin-gas-chamber strut suspension are {{compared with those of}} a single-gas-chamber strut Suspension to demonstrate not Only Superior performance potentials but also the added design flexibility offered by the twin- gas- chamber struts. The relative responses of both strut suspensions are evaluated through analysis of a pitch plane vehicle model, subject to straight-line braking inputs and excitations arising from randomly distributed road elevations. A generalized formulation for the strut forces is presented to derive the <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> rates of the proposed strut Suspensions. The results reveal that the twin-gas-chamber strut Suspension exhibits a slightly lower pitch stiffness in the vicinity of design ride height, but progressively hardening effects with increasing pitch deflections. Moreover, the twin-gas-chamber strut suspension exhibits considerably fewer hardening-softening effects in suspension rate compared with the suspension involving the single-gas-chamber struts. The results attained from the parametric Studies are also discussed to demonstrate superior design flexibility of the twin-gas-chamber struts for timing of the suspension <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> stiffness properties. The dynamic responses of the vehicle model with different Suspensions are assessed subject to random road roughness excitations as well as braking torque inputs. The results demonstrate that the twin- gas-chamber strut Suspension offers considerable potential for enhancing <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> ride, <b>pitch</b> attitude control, <b>and</b> Suspension travel responses under braking, while the influence on the ride and road-holding responses under random road inputs is insignificant.

The integrated dynamic equations of the mechanical–hydraulic coupled system were derived using the impedance transfer matrix and free-body diagram methods.

The dynamic characteristic comparisons between the VCS-EP and VHIS were presented to verify the prominent advantages of the HIS system. These results illustrated that the proposed HIS system could decouple the <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> modes, <b>and</b> intensify the coupling of wheel <b>bounce</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> modes to balance the distribution of tire dynamic forces. Furthermore, the HIS system could provide additional pitch stiffness to control the vehicle pitch motion, reduce the bounce stiffness to improve ride comfort, and increase the corresponding mode damping to eliminate transient oscillations in the lower frequency range.|$|R
