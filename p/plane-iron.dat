[...] "But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's plane {{there in the}} bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough." [...] So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the <b>plane-iron</b> came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I {{did not know how}} all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove {{in the middle of the}} room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.|$|E

On 25 January 1841, the United States Exploring Expedition visited Atafu and discovered a small population {{living on the}} island. The residents appeared to be temporary, evidenced {{by the lack of}} a chief and the possession of double canoes (used for inter-island travel). They desired to barter, and possessed blue beads and a <b>plane-iron,</b> indicating previous interaction with foreigners. The expedition reached Nukunonu on 28 January 1841 but did not record any information about inhabitants. On 29 January 1841, the expedition discovered Fakaofo and named it [...] "Bowditch". The islanders were found to be similar in appearance and nature to those in Atafu.|$|E
