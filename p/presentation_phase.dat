40|$|The allied {{competitiveness}} and unpredictable {{nature of the}} construction industry forced to rethink on the performance enhancement tools {{in order to address}} the urgent matter of resource scarcity as a global dilemma. Hence, most of the construction firms highly concern about the customer’s satisfaction by means of giving value for the client’s money. The researchers established that Value Engineering (VE) and Lean concepts supersede all the other value achieving strategies since; both address the concept of Value in a greater extent. VE addresses the areas, which are not aligned with the methodological purview of Lean. In turn, Lean could enhance the effectiveness of VE efforts. Although there were some arguments on the above, there is lack of a research of investigating the synergy between Lean and VE concepts with related to the construction sector. Hence, this study investigates the synergy between Lean and VE concepts in order to explore the best value for client. Accordingly, a qualitative research approach was followed to attain the research aim. A comprehensive literature review followed by expert opinion surveys were used to investigate the synergy between the concepts. The information gathered were subsequently subjected to a content analysis.

40|$|Hera is a model-driven {{methodology}} for designing Semantic Web Information Systems (SWIS). Based {{on the principle}} of separation-of-concerns, Hera defines models to describe the different aspects of an SWIS. These models are represented using RDF, the foundation language of the Semantic Web. Hera is composed of two phases: the data collection phase, which integrates data from different sources, and the <b>presentation</b> generation <b>phase,</b> which builds a hypermedia presentation for the integrated data. The focus of this paper is on the hypermedia <b>presentation</b> generation <b>phase</b> and the associated model specifications. The Hera <b>presentation</b> generation <b>phase</b> has two variants: a static one that computes at once a full Web presentation, and a dynamic one that computes one-page-at-a-time by letting the user influence the next Web page to be presented. The dynamic variant proposes, in addition to the models from the static variant, new models to capture the data resulted from the user's interaction with the system. The implementation is based on a sequence of data transformations applied to the Hera models that eventually produces a hypermedia presentation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} an {{exploratory}} experiment on heart rate pre-stimuli reactions are presented. The 4 basic colours (blue, green, red and yellow) were presented as full-screen images on the computer (<b>presentation</b> <b>phase),</b> for a period of 4 seconds each. During this phase the heart rate was measured at fix intervals of 1 second, for a total of 5 measurements for each colour. After the <b>presentation</b> <b>phase,</b> the 4 colours were presented together, as colour bars in one image, and the task of the subject was that of guessing the colour which the computer would have chosen using a random process (choice phase). After the choice was performed by the subject, the computer selected one of the colours randomly and presented it full-screen (presentation of the target). Results show that even though the subjects guess randomly (their guess is right 25 % of the times), a strong pre-stimuli difference in the heart rate is observed during the presentation of the colour later selected by the computer (target). For the blue and green colours this average difference is 2 heart beats per minute. To be more precise, when the blue colour is the target an increase of more than 2 heart beats per minute is observed during the <b>presentation</b> <b>phase</b> of the blue image, while when the green colour is the target, an anticipated decrease of 2 beats per minute is observed during the <b>presentation</b> <b>phase.</b> These differences obtain high statistical significance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{association}} of data of different nature to geo-graphical locations {{is becoming increasingly}} popular in {{a growing number of}} domains, including urban management, economics and social studies. Traditional geographical information systems (GIS) are pow-erful tools for processing georeferenced information, but in most cases they are still complex systems that require highly trained users for obtaining useful results. This work proposes a novel web-based architecture for hiding to the users the complexity of GIS and for allowing them to interact with the underlying spatial engine through simplified visual interfaces that take care both of the query and of the <b>presentation</b> <b>phases.</b> Such integration represents an improvement in relation to most of the previous research work focused, respectively, on easying the query or the access to resulting data.

In Phases 1 and 3, response-dependent timeout and shock suppressed responding and established equivalent rates in both components of the multiple schedule. Intermediate doses of pentobarbital increased responding suppressed by electric-shock punishment but {{had little or no}} effect on responding suppressed by timeout punishment. Response-independent presentation of timeouts did not result in suppression of responding (thus showing that response-dependent timeout acted as a punisher), and pentobarbital did not reliably increase unpunished responding.

40|$|Discrete choice {{experiments}} {{have been widely}} applied to elicit behavioral preferences in the literature. In many of these experiments, the alternatives are named alternatives, meaning that they are naturally associated with specific names. For example, in a mode choice study, the alternatives {{can be associated with}} names such as car, taxi, bus, and subway. A fundamental issue that arises in stated choice experiments is whether to treat the alternatives' names as labels (that is, labeled treatment), or as attributes (that is, unlabeled treatment) in the design as well as the presentation phases of the choice sets. In this research, we investigate the impact of labeled versus unlabeled treatments of alternatives' names on the outcome of stated choice experiments, a question that has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. Using results from a mode choice study, we find that the labeled or the unlabeled treatment of alternatives' names in either the design or the <b>presentation</b> <b>phase</b> of the choice experiment does not statistically affect the estimates of the coefficient parameters. We then proceed to measure the influence toward the willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates. By using a random-effects model to relate the conditional WTP estimates to the socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals and the labeled versus unlabeled treatments of alternatives' names, we find that: a) Given the treatment of alternatives' names in the <b>presentation</b> <b>phase,</b> the treatment of alternatives' names in the design phase does not statistically affect the estimates of the WTP measures; and b) Given the treatment of alternatives' names in the design phase, the labeled treatment of alternatives' names in the <b>presentation</b> <b>phase</b> causes the corresponding WTP estimates to be slightly higher...|$|E

However, they perform 5 – 10 better for colored than for black and white images, even at exposure durations as short as 50 msec. Surprisingly, performance is not impaired for the dichromats, whose recognition performance is also better for colored than for black and white images. We conclude either that X-chromosome-linked dichromats may be able to compensate for their reduced chromatic information range when viewing complex natural scenes or that the chromatic information in most natural scenes, for the durations tested, is sufficiently represented by the surviving primordial color subsystem...|$|E

During the <b>presentation</b> <b>phase</b> a series of 48 images of natural scenes was presented to subjects on a CRT display for exposure durations between 50 and 1000 msec. Display of the images was followed by a random noise mask. Half of the images were presented in colour; half in black white. The luminance component of the images remained constant. In the subsequent query phase the same 48 images were intermixed with 48 new images, and the subjects had to indicate which one of the images they had already seen in the <b>presentation</b> <b>phase.</b> We found a significant effect of exposure duration and colour on recognition performance.

40|$|According to the {{instructional}} failure hypothesis, the contextual similarity of the intertrial interval (ITI) and the delay interval (DI) {{is responsible for}} the choose-short bias that occurs when memory for filled intervals is tested. This hypothesis may also explain the choose-long bias for empty intervals, if birds confuse an extended DI with a long empty interval. In the present study, pigeons were trained in a within-subjects design to discriminate durations of a filled interval (2 -s and 8 -s of light), and durations of an empty interval (2 -s and 8 -s bound by two 1 -s light markers). In order to disambiguate the ITI, sample <b>presentation</b> <b>phase,</b> and the DI, the colour displayed on the video monitor was different during the various phases of a trial. In Experiment 1, the ITI was magenta, the sample <b>presentation</b> <b>phase</b> was dark, and the DI was grey. Although accuracy was greater for short than for long samples, the retention functions were parallel. Thus, {{there was no evidence of}} a biased-forgetting effect. In Experiment 2, additional tests indicated that the interval from the offset of the ITI to the onset of the DI, as well as the filled and empty intervals themselves affected choice responding in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, the colour displayed on the video monitor was manipulated such that the illumination was magenta during the ITI, and dark during the sample presentation and comparison phases in order to prevent pigeons timing from the ITI offset to the DI onset, and to create confusion for one interval-type, but not the other. A choose-long bias was obtained for empty intervals, and no-bias was obtained for filled intervals. In Experiment 4, the colour displayed on the video monitor was manipulated such that the illumination was dark during the ITI and sample <b>presentation</b> <b>phase,</b> and grey during the comparison phase in order to prevent pigeons from timing from ITI offset to DI onset, and to eliminate the possibility of confusion for both filled and empty intervals. The results of this experiment revealed no biases for either filled or empty intervals. In Experiment 5, the colour displayed on the video monitor was dark for all of the phases of the trial in order to create confusion, and thus produce the choose-short and long biases.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patient {{heterogeneity}} is {{the part}} of variability that can be explained by certain patient characteristics (e. g. age, disease stage). Population reimbursement decisions that acknowledge patient heterogeneity could potentially save money and increase population health. To date, however, economic evaluations pay only limited attention to patient heterogeneity. The objective of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge regarding patient heterogeneity within economic evaluation of healthcare programmes. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify methodological papers on the topic of patient heterogeneity in economic evaluation. Data were obtained using a keyword search of the PubMed database and manual searches. Handbooks were also included. Relevant data were extracted regarding potential sources of patient heterogeneity, in which of the input parameters of an economic evaluation these occur, methods to acknowledge patient heterogeneity and specific concerns associated with this acknowledgement. RESULTS: A total of 20 articles and five handbooks were included. The relevant sources of patient heterogeneity (demographics, preferences and clinical characteristics) and the input parameters where they occurred (baseline risk, treatment effect, health state utility and resource utilization) were combined in a framework. Methods were derived for the design, analysis and <b>presentation</b> <b>phases</b> of an economic evaluation. Concerns related mainly to the danger of false-positive results and equity issues. CONCLUSION: By systematically reviewing current knowledge regarding patient heterogeneity within economic evaluations of healthcare programmes, we provide guidance for future economic evaluations. Guidance is provided on which sources of patient heterogeneity to consider, how to acknowledge them in economic evaluation and potential concerns. The improved acknowledgement of patient heterogeneity in future economic evaluations may well improve the efficiency of healthcare...|$|R
