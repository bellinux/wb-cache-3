5|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) never {{recovered}} from {{the crash of the}} Amana. Since the beginning of 1945, 77 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed in accidents in aircraft operated by ANA. In late 1948, ANA suffered 4 crashes in 4 months. The loss of ANA's reputation as a safe airline, together with the unblemished safety record and growing commercial success of its rival Trans Australia Airlines, sent ANA into decline. In 1957 ANA was taken over by Ansett Transport Industries Limited and merged with Ansett Airways to form the domestic airline Ansett-ANA.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there were}} no deaths and only 65 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{directly}} affected by Cyclone Daman, the Fijian government, {{with the help of}} the Red Cross, decided not to request any International Aid or any external assistance. The Fijian Government, on January 15, 2008, allocated $530,000 2008FJD for the relief and rehabilitation programme of Cikobia. By August 2008, all work rebuilding Cikobia after Cyclone Daman had been completed.|$|E

5|$|From the 16th {{century the}} Commonwealth {{suffered}} {{a series of}} Tatar invasions. In the 16th century Cossack raids began descending on the Black Sea area Turkish settlements and Tatar lands. In retaliation the Ottoman Empire directed their vassal Tatar forces, based in Crimea or Budjak areas, against the Commonwealth regions of Podolia and Red Ruthenia. The borderland area to the south-east {{was in a state}} of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of Allah, request {{permission}} to return to Earth.

Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|The BVE {{vanished}} after 1981 but, from 1983 onwards, the GAL began {{carrying out}} similar attacks and abductions.
