50|$|Cockpit:The {{cockpit of}} the Astus 14.1 {{is large enough}} to {{accommodate}} two adults, or one adult with two children. The cockpit floor is flat with a daggerboard well. The mainsheet <b>purchase</b> <b>tackle</b> is attached to the aft tube. A small watertight locker is located at the fore end of the cockpit.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, Acme <b>Tackle</b> <b>purchased</b> {{the former}} Seneca Tackle Co. and {{expanded}} further. Today, Acme continues to manufacture, assemble, and package {{all of its}} lures at its Providence, Rhode Island plant, under the management and supervision of seven of Arthur Lavallee's sons and daughters. Acme is also a sponsor of Central Jersey Trout Unlimited. They have been noted as top lures {{of the time in}} numerous outdoor magazines, such as, Field and Stream.|$|R
50|$|The <b>purchase</b> of a <b>tackle</b> {{refers to}} its {{mechanical}} advantage. In general the more sheaves in the blocks {{that make up}} a tackle, the higher its mechanical advantage. The matter is slightly {{complicated by the fact that}} every tackle has a working end where the final run of rope leaves the last sheave. More mechanical advantage can be obtained if this end is attached to the moving load rather than the fixed end of the tackle.|$|R
2500|$|This unique 0-6-0T {{locomotive}} {{dates from}} 1885 {{and is the}} only engine on the line to have been built by Dübs and Company, of Glasgow; <b>purchased</b> to <b>tackle</b> the steep gradients of the Foxdale Railway she was ideally suited to the job. [...] After the merger in 1905 she was numbered 15 in the Isle of Man Railway fleet (having previously been Manx Northern's No. 4) and only saw sporadic use, most notably on Ramsey Cattle Mart specials and for snow clearing trains. [...] She was reboiler in 1923, receiving the first boiler on the IMR to carry [...] "Ross" [...] pop safety valves. [...] When the Marquess of Ailsa took over operations in 1967 she was repainted into spring green livery and saw service once again until 1968. By 1975 she had been painted into Manx Northern colours and placed in the then new museum at Port Erin where she remained until 1993 when she was returned to Douglas by road for steam feasibility tests. [...] By 1995 she was the star of the show, operating on the 1 in 12 gradients of the Snaefell Mountain Railway as part of the centenary celebrations. [...] This had historical precedent as Caledonia had been leased for construction purposes in 1895. [...] She has since been part of the stable of serviceable locomotives, having been painted into a non-prototypical blue livery in 1999 but reverted to the intricate original paint scheme in 2007. [...] The locomotive {{was the subject of a}} major rebuild from 2009 and returned to service in January 2013. [...] She was last in service in 2014 and is currently stripped down undergoing boiler work, unlikely to see service until 2016. The boiler was sent to the Severn Valley Railway in January 2016 to be repaired.|$|R

40|$|We apply {{propensity}} score matching (PSM) to {{the estimation of}} household motor fuel <b>purchase</b> quantities, to <b>tackle</b> problems caused by infrequency of purchase. The results are compared to an alternative, regression-based, imputation strategy using the infrequency of purchase model (IPM). Using data from the UK’s National Travel Survey (NTS) we observe that estimated mean obtained from the PSM imputation {{is closer to the}} estimated mean from the consumption diary, than that obtained from fitted values from the IPM. The NTS also contains an interview question on household mileage which can be used to assess the results of imputation. We find that the order statistics of the imputed distribution are more plausible for the PSM estimates than those obtained using the IPM, judging by the sample distribution of household mileage. We argue that there are some applications for which the PSM method is likely to be superior, including estimates of distributional effects of policies. On the other hand, the IPM is more suitable for analysing conditional effects and associations of consumption with covariates. We illustrate our arguments using a simple microsimulation exercise on CO 2 emissions reduction policies, an area where methods for coping with zero-inflated data seem currently to be under-used. ...|$|R
