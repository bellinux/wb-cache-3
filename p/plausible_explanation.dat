5|$|In 2016, the Anne Frank House {{published}} {{new research}} pointing to investigation over ration card fraud, rather than betrayal, as a <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> for the raid {{that led to}} the arrest of the Franks. The report states that other activities in the building may have led authorities there, including activities of Frank's company. However, it does not rule out betrayal.|$|E
5|$|Both Wessex's sudden rise {{to power}} in the late 820s, and the {{subsequent}} failure to retain this dominant position, have been examined by historians looking for underlying causes. One <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> for the events of these years is that Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Franks supported Eardwulf when he recovered the throne of Northumbria in 808, so it is plausible that they also supported Ecgberht's accession in 802. At Easter 839, not long before Ecgberht's death, he was in touch with Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, to arrange safe passage to Rome. Hence a continuing relationship with the Franks seems {{to be part of}} southern English politics {{during the first half of}} the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|The Flight Superintendent and the Technical Superintendent of ANA {{simulated}} some {{of these}} events during a test flight in another DC-4. They were satisfied that the time intervals between events were compatible with the likely sequence of events leading to {{the crash of the}} Amana, and that it was a <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> of the accident. However, on legal advice this possible explanation of the crash was not made public. Two accidents involving Douglas DC-4s, one approaching Dublin Airport, Ireland, in 1961 and another approaching Stockport Airport, Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1967 were attributed to interruption of fuel supply when engines were supplied from the cross-feed system which was open to an empty fuel tank, allowing air to be drawn into the cross-feed pipe.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E
5|$|The Ch'olan {{languages}} were formerly widespread {{throughout the}} Maya area, {{but today the}} language with most speakers is Ch'ol, spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas. Its closest relative, the Chontal Maya language, is spoken by 55,000 {{in the state of}} Tabasco. Another related language, now endangered, is Ch'orti', which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala. It was previously also spoken in extreme west of Honduras and El Salvador, but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and the Honduran one is considered moribund. Ch'olti', a sister language of Ch'orti', is also extinct. Ch'olan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related to the language of the Classic-era inscriptions found in the Central Lowlands. They may have served as prestige languages, coexisting with other dialects in some areas. This assumption provides a <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> for the geographical distance between the Ch'orti' zone and the areas where Ch'ol and Chontal are spoken.|$|E

25|$|Alterations in {{exposure}} to microorganisms is another <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation,</b> at present, {{for the increase}} in atopic allergy. Endotoxin exposure reduces release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFNγ, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12 from white blood cells (leukocytes) that circulate in the blood. Certain microbe-sensing proteins, known as Toll-like receptors, found {{on the surface of}} cells in the body are also thought to be involved in these processes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} nebular {{components}} (or anomalies) of the Crab Nebula is a helium-rich torus which is visible as an east-west band crossing the pulsar region.

As yet, {{there has been no}} <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> put forth for the structure of the torus.|$|E
25|$|Research in Germanic {{etymology}} continues, {{and many}} Germanic words whose origins were previously unclear or controversial now have <b>plausible</b> <b>explanations</b> {{in terms of}} reconstructed Indo-European words and morphology. Thus, the proportion of Germanic words without any <b>plausible</b> etymological <b>explanation</b> has decreased over time. Estimates of that proportion are typically outdated or inflated, {{as many of these}} proposals were unknown when scholars were compiling lists of unexplained Germanic words.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} new {{framework}} of explanation-oriented data mining by adding an explanation construction and evaluation phase {{to the data}} mining process. While traditional approaches concentrate on mining algorithms, we focus on explaining mined results. The mining task {{can be viewed as}} unsupervised learning that searches for interesting patterns. The construction and evaluation of mined patterns can be formulated as supervised learning that builds explanations. The proposed framework is therefore a simple combination of unsupervised and supervised learning. The basic ideas are illustrated using association mining. The notion of conditional association is used to represent <b>plausible</b> <b>explanations</b> of an association. The condition in a conditional association explicitly expresses the <b>plausible</b> <b>explanations</b> of an association. ...|$|R
25|$|Later explorers to {{the same}} regions, only a few decades after mound-building {{settlements}} had been reported, found the regions largely depopulated, the residents vanished, and the mounds untended. Since there had been little violent conflict with Europeans in that area during that period, the most <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> is that infectious diseases from the Old World, such as smallpox and influenza, had decimated most of the Native Americans who had comprised the last mound-builder civilization.|$|E
25|$|Responses to {{the problem}} of evil have {{sometimes}} been classified as defenses or theodicies. However, authors disagree on the exact definitions. Generally, a defense attempts to show that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. A defense need not argue that this is a probable or <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation,</b> only that the defense is logically possible. A defense attempts to answer the logical problem of evil.|$|E
25|$|Some specialists say {{the word}} may have {{originated}} during the Great Portuguese Discoveries, giving meaning to the sadness felt about those who departed on journeys to unknown seas and disappeared in shipwrecks, died in battle, or simply never returned. Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since the word {{has been found in}} earlier texts, this does not constitute a very good explanation. The Reconquista also offers a <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{approach}} for legal justification based on an abductive multi-agent system. Legal justification has the main objective of finding the <b>plausible</b> <b>explanations</b> for some given pieces of evidence, for instance in a crime trial. In our approach, the process of justification is done through the collaborative abductive reasoning of agents, which operate within a logic-based architecture called ALIAS. We apply the proposed approach on an example borrowed from the literature. We show that using ALIAS agents in legal justification allows not only to produce <b>plausible</b> <b>explanations</b> for observed evidences, but also to detect either collusion or inconsistencies among trial characters, and {{to take into consideration}} the credibility of the persons (e. g., witnesses) involved in the trial...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the links among the memory sources of dreams {{can be carried out}} by means of an {{automatic}} analysis of text files including dream reports and associations. Heuristic criteria can provide <b>plausible</b> <b>explanations</b> for the existence of these links, which generally present a logical {{and at the same time}} emotional significance. The aim of this paper is to support the idea that the {{study of the}} link patterns among dream sources, in addition to being interesting from the cognitive viewpoint can be also useful for the therapeutic process. An interaction schema is described including four operators: the dreamer (patient), the therapist, the detector of possible links, and the proposer of <b>plausible</b> <b>explanations.</b> Two examples are given of application of this schema...|$|R
25|$|A <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> for {{contacts}} between Villa and the German after 1915 {{is that they}} were a futile extension of increasingly desperate German diplomatic efforts and Villista dreams of victory as progress of their respective wars bogged down. Villa effectively did not have anything useful to offer in exchange for German help at that point. When assessing claims of Villa conspiring with Germans, portrayal of Villa as a German sympathizer served the propaganda needs of both Carranza and Wilson and has to be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|Anholt {{belonged to}} the parish of Morup in the Danish {{province}} of Halland {{until the middle of}} the 16th century, when a church was built on the island itself. The island remained Danish when Denmark ceded Halland to Sweden in 1645. A story claims that a negotiator had left a glass of beer placed over the island on the map during the peace negotiations. A more <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> is that Swedish forces had not conquered the fairly remote island and had little interest in it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the vaccine}} court, as in civil tort cases, {{the burden of}} proof is a {{preponderance}} of evidence, but while in tort cases, this is met by expert testimony establishing a rigorous scientific case, in the vaccine court, the burden is met with a three prong test: the petitioner must present a biological theory of harm, a logical sequence of events connecting the vaccine to the injury, and establish an appropriate time frame in which injury occurred; the petitioner must also show that there is not another biologically <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> for the injury.|$|E
25|$|The {{main volume}} {{of water from}} the Ganges River began flowing through the Padma channel in the sixteenth century.

The Teesta was active in the region until it changed its course in 1787. This territory lies in between the land raised in the north by the Teesta system when it was active and that in the south by the Padma.|$|E
25|$|The diagram on {{the right}} {{suggests}} a <b>plausible</b> <b>explanation</b> of whistle operation. Within the cavity is an off-center vortex.

When the jet moves toward the cavity an additional thrust {{is given to the}} interior vertical flow which then rotates around and back to the edge. At that point, the cavity flow and the local pressure are sufficient to force the jet {{to move away from the}} cavity.|$|E
