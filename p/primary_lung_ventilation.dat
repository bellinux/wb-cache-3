40|$|Abstract Introduction Independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{is a form}} of {{protective}} ventilation strategy used in adult asymmetric acute lung injury, where the application of conventional mechanical ventilation can produce ventilator-induced lung injury and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Only a few experiences have been published on the use of independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> in newborn patients. Case presentation We present a case of independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> in a 16 -day-old infant of 3. 5 kg body weight who had an asymmetric lung injury due to respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. We used independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> applying conventional protective pressure controlled ventilation to the less-compromised lung, with a respiratory frequency proportional to the age of the patient, and a pressure controlled high-frequency ventilation to the atelectatic lung. This was done because a single tube conventional ventilation protective strategy would have exposed the less-compromised lung to a high mean airways pressure. The target of independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> is to provide adequate gas exchange at a safe mean airways pressure level and to expand the atelectatic <b>lung.</b> Independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> was accomplished for 24 hours. Daily chest radiograph and gas exchange were used to evaluate the efficacy of independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Extubation was performed after 48 hours of conventional single-tube mechanical <b>ventilation</b> following independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Conclusion This case report demonstrates the feasibility of independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> with two separate tubes in neonates as a treatment of an asymmetric acute lung injury. </p...|$|R
40|$|Movements of the hyobranchial {{apparatus}} in {{reptiles and amphibians}} {{contribute to}} many behaviors including feeding, <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation,</b> buccopharyngeal respiration, thermoregulation, olfaction, defense and display. In a semi-aquatic turtle, Platysternon megacephalum, x-ray video and airflow measurements from blowhole pneumotachography show no evidence that above water hyobranchial move-ments contribute to lung inflation, as in the buccal or gular pump of amphibians and some lizards. Instead, hyobranchial movements produce symmetrical oscillations of air {{into and out of}} the buccal cavity. The mean tidal volume of these buccal oscillations is 7. 8 times smaller than the mean tidal volume of <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> (combined mean for four individuals). Airflow associated with buccal oscillation occurs in the sequence of inhalation followed by exhalation, distinguishing it from <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> which occurs as exhalation followed by inhalation. No fixed temporal relationship between buccal oscillation and <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> was observed. Periods of ventilation often occur without buccal oscillation and buccal oscillation sometimes occurs without <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation.</b> When the two behaviors occur together, the onset of <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> often interrupts buccal oscillation.

40|$|ObjectiveSingle-lung {{transplantation}} {{for chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease can cause unique postoperative problems that might require independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation.</b> We evaluated preoperative and immediate postoperative factors {{to predict the}} need for independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation.</b> MethodsWe retrospectively studied 170 patients who received a single-lung transplant over a 15 -year period, 20 (12 %) of whom required independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation.</b> ResultsPatients requiring independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> were similar in age, sex, ischemic time, and donor characteristics to those who required conventional ventilation. Patients receiving independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> had a greater degree of preoperative airflow limitation, more hyperinflation, lower postoperative Pao 2 /fraction of inspired oxygen ratios, more radiologic mediastinal shift, and more transplant lung infiltrate on the postoperative chest radiograph. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> was associated with increasing levels of recipient hyperinflation (percentage total lung capacity compared with predicted value; odds ratio, 1. 04; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 01 - 1. 07; P =. 032) and reduced early postoperative Pao 2 /fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (odds ratio, 0. 97; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 95 - 0. 99; P =. 005). Length of ventilation and intensive care unit stay and mortality were higher in the independent <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> group. Among patients who survived to hospital discharge, there were no differences in long-term mortality between the 2 groups.

40|$|Besides {{being one}} of the {{mechanisms}} responsible for ventilator-induced lung injury, atelectasis also seems to aggravate the course of experimental pneumonia. In this study, we examined the effect of reducing the degree of atelectasis by natural modified surfactant and/or open <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> on bacterial growth and translocation in a piglet model of Group B streptococcal pneumonia. After creating surfactant deficiency by whole lung lavage, intratracheal instillation of bacteria induced severe pneumonia with bacterial translocation into the blood stream, resulting in a mortality rate of almost 80 %. Treatment with 300 mg/kg of exogenous surfactant before instillation of streptococci attenuated both bacterial growth and translocation and prevented clinical deterioration. This goal was also achieved by reversing atelectasis in lavaged animals via open <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Combining both exogenous surfactant and open <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> prevented bacterial translocation completely, comparable to Group B streptococci instillation into healthy animals. We conclude that exogenous surfactant and open <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> attenuate bacterial growth and translocation in experimental pneumonia and that this attenuation is at least in part mediated by a reduction in atelectasis. These findings suggest that minimizing alveolar collapse by exogenous surfactant and open <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> may reduce the risk of pneumonia and subsequent sepsis in ventilated patient...|$|R
