25|$|Görgey did not led {{his troops}} in the battle, he let the commanders of his army corps to work {{together}} freely, without being conducted by his orders. And despite of that, this battle demonstrated that the Hungarian army can fight in a perfectly coordinated way, without committing {{the mistakes of the}} previous battles when different officers showed different levels of taking decisions of their own, when the unexpected situation requires it, like for example in the Battle of Isaszeg. In this battle Klapka, Damjanich, and Gáspár, three generals with very different temperaments (Damjanich being very impulsive, taking decisions in the battle in a moment and fulfilling them, without thinking the risk, Klapka, an old fashioned Habsburg-type general, who <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> importance on the safety of his troops, as well like Gáspár, who was sometimes obeying to the orders taken before from his superiors, even if {{the situation on the ground}} urged him to move differently for the sake of the battle) showed a perfect coordination and the capability of taking correct decisions when the situation required, which assured the success for the Hungarian army. The cavalry also did his best in the pursuing of the fleeing enemy at the end of the battle. This is why the Battle of Nagysalló is considered one of the best executed battles of the Hungarian Independence war.|$|E
25|$|On day three, however, Kent hit back. In 33 fiery overs before lunch, Amjad Khan and Min Patel both {{took two}} wickets, and despite more runs from Ervine - who {{finished}} with 74 - Hampshire crumbled to 182 for 7 at lunch. However, Andy Bichel and Nic Pothas added 138 {{for the eighth}} wicket, as Hampshire eked out 325, with Bichel top-scoring from number nine with 87 off 90 balls. Kent got a good start to their attempt to get quick runs and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> target up for Hampshire, as they moved to 140 for 4 just before the close of play, but Shane Watson took two quick wickets and Shaun Udal one, {{and all of a}} sudden it was up to Justin Kemp and Andrew Hall to save Kent, as they were 153 for 7 overnight. Kemp fell on the fourth morning, as Kent rolled over for 185, setting up a potentially exciting finish with 307 runs to get in 83 overs. A 95-run partnership between Sean Ervine and John Crawley put Hampshire into a good position at 139 for 1, but Hampshire failed to score quickly enough, and three wickets from Simon Cook could not quite force a victory as Hampshire hung on to finish on 241 for 8 and draw the match.|$|E

500|$|The makeup for the {{character}} of The Great Mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor Tony Lindala. The Mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper, including 10–15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, and then I had sat around for three or four. And now I was going {{to sit in the}} dark, and I could only see out of one eye. They <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> contact lens in."

Randall Cotton felt that saving the facades did not preserve the essence of the buildings, but that it was better than nothing. Cotton said, [...] "At the eyeball level, it will give something of the coherence of the Philadelphia cityscape, which is a human scale. The beauty of Philadelphia is that its lots were 20 to 25 feet, which allowed for a door and two windows. It's a falsehood to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> building behind them. But it's preferable to demolition." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron was critical of the parking garage on the lower floors, saying it [...] "detracts from [...] crisp, vertical lines and bumps clumsily against the historic buildings. The garage also makes the tower feel distant from the life of the city."

500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker.

We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> 'X' on our hand, So we came back to Washington D.C. and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and we will put this 'X' on our hand. If you see us drinking you can throw us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|E

She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was alone with him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] Nicole was unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby. Of the breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> strain on their relationship." [...] After the incident, Nicole is asked by Marylin, {{to stay away from the}} baby.
