5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, <b>proliferating</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses {{is a pair}} of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.|$|E
5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by <b>Proliferating</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E

25|$|Further {{research}} implicates the supplementary role of <b>proliferating</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear antigen (PCNA) to DNA ligase I's {{function of}} joining Okazaki fragments. When the PCNA binding site on DNA ligase I is inactive, DNA ligase I's {{ability to connect}} Okazaki fragments is severely impaired. Thus, a proposed mechanism follows: after a PCNA-DNA polymerase δ complex synthesizes Okazaki fragments, the DNA polymerase δ is released. Then, DNA ligase I binds to the PCNA, which is clamped to the nicks of the lagging strand, and catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds.|$|E
25|$|When it is {{time for}} a cell to enter S phase, {{complexes}} of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and cyclins phosphorylate Rb to pRb, allowing E2F-DP to dissociate from pRb and become active. When E2F is free it activates factors like cyclins (e.g. cyclin E and cyclin A), which push the cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases, and a molecule called <b>proliferating</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear antigen, or PCNA, which speeds DNA replication and repair by helping to attach polymerase to DNA. The initial phosphorylation is performed by Cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6, followed by additional phosphorylation by Cyclin E/CDK2. pRb remains phosphorylated throughout S, G2 and M phases.|$|E
25|$|To {{strengthen}} {{the interaction between}} the polymerase and the template DNA, DNA sliding clamps associate with the polymerase to promote the processivity of the replicative polymerase. In eukaryotes, the sliding clamp is a homotrimer ring structure known as the <b>proliferating</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear antigen (PCNA). The PCNA ring has polarity with surfaces that interact with DNA polymerases and tethers them securely to the DNA template. PCNA-dependent stabilization of DNA polymerases has a significant effect on DNA replication because PCNAs are able to enhance the polymerase processivity up to 1,000-fold. PCNA is an essential cofactor and has the distinction of being {{one of the most common}} interaction platforms in the replisome to accommodate multiple processes at the replication fork, and so PCNA is also viewed as a regulatory cofactor for DNA polymerases.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{a recent}} mathematical model of avascular tumour spheroid growth {{which accounts for}} both cell cycle dynamics and chemotactic driven cell movement. The model considers cells to exist {{in one of two}} compartments: proliferating and quiescent, as well as accounting for necrosis and apoptosis. One particular focus of this paper is the behaviour created when <b>proliferating</b> and quiescent <b>cells</b> have different chemotactic responses to an extracellular nutrient supply. Two very different steady-state behaviours are identified corresponding to those cases where <b>proliferating</b> <b>cells</b> move either more quickly or more slowly than quiescent cells in response to a gradient in the extracellular nutrient supply. The case where <b>proliferating</b> <b>cells</b> move more rapidly leads to the commonly accepted spheroid structure of a thin layer of <b>proliferating</b> <b>cells</b> surrounding an inner quiescent core. In the case where <b>proliferating</b> <b>cells</b> move more slowly than quiescent cells the model predicts an interesting structure of a thin layer of quiescent cells surrounding an inner core of <b>proliferating</b> and quiescent <b>cells.</b> The sensitivity of this tumour structure to the cell cycle model parameters is also discussed. In particular variations in the steady-state size of the tumour and the types of transient behaviour are explored. The model reveals interesting transient behaviour with sharply delineated regions of <b>proliferating</b> and quiescent <b>cells...</b>|$|R
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} frequently {{occurs in}} repeated sequences, {{and helps to}} suppress the expression and mobility of 'transposable elements': Because 5-methylcytosine can be spontaneously deaminated (replacing nitrogen by oxygen) to thymidine, CpG sites are frequently mutated and become rare in the genome, except at CpG islands where they remain unmethylated. Epigenetic changes of this type thus {{have the potential to}} direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. DNA methylation patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a complex interplay of at least three independent DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice. DNMT1 is the most abundant methyltransferase in somatic cells, localizes to replication foci, has a 10–40-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA and interacts with the <b>proliferating</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear antigen (PCNA).|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} nuclear {{staining}} patterns seen on HEp-2 cells: homogeneous, speckled, nucleolar, nuclear membranous, centromeric, nuclear dot and pleomorphic. The homogeneous pattern is seen when the condensed chromosomes and interphase chromatin stain. This pattern {{is associated with}} anti-dsDNA antibodies, antibodies to nucleosomal components, and anti-histone antibodies. There are two speckled patterns: fine and coarse. The fine speckled pattern has fine nuclear staining with unstained metaphase chromatin, which is associated with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. The coarse staining pattern has coarse granular nuclear staining, caused by anti-U1-RNP and anti-Sm antibodies. The nucleolar staining pattern is associated with many antibodies including anti-Scl-70, anti-PM-Scl, anti-fibrillarin and anti-Th/To. Nuclear membrane staining appears as a fluorescent ring around the cell nucleus and are produced by anti-gp210 and anti-p62 antibodies. The centromere pattern shows multiple nuclear dots in interphase and mitotic cells, corresponding {{to the number of}} chromosomes in the cell. Nuclear dot patterns show between 13–25 nuclear dots in interphase cells and are produced by anti-sp100 antibodies. Pleomorphic pattern is caused by antibodies to the <b>proliferating</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear antigen. Indirect immunofluorescence {{has been shown to be}} slightly superior compared to ELISA in detection of ANA from HEp-2 cells.|$|E

2500|$|DNA {{molecules}} in eukaryotes {{differ from the}} circular molecules of prokaryotes {{in that they are}} larger and usually have multiple origins of replication. This means that each eukaryotic chromosome is composed of many replicating units of DNA with multiple origins of replication. In comparison, the prokaryotic E. coli chromosome has only a single origin of replication. In eukaryotes, these replicating forks, which are numerous all along the DNA, form [...] "bubbles" [...] in the DNA during replication. The replication fork forms at a specific point called autonomously replicating sequences (ARS). Eukaryotes have a clamp loader complex and a six-unit clamp called the <b>proliferating</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear antigen. The efficient movement of the replication fork also relies critically on the rapid placement of sliding clamps at newly primed sites on the lagging DNA strand by ATP-dependent clamp loader complexes. This means that the piecewise generation of Okazaki fragments can keep up with the continuous synthesis of DNA on the leading strand. [...] These clamp loader complexes are characteristic of all eukaryotes and separate some of the minor differences in the synthesis of Okazaki fragments in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.|$|E
2500|$|To {{test the}} effects of the protein {{mutations}} on living organisms, researchers genetically altered lab mice to be homozygous for another mutation in protein related to DNA replication, flap endonuclease 1, or FEN1. The results varied based on the specific gene alterations. Homozygous knockout mutant mice experienced a [...] "failure of cell proliferation" [...] and [...] "early embryonic lethality" [...] (27). Mice with mutation F343A and F344A (also known as FFAA) died directly after birth due to complications including pancytopenia and pulmonary hypoplasia. This is because the FFAA mutation keeps FEN1 from interacting with PCNA (<b>proliferating</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear antigen), consequently not allowing it to complete its purpose during Okazaki fragment maturation. Under careful observation, cells homozygous for FFAA FEN1 mutations seem to display only partial defects in maturation, meaning mice heterozygous for the mutation would be able to survive into adulthood, despite sustaining multiple small nicks in their genomes. Inevitably however, these nicks prevent future DNA replication because the break causes the replication fork to collapse and causes double strand breaks in the actual DNA sequence. In time, these nicks also cause full chromosome breaks, which could lead to severe mutations and cancers. Other mutations have been implemented with altered versions of Polymerase α, leading to similar results.|$|E

Werner’s Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease in which individuals display symptoms of ageing prematurely. Werner’s Syndrome fibroblasts display a reduced lifespan in culture compared with normal human fibroblasts. Like normal human fibroblasts, the growth of Werner’s Syndrome fibroblasts is characterised by a decreasing fraction of cells reacting with the proliferationassociated antibodies throughout their lifespan in culture.
