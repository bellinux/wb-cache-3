40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} the factors that influence C-O bond formation reactions has been carried out to elucidate the mechanism by which copper mediates the Ullmann-type SNAr reaction of 4 -chloropyridine with <b>potassium</b> <b>phenolate.</b> Process conditions such as temperature, reactant concentrations, catalyst concentration and amounts of solubilizing additive were varied to obtain the kinetic data. Both reactant and product concentration were found to {{have a significant effect on}} the reaction rate. An increased concentration of 18 -crown- 6 ether, used as an alkali metal solubilizing agent for <b>potassium</b> <b>phenolate,</b> proved to be effective only for low conversions, whereas inhibited phenolate complexation at high product concentrations was observed. An apparent activation energy of 55 kJ•mol- 1 was observed for a Cu 0 catalyst in the liquid-phase coupling reaction in a temperature range of 100 - 150 C. It was demonstrated that a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model is mechanistically most likely to be obeyed for this type of surface reaction. A maximum adsorption enthalpy on Cu was found for the product, 4 phenoxypyridine, followed by the reactants phenolate and 4 -chloropyridine, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Powdered {{graphite}} samples {{loaded with}} various amounts of KOH have been reacted with atmospheric pressure of steam in the temperature range 700 – 900 K. Significant amounts of C 1 to C 6 hydrocarbons {{are found in}} the gaseous products of this reaction. Both the abundance of these hydrocarbons with respect to hydrogen and their relative distribution vary as a function of reaction time, KOH loading and temperature. A model for their production is proposed according to which C-H groups are stabilized by the formation of a <b>potassium</b> <b>phenolate</b> type compound at the prismatic edge of graphite. Hydrocarbon would then be produced from the direct hydrogenation of surface carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon distribution shows some deviation from the ideal Schulz-Flory distribution, giving little support to a chain growth type mechanism...|$|E
40|$|New routes for the {{preparation}} of highly active TiO 2 -supported Cu and CuZn catalysts {{have been developed for}} CO coupling reactions. Slurries of a titania precursor were dip-coated onto glass beads to obtain either structured mesoporous or non-porous titania thin films. The Cu and CuZn nanoparticles, synthesized using a reduction by solvent method, were deposited onto calcined films to obtain a Cu loading of 2  wt[*]%. The catalysts were characterized by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, temperature-programmed oxidation/reduction (TPO/TPR) techniques, 63 Cu nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM-EDX) and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS). The activity and stability of the catalysts obtained have been studied in the CO Ullmann coupling of 4 -chloropyridine and <b>potassium</b> <b>phenolate.</b> The titania-supported nanoparticles retained catalyst activity for up to 12  h. However, catalyst deactivation was observed for longer operation times due to oxidation of the Cu nanoparticles. The oxidation rate could be significantly reduced over the CuZn/TiO 2 catalytic films due to the presence of Zn. The 4 -phenoxypyridine yield was 64 [*]% on the Cu/nonporous TiO 2 at 120 [*]°C. The highest product yield of 84 [*]% was obtained on the Cu/mesoporous TiO 2 at 140 [*]°C, corresponding to an initial reaction rate of 104  mmol[*]gcat− 1 [*]s− 1. The activation energy on the Cu/mesoporous TiO 2 catalyst was found to be (144 ± 5)  kJ[*]mol− 1, which is close to the value obtained for the reaction over unsupported CuZn nanoparticles (123 ± 3  kJ[*]mol− 1) and almost twice the value observed over the catalysts deposited onto the non-porous TiO 2 support (75 ± 2  kJ[*]mol− 1). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Potassium acetate, solubilised in chlorobenzene-by 18 -crown- 6, {{displaces}} the phenolate ion from substituted phenyl acetates by a second-order (k(- 2) (Cl)) process. <b>Potassium</b> <b>phenolate</b> ions, under similar conditions, {{react with}} acetic anhydride via a second-order (k(2) (Cl)) to yield the phenyl acetate. The {{concentration of the}} crown {{does not affect the}} reactivity unless it is not sufficient to solubilise the reactants. The rate constants correlate with the ionisation of the substituted phenols in water: log k(2) (Cl) = 1. 60 +/- 0. 23 pK(a) (ArOH(aq)) - 9. 06 +/- 1. 4 log k(- 2) (Cl) = - 0. 97 +/- 0. 12 pK(a) (ArOH(aq)) + 4. 78 +/- 0. 78 The equilibrium constant for transfer of the acetyl group between phenolate ions and acetic anhydride in chlorobenzene has a Bronsted beta(eq) (Cl) of 2. 6 measured against pK(a) (ArOH(aq)). The second-order rate constants (k(2) (aq)) have been measured for the reaction of substituted phenolate ions with acetic an hydride in water and they obey the Bronsted equation: log (k(2) (aq)) = 0. 56 +/- 0. 06 pK(a) (ArOH(aq)) - 2. 52 +/- 0. 51 Comparison {{of the value of the}} Bronsted exponent for the equilibrium constant in chlorobenzene (beta = 2. 6) compared with that for aqueous solution (beta = 1. 7) indicates a greater development of effective charge consistent with the weaker solvating power of chlorobenzene. The reaction of substituted phenoxide ion with acetic anhydride has a Leffler alpha value of 0. 33 and 0. 62 for aqueous and chlorobenzene solutions; respectively, indicating a more advanced bond formation in the transition state of the reaction in the latter solvent even though the reactions in chlorobenzene are faster than in water...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. Compounds, 2, 6 -bis(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazol- 1 -ylmethyl) {{pyridine}} (L 1) and 2, 6 -bis(3, 5 -ditertbutylpyrazol- 1 -ylmethyl) pyridine (L 2) {{were prepared}} by phase transfer alkylation of 2, 6 -bis(bromomethyl) pyridine with two mole equivalents {{of the appropriate}} pyrazole. Ligands L 1 and L 2 reacted with either [PdCl 2 (NCMe) 2] or [PdClMe(COD) ] to form mononuclear palladium complexes [(PdCl 2 (L 1) ] (1), [(PdClMe(L 1) ] (2), [(PdCl 2 (L 2) ] (3), [(PdClMe(L 2) ] (4). All new compounds prepared were characterised {{by a combination of}} 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR spectroscopy and microanalyses. The coordination of L 2 in a bidentate fashion through the pyridine nitrogen atom and one pyrazolyl nitrogen atom has been confirmed by single crystal X-ray crystallography of complex 3. Reactions of 1, 2 and 3 with the halide abstractor NaBAr 4 (Ar = 3, 5 -(CF 3) 2 C 6 H 3) {{led to the formation of}} the stable tridentate cationic species [(PdCl(L 1) ]BAr 4 (5), [(PdMe(L 1) ]BAr 4 (6) and [(PdCl(L 2) ]BAr 4 (7) respectively. Tridentate coordination of L 1 and L 2 in the cationic complexes has also been confirmed by single X-ray crystallography of complexes 5 and 6. The analogous carbonyl linker cationic species, [Pd{(3, 5 -Me 2 pz-CO) 2 -py}Cl]+ (9) and [Pd{(3, 5 -tBu 2 pz-CO) 2 -py}Cl]+ (10), prepared by halide abstraction from [Pd{(3, 5 -Me 2 pz-CO) 2 -py}Cl 2] and [Pd{(3, 5 -tBu 2 pz-CO) 2 -py}Cl 2] with NaBAr 4, were however less stable. While cationic complexes 5 - 7 showed indefinite stability in solution, 9 and 10 had t 1 / 2 of 14 and 2 days respectively. Attempts to crystallise 1 and 3 from the mother liquor resulted in the isolation of the salts [PdCl(L 1) ] 2 [Pd 2 Cl 6] (11) and [PdCl(L 2) ] 2 [Pd 2 Cl 6] (12). Although when complexes 1 - 4 xviii were reacted with modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO) or NaBAr 4, no active catalysts for ethylene oligomerisation or polymerisation were formed, activation with silver triflate (AgOTf) produced active catalysts that oligomerised and polymerised phenylacetylene to a mixture of cis-transoidal and trans-cisoidal polyphenylacetylene. Compounds 2 -(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazol- 1 -ylmethyl) pyridine (L 3) and 2 -(3, 5 -di-tert-butylpyrazol- 1 -ylmethyl) pyridine (L 4) were prepared by phase transfer alkylation of 2 -picolylchloride hydrochloride with one mole equivalent of the appropriate pyrazole. Compounds 2 -(3, 5 -bis-trifluoromethyl-pyrazol- 1 -ylmethyl) - 6 -(3, 5 -dimethyl-pyrazol- 1 -ylmethyl) -pyridine (L 5) and 2 -(3, 5 -dimethyl-pyrazol- 1 -ylmethyl) - 6 -phenoxymethyl-pyridine (L 6) were isolated in good yields by reacting (2 -chloromethyl- 6 - 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazol- 1 -ylmethyl) pyridine with an equivalent amount of potassium salt of 3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) pyrazolate and <b>potassium</b> <b>phenolate</b> respectively. L 3 -L 6 react with either [Pd(NCMe) 2 Cl 2] or [PdClMe(COD) ] to give mononuclear palladium complexes 13 - 18 of the general formulae [PdCl 2 (L) ] or [PdClMe(L) ] where L = is the bidentate ligands L 3, L 4, L 5 and L 6 respectively. Single crystal X-ray crystallography of complexes 13, 15 and 16 has been used to confirm the solid state geometry of the complexes. In attempts to generate active olefin oligomerisation catalysts, the chloromethyl Pd(II) complexes 14 and 16 were reacted with the halide abstractor NaBAr 4 in the presence of stabilising solvents (i. e Et 2 O or NCMe) but no catalytic activities were observed. Decomposition was evident as observed from the deposition of palladium black in experiments using Et 2 O. In experiments where NCMe was used as the stabilising solvent, the formation of cationic species stabilised by NCMe was evident from 1 H NMR analyses. Reaction of complex 14 with NaBAr 4 on a preparative scale in a mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 and NCMe solvent gave the cationic complex [[PdMeNCMe(L 3) ]BAr 4 (19) in good yields. Complex 17 reacted with NABAr 4 to give tridentate cationic species [[PdMe(L 5) ]BAr 4 (20) which is inactive towards ethylene oligomerisation or polymerisation reactions. The tridentate coordination of L 5 in 20 has also been established by single crystal X-ray structure of 20. Catalysts generated from 18 and 19 catalysed ethylene polymerisation at high pressures to branched polyethylene; albeit with very low activity. The Choromethyl palladium complex 14 reacted with sulfur dioxide to form complex 21. The nature of the product has been established by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and mass spectrometry to be an insertion product of SO 2 into the Pd-Me bond of 14. Compounds L 1 -L 4 reacted with the nickel salts NiCl 2 or NiBr 2 in a 1 : 1 mole ratio to give the nickel complexes [NiCl 2 (L 1) ] (22), [NiBr 2 (L 1) ] (23), [NiCl 2 (L 2) ] (24), and [NiBr 2 (L 2) ] (25), [Ni 2 (μ 2 -Cl) 2 Cl 2 (L 3) 2] (26), [Ni 2 (μ 2 -Br) 2 Br 2 (L 3) 2] (27), [NiCl 2 (L 4) ] (29) and [NiBr 2 (L 4) ] (30) in good yields. Reaction of L 3 with NiBr 2 in a 2 : 1 mole gave the octahedral complex [NiBr 2 (L 4) 2] (28) in good yields. Complexes 22 - 30 were characterised by a combination micro-analyses, mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray analyses for 27 and 30. No NMR data were acquired because of the paramagnetic nature of the complexes. When complexes 22 - 30 were activated with EtAlCl 2, highly active olefin oligomerisation catalysts were formed. In the ethylene oligomeristion reactions, three oligomers: C 11, C 14 xx and C 16 were identified as the major products. Selectivityof 40 % towards α-olefins were generally obtained. In general catalysts that contain the bidentate ligands L 3 and L 4 were more active than those that contain the tridentate ligands L 1 and L 2. Dichloride complexes exhibited relatively higher catalytic activities than their dibromide analogues. Turn over numbers (TON) for oligomer formation showed high dependence on ethylene concentration. A Lineweaver-Burk analysis of reactions catalysed by 22 and 26 showed TON saturation of 28 393 kg oligomer/mol Ni. h and 19 000 kg oligomer/mol Ni. h respectively. Catalysts generated from complexes 22 - 30 also catalysed oligomerisation of the higher olefins, 1 -pentene, 1 -hexene and 1 -heptene and displayed good catalytic activities. Only two products C 12 and C 15 were obtained in the 1 -pentene oligomerisation reactions. The 1 -hexene reactions also gave two products, C 12 and C 18, while 1 -heptene oligomerisation reactions gave predominantly C 14 oligomers. Five benzoazoles were used to prepare a series of palladium complexes that were invesitigated as Heck coupling catalysts. The compounds 2 -pyridin- 2 -yl- 1 H-benzoimidazole (L 7) and 2 -pyridin- 2 -yl-benzothiazole (L 8) were prepared following literature procedures. The new ligands 2 -(4 -tert-butylpyridin- 2 -yl) -benzooxazole (L 9) and 2 -(4 -tert-butyl-pyridin- 2 -yl) -benzothiazole (L 10) were prepared by ring closure of aminophenol and aminothiophenol with tert-butyl picolinic acid respectively. The ligand 6 -tert-Butyl- 2 -(4 -tert-butyl-pyridin- 2 -yl) -benzothiazole (L 11) was prepared by intramolecular cyclisation under basic conditions is described. Reactions of L 7 -L 11 with either [Pd(NCMe) 2 Cl 2] or [Pd(COD) MeCl] afforded the corresponding mononuclear palladium complexes [PdClMe(L 7) ] (31), [PdClMe(L 8) ] (32), [PdCl 2 (L 9) ] (33), [PdMeCl(L 9) ] (34), [PdCl 2 (L 10) ] (5), [PdMeCl(L 10) ] (36) and [PdMeCl(L 11) ] (37) as xxi confirmed by mass spectrometry and micro-analyses. The palladium complexes 31 - 37 were efficient Heck coupling catalysts for the reaction of iodobenzene with butylacrylate under mild conditions and showed good stability...|$|E
