40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{characteristic}} of coagulation function in {{non-small cell lung cancer}} patients with acute cerebral infarction as the initial symptom. Methods: Cases diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer in our hospital from January 2015 to January 2016 {{were used for}} study. Fifteen cases with acute cerebral infarction as the initial symptom were included in experimental group. Thirty-three cases with no initial symptom on acute cerebral infarction were included in control group. Clinical data in patients of two groups were collected, including general information, coagulation function index, thrombelastogram index. Results: The prothrombin time (PT) [(9. 69  ±  1. 42) vs. (13. 04  ±  1. 96) s], activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) [(30. 14  ±  5. 79) vs. (39. 34  ±  7. 63) s], international normalized ratio (INR) [(0. 76  ±  0. 10) vs. (1. 35  ±  0. 22) ], coagulation reaction time (R) [(4. 76  ±  0. 79) vs. (6. 11  ±  0. 93) min], and blood clot formation time (K) [(1. 73  ±  0. 21) vs. (6. 11  ±  0. 93) min] in patients of experimental group were obviously lower than that of in control group. Fibrinogen (FIB) [(5. 43  ±  0. 89) vs. (2. 14  ±  0. 36) g/L], D-dimer [(0. 84  ±  0. 17) vs. 0. 30  ±  0. 06) mg/L], the maximum amplitude of thrombus (MA) [(65. 62  ±  10. 34) vs. (48. 69  ±  8. 61) mm], and α-angle [(68. 12  ±  9. 51) vs. (60. 37  ±  10. 29) deg] in patients of experimental group were obviously higher than that in control group. PT, APTT, INR, R value, and K value in patients of tumor node metastasis (TNM) Stage III–IV were significantly lower than that in TNM Stage I–II, and FIB, D-dimer, MA, α-angle were all higher than that in patients of TNM Stage I–II.

30|$|Interestingly, we observed, in {{cancerous}} tissue, {{a significantly}} higher incidence of the novel deletions {{in the group of}} patients with lymph node metastasis in comparison with the <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> node metastasis. However, this result is preliminary because of insufficient number of patients. It is possible that our novel deletions are involved in the mediation of tumor progression. However, our finding does not provide answers as to whether mtDNA alterations are contributing factors to carcinogenesis or whether they simply arise as part of secondary effects in cancer progression. Whether our detected novel deletions have an impact on cancer development or not requires further investigation. Studies have shown that a reduced mtDNA content is associated with higher histological grade in BC (Yadav & Chandra 2013) while other studies failed to demonstrate any correlation with tumor grade or metastasis (Yadav & Chandra 2013; Mambo et al. 2005). In the future, it would be of interest to investigate this type of correlation in our group with increased number of patients.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging {{system for}} esophageal cancer is {{controversial}} because {{it relies on}} arbitrary definitions of the anatomic location of lymph nodes to establish N and M status. It has been proposed {{that the number of}} involved lymph nodes may better predict survival. We reviewed our experience to determine the prognostic impact of the number of involved nodes and the extent of lymphadenectomy on the current staging system. MethodsRecords of all patients who underwent resection of previously untreated adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction were reviewed. Overall survival according to the AJCC staging system and the number of involved lymph nodes was analyzed by the method of Kaplan and Meier and by recursive partitioning methods. ResultsData were available on 336 patients operated on between January 1996 and September 2003. Recursive partitioning analysis using AJCC staging variables reproduced the AJCC staging system. When the number of involved lymph nodes is added, <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> more than 4 involved lymph nodes have survival similar to that of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> M 1 disease, and <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> involved <b>lymph</b> nodes have the best prognosis. Recursive partitioning analysis identified 18 lymph nodes as the minimal number required for accurate staging. In patients who have 18 or more lymph nodes removed, survival is only predicted by the presence of nodal involvement and M 1 disease. ConclusionOur analysis suggests that revisions of the current AJCC staging system for esophageal cancer should include N staging {{based on the number of}} involved lymph nodes and minimal requirements for the extent of lymphadenectomy...|$|R
40|$|A linear {{support vector machine}} (SVM) is used {{to extract}} 6 fea- tures from a total of 31 {{features}} in a dataset of 253 breast cancer patients. Five features are nuclear features obtained during a non-invasive diagnostic procedure while one feature, tumor size, is obtained during surgery. The linear SVM selected the 6 features {{in the process of}} classifying the patients into node-positive (<b>patients</b> <b>with</b> some metastasized lymph nodes) and nodenegative (<b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> metastasized <b>lymph</b> nodes). Node-positive patients are typically those who undergo chemotherapy. The 6 features were then used in a Gaussian kernel nonlinear SVM to classify the patients into three prog- nostic groups: good (node-negative), intermediate (1 to 4 metastasized nodes) and poor (more than 4 metastasized nodes). Very well separated Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for the three groups with pairwise p-value of less than 0. 009 based on the logrank statistic. Patients in the good prognostic group had the highest survival, while patients in the poor prognostic group had the lowest. The majority (72. 8 %) of the good group did not receive chemotherapy, while the majority (87. 5 %) of the poor group received chemotherapy. Just over half (56. 7 %) of the intermediate group received chemotherapy.

40|$|AbstractBackground: To {{investigate}} the prognostic {{significance of the}} number of lymph nodes removed in colorectal cancer (CRC) <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> metastatic <b>lymph</b> node. <b>Patients</b> and methods: The clinicopathological data of 461 CRC patients was analyzed. In order to compare the survival of patients who had fewer lymph nodes removed versus the survival of patients who had 1 – 3 metastatic lymph node(s), a separate group of 74 N 1 disease patients were also included in the study. All patient data were collected prospectively. Kaplan–Meier method was used for calculation and plotting of the survival curves of the patient groups, and log-rank test was used for the comparison of the survival curves. Results: Cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates of patients who had 1 – 7 lymph node(s) and 8 – 11 lymph nodes removed were significantly worse than those who had 12 or more lymph nodes removed (p =  0. 006 and p =  0. 037, respectively), while CSS was not significantly different between those who had 1 – 7 versus 8 – 11 lymph node(s) removed (p =  0. 647); this grouping had independent prognostic significance in Cox analysis (p =  0. 006). CSS of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> N 1 disease was not significantly different from those who had 1 – 7 and 8 – 11 lymph node(s) removed (p =  0. 312 and p =  0. 165, respectively), while it was significantly worse than CSS of patients who had 12 or more lymph nodes removed (p =  0. 001).

Patients and methods A series of 167 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> RCC, free from distant metastases at diagnosis, and who underwent radical nephrectomy at our hospital between January 1990 and October 1997, was reviewed. The mean (median, range) follow-up was 51 (45, 19 - 112) months. Of the 167 patients, 108 underwent radical nephrectomy alone and 59 had radical nephrectomy with regional LND limited to the anterior, posterior and lateral sides of the ipsilateral great vessel, from the level of the renal pedicle to the inferior mesenteric artery. Of these 59 patients, 49 had no evidence of nodal metastases before or during surgery. The probability of survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, using the log-rank test to estimate differences among levels of the analysed variables. Results The overall 5 -year survival was 79 %; the 5 -year survival rate for the 108 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy alone was 79 % and for the 49 who underwent LND was 78 %. Of the 49 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> suspicion of <b>lymph</b> node metastases, one (2 %) was found to have histologically confirmed positive nodes.

40|$|Lymph node {{dissection}} is {{of prime}} importance for accurate staging of colorectal carcinomas. Since {{a great number}} of small lymph nodes are missed in the traditional method, several fat clearing solutions have been introduced for easier detection of smaller lymph nodes. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of a new fat clearing solution so-called lymph node revealing solution (LNRS) in colectomy specimens of patients with colorectal carcinoma from year 2000 till 2002, thirty five colectomy specimens with less than 4 metastatic lymph nodes received in the pathology department of IKMC, were selected and re-evaluated using the LNRS. By using this solution 456 additional lymph nodes and 16 more metastatic lymph nodes were detected resulting in upstaging of 3 patients from Duke’s B to C. In all patients categorized as Nx (regional lymph nodes not assessed) by the traditional method, lymph nodes were detected after employment of LNRS. The mean diameter of dissected lymph nodes was significantly smaller than the traditional method (0. 268 versus 0. 429, P< 0. 000001). LNRS in comparison with previous solutions is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use.

METHODS: On the basis of our experience of 252 curative operations for rectal cancer, we analyze survival and recurrence in relation to the lymph node involvement and to the level of the lymph nodes where the metastases are located. All patients underwent a lymphadenectomy with high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery and removal of the lumboaortic lymph nodes from the left renal vein to the aortic bifurcation. Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 16 cases.

We determined the presence of the 4977 bp common deletion in cancer and normal paired tissue samples from 106 Vietnamese patients with BC by sequencing PCR products. The mtDNA 4977 bp deletion was significantly more frequent in normal tissue in comparison with paired cancer tissue. Moreover, the incidence of the 4977 bp deletion in BC tissue was significantly higher in patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive as compared with ER negative BC tissue.

40|$|From 1966 to 1981, 646 {{patients}} underwent resection {{for primary}} adenocarcinoma of the rectum by one surgeon (S. A. L.) in one hospital. The operation, selected by preoperative sigmoidoscopic measurement, was anterior resection (ASR) in 320 patients, abdominosacral resection (ASR) in 175 patients, and abdominoperineal resection (APR) in 151 patients. The operative mortality rate was 2 % following {{each of the}} operations. Anastomotic complications occurred in less than 2 % after AR and in 9. 7 % after ASR. All patients were completely continent of stool and flatus after AR and ASR. Follow-up is complete in 419 of 427 patients treated from 1966 to 1976. Five-year survival for curative resection (no distant metastases) was 66. 2 % after AR (129 / 195), 62. 9 % after ASR (56 / 89), and 43. 4 % after APR (33 / 76). For <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> tumor in <b>lymph</b> nodes, survival rates were 73. 9 % in AR, 75 % for ASR, and 59. 5 % for APR.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis (formation of {{new blood}} vessels) is {{associated}} with tumor growth and metastasis in patients with solid tumors, {{including those of the}} head and neck. Nitric oxide (NO) production may contribute to these processes. We assessed the role of the NO pathway in angiogenesis and tumor progression in patients with head and neck cancer. METHODS: Biochemical assays were used to measure NO synthase (NOS) activity and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in specimens of tumor and normal mucosa obtained from 27 patients. Microvessels in tumor specimens were identified by CD- 31 -specific immunohistochemical staining. Associations between microvessel densities, levels of NOS, and cGMP were examined by use of two-sided statistical tests. Tumor specimens and human squamous carcinoma A- 431 cells were grown as explants on the corneas of rabbits, and the effect of the NOS inhibitor N(omega) -nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) was tested. RESULTS: Levels of total NOS, inducible NOS, and cGMP were higher in tumor specimens than in specimens of normal mucosa (all P<. 0001).

Several investigations have emphasized on the role of CD 44 in various cancers and few studies have mentioned CD 24 and CD 74. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between CD 44, CD 24 and CD 74 expressions and several clinical or histopathological factors in OSCC patients. Materials and Methods: In our analytical cross-sectional study, forty primary OSCC specimens were immunohistochemically stained for CD 44, CD 24, and CD 74 proteins. Then, the relationship between their expressions and age, sex, lymph node metastasis, and histopathologic grading was statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney nonparametric and t-test. Furthermore, P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: CD 44 and CD 74 proteins were significantly over-expressed in OSCC patients with high grade (P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 001) as compared to those with low grade. Furthermore, CD 74 immunoreactivity showed significantly higher expression in patients with lower age (P = 0. 039).

Los individuos que mostraron negatividad con los tres métodos tuvieron un índice de recurrencia nulo. Los datos de este estudio sugieren una nueva estadificación oncológica a nivel molecular que permitiría seleccionar a los individuos que presenten metástasis submicroscópicas para un tratamiento completo, pero también evitar linfadenectomías en muchos individuos que no tienen metástasis ganglionares, permitiendo que éstos no sufran sobretratamiento. Survival at 5 {{years of}} patients with localized primary malignant melanoma is about 80 %, compared with a 35 % survival in case of lymph nodes involvement. Sentinel lymph node(s) from 45 subjects with diagnosis of malignant melanoma stage I or II was/were studied with hematoxylin-eosin (HE), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular biology (MB) techniques. The population was divided into three groups: HE-/IHC+/MB+, where 67 % patients died; HE-/IHC-/MB+, where 57 % died; and HE-/IHC-/MB-, where 100 % of the patients are alive, with no lymphadenectomy and a median follow-up of 60 months. Those subjects who showed negativity with all the three methods had a null recurrence rate. Data herein obtained suggest a new molecular oncological staging, which would allow the selection {{of patients with}} submicroscopic metastases for a complete treatment. Moreover, several <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> node metastases should not undergo lympha-denectomies, and overtreatment could therefore be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is {{the most}} common cancer {{diagnosed}} in children aged 1 - 14 years. There have been vast improvements in clinical outcomes for children diagnosed with ALL with cure rates of up to 90 % achievable for some forms of the disease. Despite these successes, some patients still relapse and the prognosis for these individuals is poor, thus there is still a great deal to be learned about the complex biology underlying ALL. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN 2) is a novel candidate gene in precursor B-cell (pre-B) ALL, and is aberrantly expressed in a high proportion (around 75 %) of cases. While the CTGF protein has no known role in lymphocyte biology or haemopoiesis, CTGF gene expression has been associated with a poor outcome in children and adults, particularly in those patients deemed to have a high-risk of relapse. The primary aims of this study were to characterise CTGF expression in paediatric pre-B ALL tumours and cell lines, and to investigate what mechanisms were responsible for its deregulated expression by examining the contribution of both genetic and epigenetic factors. Analysis of a cohort of 73 primary paediatric pre-B ALL specimens, confirmed CTGF was aberrantly expressed in 75 % of patients at heterogeneous levels. CTGF expression was found to be associated with prognosis in this cohort, as there was a trend toward lower 5 year relapse free survival (RFS) in patients with CTGFpos ALL (71 % RFS in CTGFpos, 83 % RFS in CTGFlow/neg), however this did not reach statistical significance (p= 0. 39). There was no difference in overall 5 year survival (OS) between patients with CTGFpos and CTGFlow/neg ALL. The association between CTGF expression and clinical features recorded at the time of biopsy was undertaken. These features included; age, gender, percentage blasts in bone marrow, peripheral haemoglobin level, spleen or lymph node involvement, or whether the sample was obtained at diagnosis or relapse. Patients with enlarged lymph nodes displayed a lower mean CTGF expression compared to those <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> node involvement. A similar pattern was observed with patients exhibiting enlargement of the spleen, however this did not reach statistical significance. No other clinical features were associated with CTGF expression. Analysis of global gene expression patterns in three independent paediatric pre-B ALL cohorts (PMH; n= 73, Ross; n= 118, Kang; n= 207), identified five genes that were highly correlated with CTGF expression; SOCS 2, MEF 2 C, ADD 3, GSN and DPYSL 2. In silico analysis of the 5 ’ flanking sequences of these genes, as well as CTGF identified predicted binding sites for the two Ikaros family proteins IKAROS and HELIOS, with at least one HELIOS site present in the 5 ’ flanking sequence of all correlated genes. This suggested a possible role for Ikaros family proteins in modulating CTGF gene expression. Subsequent analysis of a microarray cohort recently characterised for IKAROS gene deletions revealed that mutations or deletions within the IKAROS coding region were significantly associated with higher mean CTGF gene expression, implying that a loss of IKAROS function may promote activation of the CTGF locus. This is the first evidence implicating the Ikaros family of lymphoid transcriptional regulators in deregulation of the CTGF locus. Northern blotting of RNA from B-lineage ALL cell lines uncovered evidence of alternative splicing of CTGF mRNA. Non-canonical transcripts of approximately 1. 3 kb and 1. 6 kb were hybridised by a CTGF-specific probe in extracts from all CTGFpos cell lines. Sequencing of cDNA fragments as well as 5 ’ and 3 ’ RACE products from a cell line with the highest level of CTGF expression revealed a number of CTGF transcripts exhibiting internal deletions of exons 2 and 3, as well as truncation of exons 1 and 4. 3 ’ RACE also identified a 1. 3 kb transcript that was devoid of 3 ’ UTR regulatory elements as a result of premature polyadenylation. These findings represent the first direct evidence of alternative splicing of CTGF pre-mRNA in any tissue type and further investigation is warranted to fully characterise these tumour-associated transcripts and their protein coding potential. Structural changes within the genome are common in leukaemia and deletions affecting the long arm of chromosome 6 occur in around 30 % of cases of pre-B ALL. To investigate whether deregulation of CTGF expression has a genetic basis, the CTGF locus at 6 q 23. 1 was investigated for structural alterations or mutations. Southern blotting performed in seven B-lineage ALL cell lines (4 CTGFpos, 3 CTGFneg) confirmed that the CTGF locus was not cytogenetically rearranged. Furthermore, analysis of CTGF copy number by qPCR in primary paediatric pre-B ALL specimens (n= 17) and B-lineage ALL cell lines (n= 7) confirmed that gene amplification could not account for CTGF overexpression. Sequencing of the CTGF promoter and 3 ’ UTR in three B-lineage ALL cell lines confirmed that there were no mutations affecting these important regulatory regions, although one cell line harboured the rs 6918698 - 739 C>G SNP, which is predicted to disrupt SP 3 -mediated repression of CTGF gene expression. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is frequently altered in neoplasia. The CTGF locus contains a CpG island, and methylation of this region was found to be inversely correlated with CTGF gene expression in B-lineage ALL cell lines, as assessed by both methylation-specific PCR and by bisulfite sequencing. Bisulfite sequencing of primary tumour specimens revealed that hypomethylation of the CTGF locus was a widespread feature of pre-B ALL. By contrast, analysis of primary T-ALL specimens demonstrated extensive methylation at the CTGF locus, indicating that CTGF may be permissive for expression specifically in pre-B ALL. This study has highlighted several novel aspects of CTGF expression in pre-B ALL, including a potential role for Ikaros family proteins in regulating the CTGF locus, and the existence of CTGF mRNA transcripts generated through alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Investigation of mechanisms promoting CTGF gene expression in pre-B ALL revealed that the rs 6918698 C>G SNP was present in one pre-B ALL cell line. Hypomethylation of the CTGF locus was a notable feature of primary pre-B ALL specimens and was in contrast to the hypermethylation observed in 2 T-ALL specimens and CD 34 pos bone marrow cells. These findings will direct future research to elucidate the complex mechanisms regulating CTGF expression in pre-B ALL. It is anticipated that illuminating the role of CTGF in the pathogenesis of ALL may result in significantly improved patient outcomes through the development of targeted and less toxic therapies, and through improved risk-based stratification of patients to ensure those at a high risk of relapse are directed toward an appropriate level of therapeutic intervention...|$|E
