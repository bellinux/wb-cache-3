50|$|As the CPU is {{the main}} engine of the XC2000 microcontroller, it is also {{affected}} by certain actions of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystem.</b> Because a five-stage processing pipeline (plus two-stage fetch pipeline) is implemented in the XC2000, up to five instructions can be processed in parallel. Most instructions of the XC2000 are executed in one single clock cycle due to this parallelism.|$|E
50|$|Devices called Input/Output Multiplexers (IOMs) {{served as}} {{intelligent}} I/O controllers for communication with most peripherals. The IOM was passed {{the contents of}} the BAR for each I/O request, allowing it to use virtual rather than physical addresses. The IOM supported two different types of peripheral channels: Common Peripheral Channels could handle data transfer rates up to 650,000 cps; <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Subsystem</b> Interface Channels allowed transfers up to 1.3 million cps.|$|E

40|$|We study firm-level {{adoption}} of packaged software products of almost 4, 000 UK sites between 2000 and 2003. We consider all software {{used in a}} firm as its software product and categorize it into related, but distinct subsystems : the core subsystem (Operating Systems), and Desktop and En-terprise Applications, which we define as <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems.</b> Adoption is studied across those sub-systems. We find that larger firms tend to adopt and switch subsystems more often. We further consider three factors that may affect the adoption decision : product complexity, architectural innovation and competency scale. The complexity of existing peripheral sub-systems hinders switching {{with the exception of}} the UNIX operating system that becomes a more likely choice for firms with complex IT systems. UNIX OS is also adopted more often by firms with higher IT competency. Further, earlier generational expansion of <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems</b> generally decreases the likelihood of further adoptions. Architectural changes hinders {{adoption of}} some, but not all software applications. software, diffusion, innovation, system products...|$|R

40|$|Capitalizing on {{past and}} future {{development}} of high temperature gas reactor (HTGR) technology, a low mass 15 MWe closed gas turbine cycle power system using a pellet bed reactor heating helium working fluid is proposed for Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) applications. Although the design of this directly coupled system architecture, comprising the reactor/power system/space radiator subsystems, is presented in conceptual form, sufficient detail is included to permit an assessment of overall system performance and mass. Furthermore, an attempt is made to show how tailoring of the main subsystem design characteristics can be utilized to achieve synergistic system level advantages {{that can lead to}} improved reliability and enhanced system life while reducing the number of parasitic load driven <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>peripheral</b> {{processor}} <b>subsystem</b> used {{a technique}} known as barrel and slot {{to share the}} execution unit; each PP had its own memory and registers, but the processor (the slot) itself executed one instruction from each PP in turn (the barrel). This is a crude form of hardware multiprogramming. The peripheral processors had 4096 bytes of 12-bit memory words and an 18-bit accumulator register. Each PP had access to all I/O channels {{and all of the}} system's central memory (CM) in addition to the PP's own memory. The PP instruction set lacked, for example, extensive arithmetic capabilities and did not run user code; the <b>peripheral</b> processor <b>subsystem's</b> purpose was to process I/O and thereby free the more powerful central processor unit(s) to running user computations.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: This study {{described}} {{the design of}} a 3 -phase AC Induction Motor (ACIM) vector control drive with position encoder coupled to the motor shaft. Approach: It was based on free scale's (Motorola's) 68 k micro processor devices. Although the free scale 56 F 80 x (56800 core) and 56 F 8300 (56800 E core) families were well-suited for digital motor control and offer all things was needed, but we decided to realize a complete vector controller with a powerful 68 k processor. Results: Obviously all 680 X 0 and many 683 XX can overcome this task very easily, but we decided 68332 for time consuming because it combines high-performance data manipulation capabilities with powerful <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems.</b> All software and hardware was based on Peter J. Pinewski's nice research from Motorola. Conclusion: In this study the overall software algorithm and in two fellow papers the hardware schematics and performance will be described respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{dominant}} design {{has taken on a}} quasi-paradigmatic status in analyses of the link between technological and industrial dynamics. A review of the empirical literature reveals a variety of interpretations about some aspects of the phenomenon such as its underlying causal mechanisms and its level of analysis. To stimulate further progress in empirical research on dominant designs, we advocate a standardization of terminology by conceptualizing products as complex artifacts that evolve {{in the form of a}} nested hierarchy of technology cycles. Such a nested complex system perspective provides both unambiguous definitions of dominant designs (stable core components that can be stable interfaces) and inclusion of multiple levels of analysis (system, subsystems, components). We introduce the {{concept of a}}n operational principle and offer a systematic definition of core and <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems</b> based on the concept of pleiotropy. We also discuss how the proposed terminological standardization can stimulate cumulative research on dominant designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{dominant}} designs {{has taken on}} a paradigmatic status in the analysis of the link between technological and industrial dynamics. A review of the empirical literature, however, reveals that confusions exist over the concept, its underlying causal mechanisms, and its level of analysis. To put empirical research on dominant designs on more solid conceptual foundations, we conceptualize products as complex artifacts whose technological evolution proceeds {{in the form of a}} nested hierarchy of technology cycles. Such a nested complex system perspective provides both unambiguous definitions of dominant designs (as stable interfaces) and the inclusion of multiple levels of analysis (system, subsystem, component). To facilitate more cumulative empirical research on dominant design, we propose to use the concept of an operational principle and a systematic definition of core and <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems</b> based on the concept of pleiotropy. The paper concludes with implications of the hierarchical model of dominant designs for R&D corporate strategy managers and public policy makers...|$|R
50|$|The UNIVAC 1106 was {{introduced}} in December 1969 and was absolutely identical to the UNIVAC 1108, both physically and in instruction set. Like the 1108, it was multiprocessor capable, though it appears that it was never supplied with more than two CPUs, and did not support IOCs. In fact, {{the only difference between}} an 1108A CPU and an 1106 CPU was a couple of timing cards. In order to keep costs low, and 1106 CPU could be ordered with as few a four word channels. This meant that only three I/O channels were available for <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems,</b> as channel 15 (the highest-numbered channel) was always, in both 1106 and 1108 systems, dedicated to the operator's console. Early versions of the UNIVAC 1106 were simply half-speed UNIVAC 1108 systems. Later Sperry Univac used a different memory system which was inherently slower and cheaper than that of the UNIVAC 1108. Sperry Univac sold a total of 338 processors in 1106 systems.|$|R

The main objective of this developments was to increase the technical and organizational utilization rates in the single and small batch production. Additional future potentials of manufacturing systems are to activate by operations in the extreme fields of technologies like high speed, high volume and high precision. In this fields of operations the process management will become the critical success factor just in view of high performance and zero defects. The change drivers of future manufacturing systems are again the elctronic based technologies including virtual engineering, sensors and actuators as well as methods of the information processing like artificial neural networks and their integration to autonomous control and active exploration.

40|$|Up to now {{companies}} focussed {{their development}} and usage of flexible manufacturing systems {{mainly on the}} automation of the systems functions and the <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems</b> like transport and logistics. This paper suggests {{that the future of}} manufacturing will have to move forward across a broad front that pushes the technologies and concepts already being developed and applied and those that need to be developed, refined and adopted. Some of these are already being considered in manufacturing, while others are innovative product technologies that have been or are being developed in other sectors, mainly the automobile, mechatronics, information processing and communications sectors. Innovative manufacturing and pushing processing technologies to the extremes of physical limits. Another aspect is the miniaturization of production. All these will lead to autonomous machines that can learn and compensate for changes in conditions automatically by themselves. Developments may well lead to machines being operated or maintained by manufacturers of machines from remote sites. These developments are at different stages of realization, with some of them being too far in the future. However, they are too important to be ignored...|$|R
40|$|This manual {{has been}} {{prepared}} {{as a guide}} to operating the central processor for the GE- 225 Information Processing system. It includes {{a brief description of the}} major components of the system, general operating practices, system startup and shutdown, and a detailed description of the controls on the operator's cocsole and ty 2 ewriter. Part I has been revised to include descriptions and illustrations of equipment not included in the earlier editions of this manual. The appendix includes a section on number systems, a table of powers of 2, and octal-decimal conversion tables. Much of the basic information about machine instruction repertoire and programs is necessarily brief, since this information is contained in detail in the GE- 225 Programming Reference Manual (CPB- 252). This manual supersedes the former GE- 225 System Operating Manual (CPB- 247 A). The operating information on <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems</b> contained in that manual is now covered in separate manuals for each subsystem. A list of these manuals appears in Appendix E.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 TASKMASTER is an {{experimental}} microcontroller node of a real-time control oriented network which was proposed by James H. Herzog and Tinggui Zhang {{to demonstrate the}} feasibility of a task oriented control structure in performing distributed control actions. This study {{is a continuation of}} research involving the TASKMASTER network. A high performance microcontroller the 32 -bit Motorola MC 68332 has been used in this study to implement a node of the TASKMASTER network. Use of the MC 68332 with its powerful <b>peripheral</b> <b>subsystems</b> offers significant scope for improvement of the overall performance of the network in addition to strengthening its control processing capabilities. An 8 -bit microcontroller the Intel 8052 has also been used to implement a node of the network. A high-level language C has been used for coding of the operating system of the network which previously has been coded in assembly. In addition to being more readable, use of a high-level language offers other significant advantages such as portability, smaller code development time and code debugging time and the ability to compare different microcontrollers on a common basis. A performance analysis and comparison between the two microcontrollers used and the language used in coding them was also performed using performance measures designed as part of this study...|$|R
50|$|SDM {{was coined}} in 2014 by SanDisk for the {{software}} which leveraged their SSD and persistent memory devices. Both devices {{located on the}} processor's <b>peripheral</b> I/O <b>subsystem,</b> i.e. on PCIe-based cards. The following year (2015) was a crucial year for the standardization of plug-and-play DDR4-based NVDIMM cards. These persistent memory devices reside on the processor's memory subsystem, which requires broader platform support, but is a better fit, because it was designed for memory-like latencies and cache-line granular access. 2015 also saw several key announcements of new storage-class memory (SCM) based devices, such as Intel & Micron 3D XPoint, HPE & SanDisk memristors, Samsung & Netlist NVDIMM-P and Sony & Viking Technology.|$|R
30|$|A {{majority}} of the transceiver functionality is contained in the software modem. The goal of the software-based transceiver is to bring the SP functionality closer to the antenna as much as possible, reducing {{the burden on the}} RF front-end and utilizing the full flexibility of software. A software-based modem is particularly attractive over dedicated hardware solutions, such as ASIC- and FPGA-based solutions, due to significantly reduced design time from modeling to implementation to production. One of the major advantages of dedicated hardware is low-power design, but with the advancements made in system-on-chip (SoC) architectures over the years with particular emphasis on low-power design, solutions based on programmable SoC architectures can deliver levels of energy efficiency that are sufficient for many applications (e.g., see [2]). An SoC can be delivered as a complete solution that integrates not only the radio unit but other key units, such as central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), and <b>peripheral</b> controller <b>subsystems,</b> as well.|$|R
40|$|SpiNNaker is a {{large-scale}} multi-core computing engine designed to model heavily distributed fine-grain problems. The machine is constructed hierarchically: 1 monitor and 16 worker processors form a single node of a toroidal compute 'surface'. The six high-speed bi-directional links of each node {{are used for}} triangular edge connections that provide alternative routes around problematic links. The system itself is scalable from one node up to 216 resulting in a maximum of 220 worker processors. SpiNNaker is an isotropic homogeneous network of processors that deliberately includes no central overseer. A consequence of this isotropy is an absence of perimeter and hence no natural position for peripheral I/O connections. This study describes the practical techniques and details employed in two components of the system: (a) SpiNNlink is the proposed board-to-board interconnection system that multiplexes 48 separate 250 Mbps SpiNNaker links through six off-board connections without compromising the overall system bisection bandwidth, forms an isotropic metanetwork on top of SpiNNaker without requiring any cooperation from system software, and remains transparent to the SpiNNaker network; and (b) SpiNNterceptor is the proposed <b>peripheral</b> I/O <b>subsystem</b> developed as a layer on top of SpiNNlink that provides over 18 Gbps of minimally disruptive communication between SpiNNaker applications and externally connected equipment...|$|R
