In November 2007 the EIB signed two additional financing agreements with SONES, {{in support of}} Senegal’s National Drinking Water and Sewerage Programme for the Millennium (PEPAM). A European Development Fund (EDF) subsidy of CFAF 5.7 billion (EUR 8.6 million) and an EIB loan of CFAF 9.8 billion (EUR 15 million) complete the financing of SONES’s total investment programme of CFAF 38 billion (EUR 58 million). Under the project, more than 60 urban centres, including Dakar, will benefit from schemes to rehabilitate, upgrade and extend the drinking water supply network, reaching more than 500,000 people over four years. The planned works comprise the creation of 25 new boreholes, construction of a water treatment <b>plant,</b> <b>extension</b> of the supply network by more than 500 km and installation of 50,000 subsidized connections and 360 standpipes. The four finance providers involved have undertaken to harmonise their procedures, implementing the commitments made under the Paris Declaration on the harmonisation of development aid.|$|E

40|$|A first ratoon crop was {{subjected}} to two 55 -day periods of water stress using a rainshelter. Irrigation was withheld when the crop was 146 days old (December 1984), and again at 237 days. Daylight <b>plant</b> <b>extension</b> rate (PER) dropped below potential 12 and 20 days after imposing stress {{for the first and}} second time respectively. A decrease in PER was apparent when leaf water potential. (tpQ) was- 0, 2 MPa and extension ceased when tpQ fell below- 0, 4 to- 0, 7 MPa. Leaf resistance increased gradually when PER was reduced but it remained comparatively low for about 45 days of stress and then rose rapidly during the final 10 days of stress in each period. Canopy temperature was used to derive a stress index that was correlated with tpQ. The stress index may be used to identify drought-resistant varieties and plants in need of irrigation...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} verify the results from a preliminary study ofthe responses to Fusilade Super when applied to drought stressed cane. Irrigation was suspended at different times before harvesting to induce stress ranging from nil to severe. Stress was monitored through leaf water potential readings, measurements of <b>plant</b> <b>extension</b> rates and soil moisture levels which were estimated by a profit and loss account. Fusilade Super {{was applied to the}} cane 98 days before harvesting and whole stalk samples were taken twice after spraying to monitor the effectson sucrose content and stalk mass. One undisturbed row in each plot was harvested to determine plot yields 98 days after the ripener was applied. Cane tops which were left in plots after harvesting were analysed to determine the effect oftopping on the responses to treatments. The results confirmed that the greatest benefit from applying Fusilade Super was from well irrigated, unstressed cane and that responses were substantially lower in stressed cane. The effects of topping on the responses to treatments are discussed. No residual effects from Fusilade Super were detected in the succeeding crop at the age of 12 months, regardless ofwhether or not the cane had been stressed at the time of spraying...|$|E
40|$|In {{terrestrial}} ecosystems, fungi are {{the major}} agents of decomposition processes and nutrient cycling and of plant nutrient uptake. Hence, they have a vital impact on ecosystem processes and the terrestrial carbon cycle. Changes in productivity and phenology of fungal fruit bodies can give clues to changes in fungal activity, but understanding these changes {{in relation to a}} changing climate is a pending challenge among ecologists. Here we report on phenological changes in fungal fruiting in Europe over the past four decades. Analyses of 746, 297 dated and geo-referenced mushroom records of 486 autumnal fruiting species from Austria, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom revealed a widening of the annual fruiting season in all countries during the period 1970 – 2007. The mean annual day of fruiting has become later in all countries. However, the interspecific variation in phenological responses was high. Most species moved toward a later ending of their annual fruiting period, a trend that was particularly strong in the United Kingdom, which may reflect regional variation in climate change and its effects. Fruiting of both saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi now continues later in the year, but mycorrhizal fungi generally have a more compressed season than saprotrophs. This difference is probably due to the fruiting of mycorrhizal fungi partly depending on cues from the host <b>plant.</b> <b>Extension</b> of the European fungal fruiting season parallels an extended vegetation season in Europe. Changes in fruiting phenology imply changes in mycelia activity, with implications for ecosystem function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{physiological}} basis for variation in sucrose content among sugarcane clones despite substantial research at the molecular and biochemical levels. We used irrigation and continuous monitoring of photosynthesis and <b>plant</b> <b>extension</b> rate to modify dry matter partitioning in four clones differing widely in sucrose content. Three pot experiments were conducted on two low sucrose content clones, KQ 97 - 2599 and KQ 97 - 2835, and two high sucrose content clones,Q 117 andKQ 97 - 5080, in a temperature-controlled glasshouse. As expected, sucrose content on a dry mass basis of whole stalks was greater in high (55 % maximum) than in low sucrose clones (40 % maximum), but sucrose content in the two clones selected for low sucrose reached 55 % in some internodes. Differences between clones in whole-plant net photosynthesis and aerial biomass accumulation were small. However, biomass was distributed over fewer stalks in the high sucrose clones (4 – 7 stalks per pot) than in the low sucrose clones (9 – 11 stalks per pot). The high sucrose clones also allocated a considerably greater proportion of drymatter to the stalk (70 %maximum) than the low sucrose clones (60 %maximum). It is suggested that the relatively large amount of new leaf tissue produced by the high tillering, low sucrose clones placed an additional demand for structural photo-assimilate in these clones and delayed the accumulation of sucrose in the stalk. The results indicated that there is little direct genetic control on themaximumamount of sucrose that can accumulate in stalk tissue and that genetic contrasts in sucrose content reside more in the morphology of the plant and responses t...|$|E

At {{some of these}} plants, there were parallel but different treatment trains due to <b>plant</b> <b>extensions</b> being made at different times. A total of 25 full or partial treatment trains could therefore be monitored. A total of 115 plant visits were made {{over a period of}} fifteen months, with samples taken throughout the plant, covering the complete treatment train from raw to final water. Amongst other parameters, the turbidity of each sample was determined on site immediately upon sampling. This paper will summarise and interpret the resulting data set of approximately 1300 turbidity values. The paper will firstly characterise the raw and final waters respectively. In other words, how does typical raw water vary, and how good is the typical final water produced? The second part will summarise the typical performance of each of the treatment processes. In other words, what reduction in turbidity is typically achieved during settling, dissolved air flotation and filtration? The paper will make a practical contribution in providing a benchmark to all operators of treatment plants by: · being able to immediately "position" themselves within a typical range of raw water values. · judging their final water quality against what is generally achieved, and · evaluating and troubleshooting their individual process units against what is generally achieved...|$|R

In addition, <b>plant</b> life <b>extension</b> will require supplemental data that cannot be provided by existing surveillance programs. Testing of subsize specimens manufactured from broken halves of previously tested surveillance Charpy specimens offers an attractive means of extending existing surveillance programs. Using subsize Charpy V-notch-type specimens requires {{the establishment of a}} specimen geometry that is adequate to obtain a ductile-to-brittle transition curve similar to that obtained from full-size specimens, and the development of correlations for transition temperature and upper-shelf energy (USE) level between subsize and full-size specimens.
