5|$|<b>Pair</b> <b>formation</b> in the {{black-necked grebe}} usually starts during pauses in the {{migration}} to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E
5|$|This is a monogamous {{territorial}} species, and {{in areas}} where it is fully migratory, the male re-establishes its breeding territory and starts singing {{as soon as he}} returns. In the milder areas where some birds stay year round, the resident male remains in his breeding territory, singing intermittently, but the female may establish a separate individual wintering range until <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> begins in the early spring.|$|E
25|$|The Banggai {{cardinalfish}} {{are sexually}} monomorphic. The pairs form {{up to two}} weeks prior to spawning. The female courts the male from <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> until spawning.

Therefore, pairing tends to occur among individuals of similar sizes, so the male is able to care for all the eggs that female produces.|$|E

25|$|The Banggai {{cardinalfish}} is a paternal mouthbrooder. The female {{plays an}} active role in courtship and <b>pair</b> <b>formation,</b> which occurs a few hours to a few days before spawning. Mating pairs establish spawning territories several meters away from the main group and vigorously defend them. The eggs are about 2.5 millimeters in diameter. The young remain in the male's mouth cavity for an undetermined period after hatching. Unlike many other species of marine fish, the Banggai cardinalfish lacks a planktonic stage in its life history. The species has a short life span, reaching around four years in optimal conditions in captivity, and perhaps 1 to 2 years in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of nest building is {{preceded by a}} courtship ritual. This <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> consists of {{the male and female}} swimming parallel to each other, the male and female facing each other and contacting their barbels, the male stimulating the flanks of the female, the swimming to the surface by the male and female and production of the first bubbles at the nest site, and adding further bubbles to the nest under construction. The male produces most of the foam. First, the male and female come to the surface and swim belly-up in small circles. The film of the air-water interface is swallowed and pumped out through the gills, where it gains mucus. Movement of the pelvic fins stirs the water and mucus, captures air bubbles, and breaks these air bubbles into a foam. The female may add some bubbles to the nest under construction. Pelvic fin movement differs between sexes; males move their pelvic fins in a side-to-side fashion, while females open and close their pelvic fins. The male often dives to the bottom to retrieve plant debris; filamentous nest materials are preferred, which are knitted together in the nest by the male. The male creates an upward water current with its tail fin that lift plant materials up. Then, the male uses its developed pectoral fin spines to cary the plant materials to the nest. The male uses its mouth and pectoral fins to incorporate the plant material into the foam mass of the nest. Females neither have developed pectoral fin spines nor do they help in transporting plant debris. The end result is a dome-shaped nest made up of loosely interwoven plant material on top of tightly interwoven plant material, held up to the surface with a layer of foam; the eggs will be laid on top of this foam from below.|$|E

500|$|At Payne's study {{locality}} {{the breeding}} {{season of the}} chestnut sparrow lagged behind that of its host. The sparrows began courting when the weavers started constructing their elaborate nests. Once the breeding season began, [...] "the first impression was of the sparrows nesting and the grey-capped social weavers unobtrusively skulking nearby". Males displayed around the new weaver nests, crouching, raising and quivering their wings in a shallow V, and giving a high, twittering trill. The males were chased by the social-weavers, but returned persistently, until joined by females. When a female came near a displaying male, the male would increase his rate of wing quivering, spread and depress his tail, and bow down his head, until his body formed an arc. This exaggerated display may be an adaptation related to <b>pair</b> <b>formation</b> {{in the absence of}} male nest-building, and it may also serve to focus attention in breeding colonies and keep the birds in a colony together, as colonies are in clumps of trees surrounded by similar habitat.|$|E

[...] The nest is a shallow bowl lined with dead grass and down feathers. [...] Egg-laying typically occurs from April to August. [...] Average clutch size on Laysan Island is approximately four eggs. [...] The newly established population on Midway lays larger clutches, presumably because of better availability of food.

40|$|We study <b>pairing</b> <b>formation</b> and the {{appearance}} of induced spin-triplet p-wave superfluidity in dilute three-dimensional imbalanced Fermi gases {{in the presence of a}} uniform non-Abelian gauge field. This gauge field generates a synthetic Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction which has remarkable consequences in the induced p-wave pairing gaps. Without the synthetic gauge field, the p-wave pairing occurs in one of the components due to the induced (second-order) interaction via an exchange of density fluctuations in the other component. We show that this p-wave superfluid gap induced by density fluctuations is greatly enhanced due to the Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

2500|$|The {{breeding}} {{biology of}} some of the austral snipes has been studied in some detail.

[...] Before breeding the male snipe also perform nocturnal aerial [...] "hakawai" [...] displays with calls followed by a non-vocal roar created by diving birds driving fast moving air across the rectrices of the tail. This display is thought to be the origin of the Māori legends about the Hakawai, a term which has been extended to refer to the aerial displays.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{breeding}} {{season of the}} skylark (Alauda arvensis), particular common sequences of syllables (phrases) are produced by all males established in the same location (neighbours), whereas males of different locations (strangers) share only few syllables.

40|$|Publisher東京論文Affiliative social {{interactions}} {{play a crucial}} role in the formation and maintenance of social bonding in the form of a cooperative relationship among group members in a wide range of social animals. Behavioural functions of affiliative interactions have been extensively investigated in mammals including primates and carnivores, but little is known about such behavioural functions in birds. Because many bird species form and maintain male‒female pair bonding as a cooperative social unit, they are good animal models to study the evolution of cooperative behaviour. In this study, we investigated the involvement of affiliative interactions in the formation and maintenance of pair bonds in a life-long monogamous bird, budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). To verify the involvement of these interactions, we compared the frequency of affiliative interactions between pair bonded and non-pair bonded male‒female dyads over 3 months after introducing a novel flock. To characterize the potential frequency change in affiliative interactions, a similar comparison was conducted for aggressive interactions. We observed that affiliative interactions drastically increased together with <b>pair</b> bond <b>formation</b> 2 weeks after introducing the flock and decreased thereafter. However, a certain high frequency level of affiliative interactions was maintained even after <b>pair</b> bond <b>formation.</b> In contrast, aggressive interactions were observed to transiently increase along with <b>pair</b> bond <b>formation</b> but gradually disappeared thereafter. No such change was found in non-pair bonded male‒female dyads in both affiliative and aggressive interactions.

40|$|Male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) form a pair {{bond with}} a female partner after mating, and this {{behavior}} is regulated by the neuropeptide vasopressin (AVP).
