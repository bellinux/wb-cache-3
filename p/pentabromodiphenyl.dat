40|$|Decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) {{is used as}} a flame {{retardant}} in a variety of products, including thermoset resin plastics, textiles, and adhesives. While decaBDE itself is not known to be highly toxic, it is capable of debrominating into other polybromominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners such as <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether (pentaBDE) or octabromodiphenyl ether (octaBDE) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010, Environment Canada, 2010; Minnesota Pollution Control Agency [MPCA], 2008).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} shown that polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) behave as weak estrogens in animal and cell culture bioassays. In vivo metabolites of PBDEs are suspected to cause these effects. OBJECTIVES: To identify candidate metabolites, mouse plasma samples were collected after continuous oral and subcutaneous exposure to DE- 71, a widely used commercial <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether product, for 34 days. METHODS: Samples were extracted, separated into neutral and phenolic fractions, and analyzed by gas chromatographic mass spectrometry. RESULTS: In the plasma samples of orally treated animals, 2, 2 ´, 4, 4 ´, 5, 5 ´-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 153) represented 52 % of total measurable PBDEs, whereas it represented only 4. 3 % in the DE- 71 mixture. This suggested that BDE- 153 was more persistent than other congeners in mice. Several metabolites were detected and quantitated: 2, 4 -dibromophenol, 2, 4, 5 -tribromophenol, and six hydroxylated PBDEs. The presence of the two phenols suggested cleavage of the ether bond of 2, 2 ´, 4, 4 ´-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 47) and 2, 2 ´, 4, 4 ´, 5 -pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 99), respectively.

40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{have been}} widely used as flame retardants in a number of applications. Three commercial PBDE mixtures have been produced and used in the United States and elsewhere: commercial <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether (c-pentaBDE), commercial octabromodiphenyl ether (c-octaBDE), and commercial decabromodiphenyl ether (c-decaBDE). Although manufacture and import of c-pentaBDE and c-octaBDE were phased out in 2004, PBDE congeners associated with those mixtures continue to be found in humans and the environment. Some reports indicate that levels are continuing to increase. Imported articles treated with c-pentaBDE and c-octaBDE could be a source of human and environmental exposure to these PBDE congeners. c-DecaBDE is still manufactured and used in the United States. Data suggest that debromination, physical or metabolic removal of bromine atoms, may convert decaBDE to more toxic PBDE congeners, contributing further to the potential risk from exposure to these congeners. EPA is concerned that some of the component congeners are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic and intends to initiate a number of actions to limit the exposure and release of PBDE congeners and/or articles to which they have been added. These actions are to: (1) Initiat...|$|E

Fires involving ignition of residential upholstered furniture constitute {{a leading cause of}} fire deaths and serious injuries associated with consumer products. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission staff, the average annual fire losses for the years 1995 - 1999 were 460 deaths, 1, 110 injuries and $ 130 million in property damage (CPSC, 2004). Flame retardants delay ignition and have proven to save lives.

30|$|PBDEs are {{extensively}} used {{in various}} types of electronic equipment, furniture, plastics, textiles, etc. due to their excellent flame retardant performance (Leonel et al. 2014). Since PBDEs can be easily incorporated into different materials and products without making any covalent bonds, they could transport and migrate to different environment through volatilization and effusion etc. (Kim et al. 2007). Therefore, PBDEs have become widespread environmental pollutants and are ubiquitous in the environment (Birgul et al. 2012). Due to their persistency, long-range environmental transport potential and bioaccumulation ability, four PBDE congeners (i.e. tetrabromodiphenyl ether, <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether, hexabromodiphenyl ether and heptabromodiphenyl ether) have been listed as new persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in 2009 (Stockholm Convention 2009). Previous studies demonstrated that PBDEs have {{a wide range of}} toxicities, including cytotoxicity (An et al. 2011), developmental neurotoxicity (Costa et al. 2014), genotoxicity (Ji et al. 2011), disruption of thyroid functions (Xu et al. 2014), reproductive toxicity (Muirhead et al. 2006) and carcinogenicity (Zhao et al. 2015). Penta-BDEs are reported to be the most toxic compounds among the PBDEs congeners. Deca-BDEs received the least concern among PBDEs congeners on account of its relatively lower toxicity (Gandhi et al. 2011). However, the higher-brominated PBDEs congeners (hepta-BDEs to deca-BDEs) could be degraded/transformed to lower-brominated PBDEs congeners which seems to be more toxic in various environments such as soil, aquatic ecosystems (Huang et al. 2014). Therefore, PBDEs had posed a great threat to both human health and the global environment.|$|E
40|$|Cities of {{the future}} face {{challenges}} {{with respect to the}} quantity and quality of water resources, and multiple managerial options need to be considered in order to safeguard urban surface water quality. In a recently completed project on ‘Source control options for reducing emissions of Priority Pollutants’ (ScorePP), seven emission control strategies (ECSs) were developed and tested within a semi-hypothetical case city (SHCC) to evaluate their potential to reduce the emission of selected European priority hazardous substances (PHSs) to surface waters. The ECSs included (1) business-asusual,(2) full implementation of relevant European (EU) directives, (3) ECS 2 in combination with voluntary options for household, municipalities and industry, (4) ECS 2 combined with industrial treatment and best available technologies (BAT), (5) ECS 2 in combination with stormwater and combined sewer overflow treatment, (6) ECS 2 in combination with advanced wastewater treatment, and (7) combinations of ECS 3 - 6. The SHCC approach was chosen to facilitate transparency, to allow compensating for data gaps and to decrease the level of uncertainty in the results. The selected PHSs: cadmium (Cd), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), nonylphenol (NP) and <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether (PBDE) differ in their uses and environmental fate and therefore accumulate in surface waters to differing extents in response to the application of alternative ECS. To achieve the required reduction in PHS levels in urban waters the full implementation of existing EU regulation is prioritised and feasible combinations of managerial and technological options (source control and treatment) can be highly relevant for mitigating releases...|$|E
40|$|Seven polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ether (PBDE) congeners were measured in the particulate fraction (< 2 mm) of household dust samples (n= 40), collected in four different countries (Australia, Germany, Great Britain, and United States). Dust samples from Germany contained the lowest concentrations of total PBDEs (median: 74 ng/g, range: 17 - 550 ng/g dust). Australian dust contained the second lowest concentration (median: 1200 ng/g, range: 500 - 13, 000 ng/g dust). The dust from the United States and Great Britain contained the highest measured amounts of total PBDEs (US median: 4200 ng/g dust, range: 520 - 29, 000 ng/g; Great Britain median: 10, 000 ng/g, range: 950 - 54, 000 ng/g). Daily intake of PBDEs has been estimated from published reference values on daily dust intake rates.

The applied OECD 407 protocol was enhanced for endocrine and immune parameters, and to enable benchmark dose analysis. A vehicle control group and 7 dose groups were included, which received 0. 27, 0. 82, 2. 47, 7. 4, 22. 2, 66. 7 or 200 mg pentaBDE/kg bw/d (mkd). The liver {{appeared to be a}} key target organ, showing a marked increase of weight and centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, probably due to the observed induction of P 450 enzymes, notably CYP 1 A and CYP 2 B. A marked decrease of circulating total thyroxine (TT 4) and an increase of plasma cholesterol were probably secondary to the liver effects. Furthermore, dose-dependently decreased weight of epididymis, seminal vesicles, and prostate, as well as sperm head deformities in males, and induction of CYP 17 activity in adrenals in females were observed, all possibly related to anti-androgenic activity. Finally, we observed a substantial increase of large unstained cells in the blood and a decrease of apolar retinoids in the liver. All these effects had benchmark doses at the lower confidence bound (BMDL) in the low- or mid-dose range, but particular sensitive, potentially adverse effects were TT 4 decrease (BMDLs 1. 1 in males and 1. 8 mkd in females), and decrease of hepatic apolar retinoids (BMDLs 0. 5 mkd in males and 2. 3 mkd in females).

40|$|AbstractMany {{xenobiotics}} {{have been}} identified as in vitro androgen receptor (AR) antagonists, but information about their ability to produce combined effects at low concentrations is missing. Such data can reveal whether joint effects at the receptor are induced at low levels and may support the prioritisation of in vivo evaluations and provide orientations for the grouping of anti-androgens in cumulative risk assessment. Combinations of 30 AR antagonists {{from a wide range of}} sources and exposure routes (pesticides, antioxidants, parabens, UV-filters, synthetic musks, bisphenol-A, benzo(a) pyrene, perfluorooctane sulfonate and <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether) were tested using a reporter gene assay (MDA-kb 2). Chemicals were combined at three mixture ratios, equivalent to single components' effect concentrations that inhibit the action of dihydrotesterone by 1 %, 10 % or 20 %. Concentration addition (CA) and independent action were used to calculate additivity expectations. We observed complete suppression of dihydrotestosterone effects when chemicals were combined at individual concentrations eliciting 1 %, 10 % or 20 % AR antagonistic effect. Due to the large number of mixture components, the combined AR antagonistic effects occurred at very low concentrations of individual mixture components. CA slightly underestimated the combined effects at all mixture ratios. In conclusion, large numbers of AR antagonists from a wide variety of sources and exposure routes have the ability of acting together at the receptor to produce joint effects at very low concentrations. Significant mixture effects are observed when chemicals are combined at concentrations that individually do not induce observable AR antagonistic effects. Cumulative risk assessment for AR antagonists should apply grouping criteria based on effects where data are available, rather than on criteria of chemical similarity...|$|E
40|$|Polyhalogenated organic {{pollutants}} are xenobiotics, which {{are believed to}} cause considerable environmental pollution and human health problems {{as a result of}} their persistence, toxicity, and transformation into hazardous metabolites. These chemicals are persistent and are biomagnificated in the ecosystem. Amphibians (frogs) are considered as reliable indicators of environmental health because they form an important link in the food chain between insects and vertebrates. Furthermore, they are inhabitants of both aquatic and terrestrial environments and occupy different positions in the food web at different stages of their life cycle. The different stages in the life cycle of frogs are tadpole, juvenile and adult stages. The tadpole is transformed to a juvenile frog by metamorphosis. Disruption of this life cycle by xenobiotics can have disastrous effects on the amphibian populations. Polyhalogenated organic compounds have been known to cause endocrine disruption, effects on gene expression and induction of cytochrome P 450 enzymes in frogs. The present study was conducted to compare the tissue disposition of a polybrominated compound, 2, 2 ', 4, 4 ', 5 - <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether (BDE 99) in tadpole and juvenile stages of Xenopus tropicalis (West African clawed frog).

40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} and epidemic of diabetes and metabolic syndrome Dear fellow diabetes investigators, you, myself and our Editor-in-Chief, Dr Hotta, {{have the same}} goal; {{to do something about}} the epidemic of diabetes in Asia. I will not show the numbers again, as you have seen enough; simply there are too many peo-ple around us with diabetes. Why there are so many? Professor Eung-Jin Kim, Honorary President of Korean Diabetes Association, told me that diabetes was a rare disease in early 1960 s. He saw only five cases of dia-betes the whole year in 1957 at Seoul National University Hos-pital, which had 450 beds back then. It is clear that the diabetes epidemic in Korea (and elsewhere) is due to a change of the environment. Huge changes have occurred over the last half century in South Korea. She has industrialized, westernized and became wealthier. I do not believe industrialization is bad for South Koreans, as they live much longer now. Was the diabetes epidemic an inevitable consequence of these changes associated with industrialization? If it was, it might have been avoided. Something bad was introduced during the industri-alization process; so-called persistent {{organic pollutants}} (POP). Recently, evidence supporting this conclusion has been forth-coming and is getting stronger. Persistent organic pollutants are defined as ‘chemical substances that persist in the environment, bio-accumulate through the food web, and pose a risk of causing adverse effects to human health and the environment’. The Stockholm Convention on POP, an organization formed by international treaty, identified 12 POP initially and then added nine POP later. Here is the list: pesticides (aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, toxaphene, chlordecone, alpha hexachlorocyclohexane, beta hexa-chlorocyclohexane, lindane and pentachlorobenzene), industrial chemicals (hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCB]; hexabromobiphenyl; hexabromodiphenyl ether and heptabro-modiphenyl ether; pentachlorobenzene; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride; tetrabromodi-phenyl ether and <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether) and by-products (hexachlorobenzene; polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans [PCDD ⁄PCDF], PCB, alpha hexa-chlorocyclohexane, beta hexachlorocyclohexane and pentachloro...|$|E
40|$|Background: Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFR) are {{detected}} in the environment and biota all over the world. They contribute to the human body burden of industrial chemicals and exposure is mainly via food. Indoor dust contributes substantially in some exposure situations, which involve small children. Regulatory restrictions and bans have been introduced as some BFRs can impact proper development, potentially via the endocrine system. Objectives: The study aim was to clarify the role of retinoid system disturbances in BFR toxicity. Specific aims were to identify retinoid forms, which are sensitive to BFR exposure, and to identify genes, which can explain observed changes in specific retinoid forms. An additional aim was to evaluate the relevance of using retinoid system endpoints for risk characterization of human BFR exposure. Methods: Technical decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA), or <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether (pentaBDE) mixtures, were given orally to male and female Wistar rats at 3 - 7 different dose-levels. The OECD 28 -day repeat dose toxicity study (TG 407) and/or the 1 -generation toxicity study (TG 415) protocols, enhanced to detect endocrine effects were used. Retinoid concentrations and gene expression profiles were determined by HPLC and RT-PCR, respectively. Benchmark doses were established for all endpoints except gene expressions of the decaBDE study. Mode of action and margin of exposure evaluations were performed for decaBDE and HBCD and partly for pentaBDE. Results and discussion: Reduction of hepatic all-trans RA levels was the most sensitive physiological endpoint after decaBDE exposure, and was connected to increased expressions of Cyp 1 b 1, Cyp 26 a 1, Crabp 1 and CYP 2 B. HBCD exposure resulted in reductions of hepatic 9 -cis- 4 -oxo- 13, 14 -dihydro-retinoic acid, retinyl palmitate, and all-trans RA levels, which were connected to increased expressions of Adh 1, Aox 1, Aldh 1, Cyp 26 a 1, Lrat, Ugt 1 a 1, Ugt 1 a 6, and Ugt 1 a 9. The retinoid system characterization of pentaBDE and TBBPA was explorative, and the obtained results confirm that a full characterization is needed; in particular so for pentaBDE. Several lines of evidence, including gender and compound differences in response, as well as previously published data, provide support for key roles of CYP 2 B and CYP 3 A in the observed modulations of the retinoid system suggesting that CAR and/or PXR mediated mechanisms are involved. MOE calculations suggest that the observed retinoid system changes are of relevance to human exposure scenarios. Conclusion: Retinoid forms analyzed in this thesis were sensitive to BFR-exposure and showed gender and compound specificities in response patterns. Most of the 25 selected target genes were needed to explain the observed changes of the analyzed retinoid forms. Additional gene data from the literature was required to provide {{a good fit for}} the mechanistic interpretation. Further research is needed to clarify the exact role of CAR, PXR, AhR and/or AhRR, in BFR-induced modulation of the retinoid system...|$|E
40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) are {{chemicals}} that {{are added to}} materials to inhibit or suppress ignition and are incorporated during the manufacture of e. g. electronic equipment, furniture, construction materials and textiles. BFRs have become an increasingly important group of organohalogen compounds, which include hexabromocyclododecane diastereomers (HBCDs), tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) and commercial mixtures of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PentaBDE, OctaBDE and DecaBDE) congeners. The use of BFRs has increased tremendously during the last decades mainly due to the high demand of petroleum-based polymeric materials which have to meet strict fire safety regulations to prevent possible accidents. There are five major classes of BFRs: tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and three commercial mixtures of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), or biphenyl oxides, which are known as <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether (PentaBDE), octabromodiphenyl ether (OctaBDE) and decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaBDE). However, OctaBDE and PentaBDE are not longer being produced or in use due to their ban in EU and voluntary withdrawal by the bromine industry in North America in 2004. The main purpose of this thesis is to assess the in vitro effects of brominated flame retardants and their metabolites on sex steroid hormone action. Sex steroid hormones, such as, estrogens or androgens are formed by steroidogenic enzymes in several endocrine glands. Two of the most relevant steroidogenic enzymes are the cytochrome P 450, CYP 17 and CYP 19 (also known as aromatase). Using the human adrenocortical carcinoma H 295 R cell line, the potential of BFRs (PBDEs, TBBPA and HBCD) {{and some of their}} metabolites (hydroxylated and methoxylated PBDEs) to alter aromatase activity was analyzed. Development and validation of an in vitro enzymatic technique to study the possible effects on CYP 17 activity by these compounds is included in the present thesis. In general, parent PBDEs did not significantly alter CYP 19 or CYP 17 activities, but pronounced inhibitory effects were found for their hydroxylated metabolites, although to some extend these effects were due to cytotoxicity. In order to differentiate between cytotoxic effects of these hydroxylated metabolites and actual catalytic inhibition of aromatase, a series of experiments with human placental microsomes were performed. All hydroxylated metabolites tested showed a significant inhibition of aromatase activity. Furthermore, the agonistic and antagonistic properties on the human androgen receptor (AR) by several BFRs and PBDE metabolites were studied in two different in vitro recombinant systems. No agonistic effects on the AR were detected by any of the tested compounds, although several of the BFRs and hydroxylated PBDEs exhibited anti-androgenic activity in both recombinant in vitro systems. Furthermore, two genomic techniques (microarray and qRT-PCR) were used to describe the changes in hepatic gene profiles in HBCD exposed rats. The results induced clear sex specific changes in the hepatic gene expression profiles, suggesting female rats to be more sensitive. The effects presented in this thesis are in good agreement with previous in vitro, as well as, in vivo studies and novel information about the mechanism of action of these BFRs and PBDE metabolites were elucidated...|$|E

Two substances &# 8211; decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaDBE) and Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBP-A; this will be the subject of a separate Background Document) &# 8211; account for about 50 % of world use of brominated flame retardants. Two other polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PolyBDE) &# 8211; octabromodiphenyl ether (OctaDBE) and <b>pentabromodiphenyl</b> ether (PentaDBE) &# 8211; are used commercially, but in much smaller quantities than DecaBDE. Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) is also used in large volumes. Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) have also been used, but production was stopped in September 2000. Some PolyBDE are toxic, especially those with smaller molecules. PentaDBE may disrupt the oestrogenic system. PBB have similar effects to polychlorinated biphenyls, and may also produce hypothyroidism. Some of these chemicals are bioaccumulated. Brominated flame retardants were given priority in the 1992 OSPAR Action Plan, and therefore included in 1998 in the List of Chemicals for Priority Action. The quantities of PolyBDE used in the EU in 1994 were estimated as: DecaBDE (8 210 tonnes) as a general-purpose flame retardant, especially in polymers, polypropylene fabric and other textiles (other than clothing fabrics); OctaBDE (2 550 tonnes) in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plastics (often used for casings of electrical and electronic equipment), nylon and other plastics and in adhesives and coatings; PentaBDE (125 tonnes) mainly in flexible polyurethane foam for furniture, as well as epoxy and phenolic resins, some polyesters and textiles. About 9 200 tonnes of HBCDD was used in the EU in 1999, 85 % of it in polystyrene. Since the products containing these chemicals are widely dispersed, their possible release from waste disposal routes may be of concern, together with their potential role in producing dioxins and furans during waste incineration. The degradation of DecaBDE to the more toxic and bioaccumulative lower levels of PolyBDE is also of concern. The overwhelming majority of samples of marine biota have not shown detectable quantities of DecaBDE; however, OctaBDE has been found in fish and molluscs (up to 325 &# 956;g/kg wet weight) and PentaBDE has been found in fish and marine mammals (up to 7 700 &# 956;g/kg in white-beaked dolphins). All these chemicals have been found in river or marine sediments. Action so far has been mainly through voluntary commitments by industry {{within the framework of the}} OECD. The risk assessment for PentaBDE under the EC existing substances regulation has concluded that risk reduction measures are needed. The PolyBDEs are proposed to be included as priority hazardous substances in the list of priority substances under the EC Water Framework Directive. The action recommended is: to support the inclusion of PBB in the draft EC Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment; to support early EC harmonised restrictions on PentaBDE; to await the completion of the EC risk assessment of OctaBDE, DecaBDE and HBCDD and seek appropriate risk-reduction strategies in the light of it; to support appropriate provision on PolyBDE in the draft EC Directives on Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment and on Restrictions on Certain Hazardous Substances in Electric and Electronic Equipment; to develop an OSPAR monitoring strategy for these chemicals; to review by OSPAR in 2003 of the need for further OSPAR measures to supplement the eventual EC measures; and to ask other relevant international forums to take account of the background document. A monitoring strategy for Certain Brominated Flame Retardants has been added to this background document...|$|E
