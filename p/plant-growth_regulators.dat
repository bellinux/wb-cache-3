The hydroxymethylation of substituted fluorenes is possible {{on a small scale}} in suitable solvents which do not stabilise the corresponding radical anions. This radical anion formation, when it occurs, seriously reduces the yield of hydroxymethylated product.

40|$|Pesticides are a {{group of}} {{chemicals}} used predominantly in agriculture and against vectors in vector-borne diseases such as malaria, filariasis, etc. There are several definitions of a pesticide; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (1) defines a pesticide as any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs or which may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids or other pests in or on their bodies. The term includes substances intended {{for use as a}} <b>plant-growth</b> <b>regulator,</b> defoliant, dessicant or fruit-thinning agent or agent for preventing the premature fall of fruit and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.

40|$|Turgor {{regulation}} at reduced water contents {{was closely}} associated with changes in the elastic quality of the cell walls of individual needles and shoots of naturally drought-resistant seedlings of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss.) and of seedlings of intermediate resistance that had been pretreated with paclobutrazol, a stress-protecting, synthetic <b>plant-growth</b> <b>regulator.</b> Paclobutrazol-treated seedlings showed marked increases in drought resistance, and pressure-volume analysis combined with Chardakov measurements confirmed observations that water stress was ameliorated during prolonged drought. Turgor was maintained in the paclobutrazol-treated and in the naturally resistant drought-stressed seedlings despite water contents near or below the turgor-loss volumes of well-watered controls. The maintenance of turgor in these seedlings was in large part {{a function of the}} dynamic process of cell wall adjustment, as reflected by marked reductions in both the saturated and turgor-loss volumes and by large increases in the elastic coefficients of the tissues. Shear and Young's moduli, calculated from pressure-volume curves and the radii and wall thicknesses of mesophyll cells, also confirmed observed changes in the elastic qualities of the cell walls. Elastic coefficients of well-watered, paclobutrazol-treated seedlings were consistently larger than those in well-watered controls and several times larger than the values in untreated plants, which succumbed rapidly to drought. In contrast, untreated seedlings that withstood prolonged drought without wilting displayed elastic coefficients similar to those in seedlings that had been treated with paclobutrazol but that had not been exposed to drought...|$|R
40|$|Actual {{nitrogen}} fixation of pea and field-bean plants, grown in {{soil in the}} open air, was determined as the acetylene reduction of nodulated roots. During the {{major part of the}} vegetative growth of these plants, actual {{nitrogen fixation}} was equal to the potential maximum nitrogenase activity of the bacteroids present in the nodules. This means that increase of the actual nitrogen fixation could be achieved only if the potential nitrogenase activity of the bacteroids would be enhanced or if more nodules would be present. During the generative growth phase, the potential nitrogenase activity of the bacteroids was not entirely utilized irrespective of the shoot mass of the host plant or the nitrogen-fixing capacity of the Rhizobium microsymbiont. The addition of nitrate to nodulated plants sharply reduced actual nitrogen fixation but did not affect potential nitrogen fixation within 10 days. The nitrate effect was temporarily eliminated by treatment of the root nodules with benzyladenine, a synthetic <b>plant-growth</b> <b>regulator</b> with a photosynthate-attracting action. It is concluded that incomplete utilization of the nitrogenase present in the bacteroids is caused by an inadequate carbohydrate supply of the nodules upon supply of the leguminous plant with nitrate. In root systems of pea plants growing in symbiosis with R. leguminosarum strains of poor nitrogen-fixing capacity, the N-limited growth led to an accumulation of carbohydrates. Upon the supply of such plants with nitrate, the carbohydrate level was decreased concomitantly to an increase in alternative (i. e. cyanide-resistant) respiration. Low rates of alternative respiration were found when nitrate was added to pea plants inoculated with highly effective strains, as the N-limitation of the plants was less severe. The carbohydrates respired in the nodules amounted to 6. 3 mg C/mg N fixed with a moderately effective strain but only 3. 1 mg C/mg N fixed with a highly effective strain. Some rhizobial strains possess a hydrogenase that is capable of recirculating part of the hydrogen evolved in air by nitrogenase simultaneously with nitrogen fixation. However, the energy gain by hydrogen oxidation was very low, viz. 0. 6 - 4. 3 % Of the costs of nitrogen fixation. As hydrogen oxidation did not delay nodule senescence or increase nitrogenase utilization, the presence of hydrogenase in rhizobial strains seems to be an unimportant factor in determining the nitrogen-fixing capacity of the symbiosis. Strains of R. leguminosarum with a low nitrogen-fixing capacity showed a distinctly different nodule formation pattern on primary and lateral roots of pea plants as compared with highly effective strains. The estimates of the yield of fixed nitrogen, derived from the acetylene-reduction method, of plants inoculated with rhizobia] strains of different nitrogen-fixing capacity, equally deteriorated during the growth period. When rates of hydrogen production in air were subtracted from the acetylene reduction rates, the estimates of nitrogen fixation were severely biased in favour of a hydrogenase-containing strain. Nitrogen fixation of pea plants infected with a highly effective strain of R. leguminosarum was decreased by the supply of combined nitrogen {{to a greater extent than}} that of plants with a moderately effective strain. In plants inoculated with a strain of poor nitrogen-fixing capacity, nitrogen fixation per plant was even stimulated by a low dose of combined nitrogen. This increase was probably due to an enhanced photosynthetic capacity which counteracted the adverse effect of combined nitrogen. Seed yields were increased by nitrate dressings, regardless of the rhizobia] strain. Seed yields of plants inoculated with moderately effective strains were slightly higher than those of highly effective strains at high levels of combined nitrogen, owing to higher nitrate uptake, higher nitrogen fixation and increased photosynthesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Eragrostis tef, a tall {{stature and}} highly nutritious cereal grown in East Africa, {{has a serious}} lodging problem that reduces its {{productivity}} considerably. Certain <b>plant-growth</b> <b>regulators</b> are known to restrict growth and consequently improve lodging resistance in cereals by affecting gibberellin biosynthesis. The effect on height of growth regulator chlormequat chloride (CCC) was determined for varieties Gea Lammie with a short phenotype and DZ- 01 - 196 with a tall phenotype. Chlormequat chloride decreased plant height by 27 % in Gea Lammie and by 46 % in DZ- 01 - 196. More detailed analysis of growth regulator application by including Paclobutrazol (PBZ) on the tall tef variety DZ- 01 - 196 revealed that both CCC and PBZ reduced culm length, but {{had no effect on}} internode diameter. Chlormequat chloride at 100 mM especially reduced the length of the lowermost internodes. Treatment with CCC on the other hand did not increase panicle-bearing tillers, but grain yield in CCC-treated plants was comparable to non-treated control.

Creation of tetraploid varieties of this species is important capitally from a breeding point of view, they use them mainly because of larger proportions of tetraploid cells and because of the larger number of chromosomes and greater variability in the further multiplication. In my bachelor thesis, I examined the possibility of induction of tetraploid varieties of the species Phlox paniculata with target to determine the best combination of <b>plant-growth</b> <b>regulators,</b> supporting regeneration and chemomutagens inducing tetraploids. As a plant material were chosen leafs segments size of ca 1 cm 2, their cultivation passed of on MS medium. Cultivation of experiments carried throughout in an incubator with controlled temperature and photoperiod. They were investigated the effects of auxin IAA (indole- 3 -acetic acid) and cytokinin BAP (6 -benzylaminopurine) and TDZ (thidiazuron) to regeneration of leaf segments. They were also investigated the effects of chemomutagens colchicine and oryzalin to creation of tetraploids. The best results of regeneration were obtained with the combination of MS medium with TDZ 3 mg. l- 1 and IAA 1 mg. l- 1, in this case control variant of this medium reached 100 % regeneration of leaf segments. As less suitable chemomutagen for this thesis showed colchicine, in this case was a 100 % mortality of leaf segments cultivar 'Starfire'. On the other side as more effective herbicide showed oryzalin at concentration 14 mg. l- 1 applied for 14 days, in this variant was the percentage of recovery 18, 6 %.

Three kinds of varieties in a reduced and optimal seed quantity were included in these experiments: line (Remmy), hybrid (H 906699) and variety PX 104. The optimal seed quantity was 50 seeds per square meter for a hybrid and PX 104 varieties and 60 seeds per square meter for a line variety. Reduced seed quantity was 33 seeds per square meter for the hybrid and PX 104 varieties and 40 seeds per square meter for the line variety. Three types of applications of the azole preparations were tested for each variety and seed quantity: the first control, the second - treatment in the autumn, the third option - treatments in the autumn and spring. All variants were realized in four repetitions. During the experiments it was observed the influence on the yield of seeds, weight of thousand seeds, percentage of oil, number of plants per square meter and content of the nitrogen compounds in the rapeseed meal. The highest increase of the yield (amounting to 0, 94 t/ha) was recorded in 2014 in the variant of a hybrid variety with a density of 33 plants per square meter with autumn and spring application of growth regulators (control 6, 82 t/ha, autumn + spring treatment by plant growth regulators - 7, 76 t/ha).
