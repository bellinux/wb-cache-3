40|$|<b>PMR</b> <b>polyimides,</b> in {{particular}} PMR- 15, {{are well known}} for their excellent high-temperature stability and performance, and solvent resistance. However, the processing of these materials is limited, for the most part, to prepreg-based methods, such as compression or autoclave processing. These methods involve substantial amounts of hand labor, and as a result, manufacturing costs for components made from <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimides</b> can be high. In cost-sensitive applications, these high manufacturing costs can make the use of PMR polyimide-based components cost prohibitive. Lower cost manufacturing methods, such as resin transfer molding (RTM) and resin film infusion, have been demonstrated to reduce manufacturing costs {{by as much as}} 50 percent over prepreg-based methods. However, these processes are only amenable to materials with melt viscosities below 30 poise. Most <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimides</b> have melt viscosities on the order of 100 poise or higher. Recent efforts at the NASA Glenn Research Center have focused on chemical modifications to <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimides</b> to reduce their melt viscosity {{to the point where they}} could be processed by these low-cost manufacturing methods without adversely affecting their high-temperature properties and performance. These efforts have led to a new family of <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimides</b> that have melt viscosities significantly lower than that of PMR- 15. Reductions in melt viscosity are brought about through the introduction of molecular twists in the polymer backbone. Carbon fiber (T 650 - 35) composites were prepared from one of these polyimides, designated PMR-Flex, by compression molding.

The nadic endcap which provides the <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimides</b> with their relative ease of fabrication, both by limiting the molecular weight of the prepolymer and by undergoing the final addition cure without volatiles, is also the weak link with regard to TOS. A polyimide formulated with PAS endcaps, called V-CAP, utilizes a two step reaction sequence {{similar to that of}} the <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimides</b> and can be easily autoclave molded into low void composite materials.

40|$|The {{development}} of a class of high-temperature-resistant resins known as <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimides</b> has been reported by Serafini et al. (1972). Serafini and Vannucci (1975) found that the lower formulated molecular weight (FMW) compositions exhibited increased resin flow, but with some sacrifice in elevated temperature thermo-oxidative stability. Vannucci (1977) reported that the resin flow characteristics of the PMR composition having an FMW of 1500 could be varied by controlling the degree of resin advancement or imidization. The current investigation is concerned with an alternative approach to obtain improved flow <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimides</b> without sacrificing the desirable thermo-oxidative characteristics.

40|$|By {{varying the}} {{stoichiometry}} of the reactants {{in the preparation}} of <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimide</b> resin, changes occur in molecular weight distribution which influence the rheological properties and thus the processability of the resin, as well as the mechanical properties of the composite. The influence of 1 - 10 percent molar excess MDA on the molecular weight distribution and rheological properties of an imidized PMR system were exposed. Molecular weight distribution is characterized by gel permeation chromatography of the imidized molding compound; shear viscosity is related to changes in average molecular weight.

The elevated temperature weight loss characteristics of neat resins and graphite fiber composites were determined. The room temperature and short-time 260 C (500 F) mechanical properties of the composites were also determined. The use of m-aminostyrene end-caps reduced the final cure temperature of PMR resins by about 55 C (100 F), but the composites prepared with these resins are limited to use temperatures of about 260 C (500 F) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} N-phenylnadimide (PN) {{modified}} <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimide</b> composites reinforced with graphite fibers was investigated.

40|$|Norbornenyl-end capped <b>PMR</b> <b>polyimide</b> resins {{are widely}} used as polymer matrix {{composite}} materials for aircraft engine applications, since they combine ease of processing with good oxidative stability up to 300 C.

The end cap undergoes cross-linking during higher temperature processing, producing the desired low density, high specific strength materials, for PMR- 15. The end cap facilitates processing by controlling the molecular weight of the oligomer and allowing flow before it cross-links.

The objective was to see if any correlations exist between crosslinked network structure and dynamic mechanical properties. Variation in crosslinked network structures was achieved by altering the polyimide formulation through addition of various quantities of PN into the standard PMR- 15 composition.

Their activation energies were estimated to be 232, 60, and 14 kcal/mole, respectively. Increasing the amount of PN concentration caused lowering of the activation energies of the three relaxations, a decrease of the glass transition temperature, and increasing intensities of the three damping peaks, compared to the control PMR- 15 counterpart.

40|$|The use of {{polymer matrix}} {{composites}} (PMC's) in aircraft engines {{can lead to}} substantial weight savings over metals. This weight reduction correlates into better fuel economy, increased speed, and increased passenger load. Typically, high performance PMC's possess high thermal-oxidative stabilities (TOS) and high glass transition temperatures (Tg's) to withstand temperatures up to 316 C (600 F). One of the leading high temperature resins system available today is PMR- 15 (Polymerization of Monomeric Reactants, MW= 1500). This thermosetting polyimide utilizes addition curing through polymer endcaps which enables hand lay-up processing of carbon fiber composite parts with low void contents. However, {{the large amount of}} hand labor raises manufacturing costs and prohibits the use of PMR- 15 in many aerospace applications. Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) provides an economical alternative, but it requires a melt Viscosity of less than 10 (exp 3) centipoise (cP). This is much lower than the minimum melt viscosity of PMR- 15 (about 10 (exp 6) cP). To improve the processability of polyimides, the polymer backbone can be modified by incorporating flexible linkages, such as branching. bulky pendant groups, kinked structures, and twisted or non-coplanar moietes.
