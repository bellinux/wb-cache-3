5|$|Avialans diversified into a {{wide variety}} of forms during the Cretaceous Period. Many groups {{retained}} primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened {{with the advent of the}} <b>pygostyle</b> bone in the group Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{spends much}} of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the <b>pygostyle,</b> is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|E
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the <b>pygostyle</b> into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E
50|$|Unlike neognath birds, lithornithids {{had small}} <b>pygostyles,</b> and {{probably}} no tails. This {{may not have}} impaired their flight, however, since prehistoric birds like enantiornithes also generally had no tails.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of pygostyle: one, found in Confuciusornithidae, Enantiornithes, and some other Mesozoic birds, {{as well as in}} some oviraptorosaurs like Nomingia, is long and rod- or dagger blade-like. None of the known fossils with such <b>pygostyles</b> show traces of {{well-developed}} rectrices. The tail feathers in these animals consisted of downy fuzz and sometimes 2-4 central [...] "streamers" [...] such as those found in some specimens of Confuciusornis or in Paraprotopteryx.|$|R
50|$|Clarke et al. (2006) {{found that}} the most {{primitive}} known euornithians (the Yanornithiformes) had a mosaic of advanced and primitive features. These species retained primitive features like gastralia (belly ribs) and a pubic symphysis. They also showed the first fully modern <b>pygostyles,</b> and the type specimen of Yixianornis (IVPP 13631) preserves eight elongated rectrices (tail feathers) in a modern arrangement. No earlier pygostylians are known which preserve a fan of tail feathers of this sort; instead, they show only paired plumes or a tuft of short feathers.|$|R
5|$|All the {{vertebrae}} {{were highly}} pneumatised by invading air sacs, {{except for the}} atlas bone and the hindmost tail vertebrae, and were thereby connected to the respiratory system. The back vertebrae were as pneumatised as those of sauropod dinosaurs, and had an extensive system of depressions. These adaptations may be correlated with gigantism, as they reduce weight. The six vertebrae of the sacrum were also tall and pneumatised, and all but the first one were fused together at the top, their neural spines forming a neural plate. The ilium, the top hip bone, was also partially pneumatised close to the sacral vertebrae. Part of the pelvis was hypertrophied (enlarged) compared to other ornithomimosaurs, to support {{the weight of the}} animal with strong muscle attachments. The front hip bones tilted upwards in life. The tail of Deinocheirus ended in at least two fused vertebrae, which were described as similar to the <b>pygostyle</b> of oviraptorosaurian and therizinosauroid theropods. Ornithomimosaurs are known to have had pennaceous feathers, so this feature suggests that they might have had a fan of feathers at the tail end.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{had about}} {{nineteen}} presynsacral vertebrae (those {{of the neck}} and thorax, including three fused into a notarium), sixteen synsacral vertebrae (those of the lumbar region and sacrum), six free tail (caudal) vertebrae, and a <b>pygostyle.</b> The neck had well-developed areas for muscle and ligament attachment, probably to support the heavy skull and beak. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which articulated with the sternum through sternal ribs. The sternum was large, but small {{in relation to the}} body compared to those of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly. The sternum was highly pneumatic, broad, and relatively thick in cross-section. The bones of the pectoral girdle, shoulder blades, and wing bones were reduced in size compared to those of flighted pigeon, and were more gracile compared to those of the Rodrigues solitaire, but none of the individual skeletal components had disappeared. The carpometacarpus of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire, however. The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives, yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller, flighted pigeons. Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire, but the length proportions were little different.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertebral}} column {{is divided into}} four sections of vertebrae: cervical (11-25) (neck), trunk (dorsal or throacic) vertebrae usually fused in the notarium, synsacrum (fused vertebrae of the back, also fused to the hips (pelvis)), and <b>pygostyle</b> (tail).|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, and arrange them so they could be protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as ostriches and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had <b>pygostyles</b> on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals.|$|R
50|$|However, further discoveries {{showed that}} at least among {{primitive}} enantiornitheans, tail anatomy was more complex than previously thought. One enantiornithean, Shanweiniao, {{is known to have}} had at least four long tail feathers that overlapped each other. It is possible that these formed a lift-generating surface similar to the tail fans of euornitheans, though the fan-like tail of this species may have evolved independently of the modern bird lineage. Chiappeavis, a primitive pengornithid enantiornithean, had a fan of tail feathers similar to that of more primitive avialans like Sapeornis, suggesting that this might have been the ancestral condition, with pinfeathers being a feature evolved several times in early avialans for display purposes. Another enantiornithean, Feitianius, also had an elaborate fan of tail feathers. More importantly, soft tissue preserved around the tail was interpreted as the remains of a rectrical bulb, suggesting that this feature was not in fact restricted to species with modern-looking <b>pygostyles,</b> but might have evolved much earlier than previously thought and been present in many enantiornitheans.|$|R
5000|$|Longipterygids are {{characterized}} by an extremely long, toothed snout (making up over 60% of the total skull length), in which the teeth are restricted to {{the tips of the}} jaws. The snouts were straight but slightly concave at a point behind the nostrils, and the bones of the snout tip were solid. Their <b>pygostyles,</b> the series of fused vertebrae in the tail, were unusually large, and longer than the foot bones. The feet of longipterygids were also specialized relative to other enantiornithines. Where most enantiornithines had a long middle toe with a [...] "knuckle" [...] (trochlea) that extended beyond the outer two, the toes of longipterygids were even in length, and attached {{to the rest of the}} foot at the same level. This configuration is also seen in some groups of modern birds and is usually considered an adaptation for advanced perching ability. It is likely that longipteryigids lived primarily in trees. Because their long jaws tipped with large, often curved teeth are usually considered an adaptation for catching and eating fish, it is likely that they were similar in ecology to modern Kingfishers.|$|R
25|$|There {{are only}} a few muscles in the trunk and the tail, but they are very strong and are {{essential}} for the bird. The <b>pygostyle</b> controls all the movement in the tail and controls the feathers in the tail. This gives the tail a larger surface area which helps keep the bird in the air.|$|E
25|$|When living, Oviraptor {{was one of}} {{the most}} bird-like of the {{theropod}} dinosaurs. Its rib cage, in particular, displayed several features that are typical of birds, including a set of processes on each rib that would have kept the rib cage rigid. A relative of Oviraptor called Nomingia was found with a <b>pygostyle,</b> which is a set of fused vertebrae that would later help support the tail feathers of birds. Skin impressions from more primitive oviraptorosaurs, like Caudipteryx and Protarchaeopteryx, clearly show an extensive covering of feathers on the body, feathered wings and feathered tail fans. A tail fan is also indicated by the presence of a <b>pygostyle</b> in Nomingia, suggesting that this feature was widespread among oviraptorosaurs. Additionally, the nesting position of the brooding Citipati specimens implies the use of feathered wings to cover the eggs. Given the close anatomical similarity between these species and Oviraptor, it is highly likely that Oviraptor had feathers as well.|$|E
25|$|In birds, {{there is}} a {{variable}} number of cervical vertebrae, which often form the only truly flexible part of the spine. The thoracic vertebrae are partially fused, providing a solid brace for the wings during flight. The sacral vertebrae are fused with the lumbar vertebrae, and some thoracic and caudal vertebrae, to form a single structure, the synsacrum, which is thus of greater relative length than the sacrum of mammals. In living birds, the remaining caudal vertebrae are fused into a further bone, the <b>pygostyle,</b> for attachment of the tail feathers.|$|E
50|$|The nesting {{specimen}} {{was found}} in a stratigraphic area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft, sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise xeric (receiving a small amount of moisture). Many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions, indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods, similar to modern birds such as the ostrich, emu, and black-breasted buzzard, which brood for more than 40 days with a limited supply of sustenance. Nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in the nest for large parts of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, due to heat stress. The choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first finger may be explained by a change in function; it {{may be related to the}} presence of long wing feathers that were attached to the second finger. These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second finger began functioning as a feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first finger, which therefore became more robust. The third finger was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping. Various studies have suggested that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, and arrange them so they could be protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as ostriches and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had <b>pygostyles</b> on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals.|$|R
25|$|Ancient birds (Avialae) {{include both}} the Aves, which {{are defined as}} {{descendants}} of the common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx, and the more primitive Epidendrosaurus. Fossil birds stretch down from 154Ma through the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event at 65Ma to the present day. Scores of complete skeletons have now been found of the more recent Confuciusornis, which is an early representative of the Ornithurae. Ornithurans all have a bony <b>pygostyle,</b> to which tail feathers are anchored. For more details {{on the evolution of}} birds, see Evolution of birds.|$|E
25|$|Many {{specimens}} {{preserve a}} pair of long, narrow tail feathers, which grew longer than {{the entire length of}} the rest of the body. Unlike the feathers of most modern birds, these feathers were not differentiated into a central quill and barbs for most of their length. Rather, most of the feather formed a ribbon-like sheet, about six millimetres wide. Only at the last one quarter of the feather, towards the rounded tip, does the feather become differentiated into a central shaft with interlocking barbs. Many individuals of Confuciusornis lacked even these two tail feathers, possibly due to sexual dimorphism. The rest of the tail around the <b>pygostyle</b> was covered in short, non-aerodynamic feather tufts similar to the contour feathers of the body, rather than the familiar feather fan of modern bird tails.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{feathered}} oviraptorosaurs {{exists in}} several forms. Most directly, four species of primitive oviraptorosaurs (in the genera Caudipteryx, Protarchaeopteryx, and Similicaudipteryx) {{have been found}} with impressions of well developed feathers, most notably on the wings and tail, suggesting that they functioned at least partially for display. Secondly, at least four oviraptorosaur genera (Nomingia, Similicaudipteryx, Citipati, and Conchoraptor) preserved tails ending in something like a <b>pygostyle,</b> a bony structure {{at the end of}} the tail that, in modern birds, is used to support a fan of feathers. Similarly, quill knobs (anchor points for wing feathers on the ulna) have been reported in the oviraptorosaurian species Avimimus portentosus. Additionally, a number of oviraptorid specimens have famously been discovered in a nesting position similar to that of modern birds. The arms of these specimens are positioned in such a way that they could perfectly cover their eggs if they had small wings and a substantial covering of feathers.|$|E
25|$|Vertebrae {{are defined}} by the regions of the {{vertebral}} column that they occur in, as in humans. Cervical vertebrae are those in the neck area. With {{the exception of the}} two sloth genera (Choloepus and Bradypus) and the manatee genus, (Trichechus), all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae. In other vertebrates, the number of cervical vertebrae can range from a single vertebra in amphibians, to as many as 25 in swans or 76 in the extinct plesiosaur Elasmosaurus. The dorsal vertebrae range {{from the bottom of the}} neck to the top of the pelvis. Dorsal vertebrae attached to the ribs are called thoracic vertebrae, while those without ribs are called lumbar vertebrae. The sacral vertebrae are those in the pelvic region, and range from one in amphibians, to two in most birds and modern reptiles, or up to three to five in mammals. When multiple sacral vertebrae are fused into a single structure, it is called the sacrum. The synsacrum is a similar fused structure found in birds that is composed of the sacral, lumbar, and some of the thoracic and caudal vertebra, as well as the pelvic girdle. Caudal vertebrae compose the tail, and the final few can be fused into the <b>pygostyle</b> in birds, or into the coccygeal or tail bone in chimpanzees (and humans).|$|E
25|$|Elasmosaurus {{had four}} sacral {{vertebrae}} (the fused vertebrae {{that form the}} sacrum connected to the pelvis), a number typical of elasmosaurids. The transverse processes here were very short, and the rib facets increased in size from the first to the fourth sacral vertebra. A ridge ran {{along the top of}} these vertebrae, and the lower sides of the centra were rounded, and bore pairs of nutritive foramina, separated by low ridges. The first tail (or caudal) vertebra could be distinguished by the preceding sacral vertebra by having smaller rib facets, and by being positioned in {{the lower half of the}} centrum. These vertebrae were almost circular in shape, and the first two bore a narrow keel in the middle of the upper side. The rib facets of the tail vertebrae were located on the lower side of the centra, and their oval shape became larger and broader from the third vertebra and onwards, but became smaller from the 14th vertebra. Here, the pre zygapophyses also reached over the level of the centra for most of their length, while the post zygapophyses reached over this level by half their length. The lower part of the centra were rounded from the first to the third tail vertebrae, but concave from the fourth to the 18th. The usual number of trail vertebrae in elasmosaurids is 30. Since the last tail-vertebrae of elasmosaurids were fused into a structure similar to the <b>pygostyle</b> of birds, it is possible this supported a tail-fin, but the shape it would have had is unknown.|$|E
500|$|Also, tail bone. A {{skeletal}} formation, plowshare-shaped in birds, {{in which}} the final few caudal vertebrae are fused into a single ossification, supporting the tail feathers and musculature. In modern birds, the [...] attach to these. The <b>pygostyle</b> is {{the main component of}} the [...]|$|E
500|$|While the {{underlying}} {{structure of the}} tail {{is made up of}} bone (the <b>pygostyle)</b> and flesh, the term [...] "tail" [...] is most commonly used to refer to the feathers growing from the region and the shape they form—that is, [...] and [...] coverts and , commonly radiating in a fan configuration.|$|E
500|$|The later {{included}} the superficially gull-like Ichthyornis, the Hesperornithiformes, which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that {{they lost the}} ability to fly and became primarily aquatic. The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth {{in other parts of the}} jaws). Euornithes also {{included the}} first avialans to develop true <b>pygostyle</b> and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers, which may have replaced the [...] "hind wing" [...] as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.|$|E
500|$|Great spotted kiwis are {{the largest}} of the kiwis; the male is [...] tall, while the female is [...] tall. Bill length ranges from , while weight ranges between [...] for males and [...] for females. The body is pear-shaped, while the head and neck is small with a long slender ivory bill. The great spotted kiwi, along with the other kiwi species, is the only bird with {{nostrils}} {{at the end of its}} bill. The eyes are small and do not see well, as it relies mostly on its sense of smell. The legs are short, with three toes per foot. It has a plumage composed of soft, hair-like feathers, which have no [...] The plumage can range from charcoal grey to light brown. They have large vibrissae around the gape, and they have no tail, only a small <b>pygostyle.</b> The common name of this bird comes from black spots on its feathers. They use their powerful legs and claws for defence against predators like stoats or ferrets. Kiwis are flightless birds, and hence lack hollow bones, lack a keel to which wing muscles anchor, and have tiny wings. This species also has a low body temperature compared to other birds. [...] Average lifespan is 30 to 40 years.|$|E
2500|$|Their tails {{are very}} short {{compared}} to other maniraptorans. In Nomingia and Similicaudipteryx, the tail ends in four fused vertebrae which Osmólska, He, and others have {{referred to as a}} [...] "pygostyle", but which Witmer found was anatomically different and evolved separately from the <b>pygostyle</b> of birds (a bone which serves as the attachment point for a fan of tail feathers).|$|E
2500|$|The little spotted kiwi has {{a length}} of [...] {{and the weight of}} the male is [...] and the female weighs , making it the {{smallest}} species of kiwi.

They lack a tail, but have a small <b>pygostyle.</b> Their bill is ivory and long and their legs are pale.|$|E
2500|$|Confuciusornis shows {{a mix of}} basal and derived traits. It {{was more}} [...] "advanced" [...] or derived than Archaeopteryx in {{possessing}} a short tail with a <b>pygostyle</b> (a bone formed {{from a series of}} short, fused tail vertebrae) and a bony sternum, but more basal or [...] "primitive" [...] than modern birds in retaining large claws on the forelimbs, having a primitive skull with a closed eye-socket, and a relatively small breastbone. At first the number of basal characteristics was exaggerated: Hou assumed in 1995 that a long tail was present and mistook grooves in the jaw bones for small degenerated teeth.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 Ji's {{hypothesis}} {{was confirmed by}} a cladistic analysis by Chiappe, who defined a new group: the Pygostylia of which Confuciusornis is by definition the most basal member. Several traits of Confuciusornis illustrate {{its position in the}} tree of life; it has a more [...] "primitive" [...] skull than Archaeopteryx, but it is the first known bird to have lost the long tail of Archaeopteryx and develop fused tail vertebrae, a <b>pygostyle.</b> One controversial study concluded that Confuciusornis may be more closely related to Microraptor and other dromaeosaurids than to Archaeopteryx, but this study was criticized on methodological grounds.|$|E
2500|$|The bird {{skeleton}} {{is highly}} adapted for flight. It is extremely lightweight but {{strong enough to}} withstand the stresses of taking off, flying, and landing. One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into single ossifications, such as the <b>pygostyle.</b> Because of this, birds usually have {{a smaller number of}} bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true jaw, instead having a beak, which is far more lightweight. [...] The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an egg tooth, which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg, and that falls off once it has done its job.|$|E
2500|$|The uropygial gland, informally {{known as}} the preen gland or the oil gland, is a bilobate sebaceous gland possessed by the {{majority}} of birds. [...] It is located dorsally {{at the base of the}} tail (between the fourth caudal vertebrae and the <b>pygostyle)</b> and is greatly variable in both shape and size. [...] In some species, the opening of the gland has a small tuft of feathers to provide a [...] for the preen oil (see below). [...] It is a holocrine gland enclosed in a connective tissue capsule made up of glandular acini that deposit their oil secretion into a common collector tube ending in a variable number of pores (openings), most usually two. Each lobe has a central cavity that collects the secretion from tubules arranged radially around the cavity. The gland secretion is conveyed to the surface via ducts that, in most species, open at the top of a papilla (nipple-like structure).|$|E
2500|$|Their {{adaptation}} to a terrestrial life is extensive: {{like all the}} other ratites (ostrich, emu, rhea and cassowary), they have no keel on the sternum to anchor wing muscles. The vestigial wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have marrow, like mammals and the young of other birds. With no constraints on weight due to flight requirements, brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as much as [...] Like most other ratites, they have no uropygial gland (preen gland). Their bill is long, pliable and sensitive to touch, and their eyes have a reduced pecten. Their feathers lack barbules and , and they have large vibrissae around the gape. They have 13 flight feathers, no tail and a small <b>pygostyle.</b> Their gizzard is weak and their caecum is long and narrow.|$|E
5000|$|By contrast, the {{function}} of the <b>pygostyle</b> in the terrestrial Nomingia is not known. It is notable however that its older relative Caudipteryx had no <b>pygostyle</b> but a [...] "fan" [...] of symmetrical feathers which were probably used in social display. Perhaps such ornaments were widespread in Caenagnathoidea and their relatives, and ultimately the oviraptorosaurian <b>pygostyle</b> evolved to help support them. The related Similicaudipteryx, described in 2008, also had a rod-like <b>pygostyle,</b> associated with a fan of tail feathers.|$|E
50|$|The pygosylians {{fall into}} two {{distinct}} groups {{with regard to the}} <b>pygostyle.</b> The Ornithothoraces have a ploughshare-shaped <b>pygostyle,</b> while the more primitive members had longer, rod-shaped pygostyles.|$|E
50|$|The other <b>pygostyle</b> type is plowshare-shaped.

The other rectrices of Ornithurae are held in place and moved by structures called bulbi rectricium (rectricial bulbs), a complex feature of fat and muscles located {{on either side of the}} <b>pygostyle.</b> The oldest known species with such a <b>pygostyle</b> is Hongshanornis longicresta.|$|E
