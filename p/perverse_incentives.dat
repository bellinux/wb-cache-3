5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision. They argued that the <b>perverse</b> <b>incentives</b> regarding part-time hours, {{even if they did}} not change existing plans, were real and harmful; that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; that the costs of reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans; and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools. The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E

50|$|A {{study by}} Julie Berry Cullen et al. (2011) {{found that the}} law created a <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> for {{students}} to transfer to a high school with lower-achieving peers, in order to graduate in that school's top percent.|$|R
50|$|A {{welfare trap}} {{is an example}} of a <b>perverse</b> <b>{{incentive}}.</b> The welfare recipient, such as the one above, has an incentive to avoid raising productivity because the resulting income gain is not enough to compensate for the increased work effort.|$|R
5000|$|Bangkok police used tartan armbands as a {{badge of}} shame for minor infractions, but they were treated as {{collectibles}} by offending officers forced to wear them. Since 2007, they have been using armbands with the cute Hello Kitty cartoon character to avoid the <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive.</b>|$|R
25|$|Proponents of a {{consumption}} tax {{argue that the}} income tax system creates <b>perverse</b> <b>incentives</b> by encouraging taxpayers to spend rather than save: a taxpayer is only taxed once on income spent immediately, while any interest earned on saved income is itself taxed. To the extent that this is considered unjust, it may be remedied {{in a variety of}} ways, e.g. excluding investment income from taxable income, making investments deductible and therefore only taxing them when gains are realized, or replacing the income tax by other forms of tax, such as a sales tax.|$|E
25|$|Complexity of the {{tax code}} in {{developed}} economies offer perverse tax incentives. The more details of tax policy there are, the more opportunities for legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion. These not only result in lost revenue, but involve additional costs: for instance, payments made for tax advice are essentially deadweight costs because they add no wealth to the economy. <b>Perverse</b> <b>incentives</b> also occur because of non-taxable 'hidden' transactions; for instance, a sale from one company to another might be liable for sales tax, but if the same goods were shipped from one branch of a corporation to another, no tax would be payable.|$|E
25|$|In China, the {{majority}} of investment is carried out by entities that are at least partially state-owned. Most of these are {{under the control of}} local governments. Thus booms are primarily the result of <b>perverse</b> <b>incentives</b> at the local-government level. Unlike entrepreneurs in a free-enterprise economy, Chinese local officials are motivated primarily by political considerations. As their performance evaluations are based, to a large extent, on GDP growth within their jurisdictions, they have a strong incentive to promote large-scale investment projects. They also don’t face any real bankruptcy risk. When localities get into trouble, they are invariably bailed out by state-owned banks. Under these circumstances, overinvestment is inevitable.|$|E
40|$|When an {{insurance}} note {{is also a}} derivative a serious problem arises because a derivative must be fulfilled immediately. This feature of derivatives prevents claims processing procedures that screen out ineligible claims. This, in turn, creates a <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> for insured holders of notes to commit acts that result in payment. This problem first surfaced with CDS contracts, which {{are part of a}} class of lo{{an insurance}} I term a default insurance note. Without an address to this problem, within the average range of returns for a large venture capital portfolio, a venture-bank makes less money the better their investments do, in a continuous function. The highest rate of return is a total loss, 64 % more than a top portfolio. Here, a strategy for removing this <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> is defined, consisting of a clawback lien that returns part of the payment value as a lien on the firm that is the beneficiary of the insurance. This is presented as the final major component for implementing a default insurance note system so that venture-banking can operate to maximum benefit. Removing the <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> also minimizes disincentive for underwriters to deny DIN coverage to new venture capital firms, or to those firms that have historical earnings which are below average.

50|$|The CDM rewards {{emissions}} reductions, {{but does}} not penalize emission increases (Burniaux et al., 2009, p. 41). It therefore comes close to being an emissions reduction subsidy. This can create a <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> for firms to raise their emissions in the short-term, {{with the aim of}} getting credits for reducing emissions in the long-term.|$|R
50|$|Manager's compensation: In the past, certain {{executive}} management teams had their payout {{based on the}} total amount of profit of the company, instead of the profit per share, which would give the team a <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> to buy companies to increase the total profit while decreasing the profit per share (which hurts the owners of the company, the shareholders).|$|R
25|$|Paul Mullen, a {{forensic}} psychiatrist with extensive involvement following {{the string of}} massacres in Australia and New Zealand, attributes both the Port Arthur massacre {{and some of the}} earlier massacres to the copycat effect. In this theory the saturation media coverage provides both instruction and <b>perverse</b> <b>incentives</b> for dysfunctional individuals to imitate previous crimes. In Tasmania, a coroner found that a report on the current affairs programme A Current Affair, a few months earlier had guided one suicide, and may have helped create the expectation of a massacre. The coverage of the Dunblane massacre, in particular the attention on the perpetrator, is thought to have provided the trigger for Bryant to act.|$|E
25|$|Emissions trading gives polluters an {{incentive}} to reduce their emissions. However, there are possible <b>perverse</b> <b>incentives</b> that can exist in emissions trading. Allocating permits {{on the basis of}} past emissions ("grandfathering") can result in firms having {{an incentive}} to maintain emissions. For example, a firm that reduced its emissions would receive fewer permits in the future (IMF, 2008, pp.25–26). This problem can also be criticized on ethical grounds, since the polluter is being paid to reduce emissions (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.38). On the other hand, a permit system where permits are auctioned rather than given away, provides the government with revenues. These revenues might be used to improve the efficiency of overall climate policy, e.g., by funding reductions in distortionary taxes (Fisher et al.., 1996, p.417).|$|E
25|$|The Blackout Reduction Program (PRA) was {{established}} {{by the government in}} 2001. Initially designed to last two years, it has been subsequently extended {{in the absence of an}} alternative way to deal with the issues it addresses. This program has the objective of targeting subsidies to the poor on a geographical basis and implementing rolling blackouts in a more organized fashion. The poorest neighborhoods in the cities were to have a provision of about 20 hours of electricity per day at a price highly subsidized by the government and the utility. The PRA was initially considered a success. However, the country's macroeconomic crisis, the <b>perverse</b> <b>incentives</b> built into the PRA, and the deficiently targeted subsidy scheme have jeopardized the medium-term sustainability of the program. The absence of demand management, the lack of metering systems, sustained losses, a culture of non-payment and the absence of incentives for the distribution companies to fix the technical problems make it urgent to design a new subsidy and rationing system that is part of a more comprehensive approach to solve the problems of the power sector.|$|E

50|$|A poverty trap, {{acts as a}} {{self-reinforcing}} mechanism {{which causes}} poverty to persist. This vicious cycle of poverty remains a common experience of billions {{and the emergence of}} these traps can arise from both market failure and institution failure. On the opposite side to poverty traps are welfare traps, or an over-reliance upon welfare, that creates a <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> to work.|$|R
50|$|Further {{criticism}} of the Renewables Obligation in its original form included uncertainty over {{the price of a}} Renewables Obligation Certificate, which varies depending on demand and could reduce significantly if the amount of electricity produced from renewable energy sources approaches the obligation level. The presence of this risk acted as a <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> for the market not to meet the obligation.|$|R
500|$|Tradable {{emissions}} permits can {{be issued}} to firms within an ETS by two main ways: by free allocation of permits to existing emitters or by auction. Allocating permits based on past emissions is called [...] "grandfathering" [...] (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.38). Grandfathering permits, just like the other option of selling (auctioning) permits, sets a price on emissions. This gives permit-liable polluters an incentive to reduce their emissions. However, grandfathering permits can lead to <b>perverse</b> <b>incentives,</b> e.g., a firm that aimed to cut emissions drastically would then be given fewer permits in the future. Allocation may also slow down technological development towards less polluting technologies. The Garnaut Climate Change Review noted that 'grandfathered' permits are not 'free'. As the permits are scarce they have value and the benefit of that value is acquired in full by the emitter. The cost is imposed elsewhere in the economy, typically on consumers who cannot pass on the costs. However, profit-maximising firms receiving free permits will raise prices to customers because of the new, non-zero cost of emissions.|$|E
2500|$|In actual {{cases of}} {{international}} child abduction, {{this lack of}} a specific provision on child abduction in the 1961 treaty resulted in countries regularly interpreting the [...] "habitual residence" [...] concept of the Convention {{in a manner that}} allowed parents to take children to a foreign country and immediately acquire [...] "habitual residence." [...] This allowed judicial forum shopping and created <b>perverse</b> <b>incentives</b> for removing children from their homes to foreign jurisdictions in order to game the family law system and obtain a more favorable custodial outcome than could be gained in the jurisdiction of the child's home.|$|E

30|$|In some countries, pastoralists also {{consider}} {{that there is}} a <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> created by policies: as soon as pastoral lands are successful in harbouring biodiversity, these lands attract higher regulation which in turn negatively impacts pastoralists, when conservationist policies follow the paradigm of segregated land use. This is documented by Huntsinger et al. for the western USA and Heikkinen et al. for northern Finland.|$|R
50|$|More recently, in 2007, the Bangkok, Thailand police {{switched}} to punitive pink armbands adorned with the cute Hello Kitty cartoon character when the tartan armbands {{that had been}} intended to be worn as a badge of shame for minor infractions were instead treated as collectibles by offending officers forced to wear them, creating a <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive.</b> The revised scheme, however, was also soon abandoned.|$|R
50|$|This <b>perverse</b> <b>incentive</b> can be {{alleviated}} if {{permits are}} auctioned, i.e., sold to polluters, rather than {{giving them the}} permits for free. Auctioning is a method for distributing emission allowances in a cap-and-trade system whereby allowances are sold to the highest bidder. Revenues from auctioning go {{to the government and}} can be used for development of sustainable technology or to cut distortionary taxes, thus improving the efficiency of the overall cap policy.|$|R

However, if such rewards become a meaningful portion of “A” player's overall compensation, {{it can lead}} to <b>perverse</b> <b>incentives.</b> This is especially true when the rewards of being an “A” player are predictable and recurring (such as a normal part of the annual review process).

50|$|The {{welfare trap}} (or {{unemployment}} trap or poverty trap in British English) theory asserts that taxation and welfare systems can jointly contribute {{to keep people}} on social insurance because the withdrawal of means tested benefits that comes with entering low-paid work causes there to be no significant increase in total income.
