Including the new cycle resolves the problems mentioned above and leads to a consistent view of sunspot activity around the Dalton minimum. Moreover, it will restore the Gnevyshev-Ohl rule of cycle pairing throughout the 400 -year interval of sunspot observations...|$|E

We have advanced a two-photon excitation time-resolved imaging technique, which exploits high sensitivity of the OGB- 1 fluorescence lifetime to nanomolar Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]) and enables a high data acquisition rate in situ. The [Ca 2 +] readout is not affected by dye concentration, light scattering, photobleaching, micro-viscosity, temperature, or the main known concomitants of cellular activity. In quiescent tissue, standard whole-cell configuration has little effect on resting [Ca 2 +] inside neuronal dendrites or inside astroglia dye-filled via gap junctions.

The failure load of the MAC cages proved to be 2043 [*]N for the NiTi-l cage, and 1866 [*]N for the NiTi-s cage. The study of Wilke et al.

During sensory experience, lower neocortical areas are activated before higher ones, causing top-down synapses to experience a preponderance of post-synaptic <b>activity</b> <b>preceding</b> pre-synaptic <b>activity.</b> This timing pattern is the opposite of that experienced by bottom-up synapses, which suggests that different versions of spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) rules may be required at top-down synapses.

By manipulating artificial respiration, this <b>preceding</b> <b>activity</b> (pre-I XIIn activity) can be lengthened or isolated prematurely (decoupled XIIn activity) without developing into overt PHRn-associated inspiratory bursts. We hypothesized that these pre-I and decoupled XIIn activities, collectively termed ‘XIIn-w/o-PHRn activity’, reflect certain internal states of the respiratory centre at the period {{just prior to the}} transition from the expiratory phase to the inspiratory phase. In decerebrate, neuromuscularly blocked and artificially ventilated rats, the firing properties of medullary respiratory neurones were examined during the period of the XIIn-w/o-PHRn activity. The majority of the inspiratory neurones examined could be classified into two types: one was active (XIIn-type) and the other was inactive (PHRn-type) during the XIIn-w/o-PHRn period. On the other hand, augmenting expiratory (E-AUG) neurones of the Bötzinger complex (BOT) and the caudal ventral respiratory group (VRG) fired intensively during this period. Their firing stopped {{at the onset of the}} overt inspiratory bursts in the XIIn and PHRn, suggesting that BOT E-AUG neurones inhibit PHRn-type, but not XIIn-type, inspiratory neurones.

To address the effect of the masker laterality on forward suppression, magnetoencephalographic responses were investigated for eight subjects with normal hearing when the preceding maskers were presented ipsilaterally, contralaterally, and binaurally. We employed three masker intensity conditions: the ipsilateral-strong, left-right-balanced, and contralateral-strong conditions. Regarding the responses to the maskers without signal, the N 1 m amplitude evoked by the left and binaural maskers was significantly larger than that evoked by the right masker for the left-strong and left-right-balanced conditions. No significant difference was observed for the right-strong condition. Regarding the subsequent N 1 m amplitudes, they were attenuated by the presence of the left, binaural, and right maskers for all conditions. For the left- and right-strong conditions, the subsequent N 1 m amplitude {{in the presence of the}} left masker was smaller than those of the binaural and right maskers. No difference was observed between the binaural and right masker presentation. For left-right-balanced condition, the subsequent N 1 m amplitude decreased in the presence of the right, binaural, and left maskers in that order. If the <b>preceding</b> <b>activity</b> reflected the ability to suppress the subsequent activity, the forward suppression by the left masker would be superior to that by the right masker for the left-strong and left-right-balanced conditions.

Prior to PUVA treatment {{the percentage of}} E rosette forming cells {{was found to be}} markedly decreased in patients with active psoriasis, whereas it was normal in those with inactive skin lesions. In the initial phase of PUVA therapy (within the first 2 weeks) single PUVA exposure induced the decrease of the percentage of E rosettes in patients with psoriasis, but not in normal controls. This immediate suppression of E rosette formation, which persisted for more than 24 hr, was related to combined 8 MOP + UVA action, but not to 8 MOP or UVA irradiation alone. T lymphocytes reacquired an initial number of E rosette forming cells 48 hr after the last PUVA exposure. PUVA-induced inhibition of E rosette formation was most prominent in patients with inactive psoriasis in whom the initial percentage of E rosettes before treatment was normal. A lesser degree of decrease of E rosette forming cells after PUVA exposure was observed in patients with active psoriasis and reduced initial percentage of E rosettes. The suppression of E rosette formation caused by PUVA exposure was related to the presence of psoriatic lesions, since it could not be demonstrated after clearing of skin changes. Irrespective of <b>preceding</b> <b>activity</b> of the disease, E rosette formation showed a gradual improvement with PUVA therapy.

40|$|The input/output {{relationship}} in {{primary visual cortex}} neurons {{is influenced by the}} history of the <b>preceding</b> <b>activity.</b> To understand the impact that membrane potential trajectory and firing pattern has on the activation of slow conductances in cortical neurons we compared the afterpotentials that followed responses to different stimuli evoking similar numbers of action potentials. In particular, we compared afterpotentials following the intracellular injection of either square or sinusoidal currents lasting 20 seconds. Both stimuli were intracellular surrogates of different neuronal responses to prolonged visual stimulation. Recordings from 99 neurons in slices of visual cortex revealed that for stimuli evoking an equivalent number of spikes, sinusoidal current injection activated a slow afterhyperpolarization of significantly larger amplitude (8. 5 ± 3. 3 mV) and duration (33 ± 17 s) than that evoked by a square pulse (6. 4 ± 3. 7 mV, 28 ± 17 s; p< 0. 05). Spike frequency adaptation had a faster time course and was larger during plateau (square pulse) than during intermittent (sinusoidal) depolarizations. Similar results were obtained in 17 neurons intracellularly recorded from the visual cortex in vivo. The differences in the afterpotentials evoked with both protocols were abolished by removing calcium from the extracellular medium or by application of the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine, suggesting that the activation of a calcium-dependent current is at the base of this afterpotential difference. These findings suggest that not only the spikes, but the membrane potential values and firing patterns evoked by a particular stimulation protocol determine the responses to any subsequent incoming input in a time window that spans for tens of seconds to even minutes...|$|E
40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that the bottom-up signaling of a visual stimulus is subserved by interareal gamma-band synchronization, whereas top-down influences are mediated by alpha-beta band synchronization. These processes may implement top-down control of stimulus processing if top-down and bottom-up mediating rhythms are coupled via cross-frequency interaction. To test this possibility, we investigated Granger-causal influences among awake macaque primary visual area V 1, higher visual area V 4, and parietal control area 7 a during attentional task performance. Top-down 7 a-to-V 1 beta-band influences enhanced visually driven V 1 -to-V 4 gamma-band influences. This enhancement was spatially specific and largest when beta-band <b>activity</b> <b>preceded</b> gamma-band <b>activity</b> by approximately 0. 1 s, suggesting a causal effect of top-down processes on bottom-up processes. We propose that this cross-frequency interaction mechanistically subserves the attentional control of stimulus selection. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Contemporary research indicates that the alpha-beta frequency band underlies top-down control, whereas the gamma-band mediates bottom-up stimulus processing. This arrangement inspires an attractive hypothesis, which posits that top-down beta-band influences directly modulate bottom-up gamma band influences via cross-frequency interaction. We evaluate this hypothesis determining that beta-band top-down influences from parietal area 7 a to visual area V 1 are correlated with bottom-up gamma frequency influences from V 1 to area V 4, in a spatially specific manner, and that this correlation is maximal when top-down <b>activity</b> <b>precedes</b> bottom-up <b>activity.</b> These results show that for top-down processes such as spatial attention, elevated top-down beta-band influences directly enhance feedforward stimulus-induced gamma-band processing, leading to enhancement of the selected stimulus...|$|R

Methods and Results-We reviewed source documentation for 1067 patients who had SD in the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT) trial. We determined the circumstances of these events and assessed long-term mortality in patients who were resuscitated. Location of the SD event was available in 978 of 1067 patients, with 226 events occurring within the first 40 days. Although SD {{was more likely to}} occur at home (645 of 978, 66 %) than in hospital (204 of 978, 21 %), the proportion of in-hospital events was higher early on (99 of 226, 44 %). Home events {{were less likely to be}} witnessed regardless of time frame. <b>Preceding</b> <b>activity</b> was known for 42 % of patients with home arrest; of these, 52 % were determined to be asleep at time of event, and these deaths were more likely to be unwitnessed. A majority of patients for whom initial ECG rhythm was reported had ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (189 of 283, 67 %). Of the 155 patients successfully resuscitated, 24 % subsequently received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Nineteen percent of those who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator subsequently died compared with 49 % of patients who did not receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (hazard ratio, 0. 36; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 14 to 0. 93; P= 0. 04). Conclusions-A high proportion of SD events after high-risk myocardial infarction occurred at home, but in-hospital events were more common early on. Patients who were asleep were more likely to have unwitnessed arrests. Alternative strategies for the prevention of SD in patients who are not candidates for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator will need to take into account the circumstances of SD events.

The direct motor response (M-response) in the masseter muscle and the heteronymous H-reflex in the anterior temporalis muscle were successfully elicited by electrical {{stimulation of}} the masseteric nerve in 12 of 13 subjects. A new automatic system was used to control the on-line EMG activity and to trigger the stimulus. In a random order, two series of 20 stimuli were delivered at each of four clenching levels (0, 25, 50, and 75 % of maximal voluntary contraction). The analysis showed that both the masseteric M-response and the temporalis H-reflex were reproducible within and between series. The amplitude of the temporalis H-reflex increased significantly at higher clenching levels (ANOVA: P= 0. 003). Clenching at 50 % and 75 % of the maximal voluntary contraction caused significantly larger amplitudes of the H-reflex than clenching at 25 % of the maximal voluntary contraction; at rest, no H-reflex could be recorded. There was a significant correlation between the background EMG activity in the ipsilateral temporalis muscle and the amplitude of the H-reflex (Pearson: r= 0. 313, P= 0. 008).
