50|$|Smoking bans in <b>private</b> <b>vehicles</b> are enacted {{to protect}} {{passengers}} from secondhand smoke {{and to increase}} road traffic safety, e.g. by preventing the driver from being distracted by the act of smoking. <b>Private</b> <b>vehicles</b> are used by individuals for personal transportation; smoking bans in <b>private</b> <b>vehicles</b> are less common than bans extended to public transport or vehicles used during work, like trucks or police cars.|$|R

In 2008, global oil consumption fell by 0.8% overall, with significant declines in consumption in North America, Western Europe, and parts of Asia.|$|E

25|$|The {{plans to}} connect the new quarter with Victoria Park would make a cut-and-cover tunnel {{construction}} possible {{along the length of}} the planned Daldy Street boulevard in the Western Reclamation, providing for two public transport and two <b>private</b> <b>vehicle</b> lanes. Light rail was also mentioned as a long-term possibility. However, as it is unlikely that the harbour tunnel section would be built before 2020 earliest, coordination with the development of the new quarter would pose some difficulties.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} social {{role played by}} public transport {{is to ensure that}} all members of society are able to travel, not just those with a driving license and access to an automobile—which include groups such as the young, the old, the poor, those with medical conditions, and people banned from driving. Automobile dependency is a name given by policy makers to places where those without access to a <b>private</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{do not have access to}} independent mobility.|$|E
25|$|Cost over-runs and differing tastes {{made the}} centre {{politically}} controversial, the design often being {{described as a}} large hole in the ground, both literally and figuratively. Despite this and a NZ$204 million price tag, it has won numerous design awards and is internationally recognised for its innovative but heritage-sympathetic architecture. The main source of contention was the relatively great expense of this public transport development in the Auckland Region, where for many decades the focus had been on <b>private</b> <b>vehicle</b> ownership and travel.|$|E

25|$|Local {{transit and}} {{paratransit}} bus service in Richmond, Henrico, and Chesterfield counties {{is provided by}} the Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC). The GRTC, however, serves only small parts of the suburban counties. The far West End (Innsbrook and Short Pump) and almost all of Chesterfield County have no public transportation despite dense housing, retail, and office development. According to a 2008 GRTC operations analysis report, a majority of GRTC riders utilize their services because they do not have an available alternative such as a <b>private</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2008, with rapidly rising oil prices, {{industries}} such as {{the automotive}} industry, are experiencing a combination of pricing pressures from raw material costs and changes in consumer buying habits. The industry is also facing increasing external competition from the public transport sector, as consumers re-evaluate their <b>private</b> <b>vehicle</b> usage. Roughly half of the US's fifty-one light vehicle plants are projected to permanently close in the coming years, {{with the loss of}} another 200,000 jobs in the sector, on top of the 560,000 jobs lost this decade. Combined with robust growth in China, in 2009, this resulted in China becoming the largest car producer and market in the world.|$|E

A third attack occurred when an anti-tank missile was shot at a <b>private</b> <b>vehicle,</b> killing four Israeli civilians. Overall, during this multi-pronged cross-border attacks eight Israelis were killed— among them 6 civilians, one Yamam Special Unit police officer and one IDF soldier. forces reported that the incident ended when the eight attackers were killed, and also the Egyptian security forces reported that managed to kill two other terrorists.

25|$|Australian {{cities are}} some of the most car {{dependent}} cities in the world. Sydney in particular has a very high level of car dependency, especially by world city standards. It also has a low level of mass-transit services, with a historically low-density layout and significant urban sprawl, thus increasing the likelihood of car dependency. Strategies have been implemented to reduce <b>private</b> <b>vehicle</b> pollution by encouraging mass and public transit, initiating the development of high density housing and introducing a fleet of 10 new Nissan LEAF electric cars, the largest order of the pollution-free vehicle in Australia. Electric cars do not produce carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide, gases which contribute to climate change. Cycling trips have increased by 113% across Sydney's inner-city since March 2010, with about 2,000 bikes passing through top peak-hour intersections on an average weekday. Transport developments in the north-west and east of the city have been designed to encourage the use of Sydney's expanding public transportation system.|$|E
25|$|The next day, four U.S. {{military}} personnel were {{stopped at a}} roadblock around 9:00 PM outside PDF headquarters in the El Chorrillo neighborhood of Panama City. Marine Captain Richard E. Hadded, Navy Lieutenant Michael J. Wilson, Army Captain Barry L. Rainwater, and Marine First Lieutenant Robert Paz had left the Fort Clayton military base and {{were on their way}} to have dinner at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Panama City. The U.S. Department of Defense reported that the servicemen had been unarmed, in a <b>private</b> <b>vehicle</b> and that they attempted to flee only after their vehicle was surrounded by an angry crowd of civilians and PDF troops. The PDF asserted later that the Americans were armed and on a reconnaissance mission. The PDF opened fire and Lieutenant Paz was fatally wounded by a round that entered the rear of the vehicle and struck him in the back. Captain Hadded, the driver of the vehicle, was also wounded in the foot. Paz was rushed to Gorgas Army Hospital but died of his wounds. He received the Purple Heart posthumously. According to U.S. military sources, a U.S. Naval officer and his wife witnessed the incident and were detained by Panamanian Defense Force soldiers. While in police custody, they were assaulted by the PDF. The U.S. Naval officer spent two weeks in hospital recovering from the beating. PDF soldiers sexually threatened his wife. The next day, President Bush ordered the execution of the Panama invasion plan; the military set H-Hour as 0100 on 20 December.|$|E
500|$|At least 91% of {{the train}} {{ridership}} is to and from Union Station in downtown Toronto, while about 70% of all bus passengers travel {{to and from the}} City of Toronto.

The majority of GO Transit commuters have a <b>private</b> <b>vehicle</b> available to them for them for their commute, but choose to use GO Transit instead. About 80% of train commuters, and 60% of bus commuters choose GO Transit over driving. Over half of GO's ridership occurs on the Lakeshore West and East lines, which {{can be attributed to the}} almost continuous development along their corridors, as well as being the only two lines with two way, all day service. This is followed by the Milton line, carrying almost 14% of all ridership. Other corridors carry 4–11% of riders each.|$|E

After lengthy and inconclusive talks, the negotiations collapsed {{a few months}} later; according to Dinges, Noriega had no intentions of ever resigning. On December 15, 1989, the PRD-dominated legislature spoke of [...] "a state of war" [...] between the United States and Panama. It also declared Noriega [...] "chief executive officer" [...] of the government, formalizing a state of affairs that had existed for six years. The U.S. government stated that Noriega's forces were engaging in routine harassment of U.S. troops and civilians. Three incidents in particular occurred very near {{the time of the}} invasion, and were mentioned by Bush as a reason for the invasion. In a December 16 incident, four U.S. personnel were stopped at a roadblock outside PDF headquarters in the El Chorrillo neighborhood of Panama City. The United States Department of Defense said that the servicemen were traveling unarmed in a <b>private</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and that they attempted to flee the scene only after their vehicle was surrounded by a crowd of civilians and PDF troops.
