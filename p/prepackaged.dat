5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of <b>prepackaged</b> foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado {{outbreak}} law enforcement officers, including 30 national guard troops, were sent to Lone Grove to provide security. The American Red Cross opened shelters in Ardmore, Edmond, and Oklahoma City. About 100 volunteers from the Sorghum Mill Estates Neighborhood Association traveled to affected areas in Edmond to help with cleanup efforts. A local restaurant provided free meals to the volunteers as they assisted relief workers. The Salvation Army had two canteens in Oklahoma City, one in Lone Grove, and one in Perkins. About 2,000 meals, drinks, and snacks were provided by the Salvation Army to emergency responders. Feed the Children sent two truckloads of relief supplies to Carter County. They also sent three food trucks, containing a total of 619 meals, 900 drinks, and about 500 snacks, to Ardmore. On February22, the New Life Baptist Church sent drinks and <b>prepackaged</b> snacks, along with items needed for clean-up. Baptist Disaster Relief assisted in Lone Grove with food and emotional care. The Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA) gave away two tickets to anyone who made a donation of $25 or an equivalent amount of food to benefit victims of the tornado. A concert featuring Chris Cagle and other local musicians at Heritage Hall in Ardmore raised over $18,000 to benefit Carter County tornado victims. Another concert set up by the Salvation Army raised $2,300 more for victims.|$|E

25|$|Coffee is best {{stored in}} an {{airtight}} container made of ceramic, glass, or non-reactive metal. Higher quality <b>prepackaged</b> coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|E
25|$|Gilman {{proved to}} be a master at promotion; the {{business}} quickly expanded by advertising low prices. The firm was able to offer low prices by acting as both the wholesaler and retailer. Gilman also built a nationwide mail order business. By 1866, the firm was valued at more than $1 million. In 1869, the transcontinental railroad was completed; Gilman created a parallel company, the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, to promote the then-new concept of <b>prepackaged</b> tea under the Thea-Nector name. The tea company continued to use the Great American name for mail-order purposes. In 1871, A introduced another concept when it offered premiums, such as lithographs, china, and glassware with the purchase of coffee and/or tea at its stores.

Karen D'Souza of San Jose Mercury News called the production [...] "a thrashing collage of songs fused together with hypnotic movement and eye-popping visuals" [...] and thought the show [...] "as compelling as it is abstract [...] channels the grungy spirit of punk while also plucking at the heartstrings." [...] However, Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune compared the show unfavorably to the original album, writing: [...] " [...] once was a fine Gouda, has been <b>prepackaged</b> as Velveeta", and continued sarcastically, [...] "In other words, it should do big business on Broadway." [...] Charles Isherwood of The New York Times commented that the show contained [...] "characters who lack {{much in the way of}} emotional depth or specificity, and plotlines that are simple to the point of crudity" [...] but also felt that [...] "the show possesses a stimulating energy and a vision of wasted youth that holds us in its grip." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{issue of}} a {{religious}} nature arose in 2005 in the United Kingdom when Burger King introduced a new <b>prepackaged</b> ice cream product; the label of the product included a silhouette of the ice cream that when rotated on its side bore a resemblance to the Islamic inscription for God, Allah (الله). When a British Muslim named Rashad Akhtar, {{a resident of the}} community of High Wycombe, was presented with the ice cream cone in a Park Royal Burger King restaurant, he noticed the resemblance and became angered at what he felt was an offense to the Islamic faith. After being informed of the likeness, the local Islamic group Muslim Council of Britain pointed out the issue of the possible interpretation to Burger King and its relevance to Shariah, the Muslim version of canon law which governs the lives of members of the Islamic faith and carries the same weight as civil law in their belief structure. The company responded by voluntarily recalling the product and reissuing it with a new label. The Muslim Council praised the company for its [...] "sensitive and prompt action" [...] in resolving the matter; however, Akhtar was not satisfied with the company's withdrawal of the product.|$|E
500|$|One of the company's first {{forays into}} {{healthier}} products was in 1983 with introduction of its salad bar. The salad bar met with light to moderate success, but the company's franchise holders complained of high operating costs and a poor return on investment. Part of the product, a pita salad, was quickly {{dropped from the}} salad bar, as were {{plans to use the}} bar unit to boost breakfast sales. In 1987 the company augmented its salad bar with a test line of <b>prepackaged</b> salads, including chef and garden salads. The salad bar was eventually eliminated in favor of packaged salads. In 1990, BK introduced a new salad line accompanied by a licensing agreement with Paul Newman's Newman's Own, Inc., whose salad dressings accompanied the products. Burger King revamped its salad line again in 2004, with the introduction of its Fire Grilled Salad products. Burger King sought to differentiate this line of salads by packaging the warm meat toppings—a choice of grilled shrimp or broiled chicken—separately from the cold salad; this added the appearance of an additional layer of freshness. At one point in the United States, the salads are pre-made off-site. They are sold with two toppings and Ken's Foods Ken's Steakhouse brand salad dressing. Internationally, the salads vary in composition and style from market to market. In all markets, salads are one of the items targeted at female and health-conscious consumers.

In 1948, plain frozen fruits and {{vegetables}} were joined by what were then called 'dinner plates' with a main course, potato, and vegetable. In 1952 the first frozen dinners on oven-ready aluminum trays were introduced by Quaker States Foods under the One-Eye Eskimo label. Quaker States Foods was joined by other companies including Frigi-Dinner, which offered such fare as beef stew with corn and peas, veal goulash with peas and potatoes, and chicken chow mein with egg rolls and fried rice.

2500|$|Manga scholar Ryan Holmberg {{contends that}} more than being {{inspired}} by a Kazuo Shimada story, Black Blizzard is a direct unauthorized adaptation of Shimada's [...] "Black Rainbow". The story follows two repatriated war veterans—one who is a pianist framed for murder, {{and the other a}} gambler whose family left him—who are handcuffed together and escape after a train crash. While Tatsumi does refer to the story in his autobiographical A Drifting Life, it is not mentioned in his gekiga manifesto Gekiga College. Holmberg suspects that Tatsumi included the manga's sources later in his autobiography because Masaki Sato's autobiography mistakenly assumed that it was based on the film The Defiant Ones, which was released two years later in 1958. Holmberg also notes that A Drifting Life was largely based on the history The Tale of Gekiga by Tatsumi's older brother Shōichi Sakurai, which itself borrows from Tatsumi's earlier Gekiga College. Holmberg discounts the influence of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo because of how closely Black Blizzard mirrors [...] "Black Rainbow" [...] in its story. Holmberg says that the narrative of [...] "the manga's genesis, especially in its recent melodramatic versions, simply has to go"; [...] "the godfather of gekiga did not remake the world of manga , nor simply {{with the help of a}} couple of 'influences.' The evidence suggests very clearly that Tatsumi had at his side a copy of 'Black Rainbow,' which he was using more or less as a script". Lastly, he notes similarities between the circus singer Saeko Ozora and postwar singer Hibari Misora, concluding that gekiga did not have its roots in the [...] "everyday actualities of postwar Japan and especially its underclass", but rather [...] "mass entertainment and the world of fantasy from magazines and the movies", especially the <b>prepackaged</b> [...] "postwar experience".|$|E
