40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the conversions of biomass and biomass components to petrochemicals and total aliphatic gasoline like products. There are three major projects of the thesis. Since biomass is very complicated, {{to understand the}} thermal decomposition pathways of biomass, the pyrolytic behaviors of various biomass components including lignin and cellulose under different reaction were investigated in the first phase. Due to complexity and limited volatility, the thermal decomposition products from biomass bring insurmountable obstacles to the traditional analysis methods such as GC-MS, UV and FT-IR. Therefore, precise characterization of the whole portion of thermal decomposition products has significant impacts on providing insight into the pyrolysis pathways and evaluating the upgrading processes. Various NMR methods to characterize different functional groups presented in liquid and solid pyrolysis products by 1 H, 13 C, 31 P, 2 D-HSQC and solid state 13 C-NMR were introduced in the second phase. Nevertheless, the major drawback towards commercialization of <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>oils</b> are their challenging properties including poor volatility, high oxygen content, molecular weight, acidity and viscosity, corrosiveness and cold flow problems.

Due to their higher-energy density (approx. 15 – 30  MJ/kg) and chemical composition they are an attractive platform feedstock in the bioeconomy [1]. The main problems in use and handling of <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>oils</b> are their high viscosity, high acidity, lower heating value than fossil fuels and low phase stability [2 – 8]. These negative properties are mainly caused by the high oxygen content present in the organic components. For this reason an upgrading step like catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is often necessary. First studies on catalytic HDO were contributed by Elliott et al. in the eighties [7].

50|$|<b>Pyrolysis</b> <b>oil,</b> {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as biocrude or biooil, is a synthetic fuel under investigation as substitute for petroleum.

This high oxygen content results in non-volatility, corrosiveness, immiscibity with fossil fuels, thermal instability, and a tendency to polymerize when exposed to air.

50|$|Although the {{pyrolysis}} of WT {{has been}} widely developed throughout the world, there are legislative, economic, and marketing obstacles to widespread adoption. Oil derived from tire rubber pyrolysis contains high sulfur content, which gives it high potential as a pollutant and should be desulfurized. A number of prototype and full-scale pyrolysis plants specialized in carbon black production have successfully established across the world, including the United States, France, Germany and Japan. Because carbon black is used for pigment, rubber strengthening and UV protection, it is a relatively large and growing market. Pyrolysis plants specialized in fuel oil production is not an implausible concept. However, as profits of such ventures come from the added value between the production and distillation of oil, there is little profit without vertical integration in the oil industry. The inconsistency of the feedstock makes {{it very difficult to}} control the uniformity of the products and makes oil companies hesitant to purchase oil produced via pyrolysis. Finally, the cost of producing oil through conventional means is generally less expensive than this alternative. To date, there is no known commercially profitable standalone pyrolysis plant that specializes in oil production. However, with funding to upgrade <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>oil</b> to light fuel grade, this may be possible. Nevertheless, pyrolysis is a valuable method for disposing of waste tires.|$|E
