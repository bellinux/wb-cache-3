50|$|The {{basic idea}} behind a transit-time {{measurement}} of length {{is to send}} a signal {{from one end of}} the length to be measured to the other, and back again. The time for the round trip is the transit time Δt, and the length ℓ is then 2ℓ = Δt*"v",with v the speed of propagation of the signal, assuming that is the same in both directions. If light is used for the signal, its speed depends upon the medium in which it propagates; in SI units the speed is a defined value c0 in the reference medium of classical vacuum. Thus, when light is used in a transit-time approach, length measurements are not subject to knowledge of the source frequency (apart from possible frequency dependence of the correction to relate the medium to classical vacuum), but are subject to the error in measuring transit times, in particular, errors introduced by the response times of the <b>pulse</b> <b>emission</b> and detection instrumentation. An additional uncertainty is the refractive index correction relating the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the classical vacuum. A refractive index of the medium larger than one slows the light.|$|E

I {{hypothesized that the}} Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) achieves this by finely adjusting the shape of its mouth (beam-forming) in a behavior akin to supralaryngeal speech motor control by humans. This hypothesis arose from my discovery that Tadarida brasiliensis raise their noses and lips preceding each echolocation pulse and that they possess a hypertrophied set of specialized facial muscles possibly analogous to the levator labii aleque nasi. I investigated whether this muscle complex 1) is active during sonar performance, 2) displays anatomical and histological specializations consistent with the high-speed demands of echolocation, and 3) can effectively perform beam-forming through fine manipulations of the nose and mouth. Firstly, EMG recordings from awake echolocating bats confirmed that these muscles were activated in a temporally precise coordination with <b>pulse</b> <b>emissions.</b> Secondly, I described the anatomical organization of the muscle complex, its origin and insertions, and its innervation patterns. Histochemical analyses confirmed that these were fast-twitch muscles, as expected for muscles adapted for rapid contractions for extended periods. Lastly, I directly measured how changes in face shape affected the sonar beam-width. This muscle complex allows bats to lift the nose tip to create a small aperture, producing a wide-angle beam, or to lift both the nose and the upper lips simultaneously creating a wider aperture but narrower beam. I confirmed that for a typical pulse (downward FM sweep, 50 - 20 kHz), raising and pulling back the lips narrowed the projection beam relative to just raising the nose tip with lips held down.

Offshore discharges to the marine environment during drilling operations are <b>pulse</b> <b>emissions.</b> The relative marine aquatic ecotoxic impact of <b>pulse</b> <b>emissions</b> compared to continuous emission processes is investigated by transient dispersion modeling. Occupational health is an important decision objective for offshore operations. Crane-lifts are an important cause of accidents with human health damages on drilling rigs. A characterization factor for offshore crane-lifts is developed to include occupational health in life-cycle assessment. Long-term release of metals from solid wastes is important for the ecotoxicity of drilling wastes. A review is presented that considers the current and possible solutions to address long-term leaching processes in life-cycle assessment. An overall evaluation of offshore drilling fluid technology is performed. The study assesses the relative life-cycle performance of alternatives for density control in drilling fluids (ilmenite versus barite), offshore loading systems (crane-lifts versus a hydraulic system), base drilling fluids (water-base versus oil-base), and waste treatment of cuttings drilled with water-based drilling fluid (offshore discharge versus onshore treatment). A well located in the Barents Sea is used as reference. Results are interpreted using Monte Carlo simulation. Preferred alternatives from an overall evaluation are proposed. This thesis illustrates the challenges of life-cycle assessment.
