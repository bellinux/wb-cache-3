Special attention is devoted to unmasking the political umbrella of process in which - {{as it is known}} from other privatisation cases worldwide - there is not sufficient space for expert opinions and judgment. We confront various attitudes regarding to Bratislava Airport privatisation. We also explain Bratislava Airport privatisation in light of overall privatisation status of Slovakian airports. In quantitative way we compare Bratislava Airport performance with the main competitor Vienna Airport that is very often seen as the key problem of Bratislava Airport privatisation with regard to overlapping catchment areas of the airports. Comparison of economic performance, as well as airport charges of both airports is made in the paper. The paper does not try to identify the best <b>privatisation</b> <b>arrangement</b> for Bratislava Airport as it is primarily focused on documenting perplexity and intricacy of privatisation of a small airport that could be a big problem and fiscalized matter. In the paper also some considerations are made with regard to some airports competition issues. ...|$|E

Extant {{literature suggests that}} actions in decision spaces can be described under broad idealised forms of governance, however in looking at a sample of 18 different airports {{it is apparent that}} these classic models are insufficient to appreciate the contextual complexity of each case. Issues of institutional <b>arrangements,</b> <b>privatisation,</b> and management focus are reviewed against existing governance modes to produce a model for informing privatisation decisions, based on the contextual needs of the individual airport and region. Expanding governance modes to include emergent airport arrangements both contribute to the existing literature, and provides a framework to assist policy makers and those charged with the operation of airports to design effective governance models. In progressing this framework, contributions are made to government decision makers for the development of new, or review of existing strategies for privatisation, while the private sector can identify the intent and expectations of privatisation initiatives to make better informed decisions...|$|R
