5|$|After President Juan Perón's {{overthrow}} in 1955, Menem {{was briefly}} incarcerated. He later joined {{the successor to}} the Peronist Party, the Justicialist Party (Partido Justicialista) (PJ). He {{was elected president of}} its La Rioja Province chapter in 1973. In that capacity, he was included in the flight to Spain that brought Perón back to Argentina after his long exile.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt where she underwent a three-year refit that strengthened her armament. She was fitted with mine rails in 1914 and laid one minefield during World War I that damaged two German light cruisers. She was reconstructed beginning in late 1915 to further strengthen her armament, but <b>played</b> <b>no</b> part during the rest of the war as her crew became involved in revolutionary activities in 1917. She was taken over by the Bolsheviks in late 1917, but was put into reserve in 1918 and sold for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Between 1873 and 1882 Steinitz <b>played</b> <b>no</b> {{tournaments and}} only one match (a 7–0 win against Blackburne in 1876). His other games during this period were in {{simultaneous}} and blindfold exhibitions, which contributed {{an important part of}} a professional chess-player's income in those days (for example in 1887 Blackburne was paid 9 guineas for two simultaneous exhibitions and a blindfold exhibition hosted by the Teesside Chess Association; this was equivalent to about £4,800 at 2007 values).|$|E

The first squad was signed at a cost of £917 10s 0d, with the players choosing Johnny McMillan as their own captain. Millar, a defender signed from Middlesbrough, was chosen as vice-captain.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{war with}} the Western Xia, the Song also settled land {{disputes}} with them by referring to prior agreements, as with the Liao. However, soon after the Jin dynasty overthrew the Liao dynasty, the Jurchens sacked the Song capital in 1127 during the Jin–Song wars, causing the Song court to flee south of the Yangtze River.

5|$|Due to {{the delay}} of the 707 programme, the {{contribution}} of the 707B and 707A towards the basic design of the 698 was not considered significant, though it did highlight a need to increase the length of the nosewheel to give a ground incidence of 3.5 degrees, the optimum take-off attitude. The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they <b>played</b> <b>no</b> part in the 698's development.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume did {{not play}} in the next Test match—he was {{replaced}} by John Goddard {{who came into the}} team as part of a pre-arranged scheme to rotate the captaincy. He was chosen in a preliminary 24-man squad to tour India and Pakistan in 1948–49, but did not make the final selection of 16 players, and was overlooked for the 1950 tour of England. He continued to play irregularly for Trinidad in the following years, but <b>played</b> <b>no</b> further representative cricket until 1957.|$|E

During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E

5|$|He was {{in great}} {{form for the}} Belgian spring classics, but a fall and {{material}} malfunction kept him from playing {{a part in the}} final of both the E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem. Cancellara was one of the favourites to win the renewed Tour of Flanders but <b>played</b> <b>no</b> part in the final due to a crash in the feed zone. It was caused by a discarded water bottle. He suffered a four-part fracture of the right collarbone which ruined his spring campaign.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosaurus is {{commonly}} {{regarded as a}} herbivorous dinosaur. In 1974, Thulborn proposed that the tusks of the dinosaur <b>played</b> <b>no</b> important role in feeding; rather, {{that they would have}} been used in combat with conspecifics, for display, as a visual threat, or for active defence. Similar functions are seen in the enlarged tusks of modern muntjacs and chevrotains, but the curved tusks of warthogs (used for digging) are dissimilar.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, after {{a highly}} publicized feud between Finkelstein and an {{academic}} opponent, Alan Dershowitz, Finkelstein's tenure bid at DePaul was denied. Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–08 academic year, and on September 5, 2007, he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms. An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence <b>played</b> <b>no</b> role in the decision. In 2008, he was banned from entering Israel for 10 years.|$|E
