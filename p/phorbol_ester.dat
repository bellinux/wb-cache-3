40|$|<b>Phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> are the tetracyclic diterpenoids {{generally}} {{known for}} their tumor promoting activity. The <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> mimic the action of diacyl glycerol (DAG), activator of protein kinase C, which regulates different signal transduction pathways and other cellular metabolic activities. They occur naturally in many plants of the family Euphorbiacaeae and Thymelaeaceae. The biological activities of the <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> are highly structure specific. The <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters,</b> even at very low concentrations, show toxicological manifestations in animals fed diets containing them. This toxicity limits the use of many nutritive plants and agricultural by-products containing <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> {{to be used as}} animal feed. Therefore, various chemical and physical treatments have been evaluated to extract or inactivate <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> so that seed meals rich in proteins could be used as feed resources. However, not much progress has been reported so far. The detoxifying ability has also been reported in some molluscs and in liver homogenate of mice.

40|$|The studies {{described}} here tested {{the hypothesis that}} the changes in synaptic efficacy produced by <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> in hippocampal slices are equivalent to the long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation. In contrast to the extremely stable synaptic potentiation induced by electrical stimulation, the facilitatory effects of phorbol 12, 13 -diacetate and phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate were transient: washout of the drugs restored normal responses in approximately 1 - 2 and 2 - 4 hr for phorbol diacetate and phorbol dibutyrate, respectively. It is noteworthy that the more liposoluble of the <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> required longer washout periods. Robust LTP still occurred in response to high-frequency stimulation after washout of <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> and to a lesser degree during their application.

Application of the kinase inhibitor H 7 (100 μm) reduced low-frequency evoked EPSC amplitude (by 15 %) and simultaneously increased PPF (or reduced PPD), with no significant change in other aspects of transmission. H 7 did not affect the amplitude or frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs. <b>Phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> increased EPSC amplitude (by 50 %) with a concomitant decrease in PPF (or increase in PPD), and reduced the final EPSC amplitude during repetitive stimuli. The effect of <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> was due exclusively to protein kinase C (PKC) activation, as the specific PKC inhibitor bis-indolylmaleimide (Bis) completely blocked the potentiating effect of <b>phorbol</b> <b>esters</b> on EPSC amplitude.
