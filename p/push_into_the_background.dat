Emerging technologies like railroads, telephones, and electrical power required considerable government investment and involvement, along with “new” innovations such as public monopolies or eminent domain.

40|$|This article {{examines}} comparative homicide {{rates in the}} United States and Western Europe {{in an era of}} increasingly globalized neoliberal economics. The main finding of this preliminary analysis is that historical and spatial correlations between distinct forms of political economy and homicide rates are consistent enough to suggest that social democratic regimes are more successful at fostering the socio-cultural conditions necessary for reduced homicide rates. Thus Western Europe and all continents and nations should approach the importation of American neo-liberal economic policies with extreme caution. The article concludes by suggesting that the indirect but crucial causal connection between political economy and homicide rates, prematurely <b>pushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> of criminological thought during the ‘cultural turn’, should be returned to the foreground...|$|R
