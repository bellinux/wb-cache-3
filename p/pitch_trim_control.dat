50|$|The crew {{tried to}} land at Okęcie from the south (due to strong wind) and turned the {{aircraft}} 180 degrees to runway 33 but a rapidly spreading in-flight fire, which spread to {{the exterior of the}} aircraft (which was trailing a huge flame and dense black smoke), caused a total failure of surviving flight <b>controls,</b> including the <b>pitch</b> <b>trim.</b> The landing gear also was not functioning. The emergency fuel dumping pumps were also malfunctioning; sometimes they stopped functioning at all, only to resume dumping fuel minutes later. At the moment of the crash, approximately 32 tons of fuel were still in the tanks. A very straight turn to the left was started at 11.09 at 4900 ft with an airspeed of 480 km/h. At the moment the aircraft passed the village of Józefosław, approximately 10 km from the airport, several burnt-out elements of its fuselage fell out, starting local fires on the ground. Supposedly, at this moment the fire destroyed the <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> <b>controls.</b> When the aircraft passed the town of Piaseczno, it went into sinusoid-shaped flight for the final seconds and nose-dived with a slight 11 degrees left bank and 12 degree pitch downwards, crashing into the ground at 475 km/h and exploding into pieces in the forest 5700 m from the Warsaw airport runway. (As the nose dive started very shortly before the crash, one hypothesis states that in the final moments, fire from the cargo hold spread into the rear part of passenger cabin, causing mass panic; the passengers moved towards the nose of the aircraft, away from the fire, destabilizing the aircraft and causing the dive. Another is that rapidly spreading fire deformed the fuselage in its rear, which — combined with strong forces acting on the empennage - altered the aircraft's angle of attack and contributed to the rapid dive.) The wreckage was scattered over a rectangular area, approximately 370 by 50 m.|$|R
40|$|Independently {{deflectable}} {{control surfaces}} {{are located on}} {{the trailing edge of}} the wing of a blended wing-body aircraft. The reconfiguration control system of the present invention controls the deflection of each control surface to optimize the spanwise lift distribution across the wing for each of several flight conditions, e. g., cruise, pitch maneuver, and high lift at low speed. The control surfaces are deflected and reconfigured to their predetermined optimal positions when the aircraft is in each of the aforementioned flight conditions. With respect to cruise, the reconfiguration control system will maximize the lift to drag ratio and keep the aircraft trimmed at a stable angle of attack. In a pitch maneuver, the control surfaces are deflected to pitch the aircraft and increase lift. Moreover, this increased lift has its spanwise center of pressure shifted inboard relative to its location for cruise. This inboard shifting reduces the increased bending moment about the aircraft's x-axis occasioned by the increased pitch force acting normal to the wing. To optimize high lift at low speed, during take-off and landing for example, the control surfaces are reconfigured to increase the local maximum coefficient of lift at stall-critical spanwise locations while providing <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> with <b>control</b> surfaces that are not stall critical...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper puts {{forward a}} design idea for blended wing body (BWB). The idea is {{described}} as that cruise point, maximum lift to drag point and <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> point {{are in the same}} flight attitude. According to this design idea, design objectives and constraints are defined. By applying low and high fidelity aerodynamic analysis tools, BWB aerodynamic design methodology is established by the combination of optimization design and inverse design methods. High lift to drag ratio, <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> and acceptable buffet margin can be achieved by this design methodology. For 300 -passenger BWB configuration based on static stability design, as compared with initial configuration, the maximum lift to drag ratio and <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> are achieved at cruise condition, zero lift pitching moment is positive, and buffet characteristics is well. Fuel burn of 300 -passenger BWB configuration is also significantly reduced as compared with conventional civil transports. Because aerodynamic design is carried out under the constraints of BWB design requirements, the design configuration fulfills the demands for interior layout and provides a solid foundation for continuous work...|$|R

For an unexplained reason, the aircraft <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> {{was moved to}} the full nose-down position, which exceeded the ability of the autopilot to control, and the aircraft pitched over abruptly.

40|$|Stability {{and control}} of rotors at high advance ratio are considered. Stability of teetering, articulated, and {{gimbaled}} hub types is considered with a simple flapping blade analysis.

Stability predictions obtained using the analytical rigid flapping blade analysis and a rigid blade CAMRAD II model compare favorably. For the flapping blade analysis, the teetering rotor is found to be the most stable hub type, showing no instabilities up to an advance ratio of 3 and a Lock number of 18.

The control power of the tail surface relative to that of the other controls is examined by comparing control derivatives extracted from the simulation program over the flight speed envelope. The horizontal tail's contribution as an active control is evaluated using an explicit model following control synthesis involving a linear model of the helicopter in steady, level flight at a flight speed of eighty knots. The horizontal tail is found to provide additional control flexibility in the longitudinal axis.
