40|$|Abstract There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that focussing police resources at ‘crime hot spots’—small geographic places at which crime is concentrated—is an effective crime control strategy. Generally, hot spots policing strategies focus on formal social controls such as police crackdowns and often ignore {{the social context of}} the places that are targeted. Our article describes an approach that recognizes the importance of <b>police</b> community <b>collaboration</b> to improve public safety and reinforce informal social controls, and the emerging empirical evidence that social disorganization and collective efficacy may influence crime patterns at the micro-geographic level. We argue for the relevance of informal social controls in place-based policing and describe an innovative Smart <b>Policing</b> <b>collaboration</b> between the Brooklyn Park (Minnesota) Police Department and the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University that implements a department-wide programme in which police lead interventions to increase collective efficacy in hot spots...|$|R

This {{seems to be}} in danger with the arrival of Morey, a CNI agent, who uses the police station as cover to investigate a suspected <b>police</b> <b>collaboration</b> with a jihadist network. Morey's situation is complicated with the arrival of Fátima, an idealistic Muslim teacher who is looking for her vanished teenage brother, Abdu, while opposing the criminal activities of her other brother, Faruq, one of the biggest drug dealers in the neighborhood. However, Faruq is not the villain of the story. Then everything gets complicated when they become aware of a terrorist gang called Akrab, which blows up young people to terrorize the city. Meanwhile, Morey offers Fátima a chance to go to the peninsula with him, but, as they are about to depart, her brother Abdu returns to Ceuta on a tour bus with a bomb on board. When the police get to know this, they try to talk to him. The bomb does not go off, but Abdu is shot in the head by Morey. This leads into a second season with an impossible love affair between Morey and Fátima.|$|E

In the first season finale, Beckett angrily refuses Castle's help in reopening her mother's murder investigation—having concluded after conducting her own investigations after joining the force that focusing on her mother's death would destroy her life—stating that if Castle interferes, it will end his <b>police</b> <b>collaboration</b> with her. Despite this, Castle confronts Beckett {{at the end of the}} episode with evidence that her mother was targeted for murder. At the beginning of season 2 she forgives Castle for his indiscretion about her mother's murder after he delivers a heartfelt apology. During this period it was also revealed that Beckett speaks Russian after a semester in Kiev between her junior and senior year, as well as spending a brief period modeling when she was seventeen on the grounds that it seemed easier than waitressing (although the only shown photograph of her modeling period is her in tennis gear).

The police checked the identity documents of 40,000 people, and the operation sent 2,000 Marseillese people first to Fréjus, then to the camp of Royallieu near Compiègne, in the Northern Zone of France, and then to Drancy internment camp, last stop before the extermination camps. The operation also encompassed the expulsion of an entire neighborhood (30,000 persons) before its destruction. Located in the Old Port, the 1st arrondissement was considered by the Germans to be a [...] "terrorist nest" [...] because of its small, windy and curvy streets For this occasion, SS leader Carl Oberg, in charge of the German Police in France, made the trip from Paris, and transmitted to Bousquet orders directly received from Himmler.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{processes and}} practicalities of <b>police</b> <b>collaboration</b> with partner agencies and {{consultation with the}} public. It considers police and partner agency perspectives in detail, highlighting practical and strategic outcomes of collaboration and consultation. The police service in England and Wales along {{with most of the}} public sector, has been driven by central government to collaborate with other agencies and consult with the public for the last three decades, especially since 1979 under the influence of New Public Management. The formal obligation to do so has increased considerably since the late 1990 s. Since the Labour administration came into power in 1997, collaboration and consultation have become core ingredients of many government led policy initiatives. This in turn has increased the emphasis placed upon these two processes within the police. The most recent and significant initiatives affecting collaboration and consultation will be considered within this thesis as will the police and partner representatives' outlook on these initiatives. Funded as anESRC (CASE) studentship, the research was conducted in close collaboration and with support from a Constabulary in the North-West of England. This created an important opportunity to undertake in-depth observational qualitative research on the police. This qualitative case study approach utilises police and collaborative agency respondents' narratives, gained in the main through 35 semi-structured interviews. The use of rich narrative data illuminates the intricate practices, process and perceptions of the police and their partners. It is argued that while there is much written on 'outcomes' and 'what works', there exists a lack of qualitative analytical academic research detailing the perceptions of those involved to highlight the hidden processes, practicalities, and consequences surrounding the introduction of government policies stipulating collaboration and consultation.
