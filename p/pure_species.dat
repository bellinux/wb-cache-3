These plants, consequently, were absolutely barren. From this fact,--from the one plant which was transplanted into my garden yielding when artificially fertilised with pollen from V. lychnitis and thapsus some seeds, though extremely few in number,--from the circumstance of the two <b>pure</b> <b>species</b> growing in the same field,--and from the intermediate character of the sterile plants, {{there can be no doubt}} that they were hybrids.

60|$|The {{sterility}} {{of species}} when first crossed, {{and that of}} hybrids, may possibly depend {{to a certain extent}} on distinct causes. With <b>pure</b> <b>species</b> the reproductive organs are in a perfect condition, whilst with hybrids they are often plainly deteriorated. A hybrid embryo which partakes of the constitution of its father and mother is exposed to unnatural conditions, {{as long as it is}} nourished within the womb, or egg, or seed of the mother-form; and as we know that unnatural conditions often induce sterility, the reproductive organs of the hybrid might at this early age be permanently affected. But this cause has no bearing on the infertility of first unions. The diminished number of the offspring from first unions may often result, as is certainly sometimes the case, from the premature death of most of the hybrid embryos. But we shall immediately see that a law of an unknown nature apparently exists, which leads to the offspring from unions, which are infertile, being themselves more or less infertile; and this at present is all that can be said.|$|E
6000|$|In {{accordance}} with the facts above given, which prove {{that in many cases}} a close relation exists between variability and the sterility following from changed conditions, we may conclude that the exciting cause often acts at the earliest possible period, namely, on the sexual elements, before impregnation has taken place. That an affection of the female sexual element may induce variability we may likewise infer as probable from the occurrence of bud- variations; for a bud seems to be the analogue of an ovule. But the male element is apparently much oftener affected by changed conditions, at least in a visible manner, than the female element or ovule and we know from Gartner's and Wichura's statements that a hybrid used as the father and crossed with a <b>pure</b> <b>species</b> gives a greater degree of variability to the offspring, than does the same hybrid when used as the mother. Lastly, it is certain that variability may be transmitted through either sexual element, whether or not originally excited in them, for Kolreuter and Gartner (22/53. 'Dritte Fortsetzung' etc. s. 123; 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 249.) found that when two species were crossed, if either one was variable, the offspring were rendered variable.] ...|$|E
60|$|It is certain, {{on the one}} hand, {{that the}} {{sterility}} of various species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly, and, on the other hand, that the fertility of <b>pure</b> <b>species</b> is so easily affected by various circumstances, that {{for all practical purposes}} it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins. I think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived, namely Kolreuter and Gartner, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to some of the very same forms. It is also most instructive to compare--but I have not space here to enter on details--the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same observer from experiments made during different years. It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords any certain distinction between species and varieties. The evidence from this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences.|$|E
