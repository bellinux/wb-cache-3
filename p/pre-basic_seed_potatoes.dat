At this moment all basic seed {{material is}} imported into Republic of Serbia and Republic of Srpska, {{despite the fact that}} the method of in vitro tissue culture production of virus-free <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> has been developed in both countries and there is a continuous demand for <b>pre-basic</b> and basic <b>seed</b> <b>potato.</b> Current total production is significantly lower than actual requirements. In the 80 s and 90 s of the previous century two modern facilities for production of virus-free <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> and certified <b>seed</b> were built in Sokolac (Republic of Srpska) and Guča (Republic of Serbia). Although facilities were well-equipped, <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production was permanently ceased in 2000.

40|$|Scarcity of {{good quality}} seed is major {{obstacle}} to expanded potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production in sub-saharan Africa (SSA). Constraints in availability and supply of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> are partly attributable to challenges in production of pre-basic which is an intermediary step necessary in production of seed tubers in the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> value chain. Aeroponic minutuber production is a relatively recent technology {{that has the potential}} to break the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> bottleneck in many SSA countries due to several advantages that it holds especially those related to high multiplication rates; typically (1 : 50 - 100) that arise from sequential harvesting. There are, however, a number of potential challenges which, if not addressed, can contribute to non attainment of the projected increases in seed availability and not only mess up the 3 generation (3 G) revolution strategy of boosting seed tuber production in SSA but also jeopardize the adoption of the technology. Besides problems associated with failure of electricity supply and management of nutrition, the Achilles‘ heel of aeroponic minituber production is probably the large variation in physiological age of resulting tubers due to sequential harvesting that takes place over several months during the production cycle. In the absence of cold storage facilities which are few and beyond the reach of many <b>pre-basic</b> <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> growers in many SSA countries, harvested minitubers can either be at dormant, apical dominance, multiple sprouting or senile stage when they are required for planting with significant impacts on subsequent yields. This paper discusses the problems associated with physiological age in seed tuber systems based on aeroponic minitubers and proposes some approaches that may overcome these challenges to ensure that the promise of aeroponic minituber production is realized. The proposed approaches include the strategic application of dormancy inhibiting and dormancy promoting substances at various stages of aeroponic minituber production combined with the use of low cost storage systems such as the diffused light storage technology depending on the dormancy period of the variety (ies) being grown.

40|$|In Ethiopia, use of low-quality <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> by the {{majority}} of potato growers is associated with underdevelopment of the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> value chains. Three <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> systems are present in Ethiopia: the informal seed system, the alternative seed system and the formal seed system. This chapter analyses the performance of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> value chains with respect to their ability to supply quality seed tubers to <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> systems, by using the chain performance drivers enabling environment, technology, market structure, chain coordination, farm management, and inputs. Information obtained from literature review, secondary data and key informants’ interviews were used for the analysis. In the informal <b>seed</b> system, <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> value chains suffered from a poor enabling environment such as a low quality technical support and lack of a seed quality control system; use of sub-optimal storage and transportation technologies, sub-optimal farm management practices; and little use of inputs. In the alternative seed system, main constraints were the lack of a <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> quality control system, poor farm management practices, little use of inputs by <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> growers, and a distorted <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> market that resulted from involvement of institutional buyers.

However, the uptake of these varieties by farmers {{is very limited}} so far {{and this is one}} of the causes of insufficient seed quality in the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> system in Ethiopia. The low uptake may be related to the high costs of recommended production methods for these varieties. The objective of this study was to formulate least-cost <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods for farmers in Ethiopia. The paper used integer linear programming to determine these least-cost <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods, using published data on the perceived contributions to seed tuber yield and quality of different cultivation and post-harvest management options, and calculated <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production cost data for the different options. For the potato-growing districts Jeldu and Welmera, several <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods were formulated from which farmers can choose an affordable method that will enable them to produce <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> with reasonable yield and quality levels.

The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production area was 1290 hectares year 2006. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production is concentrated in the Nothern parts of Finland where the High Grade Region (Tyrnävä and Liminka in the Oulu region) {{for the production of}} <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> is located. Four generations of prebasic seed (class SS, S, SEE and SE), three generations of basic seed (class EC 1, EC 2 and EC 3) and one generation of certified seed (class A or B) are produced in Finland. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> inspection schema of Finland includes several steps: the field inspection, the laboratory tests of potato cyst nematodes, bacterial ring rot, brown rot and potato virus and finally the visual tuber inspection. The field inspection, sampling and visual tuber inspection are done by the authorized inspectors. For prebasic and basic seed the inspectors make two official field inspections. For certified seed only one field inspection is needed. Official requirements are set for varietal purity, rogues, potato virus, black leg (Erwinia spp.) and Rhizoctonia. During the field inspection the background information as previous crop is checked. The soil sample for testing potato cyst nematodes is taken per each hectare. The potato cyst nematodes (Globodera sp.) are quarantine organisms and the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production is not possible on the field infected by the nematodes. In the autumn the tubers for winter tests in the laboratory are sampled. For bacterial ring rot a sample is 200 tubers/ha and for virus tests 200 tubers/field. Brown rot is tested as a survey of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production. The testing method for bacterial ring rot (Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus) and brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum) is the immunofluorescense (IF) method based on the specific antibodies. These quarantine organisms are not accepted in the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production. The potato virus Y-, A-, X-, S-, M- and Potato Leaf Roll are tested once during <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> certification process usually as the prebasic seed. For the other <b>seed</b> classes the <b>potato</b> virus Y and potato virus A are tested. For certified <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> class A there is a list of varieties which are tested. The seed class B is not routinely tested. The testing method is ELISAtest. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> companies need certificate labels before sorting and packing potatoes. A visual tuber inspection is done by the local inspectors. A sample of 400 tubers/ 50 tn is cut by knife and tubers are inspected one by one. There are requirements for soil, dry and wet rot, external blemishes, common scab, black scurf, skin spot and deep-pitted scab. The quarantine organisms or visual symtops of moptop virus or tobacco rattle virus are not accepted. If all steps of inspection and testing are according to legislation, the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> lot is officially certified and can be marketed as <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> to the farmers. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

40|$|Keywords: Potato, {{positive}} selection, viruses, <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> systems, East Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a crop with a {{high potential}} to contribute to poverty reduction in Eastern Africa through income increase and improved food security. It is largely grown by smallholders, has a high production per hectare, stable prices and a steadily growing demand. Average yields in Eastern Africa of 10. 5 t/ha are much below the world average and yields observed {{in the fields of}} better performing smallholders. There is both a need and a potential for increased potato productivity. A diagnosis of the potato systems of Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia identified integrated management of bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) and late blight (Phytophthora infestans), soil fertility management, and improving <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> quality as technology-based opportunities for innovation. Improvement of potato supply chains and the knowledge exchange in the sector were identified as systemic opportunities for improvement. Analysis of the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> system confirms that both virus diseases and bacterial wilt are likely contributors to the low yields. In only 3 % of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> tubers sold in rural markets was free of PVY, PLRV, PVX and PVA. Ralstonia solanacearum was found in 74 % of potato farms sampled in Kenya. Less than 5 % of the <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> used are sourced from specialized multipliers (specialized chain). Farmers rely on <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> from neighbours and farm-saved <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> (local chain). This often makes economic sense in the absence of affordable high quality <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> and limited market security. <b>Seed</b> <b>potato</b> system interventions need to tackle the local and specialized chain simultaneously. Private investment in specialized multiplication could stimulate the production of affordable high-quality <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes.</b> For local chain improvement training on seed quality maintenance and on bacterial wilt and virus management is needed. Research into the mitigation of yield-reducing effects of indiscriminate <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> recycling, such as research on virus resistance and positive selection deserves attention. Positive selection, the selection of healthy looking mother plants for the production of <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes,</b> can contribute to improving quality management in the local chain. In farmer managed trials in Kenya it gave an average yield increase of 34 % which corresponded to a 284 Euro profit increase per ha. It requires no cash and only 4 man-days 12 per hectare and is an important alternative and complementary technology to regular seed replacement. In 18 replicated trials it was shown that positive selection lowered the incidence of PLRV, PVY and PVX with 35 %, 35 % and 39 %, respectively, and increased yields irrespective of the agro-ecology, crop management, soil fertility, variety, and quality of the starting material with an average 30 %, compared to current farmer practice. Regression analysis showed that this reduction in virus incidence contributed to the higher yields, but did not fully account for the effect. Probably other, not tested, virus diseases and other seed borne diseases also played a role. It can be concluded that positive selection can benefit all smallholder potato producers who select <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> from their own fields, and should thus be incorporated routinely in agricultural extension efforts. In retrospect the research trajectory can be considered a successful contribution of agricultural research to innovation. It shows that it is worthwhile to search for opportunities for incremental innovation that do not require institutional change and that these opportunities can be of a surprising simple nature, and based on old technology. Essential for researchers to contribute to innovation is room to manoeuvre and opportunity to immerse in practical collaborative partnerships with practitioners. Most importantly, innovation needs to be made a central objective, rather than research results, and the mandate of research needs to be broadened and allow for the active engagement in training, communication and scaling-up.  ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted {{to find out the}} best media and auxin for planting potato cutting to produce G 1 <b>seed</b> <b>potato.</b> Research was done at a shade house of Kebun Bibit Hortikultura Kembang Merta, Candi Kuning Village, Baturiti, Tabanan Regency, Bali. Were planted at the screen house for sprouting. Four weeks old of shoots were used as cutting. Each cutting measured 10 cm. Stem cutting of G 0 <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> was dipped in 2 different auxin types (Rootone F and auxin paste) and planted in 2 different media (manure and charred rice husk). Results shows that the best combination between media and auxin for stem cutting growth was charred rice husk and Rootone F, in which 82. 29 % growth was recorded. Combination between charred rice husk and Rootone F produced 12 more <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> per plant, compared to other treatment combination. In term of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> size, the highest number produced (80 %) was size SS ( 60 %) of 2 %. Keyword : Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), stem cuttings, seed production...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the recent}} years Potato virus Y {{presents}} {{a growing problem}} in Dutch <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> culture. In recent years a significant % of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> lots was de-classified due to PVY infections. This apparent increase in PVY infections was unexpected since no increase in field symptoms were observed and the numbers of aphids caught in the yellow water traps and high suction traps showed a clear decline over the last 10 years [URL]...|$|R
40|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>potato</b> {{physiological}} age progressively advances with time (chronological age), {{but is also}} influenced by temperature during storage. In this work, different combinations of constant temperatures (2, 8 and 20 °C) were applied to 'Bondi‟ and 'Fraser‟ <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> at different times during the storage period. It seems that using expensive cool storage in winter in Canterbury, with cool winter ambient temperatures, is unnecessary for crop establishment and by inference subsequent crop production. ...|$|R
