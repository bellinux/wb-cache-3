50|$|It was {{so named}} because a similar rising had {{recently}} taken place in Prague, Bohemia, at that time closely associated with France through the House of Luxembourg, kings of Bohemia. Its causes lay in the reforms of Charles VII {{at the close of}} the Hundred Years' War, by which he sought to diminish the anarchy in France and its brigand-soldiery. The ordinances passed by the estates of langue d'oïl at Orléans in 1439, not only gave the king an aid of 100,000 francs (an act which was later used by the king as though it were a <b>perpetual</b> <b>grant</b> and so freed him from that parliamentary control of the purse so important in England), but demanded as well royal nominations to officerships in the army, marked a gain in the royal prerogative which the nobility resolved to challenge.|$|E
50|$|In 1606, the Franciscan general chapter {{was held}} in Toledo where Flaithrí Ó Maolchonaire was {{selected}} as minister-provincial of the Irish friars minor. His assimilation into Castilian life and the contacts he made were of considerable benefit to his confrères and successors. The most notable act of his tenure as provincial was the founding of a new Irish Franciscan college at Leuven in the Habsburg Netherlands. A year before his appointment, Ó Maolchonaire began his efforts in earnest with {{an appeal to the}} Spanish king. The loss of five Franciscan houses during the Nine Years' War made a new foundation essential. In response, Philip III instructed Archduke Albert to provide a <b>perpetual</b> <b>grant</b> for a new college in the university town of Leuven. Ó Maolchonaire’s part in founding the college clearly influenced the Catholic pastoral mission to Ireland during the seventeenth century. The first and most active Irish printing press on the continent was long in operation at Leuven.|$|E
5000|$|But, despite Supreme Court rulings, {{the modern}} {{corporation}} {{is not a}} real person. Rather, the publicly traded stock corporation is what Barnes terms an [...] "automaton", explicitly designed to maximize return to its owners. A corporation never sleeps or slows down. It externalizes as many costs as possible, and never reaches an upper limit of profitability, because no such limit has yet been established. As a result, corporations keep getting larger. In 1955, sales of the Fortune 500 accounted for one-third of U.S. gross domestic product. By 2004 they commanded two-thirds. In other words, these few hundred corporations replaced smaller firms organized as partnerships or proprietorships. Corporations have established a homogeneous global playing field around which they can freely move raw materials, labor, capital, finished products, tax-paying obligations, and profits. Thus, corporate franchise has become a <b>perpetual</b> <b>grant</b> of sovereignty, including immortality, self-government, and limited liability. By {{the end of the}} twentieth century, corporate power—both economic and political—stretched worldwide. International agreements not only lowered tariffs but extended corporate property rights and reduced the ability of sovereign nations to regulate corporations.|$|E

500|$|Through {{his victory}} over the oligarchs, Charles {{acquired}} about 60% of the Hungarian castles, along with the estates belonging to them. In 1323, he set about revising his previous land grants, which enabled him to reclaim former royal estates. During his reign, special commissions were set up to detect royal estates that had been unlawfully acquired by their owners. Charles refrained from making <b>perpetual</b> <b>grants</b> to his partisans. Instead, he applied a system of [...] "office fiefs" [...] (or honors), whereby his officials were entitled to enjoy all revenues accrued from their offices, but only for the time they held those offices. That system assured the preponderance of royal power, enabling Charles to rule [...] "with the plenitude of power", as he emphasized {{in one of his}} charters of 1335. He even ignored customary law: for instance, [...] "promoting a daughter to a son", which entitled her to inherit her father's estates instead of her male cousins. Charles also took control of the administration of the Church in Hungary. He appointed the Hungarian prelates at will, without allowing the cathedral chapters to elect them.|$|R
5000|$|In 1890, the Queen had Karim's {{portrait}} {{painted by}} Heinrich von Angeli. According to the Queen, von Angeli was keen to paint Karim {{as he had}} never painted an Indian before and [...] "was so struck with his handsome face and colouring". On 11 July 1890, she wrote to Lansdowne, and the Secretary of State for India Lord Cross, for [...] "a grant of land to her really exemplary and excellent young Munshi, Hafiz Abdul Karim". The ageing Queen did not trust her relatives and the Royal Household {{to look after the}} Munshi after she was gone, and so sought to secure his future. Lansdowne replied that grants of land were given only to soldiers, and then only in cases of long and meritorious service. Nevertheless, the Viceroy agreed to find a grant for Karim that would provide about 600 rupees annually, the same amount that an old soldier could expect after performing exceptionally. [...] Victoria wrote to Lansdowne repeatedly between July and October, pressuring him on the land grant. Apart from wasteland, there was little government-controlled land near Agra; thus Lansdowne was having trouble finding a suitable plot. On 30 October, the Munshi left Balmoral for four months' leave in India, travelling on the same ship as Lady Lansdowne. On the same day, Lord Lansdowne telegraphed the Queen to let her know that a grant of land in the suburbs of Agra had been arranged. Lansdowne made a point of informing the Queen: ... quite recently {{one of the men who}} at the peril of his life, and under a withering fire helped to blow up the Kashmiri Gate of Delhi in the Mutiny, received, on his retirement from the service, a grant of land yielding only Rs 250 for life. Abdul Karim, at the age of 26, had received a <b>perpetual</b> <b>grant</b> of land representing an income of more than double that amount in recognition of his services as a member of your Majesty's Household. Lansdowne visited Agra in November 1890. He and the Munshi met, and Lansdowne arranged for Karim to be seated with the viceregal staff during a durbar. Lansdowne met both the Munshi and Waziruddin privately, and Lady Lansdowne met his wife and mother-in-law, who were smuggled into the Viceroy's camp in secrecy to comply with rules of purdah.|$|E

McCarter was not interested in discussing the matter. He clapped his hands together in Colby's face saying that he would not accept anything but perpetual franchises. Colby said that had he tried to persuade him with reason, he could probably have been swayed but this was eye-opening. McCarter considered his dictatorial powers absolute. Later McCarter's brother Uzel tried to persuade Colby with flattery, [...] "We think you have a political future before you, and we don't want to see you throw it away." [...] Uncorrupted, Colby decided to introduce a resolution to put the legislature on record, believing that a limited franchise bill could not be passed.

40|$|The {{system of}} funding, {{by which the}} greater part of the {{enormous}} national debt of England has been created, is that of <b>granting</b> <b>perpetual</b> annuities of # 5, # 4, or # 3, redeemable on the payment of # 100. These annuities are called respectively the 5 per cents., 4 per cents., and 3 per cents. The annuities are sold in the market, and the price is what is called the price of the funds. There could be no objection to this mode of borrowing, if the Government always contracted loans in whatever fund was at par; or, in other words, if they <b>granted</b> <b>perpetual</b> annuities of the amount of the market rate of interest at the day of borrowing, redeemable on payment of # 100.

50|$|Instances of perpetuities are the {{dividends}} {{upon the}} public stocks in England, France {{and some other}} countries. Thus, although it is usual to speak of £100 consols, the reality is the yearly dividend which the government pays by quarterly instalments. The practice of the French in this is arguably more logical. In speaking of their public funds (rentes) they do not mention the ideal capital sum, but speak of the annuity or annual payment that is received by the public creditor. Other instances of perpetuities are the incomes derived from the debenture stocks of railway companies, also the feu-duties commonly payable on house property in Scotland. The number of years' purchase which the <b>perpetual</b> annuities <b>granted</b> by a government or a railway company realize in the open market, forms a very simple test of the credit of the various governments or railways.|$|R
60|$|The {{conduct of}} Bobadilla bore all the {{appearance}} of a lawless usurpation of some intruder of the kind. He had possessed himself forcibly of the fortress, and consequently of the town.

That this man could really be sanctioned by government, in such intemperate measures, was repugnant to belief.

He established the Order of Saint George, which was the first secular order of knights. He promoted the opening of new gold mines, which made Hungary the largest producer of gold in Europe. The first Hungarian gold coins were minted during his reign. At the congress of Visegrád in 1335, he mediated a reconciliation between two neighboring monarchs, John of Bohemia and Casimir III of Poland. Treaties signed at the same congress also contributed to the development of new commercial routes linking Hungary with Western Europe.
