50|$|Earlier SNOMED {{versions}} had faceted structure {{ordered by}} semantic axes, requiring that more complex situations {{required to be}} coded by a coordination of different codes. This had two major shortcomings. On the one hand, the necessity of <b>post-coordination</b> was perceived as a user-unfriendly obstacle, which has certainly contributed to the rather low adoption of early SNOMED versions. On the other hand, uniform coding was difficult to obtain. E.g.,Acute appendicitis could be post-coordinated in three different ways with no means to compute semantic equivalences.SNOMED RT had addressed this problem by introducing description logic formula. With the addition of CTV3 {{a large number of}} concepts were redefined using formal expressions. However, the fusion with CTV3, as a historically grown terminology with many close-to user descriptions, introduced some problems which still affect SNOMED CT. In addition to a confusing taxonomic web of many hierarchical levels with massive multiple inheritance (e.g. there are 36 taxonomic ancestors for Acute appendicitis), many ambiguous, context-dependent concepts have found their way into SNOMED CT. Pre-coordination was sometimes pushed to extremes, so there are, for example, 350 different concepts for burns found on the head.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: An {{important}} feature of SNOMED CT is <b>post-coordination,</b> which is enabled by the SNOMED CT representation specifying whether a relationship is a defining or a qualifier relationship. In this paper the use of qualifier relationships in SNOMED CT is analyzed, {{as well as the}} extent to which qualifiers interact with defining relationships, so that pre-coordinated concepts can also be post-coordinated. Methods: The July 2007 release of SNOMED CT was imported into a database. Analyses were performed by querying this database. Results: Qualifier relationships occur in 10 out of 61 types of attribute relationships, and it is shown that generally pre-coordinated concepts cannot be constructed by applying <b>post-coordination</b> using qualifier relationships. Most of the qualifier relationships have generic target concepts, making it possible to construct concepts which are not clinically sensible. A logic-based representation is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the current model. Conclusions: Defining and qualifier relationships both enable <b>post-coordination</b> in SNOMED CT. Introducing qualifiers for more types of relationships, and using qualifier relationships with more specific target concepts will further improve <b>post-coordination</b> in SNOMED C...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{introduction}} of computerized <b>post-coordination</b> has solved {{many of the}} problems of pre-coordinated subject access. However, the adoption of computerized <b>post-coordination</b> results in the loss of some pre-coordination benefits. Specifically, the effect of hiding terms within the context of others is lost in <b>post-coordination</b> which gives lead status to every document term. This results in spurious matches of terms out of context. Library patrons and Internet searchers are increasingly dissatisfied with subject access performance, in part because of unmanageably large retrieval sets. The need to enhance precision and limit the size of retrieval sets motivates this work which proposes partial coordination, an approach which incorporates the advantages of computer search with the ability of pre-coordination to limit spurious partial matches and thereby enhance precision...|$|E

40|$|Concept mapping is {{a process}} that maps {{extracted}} entities from textual notes into well-defined concepts in a formal ontology. It is common that a clinical term might be mapped to more than one concept using a string-based lookup approach. Besides, many complex but important phrases found in clinical notes are not present in ontologies. To deal with these two problems, this study develops a system denoted PCG-SCT (<b>Post-coordination</b> Generation of SNOMED CT Concepts). The PCG-SCT not only deals with concept mapping but also <b>post-coordination</b> generation for complex phrases. The concept mapping module of PCG-SCT maps clinical phrases to 12 types of SNOMED concepts based on the TTSCT (Text to SNOMED CT). The concept candidates for clinical phrases are firstly generated by applying TTSCT. Then, a process of checking for the presence of SNOMED’s defining relationships between the concepts aids in the choice of the best concept from the candidates. A subsequent module of PCG-SCT generates <b>post-coordination</b> for mapped concepts by extracting 9 types of relationships through a pattern-based approach. Furthermore, the negated “Clinical finding” and negated “Procedure” concepts are detected and represented by applying SNOMED context patterns. At the same time, this approach can also be used as an automatic method for new SNOMED concepts from clinical notes. The PCG-SCT is evaluated on 100 ICU admission summaries.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the coverage provided by SNOMED CT for clinical research concepts {{represented by the}} items on case report forms (CRFs), {{as well as the}} semantic nature of those concepts relevant to <b>post-coordination</b> methods. DESIGN: Convenience samples from CRFs developed by rheumatologists conducting several longitudinal, observational studies of vasculitis were selected. A total of 17 CRFs were used as the basis of analysis for this study, from which a total set of 616 (unique) items were identified. Each unique data item was classified as either a clinical finding or procedure. The items were coded by the presence and nature of SNOMED CT coverage and classified into semantic types by 2 coders. MEASUREMENTS: Basic frequency analysis was conducted to determine levels of coverage provided by SNOMED CT. Estimates of coverage by various semantic characterizations were estimated. RESULTS: Most of the core clinical concepts (88 %) from these clinical research data items were covered by SNOMED CT; however, far fewer of the concepts were fully covered (that is, where all aspects of the CRF item could be represented completely without post-coordination; 23 %). In addition, a large majority of the concepts (83 %) required <b>post-coordination,</b> either to clarify context (e. g., time) or to better capture complex clinical concepts (e. g., disease-related findings). For just over one third of the sampled CRF data items, both types of <b>post-coordination</b> were necessary to fully represent the meaning of the item.

As efforts move towards implementation, the target maps should retain a predictable structure including those targets requiring <b>post-coordination</b> of SNOMED CT concepts. In this paper, we compared the editorial guidelines of two versions of SNOMED CT (January 2005 and July 2006, respectively) and noted how the revisions affected a single, comprehensive set of mapped concepts (n= 2002) from a legacy system. Changes made to the categories and guidelines for approved attributes were noted and then evaluated against the post-coordinated maps (n= 1570) from the original mapping effort. Seventy-one percent (n= 1118) of the concepts were affected due to changes made in either SNOMED CT categories or to the revision of approved attributes. While the efforts of each subsequent SNOMED CT version aim for continual improvement, changes made to its core structure and <b>post-coordination</b> guidelines {{make it more difficult to}} migrate proprietary data to this reference standard.

40|$|Abstract Background A great {{challenge}} in sharing data across information systems in general practice {{is the lack}} of interoperability between different terminologies or coding schema used in the information systems. Mapping of medical vocabularies to a standardised terminology is needed to solve data interoperability problems. Methods We present a system to automatically map an interface terminology ICPC- 2 PLUS to SNOMED CT. Three steps of mapping are proposed in this system. The UMLS metathesaurus mapping utilises explicit relationships between ICPC- 2 PLUS and SNOMED CT terms in the UMLS library to perform the first stage of the mapping. Computational linguistic mapping uses natural language processing techniques and lexical similarities for the second stage of mapping between terminologies. Finally, the <b>post-coordination</b> mapping allows one ICPC- 2 PLUS term to be mapped into an aggregation of two or more SNOMED CT terms. Results A total 5, 971 of all 7, 410 ICPC- 2 terms (80. 58 %) were mapped to SNOMED CT using the three stages but with different levels of accuracy. UMLS mapping achieved the mapping of 53. 0 % ICPC 2 PLUS terms to SNOMED CT with the precision rate of 96. 46 % and overall recall rate of 44. 89 %. Lexical mapping increased the result to 60. 31 % and <b>post-coordination</b> mapping gave an increase of 20. 27 % in mapped terms. A manual review of a part of the mapping shows that the precision of lexical mappings is around 90 %. The accuracy of <b>post-coordination</b> has not been evaluated yet. Unmapped terms and mismatched terms are due to the differences in the structures between ICPC- 2 PLUS and SNOMED CT. Terms contained in ICPC- 2 PLUS but not in SNOMED CT caused {{a large proportion of the}} failures in the mappings. Conclusion Mapping terminologies to a standard vocabulary is a way to facilitate consistent medical data exchange and achieve system interoperability and data standardisation. Broad scale mapping cannot be achieved by any single method and methods based on computational linguistics can be very useful for the task. Automating as much as is possible of this process turns the searching and mapping task into a validation task, which can effectively reduce the cost and increase the efficiency and accuracy of this task over manual methods. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Medical {{vocabulary}} is complex, expanding, and convoluted {{not least}} {{because of the large}} numbers of compound terms.

However, these notions are not used with particular precision in the literature.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} methods of accessing (for indexing and retrieval purposes) medical research on population {{groups in the}} major abstracting and indexing services of the health sciences literature. DESIGN: The study of diseases in specific population groups is facilitated by the indexing of both diseases and populations in a database. The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase databases were selected for the study. The published thesauri for these databases were examined to establish the vocabulary in use. Indexing terms were identified and examined as to their representation in the current literature. Terms were clustered further into groups thought to reflect an end user's perspective and to facilitate subsequent analysis. The medical literature contained in the three online databases was searched with both controlled vocabulary and natural language terms. RESULTS: The three thesauri revealed shallow pre-coordinated hierarchical structures, rather difficult-to-use terms for <b>post-coordination,</b> and a blurring of cultural, genetic, and racial facets of populations. <b>Post-coordination</b> is difficult because of the system-oriented terminology, which is intended mostly for information professionals. The terminology unintentionally restricts access by the end users who lack the knowledge needed to use the thesauri effectively for information retrieval. CONCLUSIONS: Population groups are not represented adequately in the index languages of health sciences databases. Users of these databases need to be alerted to the difficulties that may be encountered in searching for information on population groups. Information and health professionals {{may not be able}} to access the literature if they are not familiar with the indexing policies on population groups.

40|$|Background: Re-use {{of patient}} data from an {{electronic}} patient record heavily relies on structured, coded data. Terminological systems (TSs) {{are meant to}} support this. TSs are more commonly implemented nowadays, especially those that support <b>post-coordination.</b> The effect of using a compositional TS on correctness and specificity of captured patient data is unknown. Objective: To evaluate the agreement between free-text reasons for admission to intensive care captured in a patient data management system (PDMS) and reasons for admission that were recorded using a compositional TS embedded in the PDMS. Methods: Observational study comparing pairs of free-text reasons for admission to intensive care with reasons for admission that were recorded using a compositional TS. Both reasons for admission were captured in the PDMS by clinicians during regular care practice. Each pair was judged as exact match, partial match or mismatch by two independent raters. Partial matches were further analyzed to investigate whether free-text or TS-based reasons for admissions included more detail and whether these differences {{could be explained by}} the content, the interface of the TS or by user or usability characteristics. Results: Eleven percent of the pairs matched exactly, 79 % of the pairs matched partially and 10 % of the pairs did not match. Compared to free-text registration TS-based registration resulted in more detail for 21 % of the partial matches, in less detail for 43 % of the partial matches and in 36 % of the partial matches some detail was added {{while at the same time}} other detail was lacking. In 65 % of the cases in which the TS-based registration lacked some detail, this detail was available in the content of the TS. Physicians who used the TS occasionally had a significantly higher percentage of mismatches. Conclusion: In practice, <b>post-coordination</b> leads to information with different detail but a level of detail comparable to free-text registration of reasons for admission. Details missing in the TS-based reasons for admission were most often available in the TS, indicating that user interaction with the system is more of an impediment than the contents of the TS.

40|$|The {{metalloid}} silicon {{is one of}} {{the most}} versatile elements of the world. Besides its widespread occurrence in the lithosphere, silicon containing compounds, for example the polymeric silicones, are used in numerous applications of the modern world. Moreover, the digital revolution and the progress in the photovoltaic industry is relying on silicon and its semiconductor properties. In contrast to its lower homologue, the carbon, silicon is capable of expanding its coordination geometry forming penta-, hexa- and even heptacoordinate complexes. Several of these structures have been examined over the last decades. However, most of these higher coordinate silicon complexes have been found to be hydrolytically unstable limiting their wider use, for instance in biological applications. The present thesis is addressing these limitations by investigating hexacoordinate (arenediolato) bis(polypyridyl) silicon(IV) complexes. The first part of the thesis deals with the synthesis and synthetic modification of higher coordinate silicon(IV) complexes. A successful <b>post-coordination</b> functionalization of silicon(IV) complexes is demonstrated. Besides halogenation, oxidation, and nitration reactions, a convenient nitrationreduction- condensation strategy tolerating various functional groups is discussed. Moreover, a synthetic approach to tris-heteroleptic complexes coordinating the DNA-intercalating ligand dppz is shown. In a prove of principal study, the results of the binding affinity of some silicon(IV) complexes to calf thymus DNA are presented. In a second project, the syntheses and biological properties of dinuclear metal-silicon(IV) complexes are studied. In order to constitute a small library of dinuclear complexes, different synthetic strategies including the previously presented nitration-reduction-condensation strategy, are discussed.

40|$|Previous {{investigators}} have defined clinical interface terminology as a systematic collection of health care–related phrases (terms) that supports clinicians' entry of patient-related information into computer programs, such as clinical “note capture” and decision support tools. Interface terminologies also can facilitate display of computer-stored patient information to clinician-users. Interface terminologies “interface” between clinicians' own unfettered, colloquial conceptualizations of patient descriptors {{and the more}} structured, coded internal data elements used by specific health care application programs. The intended uses of a terminology determine its conceptual underpinnings, structure, and content. As a result, the desiderata for interface terminologies differ from desiderata for health care–related terminologies used for storage (e. g., SNOMED-CT®), information retrieval (e. g., MeSH), and classification (e. g., ICD 9 -CM®). Necessary but not sufficient attributes for an interface terminology include adequate synonym coverage, presence of relevant assertional knowledge, and a balance between pre- and <b>post-coordination.</b> To place interface terminologies in context, this article reviews historical goals and challenges of clinical terminology development in general and then focuses on the unique features of interface terminologies...|$|E

Lexical mapping explored the lexical similarities between terms in these two terminologies, and mapped 60. 3 % of ICPC- 2 PLUS terms overall. <b>Post-coordination</b> of remaining unmapped terms was performed, allowing one ICPC- 2 PLUS term to be mapped into composition with two SCT terms, which gives an increase of about 20 % in mapped terms. Overall we have mapped 80. 58 % of ICPC- 2 PLUS terms to SCT terminology with different level of accuracy. A manual review of the mapping shows that about 90 % of string-based mappings are accurate. Unmapped terms and mismatched terms are due to {{the differences in the}} structures between ICPC- 2 PLUS and SCT. Terms contained in ICPC- 2 PLUS but not in SCT caused a large proportion of failures in the mappings...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we have mapped the International Classification of Primary Care 2 Australian Version (ICPC 2 PLUS) terms {{into the}} SNOMED CT (SCT) terminology. We have {{developed}} a series of computerised mapping algorithms. The UMLS metathesaurus mapping which utilizes the links of ICPC 2 P and SCT terms in UMLS library has mapped 46. 5 % of ICPC 2 P terms to SCT. The lexical mapping explores the lexical similarities between terms in these two terminologies, and has mapped 60. 3 % of ICPC 2 P terms overall. <b>Post-coordination</b> of those unmapped terms has been performed, allowing one ICPC 2 P term to be mapped into composition with two SCT terms, which gives an increase of about 20 % in mapped terms. Overall we had mapped 80 % of ICPC 2 P terms to SCT. A manual review of the mapping shows that about 90 % of the string-based mappings are accurate, the unmapped terms and mismatched terms are due to the different hierarchy between ICPC 2 P and SCT. Also terms contained in ICPC 2 P but not contained in SCT caused {{a large number of}} failures in the mappings. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} medical {{ontology}} {{that is used}} for registering health problems at intensive care units in hospitals. Because of its flexible architecture {{it is necessary to}} be able to determine equivalence and subsumption automatically. These two tasks require two types of knowledge to be encoded: definitional knowledge and template knowledge. We discuss how both kinds of knowledge can be made explicit and used in Protégé, using the OWL language. In our approach, we have to mix description logic (DL) style of knowledge representation with a frame-based style of representation. The consistency between both is an important issue. Our aim with this paper is to demonstrate and discuss approaches to augment DL-based representations with frame-based meta-knowledge. 1 Real-World Usage of Ontologies DICE (Diagnoses for Intensive Care Evaluation) is an ontology regarding reasons for admission in intensive care. Its primary applications are providing a means for registration and aggregation of patients ’ reasons for admission. In order to stimulate clinicians and nurses to provide as much detail as is known about a patient, a mechanism for supporting <b>post-coordination</b> has been implemented, based on a (frame-based) representation that allows specification of refinable characteristics. Aggregation is supported by means of definitional characteristics, that enable grouping together reasons for admission that share common properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{participated in}} both tasks 1 a and 1 b of the ShARe/CLEF 2013 NLP Challenge, where 1 a was on {{detecting}} disorder concept boundaries and 1 b was on assigning concept IDs to the entities from 1 a. An existing NLP system developed at Kaiser Permanente was modified to output concepts that {{were close to}} the disorder definition of the Challenge. The core pipeline involved de-terministic section detection, tokenization, sentence chunking, probabilistic POS tagging, rule-based phrase chunking, terminology look-up (using UMLS 2012 AB), rule-based concept disambiguation and <b>post-coordination.</b> The sys-tem originally identifies findings (both normal and abnormal), procedures, anatomies, etc., and therefore a post-filter was created to subset the concepts with the source (SNOMED) and semantic types expected by the Challenge. A list of frequency-ranked CUIs was extracted from the training corpus to help break ties when multiple concepts were proposed on a single set of span. How-ever, no retraining/customization was made to meet the boundary annotation preference specified in the challenge guidelines. Our best settings achieved an F-score of 0. 503 (was 0. 684 with relaxed boundary penalty) in task 1 a, and best accuracy of 0. 443 (was 0. 865 on relaxed boundaries) in task 1 b...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} 598 of 63, 952 terms {{employed in}} problem list entries from seven major healthcare institutions {{that were not}} mapped with UMLS to SNOMED CT when preparing the NLM UMLS-CORE problem list subset. We intended to determine whether published or post-coordinated SNOMED concepts could accurately capture the problems as stated by the clinician and to characterize the workload for the local terminology manager. From the terms we analyzed, we estimate that 7. 5 % of the total terms represent ambiguous statements that require clarification. Of those terms which were unambiguous, we estimate that 38. 1 % could be encoded using the SNOMED CT January 2011 pre-coordinated (published core) content. 60. 4 % of unambiguous terms required <b>post-coordination</b> to capture the term meaning within the SNOMED model. Approximately 28. 5 % of post-coordinated content could not be fully defined and required primitive forms. This left 1. 5 % of unambiguous terms which were expressed with meaning {{which could not be}} represented in SNOMED CT. We estimate from our study that 98. 5 % of clinical terms unambiguously suggested for the problem list can be equated to published concepts or can be modeled with SNOMED CT but that roughly one in four SNOMED modeled expressions fail to represent the full meaning of the term. Implications for the business model of the local terminology manager and the development of SNOMED CT are discussed...|$|E
