25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili cites {{a number}} {{cases in which}} {{international}} tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by general international law. He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council {{does not intend to}} offend peremptory norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles must be part of an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which reiterates the prohibition on the use of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a <b>peremptory</b> <b>norm</b> of general international law is invalid. According to Hans-Paul Gasser, ‘doubtful’ wording of the Council’s resolutions must always be construed {{in such a way as}} to avoid conflict with fundamental international obligations.|$|E

That has been increasingly accepted since the Nuremberg Trials (the first enforcement in world history of international norms upon individuals) and now might be considered uncontroversial. However, the language of <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms</b> was not used in connection with these trials, rather the basis of criminalisation and punishment of Nazi atrocities, was that civilisation could not tolerate their being ignored because it could not survive their being repeated.|$|R

50|$|A {{treaty is}} {{null and void}} {{if it is in}} {{violation}} of a <b>peremptory</b> <b>norm.</b> These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations. These are limited to such universally accepted prohibitions as those against the aggressive use of force, genocide and other crimes against humanity, piracy, hostilities directed at civilian population, racial discrimination and apartheid, slavery and torture, meaning that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit such acts.|$|E
40|$|The International Law Commission's {{decision}} to maintain Articles 40 and 41 {{is based on}} the conviction that serious breaches of <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms</b> entail specific legal consequences within the field of state responsibility. Among these consequences, it is possible to distinguish between (i) specific obligations binding on other states, (ii) specific rights of other states and (iii) specific obligations of the responsible state. This article critically assesses whether international law recognizes specific consequences falling within the third of these categories. It discusses six prominent candidates suggested in international practice, literature, and the work of the ILC - such as the obligations to provide assurances of repetition, to pay punitive or exemplary damages or to prosecute individual perpetrators of serious wrongful acts. The article concludes that none of these candidates qualifies as a specific consequence of serious breaches of <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms</b> — partly because the alleged specific obligation has not been recognized in international law, and partly because it equally applies to internationally wrongful acts that do not constitute serious breaches in the sense of Article 40. It follows that international law at present does not impose specific obligations on states responsible for serious breaches of <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms.</b> This in turn raises doubts as to the viability of the distinction between serious breaches and ordinary wrongful acts...|$|R
50|$|The only {{limit to}} {{pacta sunt servanda}} are the <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms</b> of general {{international}} law, called jus cogens (compelling law).

5000|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} customary law, {{which has}} traditionally required consent {{and allows the}} alteration of its obligations between states through treaties, <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms</b> cannot be violated by any state [...] "through international treaties or local or special customs or even general customary rules not endowed with the same normative force".|$|R
5000|$|A <b>peremptory</b> <b>norm</b> (also called jus cogens, Latin for [...] "compelling law") is a {{fundamental}} principle of international law which is accepted {{by the international community}} of states as a norm from which no derogation is ever permitted. These norms rooted from Natural Law principles, and any laws conflicting with it should be considered null and void.Examples include various international crimes; a state which carries out or permits slavery, torture, genocide, war of aggression, or crimes against humanity is always violating customary international law.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{international}} treaties limit {{the cases in}} which loss of nationality may occur. In most cases this limits the government's power to deprive the individual of citizenship, but this also may limit the individual's ability to voluntarily make themselves stateless. Article 7 of the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness provides that [...] "laws for the renunciation of a nationality shall be conditional upon a person's acquisition or possession of another nationality". However, this is not considered a <b>peremptory</b> <b>norm</b> which binds non-signatories to the Convention.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual {{slavery is}} {{particular}} form of enslavement which includes limitations on one's autonomy, freedom of movement and power to decide matters relating to one's sexual activity. Thus, the crime also includes forced marriages, domestic servitude or other forced labor that ultimately involves forced sexual activity. In contrast to the crime of rape, which is a completed offence, sexual slavery constitutes a continuing offence. ... Forms of sexual slavery can, for example, be practices such as the detention of women in [...] "rape camps" [...] or [...] "comfort stations", forced temporary [...] "marriages" [...] to soldiers and other practices involving the treatment of women as chattel, and as such, violations of the <b>peremptory</b> <b>norm</b> prohibiting slavery.|$|E
50|$|The {{universality}} principle (principle of universal jurisdiction) is closely {{aligned with the}} international law doctrine of <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms</b> (jus cogens). The principle holds that all states have jurisdiction over crimes that are universally recognized to be a crime against humanity. These have historically included piracy, slave-trading, torture, genocide, and perhaps terrorism.|$|R
50|$|Jus cogens and {{customary}} {{international law}} are not interchangeable. All jus cogens are {{customary international law}} through their adoption by states, but not all customary international laws {{rise to the level}} of <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms.</b> States can deviate from customary international law by enacting treaties and conflicting laws, but jus cogens are non-derogable.|$|R

50|$|Marian Muszkat {{was born}} in Suwałki (Poland under partitions), where he {{completed}} primary and then secondary school. In 1927 he began studies at the University of Warsaw. In Warsaw Muszkat studied law, and simultaneously worked as a clerk in factories and as a school teacher. As a student he belonged to socialist academic organizations. Muszkat was a distinctive student, thereby he soon travelled to France to continue his studies at the University of Nancy. During his stay in Nancy, Muszkat penned some new ideas about public international law, <b>peremptory</b> <b>norm</b> and international problems concerning the Third World countries. In 1931 Muszkat obtained a degree of Master of Law, and in 1936 at the same University he received a degree of Doctor of Law.|$|E
50|$|On the {{question}} of preference between sources of international law, rules established by treaty will take preference if such an instrument exists. It is also argued however that international treaties and international custom are sources of international law of equal validity; this is that new custom may supersede older treaties and new treaties may override older custom. Also, is cogens (<b>peremptory</b> <b>norm)</b> is a custom, not a treaty. Certainly, judicial decisions and juristic writings are regarded as auxiliary sources of international law, whereas {{it is unclear whether}} the general principles of law recognized by 'civilized nations' should be recognized as a principal or auxiliary source of international law. Nevertheless, treaty, custom, and general principles of law are generally recognized as primary sources of international law.|$|E
5000|$|The Court has {{subsequently}} {{held that}} the UN Charter {{prohibition on the use}} of force constituted customary international law. In the Nicaragua case, the parties were in agreement that the prohibition constituted a <b>peremptory</b> <b>norm,</b> or jus cogens. The practices of states have generally conformed to the Court's approach in the Corfu Channel case. The United States has criticized the Court's approach to the use of force. The United States' criticism flows from the fact that, even owing to {{the use of force against}} Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and the acceptance of the legality of such action, the ICJ still maintains the position that non-state groups cannot commit an [...] "armed attack". An occurrence of an [...] "armed attack" [...] is the necessary condition for a state to use the right of self -defence in response to an illegal use of force, and thus breach the territorial sovereignty of a state.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} clear weight of condemnation of such practices, some critics {{disagree with the}} division of international legal norms into a hierarchy.

40|$|Jus cogens are <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms</b> of {{international}} law. No treaty between states can violate them.

As a result, {{the views of the}} people of the world – not just states and courts and international lawyers – ought to be assessed as part of that. Direct democratic input into what should be considered jus cogens can be promoted by convening Global Citizens’ Juries on the norms under discussion. Deliberations in small groups of people drawn from many nations can provide robust indicators of what world opinion would be, if everyone had access to similar information and discussions. Where broad consensus emerges across several such Global Citizens’ Juries, countries, courts and others ought to take that into account in deciding what to treat as <b>peremptory</b> <b>norms</b> {{of international}} law. Such a process would mark a significant contribution to improving the democratic deficit that currently prevails in making and implementing international law...|$|R
