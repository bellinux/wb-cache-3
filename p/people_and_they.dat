25|$|Christ's {{ministers in}} the church are {{stewards}} in the household of God and shepherds of his flock. Some are called and ordained to this occupation as presbyters or deacons. Presbyters have a principal and directing part in these great duties but they hold no priesthood differing in kind from that which is common to all the Lord's <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> have no exclusive title to the preaching of the gospel or the care of souls.

After the fall of Bastille, a new armed force, the Garde Nationale, was formed under the command of the Marquis de Lafayette, who had served with George Washington in America. Lafayette gave the Garde Nationale dark blue uniforms similar to those of the Continental Army. Blue became the colour of the revolutionary armies, opposed to the white uniforms of the Royalists and the Austrians.|$|E

The people then celebrated Narakasura's defeat with sparklers, lights and firecrackers. This celebration has continued down the generations as Deepavali.

25|$|In its ethnic {{character}} Plovdiv is {{the second}} or the third largest cosmopolitan city inhabited by Bulgarians after Sofia and possibly Varna. According to the 2001 census from population of 338 224 inhabitants the Bulgarians were 302 858 (90%). Stolipinovo in Plovdiv is the largest Roma neighbourhood in the Balkans, having a population of around 20,000 alone, further Roma ghettos are Hadji Hassan Mahala and Sheker Mahala. Therefore, the census number is a deflation {{of the number of}} Roma <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are most likely the second largest group after the Bulgarians, most of all because the Muslim Roma in Plovdiv claim to be of Turkish ethnicity and Turkish-speaking at the census ("Xoraxane Roma"). For further information see the article Roma people in Plovdiv. Like elsewhere in the country, Roma people are subjected to discrimination and segregation (See the Bulgaria section of the article Antiziganism).|$|E
25|$|Although Minnan is the {{mainstream}} Southern Min language and is spoken in Teochew speaking region's closest neighbour, Southern Fujian towards the northeast, most Teochew {{people do not}} speak it and the majority see themselves as a distinct group from their mainstream counterparts in their neighbouring Southern Fujian.

However, there are a minority group of Teochew people who speak Minnan exclusively, {{most of whom have}} had relatives and close contacts with their mainstream counterparts from their neighbouring Southern Fujian. For these Minnan speaking Teochews, Minnan is highly considered as their native language as well and they treat their hometown language as a merely accented form of Minnan.

25|$|The year of 1989, when Valdobrev {{attended}} the National Academy of Theatre and Film Arts, was {{crucial for the}} whole of Eastern Europe. The fall of the Communist regime in Bulgaria wasn't enough for the <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> demanded additional democratic reforms. Valdobrev became part of the strong student movement raised to power {{in the next few years}} of mass demonstrations, street riots, barricade protests and sieges of parliament. In 1990 the students caused a National strike by occupying all the Universities for more than a month. As a result the recently elected Communist President Petar Mladenov resigned. On the next year a new two-month-long occupation strike inflamed by the Art Academy students led to the resignation of the Communist Prime minister Andrey Lukanov. On 31 December 2006 Valdobrev hosted Bulgaria’s celebration concert for joining the EU. The event was held in Battenberg square in Sofia, and was attended by 80,000 people.|$|E

25|$|Marcus Garvey {{encouraged}} African {{people around}} the world to be proud of their race and to see beauty in their own kind. This form of Black nationalism later became known as Garveyism. A central idea to Garveyism was that African people in every part of the world were one <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> would never advance if they did not put aside their cultural and ethnic differences and unite under their own shared history. He was heavily influenced by the earlier works of Booker T. Washington, Martin Delany, and Henry McNeal Turner. Garvey used his own personal magnetism and the understanding of black psychology and the psychology of confrontation to create a movement that challenged bourgeois blacks for the minds and souls of African Americans. Marcus Garvey's return to America had to do with his desire to meet with the man who inspired him most, Booker T. Washington but unfortunately Garvey did not return in time to meet Washington. Despite this, Garvey moved forward with his efforts and two years later, a year after Washington's death, Garvey established a similar organization in America known as the United Negro Improvement Association otherwise known as the UNIA. Garvey's beliefs are articulated in The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey as well as Message To The People: The Course of African Philosophy.|$|E
