40|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} of hexamethylmelamine (HMM) and its metabolites <b>pentamethylmelamine</b> (PMM), N, 2, 2, 4, 6 -tetramethylmelamine (TMM) and hydroxymethylpentamethylmelamine (HMPMM) {{and of the}} {{alkylating agent}} triethylenemelamine (TEM) were studied on a cell line derived from a human ovarian cancer, by measuring [3 H]TdR uptake. After 24 h of incubation all the tested compounds inhibited [3 H]TdR uptake, but only at a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml. However, after 120 h incubation, concentrations of 0. 1 [...] 10 micrograms/ml resulted in highly significant cytotoxicity. HMPMM and TEM were the most active and their effect was not reversed 72 h after their removal. In our in vitro system no metabolism of HMM was observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of 6 human colorectal tumour xenografts to 7 cytotoxic agents have been established. Tumour responses have been quantified by growth inhibition, {{and the time}} taken for 3 H-thymidine fractional incorporation (TFI) to recover to the control value after treatment. The chemosensitivity of each tumour line to a spectrum of agents was individual, and no pattern of response which would allow prediction of individual agent efficacy was apparent. Cyclophosphamide, methyl-CCNU and 5 -fluorouracil produced marked growth inhibition in individual tumour lines, whereas actinomycin-D, cis-dichlorodiammine platinum, doxorubicin and <b>pentamethylmelamine</b> showed little activity. Data presented agree with clinical evaluation for single-agent therapy. The uptake and incorporation of radiolabelled 5 -fluorouracil into 4 tumour lines is reported. No marked differences between 3 FU-insensitive lines and 1 sensitive line have been observed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{effect of}} 11 anticancer {{drugs on the}} ability of Raji {{lymphoma}} cells to form colonies in soft agar was determined with the use of both a 1 -hour and a continuous drug exposure. Three distinct patterns of drug sensitivities were observed: a) Dactinomycin, adriamycin, bleomycin, mitomycin C, vincristine, and cis-platinum II all produced a dose-dependent reduction in colony formation following a 1 -hour exposure, which was further augmented by a continuous exposure to the drugs; b) the antimetabolites (methotrexate, p-cytosine arabinoside, and 5 -flu-orouracil) and <b>pentamethylmelamine</b> had no suppressive effects on colony formation with a 1 -hour exposure, but they produced marked cytotoxicity with continuous drug exposure; and c) L-phenylalanine mustard had the same degree of colony suppres-sion with both a 1 -hour and a continuous drug exposure. Preincubation of Raji cells with an enzyme mixture (DNase...|$|E

After 24 h of incubation all the tested compounds inhibited [3 H]TdR uptake, but only at a concentration of 100,ug/ml. However, after 120 h incubation, concentrations of 0 - 1 - 10,g/ml resulted in highly significant cytotoxicity. HMPMM and TEM were the most active and their effect was not reversed 72 h after their removal. In our in vitro system no metabolism of HMM was observed. HEXAMETHYLMELAMINE (HMM) is an anticancer drug which in Phase II trials has shown consistent activity in several human malignancies (Blum et al., 1973; Legha et al., 1976); its effectiveness ha...|$|E

40|$|Trimelamol (N 2,N 4,N 6 -trihydroxymethyl-N 2,N 4,N 6 -trimethylmelamine) is an {{analogue}} of <b>pentamethylmelamine</b> (PMM). In early {{clinical trials}} PMM {{failed to show}} significant anti-tumour activity in man which was attributed to poor metabolic activation. Trimelamol does not require activation and is therefore expected to be more active in man. PMM caused dose-limiting emesis and sedation whereas Trimelamol is much less neurotoxic in rodents. The relative penetration of PMM and Trimelamol into mouse brain has therefore been examined. Mice receiving PMM at 90 mg kg- 1 i. p. {{were found to have}} high concentrations of the drug in the CNS compared to plasma (mean brain/plasma ratio 1. 04) whereas animals receiving Trimelamol had consistently low CNS concentrations (mean brain/plasma ratio 0. 08). This difference did not correlate with plasma protein binding which is greater for PMM (68. 2 %) than for Trimelamol (17. 5 %). However, it does appear to be related to lipophilicity. In Phase I clinical trial Trimelamol has proved much less emetic than PMM and causes no acute sedation. It is likely that this reduction in toxicity may be explained by the relatively poor ability of Trimelamol to enter the CNS...|$|E
40|$|Summary PMM is a {{water-soluble}} {{alternative to}} HMM. PMM has been administered as an intravenous infusion to 17 {{patients in a}} Phase I clinical trial. The dose-limiting toxicities were nausea and vomiting which were observed in all patients at 500 mgm- 2 and above. The dose was not escalated above 1300 mg m 2 where nausea and vomiting were severe, prolonged (> 24 h) and poorly controlled by anti-emetics. Haematological, hepatic and renal toxicities were not observed. Neurological toxicity was not observed at low doses (< 500 mg/M 2) but could not be determined at higher doses due to intensive anti-emetic therapy. Pharmacokinetic studies (100 - 500 mgm- 2) indicated that PMM plasma levels are dose-dependent and that the PMM disposition-phase half-life is prolonged in patients with abnormal liver function. It is concluded that the severe toxicity of PMM will limit the clinical utility of this compound and hence Phase II trials are not recommended. <b>Pentamethylmelamine</b> (PMM) (Figure la) is the monodemethylated analogue of hexamethylmelamine (HMM) (Figure lb). HMM is an s-triazine derivative {{which has been in}} clinical use for 15 years. It has shown activity against a numbe...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} a soft agar clonogenic assay for human tumor stem cells provides an in vitro technique {{with a high degree}} of accuracy for predicting in vivo clinical response to standard anticancer drugs. We used this system to conduct an "in vitro phase II trial" in human ovarian cancer and melanoma. This approach can potentially identify active phase I [...] II drugs suitable for treatment of given tumor types for specific patients and eliminates the need to subject patients (who would be predicted not to respond) to toxic side effects. In vitro sensitivity for new agents was operationally defined as at least a 70 % reduction of tumor colony-forming units (TCFU) at concentrations which are readily achievable pharmacologically. The new agents AMSA and vindesine (as well as vinblastine) appeared to have activity in melanoma, while PALA and thymidine were inactive. <b>Pentamethylmelamine,</b> mitomycin C, methyl-GAG, and AMSA were relatively ineffective in ovarian cancer. Vinblastine and vindesine had definite activity. The human tumor stem cell assay may thus provide the basis for a useful alternative to the current clinical phase II testing approach for identifying antitumor activity of new agents. Validation of this concept with correlative in vitro and in vivo phase II trials of new agents in patients with tumor types predicted to be sensitive is clearly warranted...|$|E
