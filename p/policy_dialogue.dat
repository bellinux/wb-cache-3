25|$|During her {{tenure at}} ICANN from 2005-2007, and her {{service to the}} Council of the GNSO (Generic Names Supporting Organization), Bekele was {{instrumental}} in initiating <b>policy</b> <b>dialogue</b> over IDNs as well as developing the framework for leading a language group. Bekele led an active campaign to introduce IDNs under which new Internet Domain names in Arabic, Cyrillic, Russian, Chinese and non-Latin alphabets will become available, thereby providing non-English/non-Latin language native speakers an opportunity to access and communicate on the Internet in their native languages. She forged to form an IDN working group within ICANN to bring the global voices of the IDN stakeholders to ICANN. Bekele was then nominated to chair ICANN’s IDN Working Group at gNSO and was highly influential in drafting the IDN policy guidelines. As a result, Bekele was credited for successfully championing {{the inclusion of the}} global IDN community within this <b>policy</b> <b>dialogue</b> and championing the work of IDNs at ICANN. This global IDN group, which later on organized itself as the International Domain Resolution Union (IDRU) gave a testimonial to Bekele's work over IDNs.

25|$|In , Stiglitz, José Antonio Ocampo (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for <b>Policy</b> <b>Dialogue</b> IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC) and Deepak Nayyar (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) {{discuss the}} current debates on macroeconomics, capital market {{liberalization}} and development, {{and develop a}} new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the Washington Consensus has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith {{in the role of}} markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.|$|E

2500|$|The TICAD {{conferences}} {{were intended}} to help to promote high-level <b>policy</b> <b>dialogue</b> amongst African leaders and their development partners. It emerged in 1993 {{after the end of}} the Cold War in an era of 'aid fatigue' among donor countries, and was critical in regenerating strong donor interest in Africa. TICAD has evolved into a major global forum to promote development on the continent under the principles of African [...] "ownership" [...] and international [...] "partnership." [...] These concepts became essential factors in the launch of the New Economic Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), a strategy for development designed by Africans themselves. Earlier TICAD meetings have also resulted in key outcomes, in particular when Japan is hosting the G8, as it is in 2008. In 2000, for example, Japan hosted the Okinawa G8 Summit and invited leaders from several African countries to attend. Ideas proposed at TICAD II were also taken up by the G8 in the creation of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.|$|E
