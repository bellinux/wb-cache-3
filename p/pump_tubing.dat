25|$|When an open {{collection}} system is used, the pump’s suction can cause milk to overflow {{it into the}} {{collection system}} tubing, which may lead to milk particles being drawn into the pump motor. If milk leaks into the <b>pump's</b> <b>tubing,</b> the tubes should be washed, sterilized and air-dried prior to using the pump again. Failure to thoroughly clean collection tubing may lead to mold growth within the tubing. Some models of pumps have bacteria and overflow filters which prevent milk from entering the tubing.|$|R

40|$|Scale {{deposition}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important and serious problems which water injection systems are generally engaged in. Scale sometimes limits or blocks oil and gas production by plugging the oil-producing formation matrix or fractures and perforated intervals. Scale also deposited in down-hole <b>pumps,</b> <b>tubing,</b> casing flow-lines, heater treaters, tanks and other production equipment and facilities. Scale can occur at /or downstream of any point in the production system, at which super-saturation is generated.

50|$|Many gamers and {{computer}} enthusiasts choose to overclock their CPU(s) and GPU(s) {{in order to}} gain extra performance. The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling to what the original equipment manufacturer shipped their product with, most notably in the case of CPUs. Two types of mainstream cooling exist, air cooling and water cooling. Air cooling, the more common of the two, uses a heat sink often in conjunction with heat pipes or vapor chambers to move heat away from the component and dissipate it into the air. Water cooling is somewhat more complex, it makes use of water blocks, radiators, <b>pumps,</b> <b>tubing</b> and optionally a reservoir. Water removes heat by running water through a block affixed to the component and then allowing the water time in the radiator in order to cool off. Fans are often used to increase a radiator's rate of heat dissipation.|$|R

40|$|A {{quasi-experimental}} {{research design}} {{was used to}} determine the relationship between the flow rate and the delivered temperature of prewarmed crystalloid intravenous solutions when using the Thermal Jacket™, an insulation device designed for intravenous fluid bags, as compared to a conventional blood warming apparatus. One control and three experimental groups were used. Fluids in Group 1 (control group), Group 2, and Group 4 were prewarmed in a microwave oven to 41. 45 ± 1. 05 ° C. Fluids in Group 3 were left near ambient room temperature and measured at 22. 05 ± 0. 45 ° C. Fluids in the control group were infused through a standard intravenous <b>pump</b> <b>tubing,</b> 270 em in length, using no temperature maintenance device. Fluids in Group 2 and Group 3 were delivered through a standard intravenous <b>pump</b> <b>tubing</b> connected to a blood warming coil which was immersed in a water bath blood warmer. The distance from the exit point of the blood warmer to the distal end of the infusion line measured 174 em. Fluids in Group 4 were placed in a Thermal Jacket™ and delivered through standard intravenous <b>pump</b> <b>tubing.</b> After a baseline measurement, temperatures were recorded for all groups at two sites at 10 minute intervals over a 60 minute period. One site was the lower portion of the IV solution bag, and the other site was a point 2 em from the distal end of the infusion set. Temperatures were measured at flow rates of 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1, 000 ml/hr for each group. Analysis of variance showed a highly significant group effect on the delivered temperature. A Bonferroni multiple comparisons test indicated no statistically significant difference between the delivered temperatures of Group 3 (room temperature fluid + blood warmer) and Group 4 (prewarmed fluid + Thermal Jacket™). Group 2 (prewarmed fluid + blood warmer) showed a significantly higher delivered temperature (p 3 ̆c. 05) than the other groups, and the control group (prewarmed + no temperature maintenance device) showed a significantly lower delivered temperature (12. 3 ̆c. 05). Analysis of variance also showed a highly significant flow rate effect on delivered temperature. A Bonferroni multiple comparisons indicated a significant difference (12. 3 ̆c. 05) between the flow rates of 100, 250, 500, and 750 ml/hr, with the higher flow rates resulting in higher delivered temperatures. There was no significant difference noted between the delivered temperatures at 750 and 1, 000 ml/hr.

T-connections in the shunt allowed monitoring of blood pressure via a pressure transducer, intravenous infusion and the insertion of a probe tip into the blood.

40|$|Background. The {{pathophysiology}} {{leading to}} pulmon-ary side effects during haemodialysis and haemo-diafiltration {{is not yet}} fully understood. Chronic microembolization, which can be demonstrated by pulsed Doppler ultrasound, may be one cause. Methods. The study cohort consisted of 24 long-term dialysis patients undergoing haemodialysis (ns 21) and online-haemodiafiltration (ns 3), respectively. The subclavian vein downstream to the venous access was investigated during different phases of the procedure using a 2 -MHz pulsed ultrasound device. Results.

The entire anesthetized mouse was placed in the dose calibrator, and the dispensed radioactivity was confirmed. For imaging, the mouse was then placed in a custom-designed holder [5] and scanned in an Inveon preclinical PET tomograph (Siemens Preclinical Solutions, Knoxville, TN). To properly quantify the total activity in the mouse, attenuation correction was performed.
