40|$|The Greek public {{pensions}} {{system is}} essentially unfunded and it operates on a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> (PAYGO) <b>basis.</b> Serious financial problems are expected after the year 2010, {{and this is}} mainly due to adverse demographic trends. The same problem is faced by most European countries. Reform options range between fully funded schemes that will replace PAYGO systems in the long-run, and mixed (two-tier) systems where a basic provision for old age is financed by pay-as you-go and pensions insofar as they exceed this level have to be covered by capital funding. We adopt the second alternative for Greece, and we prove that the proposed two-tier public pension system is actuarially sound for the period 2000 - 50.

40|$|Due to {{demographic}} change, {{the fiscal}} sustainability of pension schemes financed on a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> (PAYGO) <b>basis</b> is of more interest for policy makers than ever. Unsustainable financing brings along a future burden to pensioners through pension cuts and/or {{to the working}} population through increasing contribution rates. With comparable data about the unfunded accrued-to-date pension liabilities of social security pension schemes soon being available due to a recent update of the international System of National Accounts (2008 SNA), we present a simple framework for accounting of paygo pension schemes using these estimates of accrued-to-date liabilities. Additionally we incorporate another definition of liabilities, the current workers' and pensioners' net liabilities (CWL). Applying this accounting framework using both definitions of liabilities to the Swiss pension scheme (AHV), we show that financing of the AHV is unsustainable. In order to restore fiscal sustainability either {{an increase in the}} contribution rate to 12 percent or a cut in average pension levels of about 38 percent would be necessary...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the choice of}} government expenditure on public goods and transfer payments (in the form of pension) in an overlapping generations model, in which individuals live for two ‘periods’ and expenditure is financed on a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> (PAYG) <b>basis.</b> The condition required for majority support of the social contract involved in the PAYG scheme is established and shown to be independent of tax rates and expenditure levels. The choice of expenditure composition can thus be made conditional on acceptance of the social contract. Two decision mechanisms regarding the choice of government expenditure are considered. The first is positive and involves majority voting {{and the second is}} normative and involves maximizing a social welfare function. In each case the ratio of the transfer payment to public goods expenditure depends, among other things, on the ratio of median to mean income. A reduction in the skewness of the income distribution is associated with a reduction in this ratio, at a decreasing rate.

The model yields a closed-form solu-tion for the majority choice of the ratio of transfer payment to public goods, which depends negatively on the ratio of median to mean income, given parameters regarding preferences, tax, growth and interest rates. Informed by this result, a dataset for demo-cratic countries is examined, suggesting that income inequalities play a minor role in accounting for the substantial variations in the compostion of government expenditure across democratic countries, while di¤erent preferences for public goods resulting from cultural di¤erences {{may be an important}} determinant.

40|$|The ACC is {{currently}} funded on a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> (pay-go) <b>basis.</b> This means that levies on {{participants in the}} scheme cover only its current period operating costs. In the past these costs have been lower than the amount required to fully fund {{the cost of the}} new claims being added to the ACC each year. This has created a $ 7. 5 billion unfunded liability that the government must address as part of any long term reform of the ACC. The introduction of competitive private delivery of the Employers' Account of the ACC requires that all future participation by employers be on a fully funded premium basis. What should the government do with the unfunded liability of the Employers' Account at the time that competition is introduced? This paper argues that if the government wants to create an efficient accident compensation market for employers it should not levy current employers for this unfunded liability. The government should not in any way entangle the funding of past liabilities with the operation of the ongoing competitive market...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to rising}} life {{expectancy}} and declining fertility, the world’s population is ageing rapidly. Not {{only does the}} number of elderly relative {{to the number of}} working-age people increase, so does the proportion of the very old in the general population of the aged. In consequence, government spending on pensions, health care and other services provided for the aged is increasing and has been projected to rise on an even larger scale {{after the turn of the}} century. How can the old-age social expenditures be accommodated into a sustainable path for the general government budget? 2 In most European countries, public outlays allocated to the elderly are financed on a <b>pay-as-you-go</b> (PAYG) <b>basis,</b> i. e. benefits paid to retired people are directly financed by contemporaneous taxes levied on workers. In periods with dramatic swings in the age structure, the tax rate is likely to swing as well. For example, when the population is ageing, the ratio of the number of persons of drawing age to that of those of contributing age increases, and PAYG financing implies an increase in the transfers from young to old. Does that cause generational conflicts, and will the PAYG scheme eventually be undermined?...|$|R

40|$|International audienceToday, {{consumers}} request virtual resources like CPU, RAM, disk (etc.) {{supplied by}} the service providers (like Amazon) and they pay on a " <b>pay-as-you-go</b> " <b>basis.</b> Generally, the supervisors adopt virtualization technologies, which optimize resources usage and limit the operating cost. The virtualiza-tion technologies are classified in two categories. The first one concerns the heavy virtualization, {{which is based on}} virtual machines (VM) concept. Each VM emulates hardware and embeds its own operating system (OS) that is completely isolated from the host OS. The second one concerns the light virtualization, which is based on the management of containers. The containers share the host OS kernel [5] while ensuring isolation. In this paper, we benchmark the performance and the energy consumption of an infrastructure that is based on the software Hadoop regarding the two technologies of virtual-ization. At first, we will identify the points to be improved concerning Hadoop performances and then we will reduce the deployment cost on the cloud. Second, the Hadoop community finds an in-depth study of the resources consumption depending on the environment of deployment. Our experiments are based on the comparison of the Docker technology (light virtualization) and VMware technology R (heavy vir-tualization).

The combina-tion of these two trends, together with generous retirement benefits in many countries, has placed {{social security}} systems around the world under enormous financial stress. Most social security systems face large un-funded liabilities. Without changes in the systems, the prospect is for rap-idly increasing tax rates on the young to pay for benefits for the old.

40|$|Abstract: Application service {{provider}} (ASP) {{is a business}} that makes computer-based services (small and medium sized businesses) available to clients over a network. The usual ASP sells a large application to large enterprises, but also provides a pay-as-you-go model for smaller clients. One of the main problems with ASP is the insufficient security to resist attacks and guarantee pay-as-you-go. Function hiding {{can be used to}} achieve protection for algorithms and assure charging clients on per-usage basis. Encryption functions that can be executed without prior decryption (function hiding protocol) gives good solution to the problems of software protection. Function hiding protocol faces a problem if the same encryption scheme is used for encrypting some data about the function and also the output of the encrypted function. In such case, an attacker could reveal the encrypted data easily thereby comprising its confidentiality. This paper aims to develop a software protection system based on function hiding protocol with software obfuscation that overcomes function hiding protocol problems. The suggested system is a multi-client system that allows charging clients on a per-usage <b>basis</b> (<b>pay-as-you-go)</b> and satisfies both confidentiality and integrity for the ASP and the client.
