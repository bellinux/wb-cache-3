40|$|We {{suggest the}} use of Poisson hidden Markov models (PHMMs) in non life insurance. PHMMs are an {{extension}} of the well-known mixture models and we use them to model the dynamics of overdispersed data, in <b>particular</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> number. PHMMs allow us to explicitly consider unobserved factors influencing the dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> number. This has an immediate impact on the value of the pure risk premium: the expected claim number is given by a weighted average of the intensity parameters of a PHMM. We show how the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of PHMMs may be suitably obtained using the EM algorithm and apply PHMMs t,o model the daily frequencies of injuries in the work place in Lombardia (Italy) ...|$|R
