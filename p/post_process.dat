At that time, Kamalakannan was in Iran finalising the CG stadium and City with Adili. The majority of the film was shot in anamorphic format, but a Super 35 camera gate and lens were used for the stadium episode to minimise distortion. Post-production of the stadium scenes were given to Prasad EFX, and the film set up their own render farm in Chennai. The <b>post</b> <b>process</b> was done in several stages after the scan.

Adili created 3D CG people to fill the CG steps and their actions in a library of 3000 frames.|$|E
500|$|That November, Joe Russo {{stated that}} {{the theme of the}} film was betrayal, calling it [...] "extremely emotional. [...] hinges on that emotion, and on a very {{personal}} level we didn't want [...] to become about politics and people arguing about platitudes. The third act is built around a very personal moment between [...]" [...] The Russos {{spent a great deal of}} time with Markus, McFeely, and Moore to ensure each character's emotional arc tracked through the entire film correctly, though realized that at some point [...] "you have to sacrifice logic for expediency". Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest <b>post</b> <b>process</b> we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months." [...] They also {{stated that the}} film would be doing [...] "a few reshoots" [...] in mid-to-late January.|$|E

40|$|The World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) is {{the global}} {{reference}} frame upon which Global Positioning System (GPS) observations are referenced to. Observations {{in the frame}} are in latitudes, longitudes and ellipsoidal heights. For use in a particular locality, {{it is necessary to}} convert these into the local coordinate system. In Ghana, the datum and ellipsoidal parameters for Ghana War Office and Clarke 1880 are used for the transformation of the GPS coordinates from the WGS 84 datum system to the Ghana National Grid System. This paper therefore examines <b>post</b> <b>processed</b> DGPS data using these two datum and ellipsoidal definitions separately.

It is suggested in [9] to use some interpolation method to fill small holes in the ground truth disparity. Akhavan et al. [10] manually filled in {{the holes in the}} reference disparity map caused by shadows. As shown in the last row of the Fig. 2, <b>post</b> <b>processed</b> disparity maps were manually enhanced using the (1) gradient information to estimate the edges and (2) neighboring disparity values.

The thesis contains a literature review, an analysis of the techniques of several recording engineers and a listening test. The literature review examines the use of effect on vocals in music. The technique analysis makes use of published interviews from the book, The mixing engineers handbook by B. Owsinski, examine the common practice of mixing low-dynamic and is based on the interviews. The results from this analysis produced the mixing constraints for the mixing of the stimuli’s for the listening test. The listening test evaluates five different environments in which vocals have been recorded. The five subjects in the listening test have all a technical audio education. All environments have different acoustical characteristics and include: a church, a song booth, an entrance hall to an apartment, an anechoic chamber and a <b>post</b> <b>processed</b> song booth with ambience effects. The results from the listing test show indications on how humans perceive room size and offer insight into the positive and negative affects of the perceived room size, the amount of volume, intelligibility, reflections and which one of the environment are most and least preferred and why. The conclusion of this thesis is that preliminary findings suggest that there could be an advantage of using room ambience over <b>post</b> <b>processed</b> ambience on lead vocals.

50|$|A sub-surface {{compressive}} {{residual stress}} profile is measured using {{techniques such as}} x-ray diffraction and hardness profile testing. The X-axis is depth in mm or inches and the Y-axis is residual stress in ksi or MPa. The maximum residual stress profile can {{be affected by the}} factors of shot peening, including: part geometry, part material, shot material, shot quality, shot intensity, and shot coverage. For example, shot peening a hardened steel part with a process and then using the same process for another unhardened part could result in overpeening; causing a sharp decrease in surface residual stresses, but not affecting sub-surface stresses. This is critical because maximum stresses are typically at the surface of the material. Mitigation of these lower surface stresses can be accomplished by a multi-stage <b>post</b> <b>process</b> with varied shot diameters and other surface treatments that remove the low residual stress layer.|$|E
