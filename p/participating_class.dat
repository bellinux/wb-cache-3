40|$|Tumor-specific {{activation}} of the TAL 1 gene {{is the most common}} genetic alteration seen in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The TAL 1 gene products contain the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, a protein dimerization and DNA-binding motif common to several known transcription factors. A binding-site selection procedure has now been used to evaluate the DNA recognition properties of TAL 1. These studies demonstrate that TAL 1 polypeptides do not have intrinsic DNA-binding activity, presumably because of their inability to form bHLH homodimers. However, TAL 1 readily interacts with any of the known class A bHLH proteins (E 12, E 47, E 2 - 2, and HEB) to form heterodimers that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The TAL 1 heterodimers preferentially recognize a subset of E-box elements (CANNTG) that can be represented by the consensus sequence AACAGATGGT. This consensus is composed of half-sites for recognition by the <b>participating</b> <b>class</b> A bHLH polypeptide (AACAG) and the TAL 1 polypeptide (ATGGT). TAL 1 heterodimers with DNA-binding activity are readily detected in nuclear extracts of Jurkat, a leukemic cell line derived from a patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Hence, TAL 1 is likely to bind and regulate the transcription of a unique subset of subordinate target genes, some of which may mediate the malignant function of TAL 1 during T-cell leukemogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Cooperative Inquiry is {{a method}} of {{developing}} technology in which children and adults are partners in the design process. Cooperative Inquiry is used to empower children {{in the design of}} their own technology and to design technology that is specific to children’s needs and wants. As Cooperative Inquiry is continually evolving and expanding, we need to consider how researchers can extend this inclusive design approach to working with populations of children with developmental, behavioral, or learning disabilities. In a semester-long case study, we explored the use of Cooperative Inquiry techniques in a classroom setting with middle school age boys with special learning needs, including mild to moderate autism, dyslexia, and attention deficits. The <b>participating</b> <b>class</b> of 10 boys ages 11 - 12 designed a browser-based computer game using Cooperative Inquiry techniques over the course of seven design sessions. Findings include that Cooperative Inquiry techniques require few modifications for use by the population of children with special learning needs.

Through this work, we believe that Cooperative Inquiry’s applicability is broadened to a new population in a classroom setting, and can be used to design more effective technologies for populations of children with special leaning needs in the future.

40|$|The {{findings}} of the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2006 highlighted concerns about support for {{and the quality of}} reading literacy teaching in South African primary schools. In South Africa there is a paucity of research outlining schooling conditions and teachers’ reading literacy teaching practices especially in the Intermediate Phase. The aim of this mixed methods study was to explore schooling conditions and teaching practices for the implementation of the curriculum for Grade 4 learners’ reading literacy development across a range of education contexts. Two research sub-questions explored in two research phases were used to investigate the overall question which was: What influence do schooling conditions and teaching practices have on curriculum implementation for Grade 4 reading literacy? In phase one, PIRLS 2006 principal and teacher questionnaire data were re-classified for secondary analysis according to language of instruction (English First Language or English Additional Language) and the mean performance of each <b>participating</b> <b>class</b> of learners on the PIRLS 2006 international benchmarks and further benchmarks established to reflect the performance of the majority of South African learners. Response distributions on selected classroom level variables detailing teacher characteristics and reading literacy teaching practices as well as selected school level variables describing teaching conditions impacting the teaching of reading literacy were compared across each reclassified benchmark sub-sample. In phase two, six school and teacher case studies were purposively selected from each of the sub-samples to complement and extend the findings from the analysis of the survey data using multiple qualitative data sources. The findings revealed that differences in schooling conditions and teaching practices across the PIRLS achievement spectrum were generally aligned to differences between advantaged, high achieving schools and disadvantaged low-achieving schools. Thus, the study provides insights into the high levels of between-school inequalities for the development of Grade 4 reading literacy and school and classroom level reasons for such inequalities. On the basis of the findings, recommendations for policy, teacher practice and teacher education, and further research are provided. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|The {{data for}} this paper were {{gathered}} {{as part of a}} national survey, funded by the Centre for British Teachers (CfBT), of teachers working in English secondary schools. The aim was to gather self-report data of teachers’ use of and attitudes towards a range of pupil-level attainment and progress data in their day-to-day work as educational practitioners. The survey participants came from a range of schools with different school-level data profiles and also from a range of positions of responsibility, subject backgrounds and length of experience. 40 % of the participating teachers report receiving training on the use of data less frequently than annually. A further 20 % report never having received any training in the use of data during the previous five years. Within this group were approximately 10 % of the participating heads, deputies and assistant heads, 20 % of the middle leaders (Heads of Department and pastoral leaders) and 30 % of the <b>participating</b> <b>class</b> teachers. Staff in senior leadership roles report the highest frequency of professional development in data use. Within this group it is Assistant Headteachers who report a higher frequency of training than their more senior colleagues in Headteacher and Deputy Headteacher positions. This is indicative of a management structure in which Headteachers in English secondary schools generally delegate the day-to-day oversight of data use to junior colleagues in the School leadership team who act as ‘data mangers’ in their schools. There are no significant differences in teachers’ level of confidence in their skills to handle data across gender or part-time/full-time categories, but those who report low levels of confidence in their data skills cite lack of training and time to develop their skills as a major concern together with a feeling that new entrants to the profession are not adequately trained in the use of data. The association between teachers’ self-reported level of understanding of pupil performance data and the frequency of training they receive is moderated by the position of responsibility held. Using classification tree analysis of the survey responses (based on chi-square tests of difference using CHAID techniques) senior leaders divide into three significantly different groups (p< 0. 001) based on the frequency of training they have received. A similar pattern is observed among middle leaders and those with other whole-school responsibilities. For classroom teachers only two significantly different groups emerged based on frequency of training. When examining the association between teachers’ self-reported level of satisfaction with their understanding of data and the frequency of training received teachers at each level of responsibility divide into two significantly different groups. These results may suggest that for classroom teachers the key appears to be receiving training on at least an annual basis to improve both self-reported understanding of data and teachers’ level of satisfaction with their understanding. For teachers with middle or senior leadership positions any frequency of training can {{have a significant impact on}} self-reported understanding of data and levels of satisfaction with understanding...|$|E
