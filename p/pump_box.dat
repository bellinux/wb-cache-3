40|$|The LBL {{formaldehyde}} sampler {{consists of}} two parts: 1) a <b>pump</b> <b>box</b> and 2) a small refrigerator housing sampling bubblers. The <b>pump</b> <b>box</b> contains two pumps, a timer, a flow controller, an electrical cord, and a ten-foot piece of tubing to connect the refrigerator to the <b>pump</b> <b>box.</b> The small refrigerator contains four columns of bubbler sampling trains attached to a metal plate. Two sampling trains each are plumbed in parallel to two sampling ports {{on the back of}} the refrigerator. The two sampling lines supplied are to be attached to these ports to allow two locations to be sampled at once (usually one indoor and one outdoor). The refrigerator also contains a rack for holding bubbler tubes. In the sampling process, air is drawn through a sampling line attached to the fitting at the back of the refrigerator and into a prlmary bubbler containing a trapping solution. This trapping solution can be distilled water or an aqueous solution of some compound that reacts with formaldehyde. From this bubbler the air goes through a second bubbler containing the same trapping solution as the first bubbler. (To maintain sample integrity, all parts that the air sample contacts are made of Teflon, polypropylene, and stainless steel.) The air then goes into the third bubbler, which contains no liquid. This bubbler contains a hypodermic needle that serves as a flow-control orifice. The hypodermic needle, in conjunction with the flow controller in the <b>pump</b> <b>box,</b> ensures a constant a flow rate. The refrigerator contains four columns of these sets of three bubblers. After samples have been collected, the bubbler bottoms are detached and the contents of the first and second bubblers in each column are poured together, capped, and labeled. The use of a refrigerated primary and secondary bubbler whose contents are combined at the end of a sampling period ensures 95 % collection efficiency. After the bubbler tubes are capped and labeled, they are stored either in the rack supplied in the refrigerator or in one of the styrofoam shipping boxes with some frozen blue ice. LBL has found that formaldehyde samples collected in water degrade significantly in a matter of hours if they are not kept cool, whereas refrigerated samples remain stable for as long as a month. Directions are provided for unpacking the apparatus, setting up sampling trains, performing the sampling, procedures after sampling, and shipping samples...|$|E
40|$|H-Canyon {{will begin}} {{dissolving}} High Aluminum - Low Uranium (High Al/Low U) Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF) following approval by DOE which is anticipated in CY 2011. High Al/Low U is an aluminum/enriched uranium UNF with small quantities of uranium relative to aluminum. The maximum enrichment level expected is 93 % {sup 235 }U. The High Al/Low U UNF will be dissolved in H-Canyon in a nitric acid/mercury/gadolinium solution. The resulting solution will be neutralized {{and transferred to}} Tank 39 H in the Tank Farm. To confirm that the solution generated could be poisoned with Gd, neutralized, and discarded to the Savannah River Site (SRS) high level waste (HLW) system without undue nuclear safety concerns the caustic precipitation of simulant solutions was examined. Experiments were performed with three simulant solutions representative of the H-Canyon estimated concentrations in the final solutions after dissolution. The maximum U, Gd, and Al concentration were selected for testing from the range of solution compositions provided. Simulants were prepared in three different nitric acid concentrations, ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 M. The simulant solutions were neutralized to four different endpoints: (1) just before a solid phase was formed (pH 3. 5 - 4), (2) the point where a solid phase was obtained, (3) 0. 8 M free hydroxide, and (4) 1. 2 M free hydroxide, using 50 wt % sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The settling behavior of the neutralized solutions {{was found to be}} slower compared to previous studies, with settling continuing over a one week period. Due to the high concentration of Al in these solutions, precipitation of solids was observed immediately upon addition of NaOH. Precipitation continued as additional NaOH was added, reaching a point where the mixture becomes almost completely solid due to the large amount of precipitate. As additional NaOH was added, some of the precipitate began to redissolve, and the solutions neutralized to the final two endpoints mixed easily and had expected densities of typical neutralized waste. Based on particle size and scanning electron microscopy analyses, the neutralized solids were found to be homogeneous and less than 20 microns in size. The majority of solids were less than 4 microns in size. Compared to previous studies, a larger percentage of the Gd was found to precipitate in the partially neutralized solutions (at pH 3. 5 - 4). In addition the Gd:U mass ratio was found to be at least 1. 0 in all of the solids obtained after partial or full neutralization. The hydrogen to U (H:U) molar ratios for two accident scenarios were also determined. The first was for transient neutralization and agitator failure. Experimentally this scenario was determined by measuring the H:U ratio of the settled solids. The minimum H:U molar ratio for solids from fully neutralized solutions was 388 : 1. The second accident scenario is for the solids drying out in an unagitiated <b>pump</b> <b>box.</b> Experimentally, this scenario was determined by measuring the H:U molar ratio in centrifuged solids. The minimum H:U atom ratios for centrifuged precipitated solids was 250 : 1. It was determined previously that a 30 : 1 H:Pu atom ratio was sufficient for a 1 : 1 Gd:Pu mass ratio. Assuming a 1 : 1 equivalence with {sup 239 }Pu, the results of these experiments show Gd is a viable poison for neutralizing U/Gd solutions with the tested compositions...|$|E

While the maximum limiting temperatures of mechanical seals are known and specified by seal manufacturers, the actual temperatures in the sealing cavity of the <b>pump</b> stuffing <b>box</b> during <b>pump</b> operation are not readily available. A conservative approach has been to provide extra cooling to the stuffing box. However, the availability of clean cooling water is often scarce in many installations, and therefore, knowledge of the thermal behavior of the sealing cavity region becomes important.

40|$|The large {{vacuum vessel}} of the J. E. T. (Joint European Torus) {{experiment}} {{has been designed}} as an all metal composite torus of non-circular cross-section. To comply with mechanical stability and ultra high vacuum requirements it has been designed as a completely welded fabrication. The metal structure consists of 32 rigid and wedge-shaped sections (equal in number to the B TOR field coils) which in turn are joined together by parallel bellows to form a torus. The rigid sectors are of box type construction suitably ribbed to withstand the stresses imposed upon them by the external forces. The bellows linking these rigid sectors determine the electrical resistance of the metallic vacuum vessel the long way around the torus, since currents which are induced in parallel with the plasma current should be kept as low as possible. All forces acting on the vacuum vessel are absorbed by the rigid sectors which also incorporate the openings to {{the interior of the}} machine, such as ports for pumping, diagnostics, auxiliary plasma heating, etc [...] . This toroidal vacuum vessel has been designed as a double walled structure with the bellows linking the rigid sectors being fitted as pairs, and it is proposed to circulate hot inert gas through out this interspace in order to raise the temperature of the whole vacuum vessel to 500 °C to achieve bakeout conditions which will assist in reaching the required base pressure of 10 - 10 torr. In order to protect external apparatus from this bakeout temperature the outside of the vacuum vessel will be thermally insulated. Much consideration has been given to the choice of materials from which to construct this vacuum vessel. Stress conditions at elevated temperatures and electrical requirements indicate {{that one of the most}} suitable materials would be in the high content nickel alloy range. The final choice was to use Inconel 600 (a trade name of Huntington Alloys, USA) or Nicrofer 7216 (a trade name of Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke FRG) for the rigid sectors and Inconel 625 (Nicrofer 6020) for the bellows, the latter material having the required electrical resistivity. The horizontal ports lying on the equitorial plane are connected to <b>pumping</b> <b>boxes</b> which in turn form locations for the turbo molecular and cryopumps. They also provide maximum access to the interior of the vacuum vessel for the beams of energetic neutral particles proposed for additional plasma heating. The vacuum vessel has been so designed that all the stresses are taken by the rigid sectors, whilst the radial inward directed forces are transmitted to and supported by a modular restraint ring which acts as an arch type of structure transmitting pressure forces of 100 tons between adjacent rigid sectors. The forces acting on the vacuum vessel are due to the atmospheric pressure during normal operation and during bakeout operations at 500 °C, the electro magnetic forces due to eddy currents which are induced in the metallic structure when the magnetic fluxes linking the vacuum vessel change with time, and the thermal stresses arising for expansion of the vacuum vessel during the baking and during experimental operation...|$|R

In this design, orifice-injected inert barrier gas between concentric twin seal faces gives rise to hydrostatic action, so that the inner seal face with hydrodynamic lift features upon running can initiate and maintain stable face separation, even at extremely slow speed. The outer plain face seal, by way of higher barrier gas pressure, prevents any process fluid on the outer diameter cavity from leaking or emitting through sealing faces. The twin face design compacting two seals to one seal ring not only reduces greatly the cartridge size so as to fit all <b>pumps</b> without stuffing <b>box</b> modifications, but maintains its dual seal functionality with the single seal simplicity. The hybrid feature combining hydrostatic action for start/stop and slow speed operations, and hydrodynamic action for initiating and maintaining stable face separation not only enhances the sealing performance, but also expands its application ranges.

40|$|The {{deterioration}} of freshly harvested horticultural crops prior to storage can be minimized by rapid pre-cooling. This deterioration occurs for two reasons: (i) the respiration rate is typically high {{due to high}} ambient temperatures at harvest, and (ii) physiological activity of the produce is at peak levels. Thus, precooling is essential. Many precooling techniques {{are used in the}} horticulture industry today. Their main purpose is to rapidly extract heat from the produce by using a suitable fluid for the heat extraction/rejection process. The efficiency of a cooling method depends on many factors: the cooling fluid used, the morphological characteristics of the product, the type and shape of packing, the system design, etc [...] It is therefore relatively difficult to compare the efficiencies of cooling systems or to evaluate the effect of each parameter on system efficiency. A new method for assessing cooling system efficiency was therefore developed. The technique was based on the capacity of the system to maintain the product temperature at the surface as low as possible without affecting the morphological characteristics of the product. It was shown that this method of assessing efficiency was effective under field conditions. A low cost liquid-ice system was designed and tested for broccoli precooling.

Systems for propulsion pto to the running equipment drive and active working bodies of road construction machines are developing {{in the way}} of using three-axis hydraulic drives. When designing a hydraulic system for road construction machinery dividing of power flow from propulsion to the running equipment drive and active working bodies is considered as rather essential problem. Leading companies do not pay attention to the development of flow divider designs, preferring to produce more expensive multi-flow pumps. One of the ways to increase {{efficiency of}} multi-functional road construction machinery is an implementation of running equipment hydraulic driving system based on a mono-aggregate pump unit which consists of a pump and a volumetric divider of power fluid flow. A principle of volumetric division and summing-up of power fluid flows, technical realization and methodology for calculation of key parameters of discrete flow distributors has been developed on the basis of discrete hydraulics regulations. The paper presents results of mathematical modeling of hydraulic systems equipped with the discrete flow distributor. Analysis of a dual-motor hydraulic drive operation has shown the following results: a discrete flow distributor ensures independent load mode of the current consumer circuit operation from the load mode of the second consumer circuit within a wide range of loads; rational value of working fluid flow discretization parameter is the following value interval  k  = 4 – 6, maximum value of parameter efficiency is reached when an angular velocity of a distributor rotor coincides with the angular velocity of a pump shaft; discrete flow distributor provides a possibility to change parameters of hydraulic flow feeding in consumers’ pressure lines within a wide range due to changes in geometrical parameters of the design; discrete flow distributor should be installed either close to the pump or be integrated into its design. The developed mathematical model and methodology for determination of parameters for the discrete flow distributor allow to optimize its design.
