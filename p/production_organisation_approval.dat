30|$|Second, {{knowledge}} <b>production</b> <b>organisations</b> in China {{are composed}} of both universities and research institutes. From the 1950 s to the 1970 s, research institutes {{used to be the}} only sector for research, while universities’ missions were primarily teaching. Being strongly influenced by the Soviet Union, the socialist government established a complex research institute system, the most important one being the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Meanwhile, higher education institutions and faculties were regrouped and aligned according to areas of specialisation. Since the 1980 s, higher education reforms have adopted a model from the United States which emphasises the development of comprehensive and research universities. Thus the Chinese innovation system is referred to as a network consisting of actors like universities, research institutes, government agencies and enterprises. With respect to the Triple Helix model, both universities and research institutes (URIs) represent the spiral of knowledge <b>production</b> <b>organisations.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{most recent}} {{developments}} in the capitalism system, greatly affected by the information and communications technology (ICT) mode of competencies accumulation, has promoted new heterarchical forms of corporate organisation replacing the Chandlerian M-form (of multiple division) (Hedlund, 1992; Ridderstråle, 1992). The heterarchical logic promotes an efficient intra-firm organisational form rooted on flexible managerial roles and developing an interdependent intra-firm network. This tendency towards a more heterarchical relationship between headquarter and subsidiaries {{seems to have been}} combined with a flatter organisation where interactions between firm divisions and top management become stronger (Mazzanti et al., 1992). In the sphere of production, this has been reflected in the shift from old models of <b>production</b> <b>organisation</b> to new models centred on the conception of the firm as a learning organisation (Penrose, 1958). Post-fordist models of <b>production</b> <b>organisation</b> (such as the Swedish (Berggren, 1992) and Japanese (Aoki, 1988) model) are based upon functional flexibility made operational through the active involvement of workers in production activity. Similarly, in the development of new technology, increasing complexity calls for an in-depth understanding of the innovation process, which can effectively take place through an active participation of workers in the learning path (Coriat, 2002).

40|$|The {{study of}} {{operations}} strategy (OS) in <b>production</b> <b>organisations</b> has largely {{focused on the}} content of highlevel strategies, and less on their practical enactment. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the middle managers who mediate the space between the strategic intent of <b>production</b> <b>organisations</b> and their operational realities. The role and strategic agency of such managers has been shown to be influential in shaping, impeding and enabling OS, but they remain surprisingly absent from much project organisation literature. In this paper, we examine the role of middle managers in OS practice via a Strategy-as-Practice framework. We study two project-based organisations, one in Denmark and one in UK, developing lean production processes. In the Danish case, the change strategy was initiated bottom-up from the project actors, whereas in the UK, the change strategy was imposed top-down as a strategic management initiative. In both cases, middle managers played a crucial role in mediating and translating intention. We show how strategy praxis, and the leadership of operations, is highly distributed within project-based organisations regardless of where change is initiated from. The findings have resonances for theory on the agency of middle managers, and for the understanding of micro activities of OS formulation and implementation within project-based forms of organisation...|$|R
