5|$|A typhoon was {{observed}} on October13 east of Guam, which moved generally northwestward for three days; then, it recurved to the northeast, and was last reported on October18. Another typhoon originated southeast of Guam on October19. It moved generally westward toward the Philippines before curving {{more to the}} north on October24. The track shifted to the northeast, and the typhoon <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> Japan and the Bonin Islands. It was last observed on October30.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen years <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> {{the first}} {{publication}} of Scouting for Boys {{and the creation}} of the current largest supranational Scout organization, WOSM, and millions of copies had been sold in dozens of languages. By that point, Scouting was the purview of the world's youth, and several Scout associations had already formed in many countries.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{ground and}} {{satellite}} based imagery, radar, and lidar {{can be used}} to detect ash clouds. This information is <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> meteorological agencies, volcanic observatories and airline companies through Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC). There is one VAAC for each of the nine regions of the world. VAACs can issue advisories describing the current and future extent of the ash cloud.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, Great Britain and France had a {{territorial}} dispute over Saint Lucia. Control of Saint Lucia <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> British and French possession an estimated 14 separate times. The nation finally {{ended up in}} the United Kingdom's possession in 1814. The United Kingdom granted Saint Lucia self rule in 1967, and eventually granted the nation independence in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Later events, {{such as the}} Boston Tea Party, further {{illustrated}} the crumbling relationship between Britain and its colonies. Although five years <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> the massacre and outright revolution, and direct connections between the massacre and the later war are (according to historian Neil Langley York) somewhat tenuous, it is widely perceived as a significant event leading to the violent rebellion that followed.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) {{typically}} {{store their}} genomes {{on a single}} large, circular chromosome. Similarly, some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular chromosome with {{a small number of}} genes. Prokaryotes sometimes supplement their chromosome with additional small circles of DNA called plasmids, which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals. For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can be <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> individual cells, even those of different species, via horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

Codenamed Checkpoint Alpha, {{this was the}} first of three Allied checkpoints on the road to Berlin. The others were Checkpoint Bravo, where the autobahn crossed from East Germany into West Berlin, and most famous of all, Checkpoint Charlie, the only place where non-Germans could cross from West to East Berlin.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} {{split into two}} blocks: A and B. Block A was sited near Lime Grove and housed {{personnel}} accommodation and administrative services, while Block B was protected by brick walls and military police since it contained the codebreaking computers. The public footpath <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> the two blocks. The level of security meant that support staff in the administrative block {{did not know of}} the activities in Block B, nor did local residents.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tropical}} depression formed east of Guam on July21. It tracked westward, passing near the island on July23, and later shifted {{more to the}} west-northwest. On July26, a ship reported a low pressure of , indicating that the system was a typhoon. The system later <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> the Philippines and Taiwan as it entered the South China Sea, but no land areas reported strong winds, suggesting the typhoon was either very small or had weakened from its peak. On July29, the typhoon made landfall between Hong Kong and Shantou in southeastern China, quickly dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark {{were behind}} on the series from the start. After several late issues, the team announced a four-month hiatus between issues 21 and 22 to allow Lark {{to get ahead of}} schedule. They said they would not solicit any additional issues until the next story arc was completed, and the hiatus actually lasted six months, in part because of miscommunication between Image Comics and Diamond Distribution. During the hiatus, they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five months <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E

5|$|On August 12, a {{tropical}} wave organized to {{a tropical}} depression about 930miles (1,495km) east-southeast {{of the island}} of Barbados. Operationally, the system was not detected until August 14, and it was {{believed to have been}} an area of low pressure when it moved through the eastern Caribbean. It moved to the west-northwest, and it slowly organized to a minimal tropical storm on August 14. Although Hurricane hunters reported winds of hurricane force in squalls, the system was discounted as an easterly wave. On August 15, Tropical Storm Charlie quickly intensified, attaining maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h) after passing through the Lesser Antilles. The small center of circulation <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> Dominica and Guadeloupe in the early morning hours.|$|E
5|$|On December19, a {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Diego Garcia, which initially tracked to the south-southeast {{before turning to}} the southwest. Later that day, the system intensified to moderate tropical storm status, prompting the Mauritius Meteorological Service to name it Bakoly. The storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone, reaching peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) on December23. After maintaining that intensity for about 12hours, Bakoly weakened below cyclone status as it turned to the south-southeast. On December25, the storm <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> Réunion and Mauritius, and later resumed its south-southwest trajectory. After executing a small loop, Bakoly turned to the southeast and dissipated on December30.|$|E
5|$|On July 10—when {{the storm}} was {{approaching}} or at its peak intensity with winds of —the Bowditch encountered severe hurricane conditions which destroyed both of her masts and washed her entire crew overboard. Her captain was able to climb back aboard, where he survived for over a week with no food or water until he was rescued by a schooner. The Echo and Creole both sustained significant damage, and the crew and captain of the latter ship had to be rescued after she began taking on water. The extent of {{the damage to the}} three ships served as the basis for evaluating the storm's intensity in Partagás's paper. The hurricane ultimately <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> Bermuda and the United States before dissipating after July 12.|$|E

5|$|Seiken Densetsu 3 {{has similar}} {{gameplay}} to its predecessor, Secret of Mana. Like many other role-playing {{games of the}} 16-bit era, the game displays a top-down perspective, in which the three player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Control may be <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> each of the characters at any time; the companions not currently selected are controlled by artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by two players, {{as opposed to the}} three of Secret of Mana. There are six possible player characters. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses which three of them will be playable and which one they will start with; the other two playable characters will join the party when met. The remaining three characters act as non-playable characters (NPCs) when encountered.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus again {{attempted}} to marry into the Julio-Claudian family. Having divorced Apicata two years earlier, he requested marriage with Drusus's widow Livilla in AD 25, possibly {{with an eye}} towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, {{in the position of}} a potential successor. The emperor denied this request, warning Sejanus that he was in danger of overstepping his rank. Alarmed by this sudden denigration, Sejanus changed his plans and began to isolate Tiberius from Rome. By fueling his paranoia towards Agrippina and the Senate, he induced the emperor to withdraw to the countryside of Campania, which he did in AD 26, and finally to the island of Capri, where he lived until his death in AD 37. Guarded by the Praetorians, Sejanus easily controlled all information that <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> Tiberius and the capital.|$|E
5|$|The South Indian {{convergence}} zone spawned a circulation that organized into a tropical {{depression in the}} Mozambique Channel on January9. It gradually intensified while moving to the southwest, developing spiral rainbands. On January11, Elinah <b>passed</b> <b>between</b> Anjouan and Mohéli in the Comoros archipelago. The next day, JTWC upgraded the storm to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, although land interaction with Mozambique weakened Elinah. After it turned to the south and moved away from the coast, the storm re-intensified, and MFR estimated Elinah reached peak winds of 115km/h (70mph) on January14. Subsequently, the {{convergence zone}} caused the storm to weaken, ultimately absorbing it by January16.|$|E
