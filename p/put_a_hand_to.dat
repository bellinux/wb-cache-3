60|$|Colonel Mant {{cleared his}} throat again and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his mustache.|$|E
60|$|He beat at {{the arms}} of his chair and then <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his throat.|$|E
60|$|Then he roused {{himself with}} a {{profound}} sigh, and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his cut and bruised cheek.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I was not," [...] she answered, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her head. [...] "Begin again, {{and let me}} look at {{something}} else. Stay! Now tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to-night, of course;--but after I am gone to-morrow. They'll {{leave them}} there without <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> them, if you don't speak. I must be off before breakfast to-morrow." ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Gospel Plow" [...] {{title is}} also shown as a {{reference}} to Luke 9:62: [...] "No one who <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the plow and looks back is fit for service {{in the kingdom of}} God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was meditating," [...] {{she replied}} coldly, as she {{smoothed}} down her skirts and mechanically <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her hair, lest a curl had gone astray.|$|E
60|$|He made a {{pretense of}} leaving, and he <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his pocket {{as if to}} insure the safety of some article. Columbine blushed. She held out her hands. She was repentant of her words and curious as to his.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia did not faint, {{being made}} of sterner substance. Gently, but with that inexorable {{instinct}} of her kind which compels {{them to look}} for reliance within themselves even in the direst of extremities, Cynthia released herself from Susan's embrace and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her forehead.|$|E
60|$|He bent lower, murmuring incoherently, and she <b>put</b> up <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> pat his swarthy bearded cheek.|$|R
60|$|He <b>put</b> forth <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> {{touch her}} arm, and she drew it {{back as if}} his fingers were of fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are they?" [...] She <b>put</b> <b>a</b> {{trembling}} <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> them. [...] "He--he struck me.... That's nothing... But you--you {{have saved}} me--from God only knows what!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But--" [...] She stopped, and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her throat; {{she looked}} as if she would stifle. She sank to her knees beside him, and caught his hand in both her own that were trembling. [...] "Oh, you can't believe it! Captain Tremayne is not the man to do a murder." ...|$|E
60|$|And Sir Rowland, realizing, too, by {{now that}} here was no ghost, {{recovered}} his lost courage. He <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his sword, then withdrew it, leaving the weapon sheathed. Here was a hangman's job, not a swordsman's, he opined--and wisely, for he had had earlier experience of Mr. Wilding's play of steel.|$|E
60|$|Succinctly now Captain Blood dispelled {{the mystery}} by a {{relation}} of the facts. It was a narrative that painted red and white by turns the Spaniard's countenance. He <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> {{the back of his}} head, and there discovered, in confirmation of the story, a lump as large as a pigeon's egg. Lastly, he stared wild-eyed at the sardonic Captain Blood.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{her coming}} I {{turned to go}} within, and I would have passed her without a word, but that she <b>put</b> forth <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> detain me.|$|R
6000|$|Wilfred <b>put</b> <b>a</b> weak <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his head, {{and asked}} in a low voice: [...] "How {{did you know that}} his hat looked like a green beetle?" ...|$|R
60|$|Gonzaga saw {{a sudden}} flash of steel before his eyes, and a {{piercing}} scream broke {{from him as}} Gian Maria's dagger buried itself in his breast. Too late Guidobaldo <b>put</b> forward <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stay the Duke.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is naught; it is past," [...] she said. But even as {{she spoke}} she <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her brow. [...] "I am {{something}} dizzy. My condition--" [...] She faltered on a trembling note of appeal that increased their compassion, and aroused in them a shame of their own harshness. [...] "Leave this security with me. I will subscribe it in the morning--indeed, as soon as I am sufficiently recovered." ...|$|E
60|$|This day Lenore Anderson {{had seemed}} a bewildering {{fulfilment}} of the sweetness {{he had imagined}} was latent in her. She had meant what was beyond him to understand. She had gently <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his lips, to check the bitter words, and he had dared to kiss her soft fingers. The thrill, the sweetness, the incomprehensible and perhaps imagined response of her pulse would never leave him. He watched the big car until {{it was out of}} sight.|$|E
6000|$|The lady's-maid, thus {{suddenly}} {{pulled up}} in a night forage after lovers, <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her forehead {{to show that there}} was no mistake about her having begun to meditate on receiving orders to that effect, and said at last, 'You once told me, ma'am, if you recollect, that when you were dressed, I was not to go staring out of the window after you as if you were a doll I had just manufactured and sent round for sale.' ...|$|E
60|$|Slone sat up. The {{smoke was}} {{clearing}} away. Little curves of burning grass were working {{down along the}} rim. He <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> grasp Lucy, remembering in a flash. He pointed to the ledge across the chasm.|$|R
60|$|The {{facts of}} this case were known far and wide. The Portuguese Governor was acquainted with them, {{as well as the}} ministers of justice, but no one <b>put</b> forth <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> punish the monster, or to protect his slaves.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jenkins {{got to his}} feet, in a slow, foolish fashion. He <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stay his lordship. The lady, in the background, {{looked on}} with wide eyes, very breathless, one <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her bosom as if to control its heave.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{that is the}} truth," [...] said he. [...] "I am fery prave myself, and pold as a lions. But {{to stand}} up there--and you ken naething of fence!--the way that you did, I declare it was peyond me. And I am sorry for the plow; though I declare I pelief your own was the elder brother, and my heid still sings with it. And I declare if I had kent what way it wass, I would not <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> such a piece of pusiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|As I called, to my immense surprise, one of {{the smooth}} round {{boulders}} on the hillside seemed slowly to uncurl, and to peer about it cautiously. Then it raised itself in the slant sunlight, <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> its eyes, and gazed out upon me with a human face for a moment. After that it descended, step by step, among the other stones, with a white object in its arms. As the boulder uncurled and came to life, I was aware, by degrees... yes, yes, it was Hilda, with Tant Mettie's baby! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has only}} one fault. As a rule, the cooks are {{expected}} to help get up the anchor and sails, but he will not <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> sailors' work. He says that a cook must not have a rough hand, but {{that it should be}} as soft as a woman's. Personally, I believe that is all nonsense. However, as we have a fairly strong crew, I do not press him on the subject; though sometimes, when I tail on to a rope myself, and see him leaning quietly against his galley smoking his pipe, I am inclined to use strong language." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You might ha' seen I warn't able to start,' rejoined his father; 'I'm on {{the wrong}} side of the road, and backin' into the palin's, and all manner of unpleasantness, and yet you von't <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> help me. I'm ashamed on you, Samivel.' ...|$|R
60|$|For a {{full minute}} they stood staring at each other, without a word. The light of the lamp hurt Molly's eyes. She <b>put</b> up <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> shade them. The silence was oppressive. It seemed to Molly {{that they had been}} {{standing}} like this for years.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{full minute}} after Jimmy's first exclamation of {{surprise}} before either of them spoke again. The light of the torch hurt Molly's eyes. She <b>put</b> up <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> shade them. It {{seemed to her that}} they had been standing like this for years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Francis, [...] "it {{remains to}} be seen whether this whole affair is not a most unworthy fraud. The {{circumstances}} are inexplicable--I had almost said incredible; and until I see a little more daylight, and some plausible motive, I confess I should be very sorry to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the transaction. I appeal to you in this difficulty for information. I must learn what is at the bottom of it all. If you do not know, cannot guess, or are not at liberty to tell me, I shall take my hat and go back to my bank as I came." ...|$|E
60|$|Since that sad {{day when}} the good mother had blessed them for the last time, there had been little time for anything. Patience {{had to be the}} busy little housewife, and what she would have done without Steadfast she could not tell. Jeph would never <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> what he called maids' work, but Stead would sweep, or beat the butter, or draw the water, or chop wood, or hold the baby, and was always ready to help her, even though it {{hindered}} him from ever going out to fish, or play at base ball, {{or any of the other}} sports the village boys loved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Francis, [...] "it {{remains to}} be seen whether this whole affair is not a most unworthy fraud. The {{circumstances}} are inexplicable - I had almost said incredible; and until I see a little more daylight, and some plausible motive, I confess I should be very sorry to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the transaction.

6000|$|Hesitatingly, [...] "N-no, I suppose not." [...] Then, {{with feeling}} and admiration, [...] "And yet, {{when it comes}} to judiciousness in {{watering}} <b>a</b> stock or <b>putting</b> up <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> skin Wall Street I don't give in that YOU need any outside amateur help, if I do wish I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then she's a lying, {{deceitful}} hussy, and she's made {{a fool of}} all of us. I {{give you}} my word of honour that she told us she was married; I'll fetch you the letter.' Mrs Griffith rose from her chair, but Miss Reed <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stop her.|$|R
60|$|Farnese made a gurgling {{sound and}} <b>put</b> <b>a</b> jewelled <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his throat {{as if he}} choked. He was all in green velvet, and every button of his doublet was a {{brilliant}} of price; and that gay raiment by its incongruity seemed to heighten {{the tragedy of the}} moment.|$|R
