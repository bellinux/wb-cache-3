There {{is a need to}} formalise the <b>progressive</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> release of an engineering model to production functions during New Product Introduction (NPI) via defining key stages of definition maturity and information requirements through a structured process. This research develops a framework to facilitate optimal <b>Design</b> for Manufacture <b>and</b> Assembly (DfMA) based on current manufacturing capabilities within the aerospace industry, promoting effective knowledge management at all stages of design definition. The framework was developed through the accomplishment of a series of objectives: (1) Investigate optimal DfMA principles and process capability analysis through a comprehensive literature review, (2) capture the current practice of progressive drawing release in the aerospace and automotive sectors, (3) create a route map of the release process built around the optimal critical path, (4) define roles and procedures to follow at each stage and (5) validate the proposed process framework through expert opinion. These objectives were achieved through the adoption of a four-stage qualitative methodology. The framework promotes the understanding and identification of the major stages, activities, responsibilities and information requirements throughout a structured design release process where quantified manufacturing capability data is incorporated within early design definition activities. Adherence to the process route-map ensures that no engineering model is released that cannot be realised by manufacturing and assembly functions. This facilitates the efficient organisation of information on an optimal concurrent engineering platform, leading to a reduction in product development leadtimes and re-work through informed design...|$|R

40|$|Icons are {{symbols that}} can be used to {{represent}} actions or operations <b>and</b> that are <b>designed</b> to convey ideas of information in a non-verbal manner. The use of icons continues to gain popularity in modern human-computer interfaces. This research focuses on a model for evaluating and understanding the appropriateness of computer icons. A hierarchical model has been built for appropriateness. The hierarchical model breaks down the appropriateness into two main components: the functional and non- functional components. The functional components are related to the intended meaning or function implied by the icon. The non-functional components are related to other aspects such as <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>familiarity.</b> Another objective of the research was to evaluate the effects of the functional components, which are considered to be appropriate by its prospective users. The component functions of each icon were broken into elements and tested using Hong Kong Chinese subjects. The results of the questionnaires show that element 1 (action) significantly contributes to the meaning and appropriateness of icons. The results show that an icon could have symbols in different forms, layouts, languages and modes (Chinese, English, alphanumeric, pictorial, combined) and will still be considered appropriate by its users if element- 1 is well represented. This research can be very useful for icon designers. Knowing the critical elements of an icon will help to better <b>design</b> icons <b>and</b> thereby be more suitable for their prospective users...|$|R

This {{can be attributed to the}} complexities of the cloning process, which may require many weeks of <b>progressive</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> experimentation. To address this issue, we incorporated an immersive 12 -week undergraduate research experience into an upper-level molecular microbiology course. Students completed two 6 -week modules where the entire molecular cloning process was carried out for two sets of novel genes implicated in distinct biological processes, microbial cell division and bacterial pathogenesis. The first module trained students in molecular cloning experimental skills, and the second facilitated the application of these skills within a new biological context. Students <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> optimized primers targeted against specific genes, andthen PCR amplified, purified, and quantified the DNA of their gene of interest. Using a variety of strategies, students inserted these genes into expression plasmids to produce GFP and His-tag fusion proteins; this was tested through restriction digestion or colony PCR and verified by gel electrophoresis. At the end of each module, students were assessed on comprehension of biological concepts, professional laboratory note-keeping and scientific communication, and proficiencies in experimental procedures. The recombinant plasmids produced by the students directly contributed to ongoing research projects, and the molecular cloning skills learnt are applicable to many career and study options in molecular biology. Overall, this research experience trained students in professional molecular biology and microbiology practice and engages them in producing real-world research outcomes...|$|R

But are there theoretical limits with political implications to this anthropocentric understanding of our engagement with users, technology and the artifacts we call computers? Has the end user been patronised by contemporary <b>progressive</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> taken hostage by neo-liberal capitalism? In sociology it is becoming clear that society is not just social, but also material. The neglected objects strike back. Just think of global environmental crises. With design research it might be just the same. We know design cannot be reduced to the shaping of dead objects, as in object oriented programming, but humans are neither users living external to objects. Where sociology have had to acknowledge that society is a collective of humans <b>and</b> non-humans, <b>design</b> might have to do away with both users and objects to remain socially and politically relevant. This talk explores the consequences of replacing the object and the user with the thing. Etymologically the thing was originally not an objective matter, but a political assembly dealing with matters of concern. Which humans and non-humans should be invited to participate in contemporary design things? Who invites? Who is marginalised or excluded? What issues should be dealt with?

40|$|Though no {{comprehensive}} {{study has been}} made of them previously, the post-war Hertfordshire Schools are well known for <b>progressive</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> for pioneering prefabrication on a large scale. In Part 1 the background to Hertfordshire's building programme is examined {{in the light of the}} 1944 Education Act and post-war population growth coupled with severe shortages of conventional building materials and labour. Part 2 explores Hertfordshire's response to this challenge: rejecting the use of war-time hutting for new primary schools, construction offering more permanency, <b>and</b> freedom to <b>design</b> a proper teaching environment was sought. A prototype was built and a vital process of "development," informing both construction <b>and</b> <b>design,</b> emerges as the key to progress. The process is shown to have begun with the adoption of a set of novel, but existing, building components; continuing analysis, modification and selective substitution led to the evolution of an integrated constructional system. Close collaboration with both clients and manufacturers ensured that optimum fitness-for-purpose in relation to cost was achieved. The interest created by this new type of architecture is discussed before turning, in Part 3, to its extension to the more complex needs of secondary schools and colleges. It is shown that once the approach was established the main challenge was organisational; alternative materials and modules, together with internal questionings of its validity in changing conditions, were all absorbed by the development process. The approach was emulated by others who introduced the consortium idea to ensure economical component manufacture; the period reviewed ends with the formation of the South Eastern Architects Collaboration (SEAC). It is strikingly clear that the influence of modernist architectural precepts, per se, was negligible. Yet by a remorseless objectivity of design the schools achieved, perhaps uniquely, the fullest realisation of Modern Movement principles, a matter of significance to architectural history...|$|R

Downing 2 ̆ 7 s architectural principles of fitness, expression and style were not new.

The authority of Downing the architect, and his enduring relevance, resides in the floor plans he <b>designed,</b> <b>and</b> the way he integrated types that others had seen as distinct. Their moral charge and response to situation are factors supporting his direction for American housing expectations.
