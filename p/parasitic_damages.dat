40|$|Abstract: Beaked whales or ziphiids are {{the least}} known cetaceans, and are among the least studied of all {{mammalian}} groups. In August and September of 2002, a male and a female beaked whale stranded alive on the Argentine coast, 110 km away from each other. The specimens died shortly after the stranding and their bodies were collected for dissection and analysis. The specimens were identified as belonging to the genus Mesoplodon. Further measurements of the skulls, shape and location of teeth as well as molecular analyses of the mtDNA control region and cytochrome b, allowed unambiguous identification of both specimens as Hector’s beaked whale, Mesoplodon hectori. The color pattern was different between male and female. Standard length was 3. 94 meters for the male and 3. 84 meters for the female. The female’s vertebral formula was C 7 + T 10 + L 11 + Ca 21 = 49. Histo-pathological analysis of the female revealed the presence of Sarcocystis sp. in the skeletal muscle, and lung lesions related to <b>parasitic</b> <b>damage</b> and pneumonia or chronic infection.

40|$|The trematode, Fasciola hepatica, is a {{cosmopolitan}} parasite of temperate regions that can infect {{a wide variety}} of wild and domestic mammalian species, including man. Host-responses differ amongst different species and this article focuses on the contrast between cattle and sheep, the two classes of livestock in which fasciolosis assumes the greatest economic importance. In the sheep, acute fasciolosis resulting from parenchymal damage to the liver and haemorrhage caused by migrating juvenile flukes is a severe and potentially fatal disease. In contrast, the parenchymal stages have limited effects in cattle and the acute form of the disease is extremely rare. Though there is no evidence for a functional, acquired immune response to Fasciola hepatica, cattle provide a less hospitable environment, probably due to the profound changes in parasitised bile ducts, which render them as unsuitable habitats for feeding fluke. Consequently, in untreated cattle, many liver fluke die within 18 months of infection, though some can survive for 2 years or more. In the sheep, essentially, the fluke can live as long as the sheep; up to 11 years has been reported. These differences lead to the need for different treatment approaches in cattle and sheep with respect to juvenile fluke, but do also provide some opportunities for novel control approaches, based on the relative tolerance of cattle and their ability to limit <b>parasitic</b> <b>damage</b> to the liver parenchyma...|$|R

40|$|Environmentally-related wear {{conditions}} and pathologies affecting the dentition of fossil lungfish from freshwater deposits in Australia have been analysed and compared with similar {{changes in the}} dentition of the living Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri. Fossil populations from the Namba, Etadunna, Wipajiri and Katipiri formations in central Australia, and the Carl Creek Limestone and the Camfield beds in northern Australia were assessed. Tooth plates from populations of living lungfish from the Brisbane River and Enoggera Reservoir in southeast Queensland were analysed for comparison. Tooth plates were measured to determine the numbers of different age groups in each population. They were assessed for abrasion, attrition, spur and step wear, erosion and caries, and for trauma and pathological conditions such as malocclusion, hyperplasia, abscesses, osteopenia and <b>parasitic</b> <b>damage.</b> All of these conditions {{are related to the}} environment where the fish lived, are found in living members of the group, and can be compared directly with those of fossil relatives. The results suggest that some of the fossil populations were at risk before climatic changes late in the Cainozoic destroyed their habitats. Some fossil lungfish populations, such as those of the Wipajiri Formation, exhibit active spawning and recruitment, good growth rates and a low incidence of disease and environmentally related damage to the tooth plates. Others, like those of the Katipiri and Namba Formations, include no young, and the adult fish were ageing and show environmentally-related damage to the dentition. Etadunna lungfish had active recruitment, but the tooth plates show a high incidence of attrition and caries. Riversleigh lungfish were actively spawning but did not grow large. Tooth plates from this latter deposit have a high incidence of pathological conditions. Fish from the Camfield Beds, where food was severely limiting, had little serious pathology but high levels of caries. Pathologies among living lungfish are common, but fossil fish were comparatively healthy, with few serious dental problems. Information from studies of fossil lungfish confirms that conservation of the few living species of lungfish depends on the maintenance of clean environments that provide adequate supplies of food and suitable sites for spawning and for the growth of young fish...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{response}} to nematode parasitism Phytoparasitic nematodes parasitise plants to seek suitable food. This food source is basically plant cell contents. Thus a plant {{response to}} parasitism is {{the reaction to}} cellular feeding of the nematode. All phytonematodes possess a stylet {{which is used to}} puncture the cell walls, a set of oesophageal glands which empty into the anterior region of the oesophagus, and a muscular pump-like organ between the stylet and intestine. Many plant <b>parasitic</b> nematodes <b>damage</b> plant cells to various degrees by removing cell contents or by inducing cell lysis. In the group of more sophisticated nematode parasites, the plant is induced to form specific sites consisting of specialised nutritive cells upon which the nematode feeds. Besides the changes induced in the plant cells by the penetration of the nematode, there are frequently effects on cells further away from the parasite. Certain nematodes induce pronounced alteration in the growth of their host such as stunting and swelling of lucerne shoots by the stem nematode, or the galling of tomato roots by root knot nematode...|$|R

40|$|During a nine-year-period ca. 100 provenances of Pinus contorta were {{investigated}} annually {{with respect to}} different kinds of <b>damage.</b> primarily by <b>parasitic</b> fungi. <b>Damage</b> to Pinus contorta occurred mainly during the first ten years after planting. northern provenances of Pinus contorta were generally more resistant to pathogens than southern provenances. Weather damage occurred almost every year among trees of southern and coastal provenance. Trees of northern provenance also suffered from weather damage due to temperature oscillations during shoot elongation. Severe weather damage predisposed to infection by secondary pathogens. primarily Gremmeniella abietina. Even northern provenances of Pinus contorta were infected by Phacidium infestans in high-altitude stands in northern Sweden. Snow blight infection was. however. of less importance to lodgepole pine than to Scots pine. owing to the rapid early growth of the former.

40|$|Nonlinear optical {{methods are}} {{becoming}} ubiquitous {{in many areas}} of modern photonics. They are, however, often limited to a certain range of input parameters, such as pulse energy and average power, since restrictions arise from, for example, <b>parasitic</b> nonlinear effects, <b>damage</b> problems and geometrical considerations. Here, we show that many nonlinear optics phenomena in gaseous media are scale-invariant if spatial coordinates, gas density and laser pulse energy are scaled appropriately. We develop a general scaling model for (3 + 1) -dimensional wave equations, demonstrating the invariant scaling of nonlinear pulse propagation in gases. Our model is numerically applied to high-order harmonic generation and filamentation as well as experimentally verified using the example of pulse post-compression via filamentation. Our results provide a simple recipe for up-or downscaling of nonlinear processes in gases with numerous applications {{in many areas of}} science.

40|$|More than 1800 phanerogamic parasites {{have been}} {{recorded}} throughout the world. Among the most important are the parasitic figworts or Scrophulariaceae, which are economically damaging root parasites. The genus Striga, with more than 50 species, belongs to this family; however, only a few are completely <b>parasitic</b> and <b>damaging</b> to their hosts. Undoubtedly, the major species are S. hermonthica-a widespread and important pest of cereals in Af r ica-and S, asiatica, an important pest both in Asia and in eastern and southern Africa. Although precise estimates of crop loss are difficult to make and data are incomplete, {{it is well known}} that severe losses, amounting in many seasons to total crop failure, are caused by these parasitic weeds. However, there is still a general lack of awareness of the magnitude and importance of the problem. These Proceedings bring together the results of discussions held at Ouagadougou, Upper Volta, in October 1981, where the latest research findings and proposals for further research were presented. They highlight the important advances made in knowledge of the pest species, methods of control, and techniques for breeding for resistance to these noxious weeds. It is hoped that this publication will prompt increased effort to be focused on methods of combat ing Striga and reducing the serious losses it causes to cereal production, and on strengthening links between scientists working in numerous programs to produce solutions to outstanding research roblems...|$|R
40|$|CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) {{were chosen}} as sensor {{technology}} for the vertex detectors of STAR, CBM and the upgraded ALICE-ITS. They also constitute a valuable option for tracking devices at future e+e- colliders. Those applications require a substantial tolerance to both, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. To allow for a focused optimization of the radiation tolerance, prototypes are tested by irradiating the devices either with purely ionizing radiation (e. g. soft X-rays) or the most pure sources of non-ionizing radiation available (e. g. reactor neutrons). In the second case, it is typically assumed {{that the impact of}} the parasitic γ-rays found in the neutron beams is negligible. We checked this assumption by irradiating MAPS with γ-rays and comparing the radiation damage generated with the one in neutron irradiated sensors. We conclude that the parasitic radiation doses may cause non-negligible radiation damage. Based on the results we propose a procedure to recognize and to suppress the effect of the related <b>parasitic</b> ionizing radiation <b>damage.</b> Comment: 3 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Coat {{damage has}} been {{reported}} frequently in captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), {{and it is a}} serious health problem because the hair coat functions as an anatomic and physiologic barrier between the animal and the environment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the pathogenesis of coat damage in this species and to exclude the most frequent causes of alopecia. The investigation included clinical, hematologic, bacteriologic, mycologic, parasitologic, and histopathologic evaluations. A broad systematic dermatologic investigation was performed on 156 rhesus macaques, kept under variable environmental conditions, at the German Primate Center, Göttingen. In addition, 27 animals from other primate facilities were incorporated into the study. Clinically, 126 animals showed partial alopecia of varying severity, with complete alopecia in the worst cases. In 88 % of the cases, the disorder was bilaterally symmetrical. The back and extremities were most commonly affected. No gross clinical changes of the skin surface were detected. Histologic changes consisted predominantly of mild epidermal hyperkeratosis and mild perivascular dermatitis. The presence and severity of histologic lesions were not correlated to coat <b>damage.</b> <b>Parasitic,</b> bacterial, and mycotic causes of alopecia were ruled out. Overviewing these results, disturbances in environment and behavior controlling or influencing hair growth may lead to hair loss in captive rhesus macaques.

The first (theoretical) part describes composition and function of gut microbiota; pesticides and their classification, environmental transport and effects of these substances on human health, and glyphosate as the active substance of herbicide Roundup, its mechanism of action, environmental fate and proven effects of glyphosate on human. The aim of second (practical) part of this thesis was to test impact of pesticide Roundup on the gut microorganisms of human. The impact of pesticide was tested in in vitro pure cultures. Roundup was added in concentrations of glyphosate 17 g/L, 1, 7 g/L and 0, 17 g/L to the complex media and after cultivation the growth of microorganisms was evaluated. The next samples of stool were collected from human volunteers; these were cultivated similarly in the complex media with different concentrations of glyphosate. The total numbers of microorganisms, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, enterococci and coliformn bacteria were defined after cultivation. When the pesticide was tested in pure cultures, concentration of 17 g/L glyphosate significantly inhibited total bacterial growth (P < 0. 05), at lower concentrations no difference was observed. The cultivated microorganisms from samples of stool demonstrated only that bifidobacteria are sensitive to glyphosate at the highest used concentration of this pesticide compared with the control sample...|$|R

In this study, there are presented the results relating to helminthosis and mange prevalence in different age categories of cattle. Positive parasitological findings were determined in 43. 30 % of tested animals. There were diagnosed cestodes of Moniezia and Dicrocoelium dendriticum strain, gastro intestinal strongilides as well as mites of Psoroptes strain. During two years’ investigation, there was found out the greatest prevalence of infections caused by gastro intestinal strongilides (19. 78 % and 29. 32 %). On the basis of the obtained results, {{it will be possible to}} use modern antihelmintics more effectively, as well as to implement measures in order to prevent both growth and survival of preparasitic stadiums in the environment and animal infection.
