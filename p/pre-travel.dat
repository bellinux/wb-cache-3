40|$|Abstract Background <b>Pre-travel</b> health {{assessments}} aim {{to promote}} risk reduction through preventive measures and safe behavior, including ensuring travelers are up-to-date with their immunizations. However, studies assessing <b>pre-travel</b> health-seeking practices {{from a variety}} of medical and non-medical sources and vaccine uptake prior to travel to both developing and developed countries within the Asia-Pacific region are scarce. Methods Cross-sectional surveys were conducted between July and December 2007 to assess <b>pre-travel</b> health seeking practices, including advice from health professionals, health information from other sources and vaccine uptake, in a sample of travelers departing Sydney and Bangkok airports. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was used to ensure representativeness of travelers and travel destinations. <b>Pre-travel</b> health seeking practices were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire distributed at the check-in queues of departing flights. Logistic regression models were used to identify significant factors associated with seeking <b>pre-travel</b> health advice from a health professional, reported separately for Australian residents, residents of other Western countries and residents of countries in Asia. Results A total of 843 surveys were included in the final sample (Sydney 729, response rate 56 %; Bangkok 114, response rate 60 %). Overall, <b>pre-travel</b> health information from any source was sought by 415 (49 %) respondents with 298 (35 %) seeking <b>pre-travel</b> advice from a health professional, the majority through general practice. Receipt of a <b>pre-travel</b> vaccine was reported by 100 (12 %) respondents. Significant factors associated with seeking <b>pre-travel</b> health advice from a health professional differed by region of residence. Asian travelers were less likely to report seeking <b>pre-travel</b> health advice and uptake of <b>pre-travel</b> vaccines than Australian or other Western travelers. Migrant Australians were less likely to report seeking <b>pre-travel</b> health advice than Australian-born travelers. Conclusions This study highlights differences in health-seeking practices including the uptake of <b>pre-travel</b> health advice by region of residence and country of birth. There is a public health need to identify strategies targeting these travel groups. This includes the promotion of affordable and accessible travel clinics in low resource countries as traveler numbers increase and travel health promotion targeting migrant groups in high resource countries. General practitioners should play a central role. Determining the most appropriate strategies for increasing <b>pre-travel</b> health preparation, particularly for vaccine preventable diseases in travelers is the next stage in advancing travel medicine research. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} <b>pre-travel</b> {{consultation}} between nurses {{and people who}} plan to travel abroad from the UK. Travel health services have developed ad hoc in response to rising public demand, and are mainly nurse-led in UK general practice. There is little research evidence to describe or evaluate <b>pre-travel</b> healthcare provision. Using a mainly qualitative bricolage design of six methods, the research traces the ‘journey’ of health recommendations made to travellers. Starting with guidance documents produced by experts, it then tracks the fulfilment of these recommendations through consultations conducted by nurses and captures {{the ways in which}} travellers use or discard the recommendations while travelling. It explores the clinical reasoning behind activities in <b>pre-travel</b> consultations, and generates ideas for practice development. The key findings are that <b>pre-travel</b> healthcare is medicine-centric and issues of time, organisation, and the model adopted by nurses affects the quality of consultations. Two styles of consultation were identified: the Kitchen Sink style was comprehensive and verbose; the Medical and Minimal style focused on vaccinations. Travellers recalled or used very little of what was imparted during their consultations, but far from being ‘blank slates’, travellers usually managed their health appropriately and had far more knowledge than nurses recognised. The thesis offers conceptual insights to the <b>pre-travel</b> consultation which relate to patient safety, quality and the legal integrity of practitioners. It offers a prototype model of the <b>pre-travel</b> consultation that takes account of the challenges associated with current practice. The implications for practice relate to education for nurses in consultation management, patient-centredness, proactive versus reactive service provision, and patient education. <b>PRE-TRAVEL</b> - the new model for consultations - contributes a framework for engaging with these issues, subject to post-doctoral testing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{medical and}} travel plans {{gathered}} from <b>pre-travel</b> interviews {{are used to}} decide the provision of specific <b>pre-travel</b> health advice and vaccinations, {{there has been no}} evaluation of the relevance of this strategy. In a prospective study, we assessed the agreement between <b>pre-travel</b> plans and post-travel history and the effect on advice regarding the administration of vaccines and recommendations for malaria prevention. METHODS: We included prospectively all consenting adults who had not planned an organized tour. Pre- and post-travel information included questions on destination, itineraries, departure and return dates, access to bottled water, plan of bicycle ride, stays in a rural zone, and close contact with animals. The outcomes measured included: agreement between pre- and post-travel itineraries and activities; and the effect of these differences on <b>pre-travel</b> health recommendations, had the traveler gone to the actual versus intended destinations for actual versus intended duration and activities. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-five travelers were included in the survey, where 188 (52 %) were males (median age 38 years). In 81 (23 %) travelers, {{there was no difference between}} pre- and post-travel history. Disagreement between pre- and post-travel history were the highest for stays in rural zones or with local people (66 % of travelers), close contact with animals (33 %), and bicycle riding (21 %). According to post-travel history, 125 (35 %) travelers would have needed rabies vaccine and 9 (3 %) typhoid fever vaccine. Potential overprovision of vaccine was found in > 2 % of travelers. A change in the malaria prescription would have been recommended in 18 (5 %) travelers. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Pre-travel</b> history does not adequately reflect what travelers do. However, difference between recommendations for the actual versus intended travel plans was only clinically significant for the need for rabies vaccine. Particular attention during <b>pre-travel</b> health counseling should focus on the risk of rabies, the need to avoid close contact with animals and to seek care for post-exposure prophylaxis following an animal bite...|$|E
40|$|Limited data {{exist on}} {{infectious}} diseases imported to various locations in Europe, particularly after travel within the continent. To investigate travel-related disease relevant to Europe that is potentially preventable through <b>pre-travel</b> intervention, we analyzed the EuroTravNet database of 5, 965 ill travelers reported by 16 centers in "Western" Europe in 2011. There were 54 cases of vaccine-preventable disease, mostly hepatitis A (n[*]=[*] 16), typhoid fever (n[*]=[*] 11), and measles (n[*]=[*] 8); 6 cases (including 3 measles cases) {{were associated with}} travel within "Western" Europe. Malaria was the most commonly diagnosed infection (n[*]=[*] 482, 8. 1 % of all travel-related morbidity). Among patients with malaria, the military most commonly received <b>pre-travel</b> advice (95 %), followed by travelers for missionary, volunteer, research, or aid work (81 %) but travelers {{visiting friends and relatives}} (VFRs) were least likely to receive <b>pre-travel</b> advice (21 %). The vast majority (96 %) of malaria patients were resident in "Western" Europe, but over half (56 %) were born elsewhere. Other significant causes of morbidity, which could be reduced through advice and behavioral change, include Giardia (n[*]=[*] 221, 3. 7 %), dengue (n[*]=[*] 146, 2. 4 %), and schistosomiasis (n[*]=[*] 131, 2. 2 %). Of 206 (3. 5 %) travelers with exposure in "Western" Europe, 75 % were tourists; the highest burden of disease was acute gastrointestinal infection (35 % cases). Travel from "Eastern" Europe (n[*]=[*] 132, 2. 2 %) was largely associated with migration-related travel (53 %); among chronic infectious diseases, tuberculosis was frequently diagnosed (n[*]=[*] 20).

40|$|Abstract. Immigrants {{returning}} home to visit friends and relatives (VFR travelers) are at higher risk of travel-associated illness than other international travelers. We evaluated 3, 707 VFR and 17, 507 non-VFR travelers seen for <b>pre-travel</b> consultation in Global TravEpiNet during 2009 – 2011; all were traveling to resource-poor destinations.

40|$|Background: Immunocompromised and {{chronically ill}} {{travellers}} (ICCITs) {{are susceptible to}} travel related diseases. In ICCITs, <b>pre-travel</b> care regarding vaccinations and prophylactics is complex. We evaluated the protection level by preventive measures in ICCITs by analysing rates of vaccination protection, antibody titres, and the prescription of standby antibiotics. Methods: We analysed, and reported according to STROBE guidelines, <b>pre-travel</b> care data for ICCITs visiting the medical <b>pre-travel</b> clinic at the Academic Medical Centre, The Netherlands from 2011 to 2016. Results: We analysed 2104 visits of 1826 ICCITs. Mean age was 46. 6 years and mean travel duration 34. 5 days. ICCITs on immunosuppressive treatment (29. 7 %), HIV (17. 2 %) or diabetes mellitus (10. 2 %) comprised the largest groups. Most frequently visited countries were Suriname, Indonesia, and Ghana. Most vaccination rates were > 90 %. Of travellers in high need of hepatitis A and B protection, 56. 6 and 75. 7 %, underwent titre assessments, respectively. Of ICCITs with a respective indication, 50. 6 % received a prescription for standby antibiotics. Conclusion: Vaccination rates in our study population were overall {{comparable to those of}} healthy travellers studied previously in our centre. However, regarding antibody titre assessments and prescription of standby antibiotics, this study demonstrates that uniform <b>pre-travel</b> guidelines for ICCITs are highly needed.

40|$|Extract] The {{provision}} of written {{health and safety}} information for travellers has {{become an integral part}} of supporting the advice given during <b>pre-travel</b> health consultations. This may take the form of brochures, information sheets, and printouts from the Internet or indeed travel health booklets such as Travel Vaccination Certificate Book and <b>Pre-Travel</b> Guide, formerly Your Passport to Travel Health. ¹ Travel Vaccination Certificate Book and <b>Pre-Travel</b> Guide is based on the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP),² which has recently superseded the International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV), but has strategically inserted health information for the traveller. Travel Vaccination Certificate Book and <b>Pre-Travel</b> Guide includes notes on travel advice, passports and consular advice, as per the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) ³; notes on yellow fever, a travel health checklist, the ICVP, notes on malaria, notes on how to prevent malaria and dengue fever, notes on rabies, including a detailed rabies pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccination record; a chart giving the duration of protection of vaccines; and a section for detailing important medical history. It is curious that the nomenclature on the cover is not consistent with the ICVP. In addition, there is no obvious date of publication on the booklet and the year of publication has been estimated from discussions with the author. The Travel Vaccination Certificate Book and <b>Pre-Travel</b> Guide is obviously directed to travellers and retains the size of the ICV, hence could be easily carried with other travel documents. It no longer appears to come standard with a durable protective yellow plastic cover, as in the previous edition. None-the-less, it is as robust as any ICV or ICVP. In order to keep the booklet compact, it has omitted the A–Z of travel health issues, which would need to be provided by a separate publication. None-the-less, it may be useful to provide other essential advice for the traveller, such as a ready reference chart reminding travellers of lifesaving first aid procedures and an expanded proformas documenting travellers' medications. The inclusion of a key travel advisory website is a significant advance on the previous edition and appears to be the result of a partnership with DFAT. Perhaps other useful websites could be added, such as that of the Australian Travel Health Advisory Group. ⁴ The Travel Vaccination Certificate Book and <b>Pre-Travel</b> Guide gives coverage to issues not covered in an ICV alone. It is not a substitute for up-to-date <b>pre-travel</b> health advice on a range of health and safety topics important to the traveller or those seeking assistance for potentially life-threatening conditions from a qualified source. The Travel Vaccination Certificate Book and <b>Pre-Travel</b> Guide is not without some competition, which may be used as adjunctive resources; however, there are few comparable compact publications. 5 The booklet does provide an exceptionally practical low-cost reference for the traveller as an adjunct to appropriate health advice received before travel...|$|E

40|$|Recognition of {{clinical}} syndromes in returned travelers {{is an important}} part of providing care to international travelers. The first step is to take a history with attention to <b>pre-travel</b> preventive measures, the patient's itinerary, and potential exposure to infectious agents. The patient should then be examined to document physical signs, such as fever, rash, or hepatosplenomegaly, and to have basic laboratory data obtained. This evaluation will provide most physicians with the necessary information to generate a differential diagnosis. Each diagnosis should be matched against the incubation period of the disease, the geographic location of illness, the frequency of illness in returned travelers, and the <b>pre-travel</b> preventive measures. Careful attention to these aspects of patient care should result in the appropriate diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for the ill returned traveler.

The impact of these may be reduced by relevant <b>pre-travel</b> advice. Little is known {{of the effect of}} <b>pre-travel</b> advice on the incidence of diarrhoea among travellers abroad. AIM: To determine the 'true' attack rate of travellers' diarrhoea and to assess the effectiveness of <b>pre-travel</b> health advice in reducing the incidence of diarrhoea and the need for subsequent GP consultation. METHOD: A retrospective study was carried out in a general practice in Stirling, Scotland, using a standardized, structured questionnaire to obtain demographic details and patients' home and foreign health experience in the previous 12 months. The questionnaire was administered to a 20 % sample (n = 1771) of practice patients aged 16 years or over, stratified by age and sex. Main outcome measures were reported diarrhoeal illness while abroad, its management and outcome, and a record of diarrhoea in the two weeks prior to responding to the questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rate was 97 % (n = 1649). Of those responding, 44 % had travelled abroad in the past 12 months; 39 % of travellers reported having diarrhoea while abroad, while 6 % of the same group reported diarrhoea in the two weeks prior to being questioned; 9. 7 % of non-travellers reported diarrhoea in the two weeks prior to being questioned. Travellers were 6. 5 times more likely to experience diarrhoea while abroad than when spending a comparable 2 -week period at home. Travellers who had sought <b>pre-travel</b> advice {{were more likely to be}} travelling to a high-risk destination (P < 0. 0001) and were more likely to suffer diarrhoea while abroad (P < 0. 05); however, they were less likely to need medical help while abroad or on their return (P < 0. 0001).

In patients infected with HIV (PHIV), combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) improves immunity, enabling them to travel with less risk for their health. <b>Pre-travel</b> consultation of PVIH has the following objectives: to determine immune status, to update immunization and to decide on anti-malaria drug prophylaxis, taking into account potential drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy. Vaccine response and duration of protection is shorter-lived in PVIH, especially if the CD 4 count is below 200 cells/mm 3 and the HIV viral load is detectable. Therefore cART is a cornerstone for disease prevention among patients infected with HIV who travel...|$|E
40|$|The {{importation}} {{of infectious diseases}} into Australia via international travel poses a continuing and evolving threat to national disease control. There is an increasing {{need to understand the}} contribution of air travel to the spread of infectious diseases globally. Although travel has been a means of infectious disease dissemination throughout history, the speed, reach and volume of modern air transportation results in the rapid spread of infectious diseases globally. Air travellers may still be within the incubation period of most infectious diseases when they arrive at their destination and all countries are vulnerable to the {{importation of}} infectious diseases. Travellers {{play a significant role in}} the spread of infectious diseases across international borders, through their travel patterns and behaviours. Responsible travel through the adoption of effective preventative practices is crucial to the comprehensive control of infectious diseases on a global scale. The main aim of this thesis was to describe the travel patterns and health behaviours of travellers and their potential impact on the epidemiology of infectious disease in Australia. In controlling imported infectious diseases, it is important to first quantify the burden of infectious diseases in travellers and to identify the changing patterns of travel and the contribution of the traveller to the risks of disease importation. Three separate studies were conducted to address the aims of this thesis. The first was an airport study of travellers departing Sydney bound for destinations in Asia and Bangkok airport bound for destinations in Australia. This study assessed travel patterns and traveller demographic characteristics, symptoms consistent with infection and contact with febrile persons and <b>pre-travel</b> health care seeking behaviour, vaccine uptake and risk perception. The second study was a national telephone survey to determine the incidence of travel in the Australian population. A separate national telephone survey of Australian adults was also undertaken to identify factors that influence the uptake of <b>pre-travel</b> advice and travel vaccines in Australian travellers and compares the vaccination status of travellers and non-travellers. These studies identified a range of travel patterns and traveller characteristics unique to Australian resident travellers and visitors to Australia. Travel is a common pursuit among Australian adults, with many reporting symptoms consistent with infection prior to departure and few reporting <b>pre-travel</b> preventative practices. Several population sub-groups have a greater propensity for travel, including Australian migrants, who may be at increased risk of infectious diseases owing to a lower uptake of <b>pre-travel</b> health care seeking and vaccine uptake than Australian born travellers. The risk perception results indicate that opportunities exist to modify traveller behaviour and improve the uptake of <b>pre-travel</b> preparations. Data on travel patterns and behaviours as they relate to the importation and transmission of infectious disease are lacking in Australia and the studies included in this thesis represent new and important knowledge of the travel patterns and traveller behaviour relevant to the spread of infectious diseases via air travel to Australia. These studies identify high-risk sub-groups of travellers, determine the proportion of the Australian population engaging in international travel and quantify the proportion of Australian travellers who prepare for the infectious diseases risks associated with travel through <b>pre-travel</b> preventative practices. The findings from this series of cross-sectional surveys of travellers can inform travel medicine and border control policy and practice. Strategies are required to address poor uptake of <b>pre-travel</b> health advice and vaccination in travellers, particularly migrant Australians. Empirical data obtained in this thesis is of use for modelling infectious disease transmission on a global scale, and to inform pandemic planning and border control measures...|$|E
40|$|Travel is {{important}} in the acquisition and dissemination of infection. We aimed to assess European surveillance data for travel-related illness to profile imported infections, track trends, identify risk groups, and assess the usefulness of <b>pre-travel</b> advice. We analysed travel-associated morbidity in ill travellers presenting at EuroTravNet sites during the 5 -year period of 2008 - 12. We calculated proportionate morbidity per 1000 ill travellers and made comparisons over time and between subgroups. We did 5 -year trend analyses (2008 - 12) by testing differences in proportions between subgroups using Pearson's χ(2) test. We assessed the effect of the <b>pre-travel</b> consultation on infection acquisition and outcome by use of proportionate morbidity ratios. The top diagnoses in 32   136 patients, ranked by proportionate morbidity, were malaria and acute diarrhoea, both with high proportionate morbidity (> 60). Dengue, giardiasis, and insect bites had high proportionate morbidity (> 30) as well. 5 -year analyses showed increases in vector borne infections with significant peaks in 2010; examples were increased Plasmodium falciparum malaria (χ(2) = 37 · 57, p < 0 · 001); increased dengue fever (χ(2) = 135 · 9, p < 0 · 001); and a widening geographic range of acquisition of chikungunya fever. The proportionate morbidity of dengue increased from 22 in 2008 to 36 in 2012. Five dengue cases acquired in Europe contributed to this increase. Dermatological diagnoses increased from 851 in 2008 to 1102 in 2012, especially insect bites and animal-related injuries. Respiratory infection trends were dominated by the influenza H 1 N 1 pandemic in 2009. Illness acquired in Europe accounted for 1794 (6 %) of all 32   136 cases-mainly, gastrointestinal (634) and respiratory (357) infections. Migration within Europe was associated with more serious infection such as hepatitis C, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS. <b>Pre-travel</b> consultation was associated with significantly lower proportionate morbidity ratios for P falciparum malaria and also for acute hepatitis and HIV/AIDS. The pattern of travel-related infections presenting in Europe is complex. Trend analyses can inform on emerging infection threats. <b>Pre-travel</b> consultation is associated with reduced malaria proportionate morbidity ratios and less severe illness. These findings support the importance and effectiveness of <b>pre-travel</b> advice on malaria prevention, but cast doubt on the effectiveness of current strategies to prevent travel-related diarrhoea.

40|$|Background: Migrant {{travellers}} who {{return to}} {{their country of origin}} to visit family and friends (VFR) are less likely to seek travel-related medical care and are less likely to adhere to recommended medications and travel precautions. Through this study, we aimed to get an understanding of the views of stakeholders from community migrant centres and primary care providers on barriers for migrants, particularly from non-English speaking backgrounds, in accessing travel health advice and the strategies {{that could be used to}} engage them. Methods: A qualitative study involving 20 semi-structured interviews was undertaken in Sydney, Australia between January 2013 and September 2014. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Results: Language barriers, a lower perceived risk of travel-related infections and the financial costs of seeking <b>pre-travel</b> health care were nominated as being the key barriers impacting on the uptake of <b>pre-travel</b> health advice and precautions. To overcome pre-existing language barriers, participants advocated for the use of bilingual community educators, community radio, ethnic newspapers and posters in the dissemination of <b>pre-travel</b> health information. Conclusions: Travel is a major vector of importation of infectious diseases into Australia, and VFR travellers are at high risk of infection. Collaboration between the Government, primary care physicians, migrant community groups and migrants themselves is crucial if we are to be successful in reducing travel-related risks among this subgroup of travellers...|$|E
