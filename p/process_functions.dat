25|$|The singing <b>process</b> <b>functions</b> {{best when}} certain {{physical}} {{conditions of the}} body are put in place. The ability to move air {{in and out of}} the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.|$|E
2500|$|Central {{sensitization}} of the {{dorsal horn}} neurons that is evoked from C fiber activity {{is responsible for}} temporal summation of [...] "second pain" [...] (TSSP). This event is called ‘windup’ and relies on a frequency greater or equal to 0.33Hz of the stimulus. Windup is associated with chronic pain and central sensitization. This minimum frequency was determined experimentally by comparing healthy patient fMRI’s when subjected to varying frequencies of heat pulses. The fMRI maps show common areas activated by the TSSP responses which include contralateral thalamus (THAL), S1, bilateral S2, anterior and posterior insula (INS), mid-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and supplemental motor areas (SMA). TSSP events are also associated with {{other regions of the}} brain that <b>process</b> <b>functions</b> such as somatosensory processing, pain perception and modulation, cognition, pre-motor activity in the cortex.|$|E

50|$|This <b>process</b> <b>functions</b> like a cutter suction dredger, but {{the cutting}} tool is a {{rotating}} Archimedean screw set {{at right angles to}} the suction pipe. The first widely used auger dredges were designed in the 1980s by Mud Cat Dredges, which was run by National Car Rental, but is now a Division of Ellicott Dredges. In 1996, IMS Dredges introduced a self-propelled version of the auger dredge that allows the system to propel itself without the use of anchors or cables. During the 1980s and 1990s auger dredges were primarily used for sludge removal applications from waste water treatment plants. Today, auger dredges are used for a wider variety of applications including river maintenance and sand mining.|$|E

The player controls the character Red as she travels {{through a series}} of locations, battling enemies known collectively as the Process in both real-time combat and a frozen planning mode referred to as [...] "Turn (...) [...] ". Using Turn (...) drains the action bar, which refills after a short delay. Until it is full again, Red cannot use Turn (...) , or any other ability (without a specific upgrade). Red earns experience points after each battle, and may collect new powers (called Functions) from fallen victims of the <b>Process.</b> <b>Functions</b> may be equipped as one of four unique techniques, as an enhancement on another, equipped technique, or as a passive, persistent effect during battle. For example, the Function Spark (...) may be used to fire a wide area attack, equipped on another Function to increase its area of effect, or used as a passive effect to spawn decoys of Red. Red can also collect and activate Limiters, which serve as optional debuffs during combat, but in turn increase experience gained. Both Functions and Limiters reveal minor parts of the story if used for a long enough time.|$|E
50|$|Memory {{is never}} a literal recount of past experiences. Rather, it is {{dependent}} on the constructive processes present at the time of encoding that are subject to potential errors and distortions. Essentially, the constructive memory <b>process</b> <b>functions</b> by encoding the patterns of physical characteristics that are perceived by the individual, as well as the interpretive conceptual and semantic functions that act in response to the incoming information. By utilizing multiple interdependent cognitive processes there {{is never a}} single location in the brain where a given complete memory trace of an experience is stored. In this manner, the various features of the experience must be joined together to form a coherent representation of the episode and if this binding process fails it can result in source memory failure, where later attempted retrieval of the episode results in fragmented recollection and an inability to consolidate the information into a cohesive narrative of a past experience.During the recall of Episodic memory, the information that a person remembers is usually limited in scope, ultimately giving an incomplete recollection of an event. By employing reconstructive processes, individuals supplement other aspects of available personal knowledge into the gaps found in episodic memory in order to provide a fuller and more coherent version, albeit one that is often distorted.|$|E
