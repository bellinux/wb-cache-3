The high chiefs are now limited to 33 titles and called nobles (nopele), but some nobles carry more than one title. They are still estate holders, and as such have some influence, {{but they are not}} the government (although many of them are high ranking civil servants). The lower chiefs have disappeared (and the word fototehina now means 'brothers'). The matāpule have also largely disappeared except those who keep the protocol and serve as official spokesmen for the king and nobles. And also the royal undertaker, Lauaki. Tax collection is a task for the central government only. Slavery is abolished, since the emancipation of 1875, and all other <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> the 'commoners'.|$|E

The last bastion of Hong Kong's guarantees is the law. What we have left is our legal system, but people fear that this may be under attack too". Steve Vickers, the principal of one local risk assessment firm said: [...] "The Hong Kong government appears to now have considerably diminished autonomy and the liaison office seems to be strengthening its position, [...] certainly sent a chill through the business and social arenas in Hong Kong".|$|E
500|$|Miller {{described}} his biggest challenge in writing Rivens music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, [...] "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, and <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> {{standing in a}} room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is [...] "appealingly atmospheric", but [...] "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 1998, Houston Police Department {{officers}} {{acting on}} a tip regarding drug related activities entered a Gulfton apartment complex and shot and killed Pedro Oregon Navarro. The circumstances of the event were disputed. By October 19 of that year a Harris County grand jury cleared the officers of charges related to the incident. Nestor Rodriguez, {{a professor of sociology}} at the University of Houston, described Gulfton as [...] "a place where <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> struggling to get by." [...] Consequently, there were fewer [...] "displays of outrage" [...] than would have been expected if the incident had occurred in one of the [...] "older, well-established Latino communities." [...] Oregon's killing was controversial because illicit drugs were not found on the property. Oregon's family sued the City of Houston arguing that the raid was inappropriate. The city countered that its officers acted in an appropriate manner. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2000.|$|E

500|$|In 1964, Simone changed record {{distributors}} {{from the}} American Colpix to the Dutch Philips, which also meant {{a change in}} the contents of her recordings. She had always included songs in her repertoire that drew upon her African-American origins (such as [...] "Brown Baby" [...] by Oscar Brown and [...] "Zungo" [...] by Michael Olatunji in her album Nina at the Village Gate in 1962). On her debut album for Philips, Nina Simone in Concert (live recording, 1964), {{for the first time she}} openly addressed the racial inequality that was prevalent in the United States with the song [...] "Mississippi Goddam", her response to the June 12, 1963, murder of Medgar Evers and the September 15, 1963, bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four young black girls and partially blinded a fifth girl who survived. She remarked that the title and the song itself was, [...] "like throwing 10 bullets back at them", becoming one of many other protest songs written by Simone. The song was released as a single, and it was boycotted in certain southern states. Specifically, promotional copies were smashed by a Carolina radio station and returned to Simone's record label. Simone later recalled how [...] "Mississippi Goddam" [...] was her [...] "first civil rights song" [...] and that the song came to her [...] "in a rush of fury, hatred and determination". The song was a direct challenge to widely held beliefs that race relations could change gradually and called for more immediate developments, [...] "me and my <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> about due". It was a key moment in her political radicalization. [...] "Old Jim Crow", on the same album, addressed the Jim Crow laws.|$|E

500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about you. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it."

2500|$|Some {{surnames}} {{are equal}} to given names, such as Joana Fernando, or André João, in which [...] "Fernando" [...] and [...] "João" [...] are surnames, not given names. It is rather improbable {{that those are}} patronymics; more likely they originated with people with no surnames, who were given two names {{for the sake of}} enhanced individuality. One can find today in Portugal and Brazil people who still use surnames that for other <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> given names, although they were passed from parents to sons for generations, such as Valentim, Alexandre, Fernando, Afonso (note the family name de Melo Afonso) and Antonio (note de Melo Antonio). Names like Dinis, Duarte, Garcia and Godinho were originally given names, but today they are used in Brazil almost exclusively as surnames, although Duarte and Dinis are still common given names in Portugal.|$|E
2500|$|Gillespie was criticised for {{defacing}} a Make Poverty History poster {{signed by}} all the acts at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005.

We did a lot of work for the Hoping Foundation to raise money for children in the Palestinian refugee camps and the lady who got us involved is Bella Freud, Lucian Freud's daughter and Sigmund Freud's great granddaughter. They had to flee Austria to escape Nazi persecution, and she believes in the Palestinian cause. To say we're anti-Semitic is a smear, so you'd better watch what you're saying. Because you oppose one country's government's policies doesn't mean to say that you hate all the people from that country. I don't like Bush or Putin or Tony Blair, but I don't hate American, Russian or British people. Most <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> trying hard to get by."

The letter was addressed to her as “Walker-Black”. Walker had never been married, didn’t use a hyphenated name, and had never had the last name Black. It appeared as if someone forgot to remove the race notation before signing and sending out that letter. James Anderson, Lindner's lawyer, apologized to Walker saying it was a [...] "simple mistake.

2500|$|Adorno's {{reputation}} as a musicologist has been in steady decline since his death. [...] His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the Second Viennese School in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him {{to fall out of}} favour.

[...] The eminent pianist and critic Charles Rosen saw Adorno's book The Philosophy of New Music as [...] "largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study." [...] Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic Eric Hobsbawm saw Adorno's writings as containing [...] "some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz". The British philosopher Roger Scruton saw Adorno as producing [...] "reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine." [...] Irritation with Adorno's tunnel vision started even while he was alive. [...] He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: [...] "I {{have never been able to}} bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by the way, how he treats Stravinsky." [...] On the other hand, the scholar Slavoj Žižek has written a foreword to Adorno's In Search of Wagner, where Žižek attributes an [...] "emancipatory impulse" [...] to the same book, although Žižek suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands [...] "a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno's Wagner study." ...|$|E

But everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get {{over the fact that}} there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." [...] He commented that no one in Sylvia's [...] was [...] "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" [...] He further added, [...] "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, I can make it. If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.'" [...] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> now starting to value education is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is [...] "nuts". Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O'Reilly responded, saying, [...] "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true" [...] and also called out Media Matters, claiming that [...] "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism." [...] Juan Williams said the criticism of O'Reilly was [...] "rank dishonesty" [...] and that the original comments [...] "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN."
