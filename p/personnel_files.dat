5|$|The {{office of}} the Deputy Führer had final {{approval}} over civil service appointments, and Bormann reviewed the <b>personnel</b> <b>files</b> and made the decisions regarding appointments. This power impinged on the purview of Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, and {{was an example of}} the overlapping responsibilities typical of the Nazi regime. Bormann travelled everywhere with Hitler, including trips to Austria in 1938 after the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany), and to the Sudetenland after the signing of the Munich Agreement later that year. Bormann was placed in charge of organising the 1938 Nuremberg Rally, a major annual party event.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{assigned}} to the FMPU included {{some of the most}} well known film professionals of the day, as well as filmmakers who would have great success after the war. Actors such as Clark Gable, William Holden and Alan Ladd, and directors including Richard Bare and John Sturges served with the unit. Future president Ronald Reagan, who transferred from the cavalry reserve, was a captain in the unit. He was the personnel officer and was responsible for maintaining <b>personnel</b> <b>files</b> and orienting new recruits to the operational aspects of Fort Roach. Later he was appointed adjutant. Like the other notable actors Reagan appeared in the films produced by the unit, but to avoid distracting the audience they were eventually relegated to narrating the films.|$|E

25|$|As this {{so-called}} culture fight was originally one between Catholics and more Protestant, Bismark-oriented and Prussia-friendly group of people, Hubertia was cought in the middle. Becker was a politician {{of the catholic}} Centrum party and openly voiced that Catholics only made it into higher offices {{in the area of}} Baden-Württemberg when they had been members of Hubertia. This can be understood as a typical statement during the cultural war (Kulturkampf) with Köhler voicing his antipathy towards the fraternity of Hubertia. On the other hand, Hasel completely disproves Köhller's view: He points out that the view of Catholics only having gotten into higher office positions if they had been Hubertia's members must be false as access to Baden's office career track was not bound by confession. Catholic forestry office applicants were not hindered on their path, which is proven by several of <b>personnel</b> <b>files.</b>|$|E

Also, Fogleman wrote and placed [...] "letters of evaluation" [...] in the permanent <b>personnel</b> <b>files</b> of Wickson, May, Wang, Halcli, Wilson, Pilkington, and Emery that stated that each had failed [...] "to meet Air Force standards in job knowledge, judgment and leadership". In addition, a military decoration awarded to O'Brien for his service during OPC was rescinded. A videotape in which Fogleman described his actions related to the incident and his views on standards and accountability was distributed throughout the USAF and all USAF officers, senior non-commissioned officers, and Senior Executive Service civilians were ordered to view it.

500|$|In {{the third}} series premiere episode, Tom survives and poses as a vagrant {{in order to}} find Joyce in a church; Tom kills Joyce and leaves his body outside Thames House in an attempt to prove his innocence. When it does not, Adam Carter (Rupert Penry-Jones) tracks down Joyce's wife and makes her confess to their plan to frame Tom, {{clearing}} him of all charges. Tom is reinstated as Head of Section. However, in the next episode, he undergoes a [...] "conscience explosion" [...] and sabotages an operation to lure a terrorist cell into buying [...] "red mercury", because he did not like what was being done to the scientist in order for him to attempt to create it (which includes forging gambling debt, prompting the man's wife to leave him. He also develops a severe alcohol problem). As a result, Tom is decommissioned and takes early retirement from MI5. In the book Spooks: The <b>Personnel</b> <b>Files,</b> Tom is revealed to have married Christine Dale following his retirement and to have founded a private security company called 'Trans Atlantic Security'. He is also mentioned in Season 7 Episode 1 when Lucas North asks Harry 'How did Tom Quinn work out?'. Tom briefly returns in the final episode, hired by Harry Pearce as an [...] "outside contractor" [...] to eliminate the head of a conspiracy of Russian nationalists who tried to derail the move to a closer Russian/UK relationship. Although brief, this scene makes it clear that Tom is still involved in spying.|$|E
500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular <b>personnel</b> <b>files</b> of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I have worked hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E

However, Palin has also claimed that her family {{was not aware of}} Wooten's suspension until July 2008. Also, Wooten's release of February 7, 2008, did not place his file in the public domain, it only released his file to McCann's attorneys in connection with the divorce proceedings.|$|R

2500|$|In March 2012, {{however, the}} Washington Times {{reported}} that Ellerbe was never fully vetted before being hired by Gray. The newspaper {{said that the}} Gray administration {{did not ask for}} Ellerbe's <b>personnel</b> <b>file</b> from Sarasota, where he spent nearly six months as chief before returning to Washington, D.C. The <b>personnel</b> <b>file,</b> obtained by the newspaper, revealed that several female firefighters in Sarasota had accused Ellerbe of sexual harassment. Ellerbe allegedly defended his actions to Sarasota Battalion Chief Joe Robinson that staring at women's breasts was [...] "part of my heritage" [...] and that none {{of the women in the}} department were good-looking. Robinson also claimed that Ellerbe warned staff not to [...] "cross" [...] him and that he was vindictive. Ellerbe denied harassing anyone, denied making the statements, and claimed the charges were made by union members upset with changes he made in the department. Ellerbe also claimed that Sarasota County found the allegations false, although the Washington Times reported there was no such finding in the <b>personnel</b> <b>file.</b> Sarasota County administrator Dave Bullock told the newspaper that Ellerbe was counseled regarding the county's sexual harassment policy after the incident, but that such counseling is routine after any such allegation (legitimate or not). City Council member Mendelson, whose public safety committee held hearings on Ellerbe's nomination, said the committee did not see nor did it ask for Ellerbe's Sarasota <b>personnel</b> <b>file.</b>|$|R

A report which investigated whether Higginbotham had fired a whistleblower {{has not yet been}} released. The report said cemetery officials were also negligent in continuing to use a paper filing system instead of a computerized database to keep track of cemetery operations. A new burial management system was to have been installed which would have [...] "triple verified" [...] burial records, but implementation of the system had lagged significantly.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead issued formal {{letters of}} {{counseling}} to Vice Admiral Robert Conway and Captain Gary Galloway {{for their actions}} related to the incidents and subsequent investigation. [...] Conway, former head of Navy Installations Command and the highest-ranking officer {{to sign off on}} a June 2007 investigation into the abuse, was chastised for not doing more to ensure that officers in his chain of command were sufficiently addressing the hazing allegations. [...] Conway retired in April 2009. [...] Galloway, former commander of the Bahrain base {{at the time of the}} incidents in question, was scolded for not acting quickly and firmly to verify the nature of the alleged behavior and ensure that prohibitions against hazing were enforced.

[...] These files were later used by Hojjatiyeh including sending flyers in the mail warning Bahá'ís {{of the consequences of}} continuing to believe in the Bahá'í beliefs. [...] Also, once again, there were reports of mob attacks, arson, and deaths and murders against the Bahá'ís across Iran; twenty-two Bahá'í cemeteries as well as hundreds of Bahá'í homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. During December 1978 in Sarvestan, a city south of Shiraz, it was reported that several hundred Bahá'í houses were set on fire, and more than 1,000 Bahá'ís were left homeless. [...] Reports of the attacks suggest that they were not spontaneous, but that they were initiated by the military government appointed by the Shah, that SAVAK provided the addresses for Bahá'ís, and when the army showed up they did not take action to prevent the fires from spreading. Further attacks happened throughout the country including Bahá'ís who would not recant being fired at and having their homes destroyed; the violence continued even after the Shah fled Iran.|$|E
