50|$|In {{conventional}} PCR, the Taq DNA polymerase {{is active}} {{at room temperature}} {{and to a lesser}} degree, even on ice. In some instances, when all the reaction components are put together, nonspecific <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> can occur due to these low temperatures.

5000|$|When {{designing}} primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine {{is useful}} in that it can pair with any natural base.

50|$|A primer dimer {{is formed}} and amplified in three steps. In the first step, two <b>primers</b> <b>anneal</b> at their {{respective}} 3' ends (step I in the figure). If this construct is stable enough, the DNA polymerase will bind {{and extend the}} primers according to the complementary sequence (step II in the figure). An important factor contributing to {{the stability of the}} construct in step I is a high GC-content at the 3' ends and length of the overlap. The third step occurs in the next cycle, when a single strand of the product of step II is used as a template to which fresh <b>primers</b> <b>anneal</b> leading to synthesis of more PD product.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>annealing</b> of the <b>primer</b> to the template, DNA {{replication}} {{proceeds to}} the end of the template. The duplex is denatured and the second <b>primer</b> <b>anneals</b> to the newly formed DNA strand, containing sequence from the first primer.

50|$|Hexamer primers are {{sequences}} {{composed of}} six random nucleotides. For MDA applications, these primers are usually thiophosphate-modified at their 3’ end to convey {{resistance to the}} 3’ - 5’ exonuclease activity of Ф29 DNA polymerase. MDA reactions start with the annealing of such primers to the DNA template followed by polymerase-mediated chain elongation. Increasing numbers of <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> events happen along the amplification reaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{amplification}} reaction initiates when multiple primer hexamers anneal to the template. When DNA synthesis {{proceeds to}} the next starting site, the polymerase displaces the newly produced DNA strand and continues its strand elongation. The strand displacement generates newly synthesized single stranded DNA template for more primers to anneal. Further <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> and strand displacement on the newly synthesized template results in a hyper-branched DNA network. The sequence debranching during amplification results in high yield of the products. To separate the DNA branching network, S1 nucleases are used to cleave the fragments at displacement sites. The nicks on the resulting DNA fragments are repaired by DNA polymerase I.|$|E

50|$|MALBAC primers have {{variable}} components {{which allow}} them to randomly bind to the template DNA. This means that on a single fragment at any cycle, there could be multiple <b>primers</b> <b>annealed</b> to the fragment.

50|$|Fast COLD-PCR {{differs from}} Full COLD-PCR {{in that the}} {{denaturation}} and intermediate annealing stages are skipped. This is because, in some cases, the preferential amplification of the mutant DNA {{is so great that}} ensuring the formation of the mutant/wildtype heteroduplex DNA is not needed. Thus the denaturation can occur at the Tc, proceed to <b>primer</b> <b>annealing,</b> and then polymerase-mediated extension. Each round of amplification will include these three stages in that order. By utilizing the lower denaturation temperature, the reaction will discriminate towards the products with the lower Tm - i.e. the variant alleles. Fast COLD-PCR produces much faster results due to the shortened protocol. However, {{it is important to note}} that Full COLD-PCR is essential for amplification of all possible mutations in the starting mixture of DNA.|$|E
5000|$|Differences {{between the}} X {{chromosome}} and Y chromosome {{versions of the}} amelogenin gene (AMELX and AMELY respectively) enable it {{to be used in}} sex determination of unknown human samples. AMELX’s intron 1 contains a 6 bp deletion relative to intron 1 of AMELY. This can be detected at low cost using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of intron 1, followed by gel electrophoresis. Two bands of DNA, at 106bps and 112bps, are resolved if both the AMELX and AMELY versions of the gene are present (i.e. the sample is from a male) or one band of DNA, at 106bps, if the AMELX version only is present (i.e. the sample is from a female). [...] However because of AMELY variation among individuals and populations, this method of sex determination is not 100% accurate. Mutation in regions of AMELY intron 1 commonly used as <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> sites may disable PCR amplification. A 6bp insertion to AMELY intron 1 results in an amplicon identical in length to that of AMELX. In some males AMELY may be deleted entirely. In any of these cases only one band is visualized during gel electrophoresis of PCR products, causing misidentification of the sample as female. The misidentification rate may vary among populations, but in general appears to be low. In one study in Spain, the amelogenin sex determination test using AMELX (977bps) and AMELY (790bps) bands was performed for 1224 individuals of known gender with a 99.84% (1222/1224) accuracy rate. [...] Another study in India, however, found 5 of its 270 men studied (1.85%) possessed an AMELY deletion, terming them “deleted-amelogenin males” (DAMs). In response the authors suggested that while the amelogenin sex test may be accurate in general, other Y chromosome markers such as SRY, STR, or 50f2 can be used for less ambiguous gender identification.|$|E
5000|$|Paired-end tags (PET) (sometimes [...] "Paired-End diTags", {{or simply}} [...] "ditags") are the short {{sequences}} at the 5’ and 3’ {{ends of a}} DNA fragment which are unique enough that they (theoretically) exist together only once in a genome, therefore making the sequence of the DNA in between them available upon search (if full-genome sequence data is available) or upon further sequencing (since tag sites are unique enough to serve as <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> sites). Paired-end tags (PET) exist in PET libraries with the intervening DNA absent, that is, a PET [...] "represents" [...] a larger fragment of genomic or cDNA by consisting of a short 5' linker sequence, a short 5' sequence tag, a short 3' sequence tag, and a short 3' linker sequence. It was shown conceptually that 13 base pairs are sufficient to map tags uniquely. However, longer sequences are more practical for mapping reads uniquely. The endonucleases (discussed below) used to produce PETs give longer tags (18/20 base pairs and 25/27 base pairs) but sequences of 50-100 base pairs would be optimal for both mapping and cost efficiency. After extracting the PETs from many DNA fragments, they are linked (concatenated) together for efficient sequencing. On average, 20-30 tags could be sequenced with the Sanger method, which has a longer read length. Since the tag sequences are short, individual PETs are well suited for next-generation sequencing that has short read lengths and higher throughput. The main advantages of PET sequencing are its reduced cost by sequencing only short fragments, detection of structural variants in the genome, and increased specificity when aligning back to the genome compared to single tags, which involves only {{one end of the}} DNA fragment.|$|E

50|$|Instead of cloning, {{adaptors}} {{containing the}} endonuclease sequence are ligated {{to the ends}} of fragmented genomic DNA or cDNA.

30|$|Based on the PCR product {{expected}} {{size and}} the <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> temperature, the PCR regime used was as follows: 94  °C for 4  min followed by 37 cycles of 94  °C for 30  s, 50 – 58  °C for 30  s, 72  °C for 30  s. We ran the reaction at five different <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> temperatures: 50, 52, 54, 56, and 58  °C. At all the temperatures tested, the fluorescence curve reached the logarithmic phase at the same cycle number, although the total levels of fluorescence were higher at 50, 52, and 54  °C. Since higher <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> temperatures increase primer specificity, 54  °C {{was chosen as the}} optimal <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> temperature in our experiments. We also tested the effect of TaqMan probe concentration (100, 200, and 500  nM) on the reaction parameters and found that amplification using 200  nM TaqMan probe produced more stable and pronounced amplification curves; the total level of fluorescence with 200  nM TaqMan probe was higher than when using 100  nM TaqMan probe. The optimal number of cycles was 37, because in such a number of cycles fluorescence was not observed in samples without P. kudriavzevii DNA.|$|E

50|$|Site {{directed}} mutagenesis {{is a valuable}} technique that allows for the replacement of a single base in an oligonucleotide or gene. The basics of this technique involve the preparation of a primer {{that will be a}} complementary strand to a wild type bacterial plasmid. This primer will have a base pair mismatch at the site where the replacement is desired. The primer must also be long enough such that the <b>primer</b> will <b>anneal</b> to the wild type plasmid. After the <b>primer</b> <b>anneals,</b> a DNA polymerase will complete the primer. When the bacterial plasmid is replicated, the mutated strand will be replicated as well. The same technique can be used to create a gene insertion or deletion. Often, an antibiotic resistant gene is inserted along with the modification of interest and the bacteria are cultured on an antibiotic medium. The bacteria that were not successfully mutated will not survive on this medium, and the mutated bacteria can easily be cultured.|$|R

Amplification of {{a segment of the}} coding region of Escherichia coli lacZ by using a PCR <b>primer</b> <b>annealing</b> temperature of 50 degrees C detected E. coli and other coliform bacteria (including Shigella spp.) but not Salmonella spp. and noncoliform bacteria.

PCR amplification of lacZ and lamB provides a basis for a method to detect indicators of fecal contamination of water, and amplification of lamB in particular permits detection of E. coli and enteric pathogens (Salmonella and Shigella spp.) with the necessary specificity and sensitivity for monitoring the bacteriological quality of water so as {{to ensure the safety of}} water supplies...|$|E
