5|$|Philosophy of <b>psychiatry</b> explores {{philosophical}} questions {{relating to}} <b>psychiatry</b> and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration {{in the philosophy of}} <b>psychiatry.</b> The first concerns the examination of <b>psychiatry</b> as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|The ideologizing of science, its {{breakaway}} {{from the}} achievements of world <b>psychiatry,</b> the party orientation of Soviet forensic <b>psychiatry.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive <b>psychiatry,</b> the nature of <b>psychiatry</b> is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using <b>psychiatry</b> for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1948, the Soviet secret service took an {{interest}} in this area of medicine. One of those with overall responsibility for the Soviet secret police, pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky, was the first to order the use of <b>psychiatry</b> as a tool of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, <b>psychiatry</b> was incapable of not being repressive. A system of political abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> was developed at the end of Joseph Stalin's regime.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, a {{vigorous}} movement grew up protesting against abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> in the USSR. Political abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> in the Soviet Union was denounced {{in the course}} of the Congresses of the World Psychiatric Association in Mexico City (1971), Hawaii (1977), Vienna (1983) and Athens (1989). The campaign to terminate political abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> in the USSR was a key episode in the Cold War, inflicting irretrievable damage on the prestige of medicine in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of <b>psychiatry</b> during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, <b>psychiatry</b> is discredited throughout the world. <b>Psychiatry</b> lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using <b>psychiatry</b> to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now <b>psychiatry</b> is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for <b>Psychiatry</b> Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
5|$|Institute of <b>Psychiatry</b> Library: The {{library is}} largest {{psychiatric}} library in Western Europe, holding 3,000 print journal titles, 550 {{of which are}} current subscriptions, as well as access to over 3,500 electronic journals, 42,000 books, and training materials. The collections focus on <b>psychiatry,</b> psychology, neuroscience, neurology, genetics and psychotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian <b>psychiatry</b> {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading <b>psychiatry</b> in Soviet times. Since then Russian {{psychiatric}} system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet <b>psychiatry</b> {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world <b>psychiatry.</b> Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world <b>psychiatry</b> and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in <b>psychiatry</b> was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on <b>Psychiatry</b> has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on <b>Psychiatry</b> took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on <b>Psychiatry</b> had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E
5|$|The Institute of <b>Psychiatry,</b> Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) is {{a faculty}} and a {{research}} institution dedicated to discovering what causes {{mental illness and}} diseases of the brain, and to help identify new treatments of the diseases. The institute is the largest centre for research and postgraduate education in <b>psychiatry,</b> psychology and neuroscience in Europe. Originally established in 1924 as the Maudsley Hospital Medical School, the institute {{changed its name to}} the Institute of <b>Psychiatry</b> in 1948, merged with King’s College London in 1997, and was renamed IoPPN in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} {{political}} abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> prepared {{at the request}} of the Commission by Gushansky with the aid of Prokopenko lay unclaimed and even the Independent Psychiatric Journal (Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal) would not publish it. The Moscow Research Center for Human Rights headed by Boris Altshuler and Alexei Smirnov and the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia whose president is Yuri Savenko were asked by Gushansky to publish the materials and archival documents on punitive <b>psychiatry</b> but showed no interest in doing so. Publishing such documents is dictated by present-day needs and by how far it is feared that <b>psychiatry</b> could again be abused for non-medical purposes.|$|E
5|$|Their {{interaction}} {{system is}} principally sociological: {{the presence of}} the Penal Code article on slandering the state system inevitably results in sending a certain percentage of citizens to forensic psychiatric examination. Thus, it is not <b>psychiatry</b> itself that is punitive, but the totalitarian state uses <b>psychiatry</b> for punitive purposes with ease.|$|E
5|$|While {{in prison}} Bukovsky and fellow inmate {{psychiatrist}} Semyon Gluzman jointly wrote A Manual on <b>Psychiatry</b> for Dissidents published in Russian, English, French, Italian, German, Danish. It instructed potential victims of political <b>psychiatry</b> {{how to behave}} during interrogation {{in order to avoid}} being diagnosed as mentally ill.|$|E
5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Walter Reich, the misdiagnoses of dissidents {{resulted from}} some characteristics of Soviet <b>psychiatry</b> that were distortions of standard psychiatric logic, theory, and practice.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, {{the scale}} of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed. The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic <b>Psychiatry,</b> which between them hold evidence about the expansion of <b>psychiatry</b> and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet <b>psychiatry</b> under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychologist}} Dmitry Leontev, punitive <b>psychiatry</b> in the Soviet Union {{was based}} on the assumption that only a madman can go against public dogma and seek for truth and justice.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic <b>psychiatry</b> {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic <b>psychiatry</b> from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of <b>psychiatry,</b> all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in <b>psychiatry</b> had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for <b>psychiatry,</b> was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and <b>psychiatry.</b> This fear is caused by not only abuse of <b>psychiatry,</b> but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence {{is related to the}} primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian <b>psychiatry</b> and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E

5|$|In {{his article}} of 2002, Alan A. Stone, {{who as a}} member of team had {{examined}} Pyotr Grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979, disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR. He asserted {{that it was time for}} <b>psychiatry</b> in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation. In Stone's words, he believes that Snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics. According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century. In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence.|$|E

5|$|Michael Persinger is a {{neurophysiologist}} who {{has worked}} at Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He trained as a psychologist {{and focused on the}} impacts of religious experience. Persinger {{is the author of the}} book Neuropsychological Basis of Human Belief, and since its publication he has researched and examined the physiological and neurological causes of religious belief systems. Normand Carrey received education as a medical doctor and specialized in <b>psychiatry.</b> He became a child psychiatrist, and worked out of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Carrey has conducted studies into psychological resilience, and has taught physicians in a <b>psychiatry</b> residency program in the field of family therapy. He has worked in the field of adolescent <b>psychiatry</b> at IWK Health Centre. Lynn Suess assisted Persinger in 1980, in researching geological phenomena which may have affected unidentified flying object sightings in Washington.

5|$|<b>Psychiatry</b> {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, <b>psychiatry</b> can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

5|$|The {{evidence}} for the misuse of <b>psychiatry</b> for political purposes in the Soviet Union was documented {{in a number of}} articles and books. Several national psychiatric associations examined and acted upon this documentation.|$|E
5|$|The now {{available}} evidence supports {{the conclusion that}} the system of political abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> was carefully designed by the KGB to rid the USSR of undesirable elements. According to several available documents and a message by a former general of the Fifth (dissident) Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB to Robert van Voren, political abuse of <b>psychiatry</b> as a systematic method of repression was developed by Yuri Andropov along with a selected group of associates.|$|E
5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive <b>psychiatry</b> allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive <b>psychiatry</b> to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
