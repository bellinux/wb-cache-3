25|$|While Heath/Zenith's {{computer}} {{business was}} successful, {{the growing popularity}} of home computers as a hobby hurt the company because many customers began writing computer programs instead of assembling Heathkits. While their assembly was still an interesting and educational hobby, kits were no longer less expensive than <b>preassembled</b> products; BYTE reported in 1984 that the kit version of the Z-150 IBM PC compatible cost $100 more than the <b>preassembled</b> computer from some dealers, but needed about 20 hours and soldering skills to assemble. The continuation of the integration trend (printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, etc.), and mass production of electronics (especially computer manufacturing overseas and plug-in modules) eroded the basic Heathkit business model. Assembling a kit might still be fun, but it could no longer save much money. The switch to surface mount components and LSI ICs finally made it impossible for the home assembler to construct an electronic device for significantly less money than assembly line factory products. As sales of its kits dwindled during the decade, Heath relied on its training materials and a new venture in home automation and lighting products to stay afloat. When Zenith eventually sold ZDS to Groupe Bull in 1989, Heathkit was included in the deal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Trace or {{chromatogram}} files (raw data) {{are produced}} by automatic nucleic acid sequencing equipment or sequencers. Each file contains information which can be interpreted by specialised software to reveal the sequence (base calling). This {{is done by the}} sequencer proprietary software or publicly available programs. Depending on the size of a sequencing project the number of trace files can vary from just a few to thousands of files. Sequencing quality assessment on various criteria is important at the stage preceding clustering and contig assembly. Two major publicly available packages – Phred and Staden are used by <b>preAssemble</b> to perform sequence quality processing. Results The <b>preAssemble</b> pre-assembly sequence processing pipeline has been developed for small to large scale automatic processing of DNA sequencer chromatogram (trace) data. The Staden Package Pregap 4 module and base-calling program Phred are utilized in the pipeline, which produces detailed and self-explanatory output that can be displayed with a web browser. <b>preAssemble</b> can be used successfully with very little previous experience, however options for parameter tuning are provided for advanced users. <b>preAssemble</b> runs under UNIX and LINUX operating systems. It is available for downloading and will run as stand-alone software. It can also be accessed on the Norwegian Salmon Genome Project web site where <b>preAssemble</b> jobs can be run on the project server. Conclusion <b>preAssemble</b> is a tool allowing to perform quality assessment of sequences generated by automatic sequencing equipment. <b>preAssemble</b> is flexible since both interactive jobs on the <b>preAssemble</b> server and the stand alone downloadable version are available. Virtually no previous experience is necessary to run a default <b>preAssemble</b> job, on the other hand options for parameter tuning are provided. Consequently <b>preAssemble</b> can be used as efficiently for just several trace files as for large scale sequence processing. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{assembly}} of retroviral particles is {{mediated by the}} product of the gag gene; no other retroviral gene products are necessary for this process. While most retroviruses assemble their capsids at the plasma membrane, viruses of the type D class <b>preassemble</b> immature capsids within the cytoplasm of infected cells. This has allowed us to determine whether immature capsids of the prototypical type D retrovirus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV), can assemble in a cell-free protein synthesis system. We report here that {{assembly of}} M-PMV Gag precursor proteins can occur in this in vitro system. Synthesized particles sediment in isopycnic gradients to the appropriate density and in thin-section electron micrographs have a size and appearance consistent with those of immature retrovirus capsids. The in vitro system described in this report appears to faithfully mimic the process of assembly which occurs in the host cell cytoplasm, since M-PMV gag mutants defective in in vivo assembly also fail to assemble in vitro. Likewise, the Gag precursor proteins of retroviruses that undergo type C morphogenesis, Rous sarcoma virus and human immunodeficiency virus, which do not <b>preassemble</b> capsids in vivo, fail to assemble particles in this system. Additionally, we demonstrate, with the use of anti-Gag antibodies, that this cell-free system can be utilized for analysis in vitro of potential inhibitors of retrovirus assembly...|$|R

40|$|The helicase and primase {{activities}} of the hexameric ring-shaped T 7 gp 4 protein reside in two separate domains connected by a linker region. This linker region {{is part of the}} subunit interface between monomers, and point mutations in this region have deleterious effects on the helicase functions. One such linker region mutant, A 257 T, is analogous to the A 359 T mutant of the homologous human mitochondrial DNA helicase Twinkle, which is linked to diseases such as progressive external opthalmoplegia. Electron microscopy studies show that A 257 T gp 4 is normal in forming rings with dTTP, but the rings do not assemble efficiently on the DNA. Therefore, A 257 T, unlike the WT gp 4, does not <b>preassemble</b> on the unwinding DNA substrate with dTTP without Mg(II), and its DNA unwinding activity in ensemble assays is slow and limited by the DNA loading rate. Single molecule assays measured a 45 times slower rate of A 257 T loading on DNA compared with WT gp 4. Interestingly, once loaded, A 257 T has almost WT-like translocation and DNA unwinding activities. Strikingly, A 257 T <b>preassembles</b> stably on the DNA in the presence of T 7 DNA polymerase, which restores the ensemble unwinding activity of A 257 T to ∼ 75 % of WT, and the rescue does not require DNA synthesis. The DNA loading rate of A 257 T, however, remains slow even {{in the presence of the}} polymerase, which explains why A 257 T does not support T 7 phage growth. Similar types of defects in the related human mitochondrial DNA helicase may be responsible for inefficient DNA replication leading to the disease states...|$|R

KSR-deficient mice were grossly normal even though ERK kinase activation was attenuated to a degree sufficient to block T-cell activation and inhibit tumor development. Consistent with its role as a scaffold, high-molecular-weight complexes containing KSR, MEK, and ERK were lost in the absence of KSR.

This effect was dependent on preassociation of the mutants with WT TACI in the absence of ligand. The mutants did not interfere with ligand binding by WT TACI, suggesting that they may act by disrupting ligand-induced receptor rearrangement and signaling. This work demonstrates that TACI <b>preassembles</b> as an oligomeric complex prior to ligand binding and provides a mechanistic insight into how the heterozygous C 104 R TACI mutation can potentially lead to CVID...|$|R

We found that the proteins are in close enough proximity to form complexes and that these complexes <b>preassemble</b> at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

40|$|AbstractThe Betaretrovirus genus is {{characterized}} by the ability to <b>preassemble</b> immature capsids within the cytoplasm. For Mason–Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) this ability depends in part upon the unique Internal Scaffold Domain (ISD) within the p 12 region of Gag. In this study, we have further characterized the ability of M-PMV p 12 to promote Gag–Gag interaction and have examined the Gag polyprotein of the related mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) to potentially identify a region with equivalent function. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we confirmed that both Gag polyproteins strongly interact, primarily through the CA-NC regions, but also through additional domains N-terminal to CA. For M-PMV, this auxiliary interaction domain was p 12. For MMTV, no single strongly self-interacting protein was identified. Instead, MMTV Gag appears to utilize the weak contributions of several protein domains to support the main interaction of its CA-NC. Our findings suggest that, in addition to the canonical NC “I-domain” interaction, MMTV Gag self-association results from the concerted action of multiple regions of the polyprotein while M-PMV Gag relies mainly on its p 12 domain...|$|R

In the nucleoplasm, the apparent diffusion coefficients for the three molecules ranged from 0. 26 to 0. 40 μm 2 s− 1. However, in CBs, fluorescence recovery was markedly slower than in the nucleoplasm, and there were at least three kinetic components. The recovery rate within CBs was independent of bleach spot diameter and could not be attributed to high CB viscosity or density. We propose that binding to other molecules and possibly assembly into larger complexes are the rate-limiting steps for FRAP of U 7, coilin, and TBP inside CBs...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} models currently {{exist for the}} assembly pathway of the spliceosome, namely, the traditional model, in which spliceosomal snRNPs associate in a stepwise, ordered manner with the pre-mRNA, and the holospliceosome model, in which all spliceosomal snRNPs <b>preassemble</b> into a penta-snRNP complex. Here we have tested whether the spliceosomal A complex, which contains solely U 1 and U 2 snRNPs bound to pre-mRNA, is a functional, bona fide assembly intermediate. Significantly, A complexes affinity-purified from nuclear extract depleted of U 4 /U 6 snRNPs (and thus unable to form a penta-snRNP) supported pre-mRNA splicing in nuclear extract depleted of U 2 snRNPs, whereas naked pre-mRNA did not. Mixing experiments with purified A complexes and naked pre-mRNA additionally confirmed that under these conditions, A complexes do not form de novo. Thus, our studies demonstrate that holospliceosome formation is not a prerequisite for generating catalytically active spliceosomes and that, at least in vitro, the U 1 and U 2 snRNPs can functionally associate with the pre-mRNA, prior to and independent of the tri-snRNP. The ability to isolate functional spliceosomal A complexes paves the way to study in detail subsequent spliceosome assembly steps using purified components...|$|R

Expression of the M-PMV Gag precursor in bacteria results in the assembly of capsids indistinguishable from those assembled in mammalian cells. We have used this system to investigate the structural requirements for the assembly of Gag precursors into procapsids. A series of C- and N-terminal deletion mutants progressively lacking each of the mature Gag domains (matrix protein [MA]-pp 24 / 16 -p 12 -capsid protein [CA]-nucleocapsid protein [NC]-p 4) were constructed and expressed in bacteria.

The role of these N-terminal domains {{is not based on}} a specific amino acid sequence, since both MA-CA-NC and p 12 -CA-NC polyproteins efficiently assemble into capsids.

40|$|Cilia are microtubule-based organelles {{and perform}} motile, sensing and {{signaling}} functions. The assembly {{and maintenance of}} cilia depend on intraflagellar transport (IFT). Besides ciliary localization, most IFT proteins accumulate at basal bodies. However, {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanism of basal body targeting of IFT proteins. We first identified the possible basal body-targeting sequence in IFT 46 by expressing IFT 46 truncation constructs in an ift 46 - 1 mutant. The C-terminal sequence between residues 246 - 321, termed BBTS 3, was sufficient to target YFP to basal bodies in the ift 46 - 1 strain. Interestingly, BBTS 3 is also responsible for the ciliary targeting of IFT 46. BBTS 3 :: YFP moves bidirectionally in flagella and interacts with other IFT complex B (IFT-B) proteins. Using IFT and motor mutants, we show that the basal body localization of IFT 46 depends on IFT 52, but not on IFT 81, IFT 88, IFT 122, FLA 10 or DHC 1 b. IFT 52 interacts with IFT 46 through residues L 285 and L 286 of IFT 46 and recruits it to basal bodies. Ectopic expression of the C-terminal domain of IFT 52 in the nucleus resulted in accumulation of IFT 46 in nuclei. These data suggest that IFT 52 and IFT 46 can <b>preassemble</b> as a complex in the cytoplasm, which is then targeted to basal bodies...|$|R
