5|$|While {{the party}} was in <b>power,</b> <b>press</b> {{secretary}} Alastair Campbell installed a centralised organisation to co-ordinate government communication and impose a united message to be delivered by ministers. Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's press officer, was often in conflict with Campbell because of the former's attempts to brief the press by his own initiatives; this continued until his resignation in 1999. Campbell followed a professional approach to media relations {{to ensure that a}} clear message was presented, and the party planned stories in advance to ensure a positive media reaction. Campbell used his own experience in journalism; he was known for his attention to detail and effective use of sound bites. Campbell developed a relationship with News International, providing their newspapers with early information in return for positive media coverage.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the mold cavity with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once the mold cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a <b>power</b> <b>press</b> or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|E

40|$|Compressed earth blocks constructions are {{appropriate}} {{for the improvement of}} the housing conditions in poor contexts, in particular in developing countries. The blocks are produced using manually operated presses, preferably bidirectional. The bidirectional human <b>powered</b> <b>presses</b> currently available are mechanically complex, difficult to use and very expensive. In order to overcome these issues, the paper presents the concept and the design of a new bidirectional human <b>powered</b> <b>press</b> for compressed earth blocks, called Float-Ram. The press is characterized by: the adoption of a floating mold, which provides a bi-directional pressing action in simple way; an optimized kinematic structure, based on a cam-roller follower transmission system; a general mechanical simplicity, since the node of all kinematic pairs is constituted by a single shaft. The Float-Ram, tested on the laboratory and on the field, can be considered as an important media for the diffusion of highquality raw earth building in developing countries...|$|R
