25|$|On 2 June 2003, Coast Air {{started its}} first head-on {{competition}} with Scandinavian Airlines. Using the ATR planes, Coast Air started with two daily round services between Haugesund and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. By September, Coast Air increased to three daily round trips, and reduced prices to NOK500. From 9 October, Scandinavian Airlines reduced their prices by 22% {{on the route}}. On 16 February, Coast Air also started competing with Braathens and Widerøe on the route between Stavanger and Bergen, marketing it as a low-fare service and ticket prices as low as NOK199. The Haugesund–Oslo route cost Coast Air NOK11 million in 2003. In March 2004, Coast Air was forced to close the Stord to Oslo route, after several reductions in frequency during the past year. To create more inertia on the Bergen–Stavanger route, Coast Air also started a cooperation with DAT, where the latter flew an extra daily round trip. Following the losses of the Haugesund–Oslo and Bergen–Stavanger routes, they were terminated in May 2004. In December, the Norwegian Competition Authority started investigating Scandinavian Airlines for illegal <b>price</b> <b>dumping</b> on the Oslo–Haugesund route. The authority suspected that SAS had illegally cross-subsidized the route {{to fend off the}} competition, and announced the company would be fined NOK20 million. The case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was found not guilty. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had broken the law, but that since it happened just after the act came into power, they would not have to pay the fine.|$|E

40|$|Although cost-plus pricing {{is often}} used in B 2 B markets it has the serious {{drawback}} that it ignores both customer price sensitivity and potential competitor action. Most B 2 B markets are oligopolies {{so that there is}} an ever-present risk of a price-war if any of the competitors engage in aggressive price-cutting. Firms should be encouraged to think of pricing as a continuous process rather than a once-off decision. This process involves several different departments, which may have rather different views on pricing priorities (for example, sales people tend to over-estimate the responsiveness of customers to price, while accountants tend to focus on the short-term cash-flow implications of pricing rather than longer-term strategy). Two aspects of pricing that are particularly important in B 2 B markets are bid pricing and price-setting within long-term buyer-seller relationships. Pricing raises a number of important ethical issues, notably anti-competitive pricing, price fixing, price collusion, price discrimination, predatory <b>pricing</b> (<b>dumping)</b> and <b>price</b> gougin...|$|R

40|$|The report {{identifies}} {{concerns with}} the EU anti-dumping instrument, as applied today, {{regardless of the}} fact that the investigation procedures and methods might be in line with the current regulation and practice. The report's arguments are based on the recent anti-dumping investigation – and imposition of anti-dumping measures – on imports of ceramic tiles from China, but the observations and conclusions from the analysis are valid for most EU anti-dumping investigations. The report observes that <b>price</b> <b>dumping</b> is evaluated differently depending on whether the product is manufactured in the EU or imported from third countries. What is considered to be <b>price</b> <b>dumping</b> when imported is considered normal competition for a product manufactured in the EU. This is due to the fact that spatial price differentiation within the EU is covered by competition rules, and that competition rules have higher requirements for market share and price undercutting than the anti-dumping legislation. The report, accordingly, advocates that the criteria for imposing anti-dumping duties should be harmonized to the EU competition rules in order to ensure fair competition on the EU market. In the absence of a reformed anti-dumping regulation, the anti-dumping measures will most likely only contribute to a distorted competition where the complaining EU manufacturing industry will be protected to the detriment of the consumers. ...|$|E
