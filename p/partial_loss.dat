We find that entanglement can vanish completely for <b>partial</b> <b>losses,</b> in a situation reminiscent of so-called entanglement sudden death. Even states with extreme squeezing may become separable after propagation in lossy channels. Having in mind the potential applications of such entangled light beams to optical communications, we investigate the conditions under which entanglement can survive for all <b>partial</b> <b>losses.</b> Different loss scenarios are examined, and we derive criteria to test the robustness of entangled states. These criteria are necessary and sufficient for Gaussian states. Our study provides a framework to investigate the robustness of continuous-variable entanglement in more complex multipartite systems...|$|R

The initials are difficult to decipher because of <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of the gilt Copperplate script. Possibilities include HCA or HA, TCA or FCA over B. Several candidates have been suggested including Henry, 3rd Earl of Bathurst, and Sir Thomas Brisbane, New South Wales Governor in 1821–1825 after Lachlan Macquarie, but the most likely is Henry Colden Antill (1779–1852). Antill was appointed aide-de-camp to the fifth New South Wales Governor, Macquarie who was in office 1810–1821, on his arrival in Sydney on 1January 1810. He was promoted to Major of Brigade in 1811 and retired from the British Army in 1821. Antill settled on land first at Moorebank near Liverpool and then in 1825 on his estate near Picton—named Jarvisfield in honour of Macquarie's first wife, Jane Jarvis. He was buried at Jarvisfield on 14August 1851. Antill had subdivided part of the estate in 1844, making possible {{the founding of the}} town of Picton. When the State Library acquired its punchbowl in 1926, the Antill family of Picton — Henry's antecedents — had no knowledge of the punchbowl's provenance.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the sensitivity or insensitivity of structures to local damage {{has been a major}} research field during the last decades, mainly provoked due to the series of aging structures and infrastructures. Many researchers have described this property as redundancy, others as the resistance to disproportionate collapse or robustness and still others as the ability of structural systems to display alternate load paths in case of a local damage. In any case, the problem for the {{evaluation of}} this property is increasingly alarming since many systems experience similar collapses (American Society of Civil Engineers (2009). Proceedings of Structures Congress on the first international symposium on disproportionate collapse. ASCE, Austin, TX).

25|$|For {{several centuries}} of the Medieval era, the {{vineyards}} of Germany (including Alsace) expanded, and {{is believed to}} have reached their greatest extent sometime around 1500, when perhaps as much as four times the present vineyard surface was planted. Basically, the wine regions were located in the same places as today, but more lands around the rivers, and land further upstream Rhine's tributaries, was cultivated.

25|$|This {{period was}} marked by a <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of Lisbon's {{economic}} vitality when Brazil became independent and its gold and other products no longer flowed into the capital. During the Cabralismo, the period from 1842 to 1846 when António Bernardo da Costa Cabral dominated Portuguese politics, noble titles were assigned {{to many of the}} more important bourgeoisie, as a compromise with the Conservative Party that had some success. With the loss of earnings from Brazil, dependence on the state became attractive for the leisure class, who feared competition from the neo-aristocrats and supported traditionally rigid social divisions. It was at this time that titles of 'Baron' and 'Viscount' multiplied among the landed property owners, many of them hereditary, but many others being limited {{to the life of the}} beneficiary receiving rents from the state or engaged in the corrupt politics of the time. The territorial aristocracy acquired the habit of spending the winters in Lisbon, staying in their manor houses (solars) only in summer. However, it was the common people who suffered most from the wars and the loss of Brazil, as the city's economy stagnated and it lost its international influence, going from the fifth most populous city in Europe to the tenth and continuing downward.

40|$|In a {{population}} of Florida scrub-jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens (Bosc, 1795), in a suburban scrub habitat, <b>partial</b> brood <b>loss</b> is much more common (averaging about 30 % of nestlings from successful nests) than in a natural habitat (averaging about 5 %). We hypothesized that this <b>partial</b> brood <b>loss</b> was attributable to starvation of last-hatched nestlings (i. e., brood reduction), and that large differences in <b>partial</b> brood <b>loss</b> were caused by differences in arthropod food abundance between the two sites. To test these hypotheses, we closely monitored nests in suburban scrub in 1999 and performed arthropod surveys and focal-nest observations in both habitats in 1998 and 1999. In suburban scrub, later hatched nestlings were {{three times more likely}} to die before fledging than earlier hatched nestlings, suggesting that brood reduction occurred. In both years, arthropod abundance in the suburban scrub was less than half that of the natural scrub. However, patterns of food delivery by parents were not significantly different between sites, suggesting that lower food abundance does not in itself explain higher <b>partial</b> brood <b>loss</b> in suburban habitat. Differences in the number of helpers, a greater degree of hatching asynchrony or the delivery of lower quality food throughout the nestling period may increase the probability that later hatched nestlings starve in suburban scrub...|$|R

Presumably ten years before the events of House, at a [...] "Doctors vs. Lawyers" [...] paintball game, she met Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) with whom she started a romantic relationship. Five years later, during a game of golf, House suffered an infarction in his right leg. He was admitted at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, but went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug-seeking behavior (House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself). An aneurysm in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest. He was willing to endure excruciating post-operative pain to retain the use of his leg. After he was put into a chemically induced coma to sleep through the worst of the pain, Stacy, his medical proxy at the time, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between amputation and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in the <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of use in his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive series of UKAs used in patients with <b>partial</b> thickness cartilage <b>loss</b> in the medial compartment of the knee. Patients and Methods: Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in 90 patients with <b>partial</b> thickness cartilage <b>loss</b> and followed up independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients had <b>partial</b> thickness cartilage <b>loss</b> either on both femur and tibia (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively). Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1 : 2 based on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees in 36 patients with <b>partial</b> thickness cartilage <b>loss,</b> who had pre-operative MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors identified on MRI that predicted the outcome. Results: Knees with <b>partial</b> thickness cartilage <b>loss</b> had significantly worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees with <b>partial</b> thickness <b>loss</b> had a fair or poor result and a fifth failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with <b>partial</b> thickness <b>loss</b> was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters), were arthroscopies for persistent pain. Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients with <b>partial</b> thickness cartilage <b>loss</b> who achieved fair or poor outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores. However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics. MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema, synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information. Conclusion: Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients with <b>partial</b> thickness <b>loss</b> achieve a good result we cannot currently identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful and misleading...|$|R
