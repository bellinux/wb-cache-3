5|$|Since Svalbard {{is located}} {{north of the}} Arctic Circle it {{experiences}} midnight sun in summer and <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> in winter. At 74° north, the midnight sun lasts 99 days and <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> 84 days, while the respective figures at 81° are 141 and 128 days. In Longyearbyen, midnight sun lasts from 20 April until 23 August, and <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> lasts from 26 October to 15 February. In winter, the combination of full moon and reflective snow can give additional light.|$|E
5|$|Above the Arctic Circle, {{an extreme}} case is reached {{where there is}} no {{daylight}} at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a <b>polar</b> <b>night.</b> In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.|$|E
5|$|The {{archipelago}} {{features an}} Arctic climate, although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas {{at the same}} latitude. The flora {{take advantage of the}} long period of midnight sun to compensate for the <b>polar</b> <b>night.</b> Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds, and also features polar bears, reindeer, the Arctic fox, and certain marine mammals. Seven national parks and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of the archipelago, protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, natural environment. Approximately 60% of the archipelago is covered with glaciers, and the islands feature many mountains and fjords.|$|E

5|$|As {{temperatures}} {{continue to}} rise, the last animal {{life will be}} driven back toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the <b>polar</b> <b>night,</b> aestivating during the polar day due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily {{be found in the}} oceans. However, due to a decrease of the amount or organic matter coming to the oceans from the land as well as oxygen in the water, life would disappear there too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of freshwater species and conclude with invertebrates, particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia. As a result of these processes, multi-cellular lifeforms may be extinct in about 800 million years, and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|The second depot-laying party left Framheim on 22February, {{with eight}} men, seven sledges and forty-two dogs. Conditions on the Barrier had {{deteriorated}} sharply; average temperatures had dropped by 9°C (16°F), and rough snow had drifted across the previously smooth ice surface. In temperatures sometimes {{as low as}} , on 3March the party reached 81°S, where they established a second depot. Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Prestrud, Johansen and Wisting then continued with the strongest dogs, hoping to reach 83°S, but in difficult conditions they halted at 82°S on 8March. Amundsen {{could see that the}} dogs were exhausted; the party turned for home, and with light sledges travelled swiftly to reach Framheim on 22 March. Amundsen wanted more supplies taken south before the impending <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> made travel impossible, and on 31 March a party of seven men led by Johansen left Framheim for the 80°S depot with six slaughtered seals— of meat. The party returned on 11 April—three days later than expected—after they strayed into a field of crevasses.|$|E

50|$|The novel {{does not}} seem to take into account that due to the {{ellipticity}} of the orbit the planet would be in a near-equinoxe position during most of the orbiting period, which would mean that both poles would enjoy a mild twilight. If the orbit were less elliptic there would be no arctic twilight zone at all but <b>polar</b> <b>nights</b> and days of varying length, like on Earth. So {{it is hard to imagine}} the astronomic circumstances needed for Harrison's interesting plot.|$|R
50|$|Situated {{far north}} of the Arctic Circle, Finnmark has midnight sun {{from the middle of}} May until late July. Conversely, in two months of the winter, from late November to late January, the county {{experiences}} <b>polar</b> <b>nights</b> where the sun is always below the horizon. As a consequence, there is continuous daylight from early May to early August. At midwinter, there is only a bluish twilight {{for a couple of hours}} around noon, which can almost reach full daylight if there are clear skies to the south.|$|R
5000|$|Qantassaurus lived 115 {{million years}} ago in Australia, during the late Aptian/early Albian age of the early Cretaceous period.

25|$|The {{sun sets}} on November 18 or 19, {{and it remains}} below the horizon for about 65 days. This creates a <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> that lasts until the Sun returns to lightly touch the horizon (due to the {{refraction}} and scattering of the atmosphere) by January 22 or January 23. The sun then rises again completely over the horizon by January 27 or 28. During {{the first half of}} the <b>polar</b> <b>night,</b> there is a decreasing amount of twilight each day, and on the winter solstice (around December 21 or December 22), civil twilight in Barrow lasts for a mere 3 hours.|$|E
25|$|The <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> lasts from 8 November until 3 February, and {{the period}} of midnight sun from 2 May until 11 August. With just 595 hours of bright {{sunshine}} per year, Bear Island has the lowest average yearly sunshine in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Climatic {{conditions}} {{here are}} very severe with lowest temperature touching minus (-)25 °C to (-) 30 °C during winter; even in summers the temperature does not rise above 0 C. The <b>polar</b> <b>nights</b> lasts for 125 days while the polar days are 140. Climatically {{none of the}} Gulf Streams touch the 75 islands of the Franz Josef Land. While Polynias are the wind and sea currents that prevail in {{the northern and southern}} part of the land mass, which are the causative factors for the large ice free zone in the sea, the eastern and northern winds cause very cold breeze. The rainfall in the land varies between 100 mm and 300 mm but mostly in the form of snow.|$|R
25|$|The {{combination}} of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: Mørketid (<b>polar</b> <b>night)</b> and Seinvinter (late winter).|$|E
25|$|The sun remains {{below the}} horizon during the <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> from about 26 November to 15 January, but owing to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an {{occasion}} for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight {{for a couple of}} hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm, and by 1 April it is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time).|$|E
25|$|The main forces {{influencing}} the climate are the glaciation and sea ice. At 81° north the archipelago experiences 141 annual days of midnight sun, from 12 April to 30 August. During the winter it experiences 128 days of <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> from 19 October to 23 February. Even during summer {{the angle of}} the sun ray spreads the limited radiated energy over a large area. Further cooling is caused by the high amount of cloudiness. The sea starts to freeze in late September and reaches its annual maximum in March, at which time ninety-five percent of the sea is ice-covered. The ice starts to decrease in May and suffers a major melting in June, with the minimum occurring in August or early September.|$|E

40|$|We used thermal-infrared spectra {{returned}} by the Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFSMEx) to retrieve atmospheric temperature profiles, surface temperatures, and column-integrated optical depths {{of dust and}} water ice.

By exploiting PFS/MEx capability to perform observations at different local times (LT), this dataset allows investigation of the daily cycles of suspended dust and ice. We present an overview of the seasonal and latitudinal dependence of atmospheric quantities during the relevant period, as well as an assessment of the interannual variability in the current Martian climate. Daily variations of Martian aerosols are also presented, including dust during the global dust storm of MY 28, and water ice in the aphelion cloud belt.

The work itself then provides a brief description of the palaeographic position of the Arctic and Antarctic regions, their palaeoclimatic situations, organisms inhabiting their terrestrial and marine environments and their adaptation mechanisms. Further, a more detailed review of the land plants is presented. The last part is dedicated to the specific survival strategies of the land plants in the polar regions during the warm geological periods.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} dynamic and thermal {{response}} of the winter stratosphere {{to the presence of}} a weak meridional surface temperature gradient. Previous work suggested that polar stratospheric clouds could have played a decisive role in maintaining high-latitude warmth, especially over continental interiors, during the <b>polar</b> <b>nights</b> of the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs; both a chemical source of additional water vapor and a dynamical feedback between the surface climate and stratospheric temperatures have been proposed as mechanisms by which such clouds could form. A principal goal of this work is to investigate the latter problem using a general circulation model with stratospheric resolution that is forced with a very weak surface temperature gradient. It is found that temperatures in the lower stratosphere do not deviate significantly from the control run, which results from a robust flux of wave activity into the winter stratosphere. The strength of the stratosphere’s residual circulation increases slightly {{in the presence of the}} weak gradient, as wavenumber 3 begins to propagate to stratospheric altitudes. Changes in the zonal wind field that allow for the altered propagation are in balance with a weakened temperature gradient through the full depth of the troposphere. These simulations also suggest that the tropospheric thermal stratification could be maintained by moist convection at all latitudes in warm climate states with a weak temperature gradient. 1...|$|R
40|$|The North Atlantic spring bloom is {{a massive}} annual growth event of marine phytoplankton, tiny {{free-floating}} algae that form {{the base of the}} ocean's food web and generates a large fraction of the global primary production of organic matter. The conditions that trigger the onset of the spring bloom in the Nordic Seas, at the northern edge of the North Atlantic, are studied using in situ data from six bio-optical floats released north of the Arctic Circle. It is often assumed that spring blooms start as soon as phytoplankton cells daily irradiance is sufficiently abundant that division rates exceed losses. The bio-optical float data instead suggest the tantalizing hypothesis that Nordic Seas blooms start when the photoperiod, the number of daily light hours experienced by phytoplankton, exceeds a critical value, independently of division rates. The photoperiod trigger may have developed at high latitudes where photosynthesis is impossible during <b>polar</b> <b>nights</b> and phytoplankton enters into a dormant stage in winter. While the first accumulation of biomass recorded by the bio-optical floats is consistent with the photoperiod hypothesis, it is possible that some biomass accumulation started before the critical photoperiod but at levels too low to be detected by the fluorometers. More precise observations are needed to test the photoperiod hypothesis. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (NSF award OCE- 1155205...|$|R
