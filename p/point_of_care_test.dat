40|$|BACKGROUND: Many <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> {{diagnostic}} {{technologies are}} available which produce results within minutes, and offer {{the opportunity to}} deliver acute <b>care</b> out <b>of</b> hospital settings. Increasing access to diagnostics at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> could increase the volume and scope <b>of</b> acute ambulatory <b>care.</b> Yet these technologies are not routinely used in many settings. We aimed to explore how <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> is used in a setting where it has become 'normalized' (embedded in everyday practice), in order to inform future adoption and implementation in other settings. We used normalization process theory to guide our case study approach. METHODS: We used a single case study design, choosing a community based ambulatory <b>care</b> unit where <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> is used routinely. A focused ethnographic approach was taken, including non-participant observation of all activities related to <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing,</b> and semi-structured interviews, with all clinical staff involved in <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> at the unit. Data were analysed thematically, guided by normalization process theory. RESULTS: Fourteen days of observation and six interviews were completed. Staff had a shared understanding of the purpose, value and benefits <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing,</b> believing it to be integral to {{the running of the}} unit. They organised themselves as a team to ensure that <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> worked effectively; and one key individual led a change in practice to ensure more consistency and trust in procedures. Staff assessed <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> as worthwhile for the unit, their patients, and themselves in terms of job satisfaction and knowledge. Potential barriers to adoption <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> were evident (including lack of trust in the accuracy of some results compared to laboratory testing; and lack of ease of use of some aspects of the equipment); but these did not prevent <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> from becoming embedded, because the importance and value attributed to it were so strong. CONCLUSIONS: This case study offers insights into successful adoption of new diagnostic technologies into every day practice. Such analyses may be critical to realising their potential to change processes <b>of</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R

Results 23 studies (total number of patients 13 959, range in mean age 38 - 65 years, range of venous thromboembolism prevalence 4 - 51 %) were included in the meta-analysis. The studies reported two qualitative <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> D-dimer <b>tests</b> (SimpliRED D-dimer (n= 12) and Clearview Simplify D-dimer (n= 7)) and two quantitative <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> D-dimer <b>tests</b> (Cardiac D-dimer (n= 4) and Triage D-dimer (n= 2)).

40|$|<b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> {{describes}} testing using handheld or benchtop technology, {{where the}} result will be used in the screening for, or the diagnosis and/or the management of, disease. It is an alternative to using the services of a centralized facility such as a laboratory. The successful use <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> technology demands that the quality of the result can be assured and that a clinical and/or economic benefit can be demonstrated. As with benchtop technology, handheld technologies have features to deal with all the steps in the analytical process. The quality of the result depends on the manufacturing process of the device and the competence of the operator. The potential for clinical and/or economic benefit will exist wherever the rapid provision of the result enables a decision to be made immediately and appropriate action implemented. This may include making or ruling out a diagnosis; the latter leading to an alternative diagnostic pathway or discharge of the patient. The clinical benefits, however, will also depend on the implementation of an intervention and will be measured in terms of improved morbidity and mortality. However, in both the design of outcome studies as well as the routine management of patients, surrogate markers of outcome may be used to assess the value of the test and intervention. In patients with chronic diseases a test may be used to assess the status of the patient and the effectiveness of the intervention, thus playing an important role in maintaining patient compliance. Diabetes mellitus provides an excellent exemplar <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> producing both positive clinical and economic outcomes in the management of a chronic disease. The speedy availability of results has also been shown to facilitate rapid decision making in acute medical situations such as in the emergency room and operating room. As a more patient-focussed approach to healthcare is being adopted leading to the requirement for faster access to results, as well as more testing being undertaken in the home and the primary care setting, the demand for <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>testing</b> technology is set to increase dramatically. Changes in clinical practice will need to be made to maximize the benefits of testing to the patient and healthcare provider.

40|$|Background: Early {{detection}} of complications significantly reduces dengue associated mortality and morbidity. We {{set out to}} determine if the NS 1 rapid antigen detection test {{could be used as a}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>test</b> to predict severe disease. Methods: 186 adult patients with confirmed dengue were enrolled during day 3 – 8 of illness. Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded during the course of the illness and NS 1 antigen levels were determined using both the Panbio dengue early ELISA (Panbio, Australia) and a NS 1 rapid antigen detection kit (SD Bioline, South Korea). Results: 59. 1 % of patients presented to hospital on day 5 – 6 of illness when NS 1 antigen positivity was significantly (p = 0. 008) associated with severe dengue (odds ratio 3. 0, 95 % CI 1. 39 to 6. 47) and the NS 1 antigen levels were significantly higher (p = 0. 03) in those who went on to develop shock.

The bedside NS 1 test showed comparable sensitivity (97. 4 %) and specificity (93. 7 %) to the laboratory NS 1 test in our setting and cohort.

Patients and pharmacists involved in service provision were asked to complete a satisfaction survey. Pharmacists were additionally invited to undertake interviews to better understand their views on the service. Main outcome measures: Feasibility of service, acceptability to stakeholders and proportion testing positive for coeliac disease. Results: Of the 551 individuals tested, 52 (9. 4 %) tested positive. 277 (50. 3 %) were tested for accessing irritable bowel syndrome treatment, 142 (25. 8 %) due to presenting for diarrhoea. The proportion of patients testing positive with different symptoms or for different treatments were similar. Of 43 customers who returned the satisfaction survey, all would recommend the service to others, believing the community pharmacy to be a suitable location.
