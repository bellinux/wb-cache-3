40|$|The {{cyanobacterium}} Planktothrix agardhii, {{which is}} dominant in many shallow eutrophic lakes, can produce hepatotoxic microcystins. Currently, more than 70 different microcystin variants have been described, which differ in toxicity. In this study, {{the effect of}} <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> on the production of different microcystin variants by P. agardhii was investigated using light-limited turbidostats. Both {{the amount of the}} mRNA transcript of the mcyA gene and the total microcystin production rate increased with <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> up to 60 µmol m– 2 s– 1, but they started to decrease with irradiance greater than 100 µmol m– 2 s– 1. The cellular content of total microcystin remained constant, independent of the irradiance. However, of the two main microcystin variants detected in P. agardhii, the microcystin-DeRR content decreased twofold with increased <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance,</b> whereas the microcystin-DeLR content increased threefold. Since microcystin-DeLR is considerably more toxic than microcystin-DeRR, this implies that P. agardhii becomes more toxic at high light intensities.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} a {{comparative}} study on diversity and species composition of subaerial algal communities from tree barks of closed undisturbed sacred grove, mixed plantation, and open disturbed forest. A total of 85 taxa had been recorded, 30 cyanobacteria and 55 algal species belonging to six classes of algae. Sacred grove harboured the highest subaerial algal diversity compared to those of plantation and open disturbed forest. There was a strong significant difference in species composition among the three different sampling areas. High number of diatoms with 14 species was recorded in sacred grove. Cyanobacteria with 22 species were the frequent group in disturbed forest whereas Trentepohliales dominated in plantation. Canonical correspondence analysis confirmed that high <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> favored the growth of cyanobacteria in disturbed forest. The abundance of Trentepohliales members correlated to high rainfall and <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance.</b> High diversity and presence of many diatom species in undisturbed Mawphlang sacred grove were associated with low <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> and high relative humidity and could also {{be due to a}} presence of suitable substrata formed by the growth of mosses.

40|$|SummaryStomata are pores on the {{surfaces}} of leaves that regulate gas exchange between the plant interior and the atmosphere [1]. Plants adapt to changing environmental conditions {{in the short term}} by adjusting the aperture of the stomatal pores, whereas longer-term changes are accomplished by altering the proportion of stomata that develop on the leaf surface [2, 3]. Although recent work has identified genes involved in the control of stomatal development [4], we know very little about how stomatal development is modulated by environmental signals, such as light. Here, we show that mature leaves of Arabidopsis grown at higher <b>photon</b> <b>irradiances</b> show significant increases in stomatal index (S. I.) [5] compared to those grown at lower <b>photon</b> <b>irradiances.</b> Light quantity-mediated changes in S. I. occur in red light, suggesting that phytochrome photoreceptors [6] are involved. By using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that this response is dominated by phytochrome B and also identify a role for the transcription factor, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF 4) [7]. In sum, we identify a photoreceptor and downstream signaling protein involved in light-mediated control of stomatal development, thereby establishing a tractable system for investigating how an environmental signal modulates stomatal development...|$|R
40|$|Light signals {{perceived}} by the phytochrome family of red (R) and far-red (FR) light-absorbing photoreceptors direct plant growth and development throughout their lifecycle. In contrast to other family members, phyA displays rapid light-induced proteolytic degradation upon conversion to the biologically active Pfr form and mediates high irradiance responses to continuous FR. These unique properties together with limited examples of phyA function in R have resulted in an over-simplified portrayal of phyA as a FR sensor which acts predominantly in seed germination and early stages of seedling de-etiolation. In a recent work, published in The Plant Journal, we report significant phyA activity in Arabidopsis thaliana at high (> 100 µmolm− 2 s− 1) <b>photon</b> <b>irradiances</b> of R. Under these conditions, we observed retarded degradation of a pool of nuclear-localised phyA, consistent with the phenomenon of photoprotection, and showed phyBphyCphyDphyE quadruple null mutants, containing only functional phyA, to de-etiolate and survive to flowering. The <b>photon</b> <b>irradiances</b> {{used in this study}} were greater than those routinely used for photomorphogenic analysis in the laboratory but considerably lower than those commonly observed in daylight.

40|$|This {{study is}} about how changed light {{conditions}} induce dormancy in plants. It is divided in two parts. First a literature study where quantification of light, the concept dormancy, photoperiod and light quality are discussed. Second an experimental part, where the importance of light for sprouting capacity in root buds of perennial sow thistle (Sonchus arvensis L.) is investigated. In the science in how flowering in plants are induced the concepts short day/long day plants and light dominant/dark dominant are well-established. These concepts can also be applied to how light induce dormancy in plants. Plants are divided into short-day plants and long-day plants depending on if endodormancy is induced when day length is longer than a critical threshold value (long-day plants) or shorter than a critical threshold value (short-day plants). Plants can detect both light quality and <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance.</b> Both decrease in the dusk and can therefore be of importance to denote the day length. For {{the most of the}} plants that has been studied, it has been showed that it is the duration of night length (dark dominant) that is important not the daylight as the classification (short-day/long-day) might trick you to believe. But it also exist plants that the duration of the light is important (light dominant), even then they is less common. Studies in spruce (Picea abies) have showed that light quality might be important for how dormancy is induced. So it is many aspects of lights that theoretically can be of importance for how dormancy is induced in plants. Earlier studies have shown that perennial sow thistle has a dormancy stage in autumn. This reduces the sprouting capacity after fragmentation and makes the plant less vulnerable to mechanical control at autumn. In the experimental part perennial sow thistle was exposed to three treatments: (i) long-day with low intensity (18 / 6 light/dark, <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> 324 μmol/m 2 s), (ii) short-day with low intensity (12 / 12 h light/dark, <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> 324 μmol/m 2 s) and (iii) short-day with high intensity (12 / 12 h light/dark, <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> 485 μmol/m 2 s). Sprouting capacity was evaluated based on proportion of sprouting buds from short fragments. Neither of the daylength treatments used here had any significant effect on sprouting capacity. Sprouting capacity was higher when the irradiance was low. This was not expected and is probably not the cause of dormancy induction in perennial sow thistle...|$|E

Spectral irradiance measurements indicate that 75 % of the signal detectable by the PAM originates in the upper 150 mu m of the sediment. From the photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) measurements, {{it was concluded that}} the PAM could be used to observe changes in photosynthetic parameters during the day or the season. Photoacclimation to lower irradiance was indicated by changes in the maximum ETR and the saturating <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> parameter I-k. When cores were exposed to a high <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> for several hours, vertical migration could be followed using reflectance spectra. The data also showed that the benthic algae did not seem to experience photoinhibition or CO 2 limitation. To explain this, it is hypothesised that there is a continuous vertical migration in the top layer of the sediment, where algae can avoid photoinhibition due to prolonged periods of high irradiance and lack of CO 2 by migrating downwards while others migrate upwards.

Two stable, distinct morphotypes occurred in this population at two sampling sites exposed to different daily <b>photon</b> <b>irradiances.</b> Uprights from the more illuminated site were regularly pinnate, with numerous closely packed lateral branches, representing the best-known phenotype of the species; in contrast, uprights from the more shaded inner site had very long and narrow axes, greater intervals between first-order branches and lower branching order.

40|$|Buoyant cyanobacteria, {{previously}} mixed {{throughout the}} water column, float {{to the lake}} surface and form a surface waterbloom when mixing subsides. At the surface, the cells are exposed to full sunlight, and this abrupt change in <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> may induce photoinhibition; at the same time, temperature rises as well. This study investigated the damaging effects of this increase in temperature {{as well as the}} ecologically more relevant combination of both an increased temperature and a high <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance.</b> Analysis of surface blooms with oxygen microelectrodes showed that integrated oxygen contents that are dependent on the balance of photosynthetic oxygen evolution and respiratory oxygen uptake decreased when temperature was raised about the lake temperature. Gross rates of photosynthesis were unaffected by temperatures up to of 35 degrees C; hence, a moderate increase in temperature mainly stimulated oxygen uptake. Preincubation of cells of the cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae (Lyngb.) de Brebisson at temperatures up to 35 degrees C did not affect the subsequent measurement of rates of net photosynthesis. Another 5 degrees C rise in temperature severely damaged the photosynthetic apparatus. Failure to restore net rates of photosynthesis was coupled to a strong quenching of the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence, F-v/F-m, that {{was the result of a}} rise in F- 0. A combination of high temperature and high <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> was more damaging than high temperature alone. In contrast, low photon irradiances offered substantial protection against heat injury of the photosynthetic apparatus. I conclude from this study that because cyanobacteria usually are acclimated to low average irradiance prior to bloom formation, there is a reasonable risk of chronic photoinhibition. The increase in temperature will enhance the photodamage of cells in the top layer of the bloom. Low photon irradiances in subsurface layers will offer protection against heat injury. If the high temperatures extend to the deepest, dark layers of the bloom, damage in those layers is likely to occur...|$|E

In {{an attempt to}} reveal the factors that control this pattern, a series of measurements were carried out using online acetylene reduction assay. Light response curves of nitrogenase were recorded applying various concentrations of oxygen. The effect of oxygen depended on the irradiance applied. Above a <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> of 16 μmol m 2 s 1 nitrogenase activity was highest under anoxic conditions. Below this irradiance the presence of oxygen was required to achieve highest nitrogenase activity and in the dark 5 % oxygen was optimal. At any oxygen concentration a <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> of 100 μmol m 2 s 1 was saturating. When Trichodesmium was incubated in the dark, nitrogenase activity gradually decreased and this decline was higher at higher levels of oxygen.

This recovery depended on oxygenic photosynthesis {{because it did not}} occur in the presence of DCMU [3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea]. Recovery of nitrogenase activity in the light was faster at low oxygen concentrations. The results showed that under aerobic conditions nitrogenase activity was limited by the availability of reducing equivalents suggesting a competition for electrons between nitrogenase and respiration. ...|$|E
40|$|In Brazil, {{pastures}} for cattle ranching {{are being}} established {{in areas that}} were previously forested. To investigate some consequences of this change in land use we measured fluxes of CO 2 and water vapour over a typical pasture, dominated by the introduced C- 4 grass Brachiaria brizantha. In addition, we compared the CO 2, water vapour fluxes and canopy stomatal conductances observed with those obtained simultaneously over a nearby undisturbed rain forest. Measurements were made {{near the end of}} the wet season under conditions of ample soil moisture. Leaf area index of the pasture was 3. 9. The pasture had a lower canopy stomatal conductance than the forest (typically 0. 2 - 0. 3 mol m(- 2) s(- 1) versus 0. 4 - 0. 9 mol m(- 2) s(- 1) at high <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance)</b> and was less responsive to the canopy-to-air vapour pressure difference. As a consequence of these lower canopy stomatal conductances, the pasture used much less water than the forest with average values over the period examined being 153 mol H 2 O m(- 2) d(- 1) and 249 mol H 2 O m(- 2) d(- 1) for pasture and forest respectively (2. 74 and 4. 48 mm d(- 1) respectively). This was also reflected by differing fractions of the absorbed energy being dissipated as evaporation. This proportion was typically 0. 56 for the pasture and 0. 74 for the forest. After allowing for soil and plant respiration, average daily photosynthetic rates were 0. 67 mol C m(- 2) d(- 1) for the pasture and 0. 57 mol C m(- 2) d(- 1) for the forest (8. 0 and 6. 8 g C m(- 2) d(- 1), respectively). Thus, despite an appreciably lower rate of water use the pasture assimilated more carbon on a daily basis. Nevertheless, Brachiaria displayed a somewhat lower rate of photosynthesis than expected for a C- 4 grass, perhaps because of a low nutrient status. Indeed, at low and medium <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> the pasture and forest showed remarkably similar photosynthetic performance. There was, however, less tendency for CO 2 assimilation rates of the pasture canopy to saturate at high <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance.</b> The respiratory fluxes from the two ecosystems at night were quite similar, 6 - 8 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1). The ratio of intercellular CO 2 concentration to ambient CO 2 concentration was usually 0. 4 to 0. 6 for the pasture, a range which is higher than that often reported for C- 4 plants but possibly not unusual for tropical grasses in their natural environment.

40|$|Successful {{restoration}} of vegetation in dry valleys under strong anthropogenic disturbance in southwestern China {{is limited by}} lack {{of information on the}} germination requirements of many native plants, including some rose species. Effects of post-dispersal factors (temperature, moisture and light) on Rosa soulieana seed dormancy and germination were examined in order to predict the rate and timing of germination in the field. Dry storage, cold stratification, and warm plus cold stratification increased both germination percentages and germination rates. Warm plus cold stratification was most effective in breaking achene dormancy, followed by cold stratification and dry storage. Light during cold stratification had no effect on dormancy break. Germination occurred from 5 degrees C to 30 degrees C. At low temperature, diurnal alternating temperature (5 / 15 degrees C) was more effective than constant temperature (5 degrees C) in stimulating germination. Water stress significantly led to a decrease in germination percentage and rate. Significant differences under various <b>photon</b> <b>irradiances</b> were observed neither in germination percentages nor in germination rates. Temperature and moisture, but not light, appeared to play important roles in regulating dormancy and germination. Our results suggest that R. soulieana seeds may germinate sporadically from early spring to summer when soil moisture is sufficient for them to initiate this process. However, most achenes should normally germinate in the spring, which is a general phenomenon in plants.

40|$|When buoyant {{cyanobacteria}} form {{a surface}} bloom, they may obtain inorganic carbon {{from the water}} and the atmosphere. In this study, artificial blooms of cyanobacteria were exposed to different concentrations of CO(2) in the atmosphere and HCO 3 - in the water. The conditions and photosynthetic activity within the bloom were measured with microelectrodes sensing O- 2, pH, and light. Net rates of photosynthesis increased with the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere (air = 350 ppm). However, even under 3, 500 ppm CO 2, reducing the concentration of inorganic carbon in the water reduced rates of photosynthesis. Thus, both air and water acted as sources of inorganic carbon. Bloom formation may give cyanobacteria an advantage in competition for light and inorganic carbon with other groups of phytoplankton; by placing a dense biomass close to the water surface they are able to intercept a large amount of the flux of light and inorganic carbon. The high surface pH produced in the bloom will promote influx of CO 2 from the atmosphere by "chemical enhancement. " The obvious advantage of being close to the water surface may be offset by the risk of photoinhibition at high <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance.</b> The dense packing of colonies in the bloom furthermore caused a high local demand for inorganic carbon and consequently extreme carbon depletion. This combination of high <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> and carbon limitation proved to be especially detrimental in blooms. When the availability of inorganic carbon was restricted, nonphotochemical quenching of fluorescence increased, showing some removal of excess excitation energy, but not to the extent that photodamage was prevented. Depending on the outcome of several interacting processes, surface bloom formation may be advantageous or deleterious for the cyanobacteria involved. This also depends on the environmental conditions to which cells were acclimated prior to bloom formation.

40|$|Iron, {{one of the}} {{structural}} elements of organic components that play {{an essential role in}} photosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation of plants, is available at extremely low concentrations in large parts of the Southern Ocean’s surface waters. We tested the hypothesis that photosynthesis is the primary target of iron stress in phytoplankton living in this specific environment, resulting in a reduced carbohydrate production. Cultures of a small Antarctic diatom, Chaetoceros brevis, were exposed to two different <b>photon</b> <b>irradiances</b> under iron-rich and iron-poor conditions. Under both light regimes growth rate was reduced only slightly by iron starvation, as expected because the iron requirement of a small-celled species such as C. brevis is low. Even so, iron-starved cells differed markedly from iron-replete cells: for low and high irradiance, respectively, they had a 20 and 27 % lower content of light-harvesting pigments (chlorophyll a and c 2 and fucoxanthin), a 8 and 15 % decrease in light absorption and a 15 and 17 % decrease in quantum yield of photosystem II. The diurnal production of water-extractable carbohydrates was reduced by 28 and 31 %, which resulted in a low supply of energy and carbon skeletons from these storage products. This may well have influenced protein synthesis. The nocturnal consumption of carbohydrates was also reduced, which, together with the almost proportional decrease in cellular C and N content, suggests that the C and N metabolism were tightly tuned in iron-stressed cultures. The decrease in C and N content correlated with a decrease in cell volume. Our results indicate that iron limitation is likely to affect the ability of phytoplankton to maintain high rates of protein synthesis within the deep wind-mixed layer of the Southern Ocean. In addition, growth at the surface could be inhibited by too much light: iron-poor cultures of C. brevis grown at low irradiance showed enhanced sensitivity to photoinhibition. ...|$|R

40|$|Photorealistic image {{synthesis}} {{deals with}} simulation {{of the light}} energy transport in an artificial scene in order to generate realistic looking snapshot of the scene from a given position. From a physical point of view we need to compute the value of radiance L reflected to the camera at every visible point of the scene. This task is very difficult and time consuming, because of recursion in the computation process. In our work, we chose a combination of two algorithms for realistic image synthesis: <b>Photon</b> Maps and <b>Irradiance</b> Cache. We further extended the algorithms in some aspects not addressed before. 3. Photon Maps 1. Describing the Light Transport: The Rendering Equation Rendering equation describes light transport in the space. Its simplified form is: It tells that the reflected (or outgoing) radiance L at a given point and in a given direction is o equal to the self emitted radiance L plus the radiance reflected from the surface from all the e incoming directions. It is a Fredholm's integral equation of second kind. It can be solved by stochastic Monte Carlo methods (ray tracing) or finite elements methods (radiosity). The algorithms we used are the modification of stochastic Monte Carlo methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} temperature, <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance,</b> and {{photoperiod}} {{on the growth}} of Sargassum horneri embryos were ex-amined for female plants collected at Chokpo in Tongyeoung, Gyeongnam Prefecture, Korea on 27 December 2011. Mature plant receptacles were detached, and fertilized eggs were cultured in the laboratory at temperatures of 5 - 25 ℃ with photon irradiances of 10 - 80 μmol m- 2 s- 1 under 14 L: 10 D and 10 L: 14 D photoperiods. Germination and embryo growth were rapid at 20 - 25 ℃ and 40 μmol m- 2 s- 1 under 14 L: 10 D. The number of rhizoids in the germinated young thalli was high at high photon irradiances (40 - 80 μmol m- 2 s- 1) and 15 - 20 ℃. At 20 ℃ and 14 L: 10 D, vigorous growth of main and lateral branches was observed; however, at 5 ℃ under both photoperiods, plant growth decreased markedly. In the present study, S. horneri grew well at high temperatures (20 - 25 ℃) and high photon irradiances (40 - 80 μmol m- 2 s- 1) with a 14 L: 10 D photoperiod...|$|E
40|$|Interest in red coralline algae is {{increasing}} {{due to their}} projected sensitivity to ocean acidification and their utility as palaeoenvironmental proxies. Thus, {{it is crucial to}} obtain a thorough understanding of their basic photosynthetic characteristics and appropriate techniques for use in both laboratory and in situ studies. This study provides fluorescence methodology and data for the ecologically important red coralline alga Lithothamnion glaciale using pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry. Lithothamnion glaciale was sufficiently dark-acclimated for in situ work following 10 s of quasi-darkness, attaining 95 – 98 % of the maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm). Rapid light curves conducted in situ and in the laboratory determined a low light adaptation, with a saturation intensity of 4. 45 – 54. 6 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1. Intra-thallus heterogeneity was observed between branch tips and bases (i. e., within the thallus) using a custom-made 2 mm fibre optic probe (the heterogeneity could not be detected using the standard 5 mm probe). Branch bases were lower light acclimated than the tips, with higher maximum effective quantum yield (Fq′/Fm′max) and lower non-photochemical quenching. Samples measured in May were higher light acclimated than in March, which suggests a degree of seasonal acclimation. Light history and <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance</b> levels were thus found to significantly affect the photosynthetic characteristics of L. glaciale...|$|E
40|$|MASH {{stands for}} "Macros for the Automation of SHadow". It allows {{to run a}} set of {{ray-tracing}} simulations, {{for a range of}} photon energies for example, fully automatically. Undulator gaps, crystal angles etc. are tuned automatically. Important output parameters, such as photon flux, <b>photon</b> <b>irradiance,</b> focal spot size, bandwidth, etc. are then directly provided as function of photon energy. A photon energy scan is probably the most commonly requested one, but any parameter or set of parameters can be scanned through as well. Heat load calculations with finite element analysis providing temperatures, stress and deformations (Comsol) are fully integrated. The deformations can be fed back into the ray-tracing process simply by activating a switch. MASH tries to hide program internals such as file names, calls to pre-processors etc., so that the user (nearly) only needs to provide the optical setup. It comes with a web interface, which allows to run it remotely on a central computation server. Hence, no local installation or licenses are required, just a web browser and access to the local network. Numerous tools are provided to look at the ray-tracing results in the web-browser. The results can be also downloaded for local analysis. All files are human readable text files, that can be easily imported into third-party programs for further processing. All set parameters are stored in a single human-readable file in XML format...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we present a model of in vitro cell killing through type II Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for {{simulation}} of the molecular interactions leading to cell death in time domain {{in the presence of}} oxygen transport within a spherical cell. By coupling the molecular kinetics to cell killing, we develop a modeling method of PDT cytotoxicity caused by singlet oxygen and obtain the cell survival ratio as a function of light fluence or initial photosensitizer concentration with different <b>photon</b> density or <b>irradiance</b> of incident light and other parameters of oxygen transport. A systems biology model is developed to account for the detailed molecular pathways induced by PDT treatment leading to cell killing. We derive a mathematical model of cell decision making through a binary cell fate decision scheme on cell death or survival, during and after PDT treatment, and we employ a rate distortion theory as the logical design for this decision making proccess to understand the biochemical processing of information by a cell. Rate distortion theory is also used to design a time dependent Blahut-Arimoto algorithm of three variables where the input is a stimulus vector composed of the time dependent concentrations of three PDT induced signaling molecules and the output reflects a cell fat...|$|R
40|$|The {{chlorophyll}} meter (SPAD- 502) {{is widely}} used to estimate chlorophyll content, but non-uniform chloroplast distribution can affect its accuracy. This study aimed to assess the effect of <b>photon</b> fluence (F, <b>irradiance</b> x time of illumination) in leaves with different chlorophyll content and {{determine the effect of}} chlorophyll a/b on SPAD values of four tropical tree species (Croton draconoides Müll. Arg., Hevea guianensis Aubl., Hymenaea courbaril L. and Matisia cordata H. B. K.). There were also determined calibration equations for the chlorophyll meter and assessed the effect of F on SPAD values between 07 : 00 h and 17 : 00 h. Calibration equations were obtained after determining leaf chlorophyll content in the laboratory. Increases in F with time caused a reduction in SPAD values in species with a high chlorophyll content, with reductions of 20 % in M. cordata and 10 % in H. guianensis. Leaves of C. draconoides and H. courbaril had lower chlorophyll content and showed no changes in SPAD values with increase in F. The chlorophyll a/b ratio increased with SPAD values and the SPAD/chlorophyll relationship was best described by an exponential equation. It seems that F may affect SPAD values in leaves with high chlorophyll content, probably due to non-uniform chloroplast distribution at high irradiance. This indicates that SPAD values tend to be more accurate if recorded early in morning when irradiance is low...|$|R
40|$|Five-minute {{measurements}} {{of both the}} average photon energy and photovoltaic performance are used in this project {{for the analysis of}} the impact of variations in the average photon energy on photovoltaic performance. Four days of measurements have been analyzed, these four days comprise a clear sky day, a day with alternating high and low irradiance peaks (super irradiance) and two clouded days. The impact of this variation is clearly shown in the comparison between the average <b>photon</b> energy versus <b>irradiance</b> plot and the efficiency versus irradiance plot of the clear day data. These plot show that the relatively higher average photon energy relates to a relatively lower efficiency. This effect confirmed by the overall statistic taken over all four days whereby the higher than average average photon energy and lower than average efficiency has the highest share in the measurements. The difference between the two investigated module types (amorphous and (multi) crystalline) is proven in the efficiency versus irradiance plot. The behaviour at the relatively higher average photon energy is similar in both cases. In the case of the relatively lower average photon energy the efficiency of the amorphous modules remains at the same level as at average average photon energies. The impact of clouds on the spectral irradiance distribution is investigated in this project. The comparison is made between the average photon energy of the measured data and the extraterrestrial average photon energy. In this way a description of the whole atmospheric impact is made. This shows that the clouded sky impact on the average photon energy on the earth’s surface is that it increases the average photon energy. To conclude this project a comparison between modelled and measured average photon energy is made. This shows that the modelled average photon energy is underestimating the measured data on the clouded days. It also shows that the variability on the super irradiance day is lost in the modelling output. For model results on the clear day the values line up closely to the measured values...|$|R
