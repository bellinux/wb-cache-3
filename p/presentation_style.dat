5|$|In The New York Times, {{journalist}} Michael Massing {{felt that}} the author's view on contemporary free-speech issues (her stance on limiting censorship, and her view that little television programming could cause harm to children) was extreme. The American Prospect criticized the author's <b>presentation</b> <b>style,</b> acknowledging Heins was a skilled attorney {{on the subject of}} civil liberties, but called the book itself boring. The review compared the author's writing style to comic books, and concluded Heins' chronology of litigation regarding profane speech came across as less than a neutral presentation.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of a}} {{long-term}} cost cutting programme, bulletins were renamed the BBC News at One, Six and Ten respectively in April 2008 while BBC News 24 was renamed BBC News and moved into the same studio as the bulletins at BBC Television Centre.

25|$|The {{sequence}} {{has since}} seen several remixes {{to the music}} and a change in visuals {{to focus more on}} the well-known journalists, with less footage of camera crews and production teams. Changes have also seen the channel logo included during the sequences and at the end, as well as the fonts used for the time. The conclusion of the countdown was altered in 2008 to feature the new <b>presentation</b> <b>style,</b> rather than a data stream moving in towards the camera. Also in 2008, the graphic for the countdown changed, resembling BBC One Rhythm and Movement Idents, due to the logo being in a red square in inferior-left corner.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 idents {{featured}} a sans-serif numeral 2 at {{the centre of}} an initially art-related scene; however the idents moved away from this style as the station's style changed. Although highly praised, this expansive set of idents was ended in November 2001. The BBC corporate logo was updated within the idents in October 1997, though the idents {{moved away from the}} original viridian colour scheme in these latter years. The subsequent <b>presentation</b> <b>style</b> was introduced on 19 November 2001 and kept the same figure 2, but in a yellow background and given a personality. At the time, BBC Two became the first BBC channel to feature a box logo.|$|E

25|$|At Radio 1 Everett {{continued}} {{to develop his}} own unique <b>presentation</b> <b>style,</b> encouraged by producer Angela Bond, who had persuaded her superiors to give him his first programme, although he later reacted against her {{as a representative of}} the BBC. Everett's Radio 1 show featured zany voices, surreal characters, multi-tracked jingles and trailers, all of his own creation and compilation. It was Everett who had persuaded Johnny Beerling and station controller Robin Scott, at a lunch meeting before his appointment, of the importance of the new station having jingles. Everett's shows on BBC Radio 1 included Midday Spin, and in 1968 he took over a Saturday show from 10.00am to 12.00 noon.|$|E
25|$|Mary Joan Winn Leith in The Oxford History of the Biblical World {{believes}} that Ezra was a historical figure whose life was enhanced in the scripture {{and given a}} theological buildup. Gosta W. Ahlstrom argues the inconsistencies of the biblical tradition are insufficient to say that Ezra, with his central position as the 'father of Judaism' in the Jewish tradition, has been a later literary invention. Those who argue against the historicity of Ezra argue that the <b>presentation</b> <b>style</b> of Ezra as a leader and lawgiver resembles that of Moses. There are also similarities between Ezra the priest-scribe (but not high priest) and Nehemiah the secular governor {{on the one hand}} and Joshua and Zerubbabel on the other hand. The early 2nd-century BCE Jewish author Ben Sira praises Nehemiah, but makes no mention of Ezra.|$|E
25|$|The {{first series}} of the new format of Top Gear was {{broadcast}} in 2002, with Clarkson, joined by two new presenters – Richard Hammond and Jason Dawe, although only the former typically appeared in most segment along with Clarkson – along {{with the introduction of}} a test driver called The Stig, an anonymous, helmeted racing driver who conducted the show's Power Laps. Following the first series, Dawe was replaced by James May, who had previously worked on the old format, while the original Stig portrayed by Perry McCarthy was replaced {{at the beginning of the}} third series by Ben Collins. While the show operated in a similar manner to the previous format during the early series, with the inclusion of reading out letters from viewers and conducting interviews, it eventually focused on humour and creating a unique <b>presentation</b> <b>style</b> for the programme, and the inclusion of races between cars or between a car and another form of transportation, challenges involving cheap, second-hand cars, unusual approaches to reviewing cars, and road trips. In most of the early series, the presenters regularly destroyed a caravan.|$|E

2500|$|The premise for the {{new show}} was that unlike The Late Late Breakfast Show, which had been {{broadcast}} from the BBC's studios each week, the Roadshow would come from a new, different and exotic location each week.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} patients’ {{and health}} professionals’ understanding of and preferences for different graphical <b>presentation</b> <b>styles</b> for individual-level EORTC QLQ-C 30 scores. Methods: We recruited cancer patients (any treatment and diagnosis) in four European countries and health {{professionals in the}} Netherlands. Using a questionnaire, we assessed objective and self-rated understanding of QLQ-C 30 scores and preferences for five <b>presentation</b> <b>styles</b> (bar and line charts, with or without color coding, and a heat map). Results: In total, 548 patients and 227 health professionals participated. Eighty-three percent of patients and 85 % of professionals self-rated the graphs as very or quite easy to understand; this did not differ between graphical <b>presentation</b> <b>styles.</b> The mean percentage of correct answers to questions objectively assessing understanding was 59 % in patients, 78 % in medical specialists, and 74 % in other health professionals. Objective understanding did not differ between graphical formats in patients. For non-colored charts, 49. 8 % of patients {{did not have a}} preference. Colored bar charts (39 %) were preferred over heat maps (20 %) and colored line charts (12 %). Medical specialists preferred heat maps (46 %) followed by non-colored bar charts (19 %), whereas these charts were equally valued by other health professionals (both 32 %). Conclusion: The substantial discrepancy between participants’ high self-rated and relatively low objective understanding of graphical presentation of PRO results highlights the need to provide sufficient guidance when presenting such results. It may be appropriate to adapt the presentation of PRO results to individual preferences. This could be facilitated when PROs are administered and presented to patients and health professionals electronically...|$|R
2500|$|After much debate, Jones remembered an {{animation}} Gilliam {{had created}} for Do Not Adjust Your Set called [...] "Beware of the Elephants", which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style.

Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam's efforts, entitled [...] "Christmas Cards", and agreed that it represented [...] "a way of doing things differently". Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the <b>presentation</b> <b>style</b> of the Flying Circus series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single stream-of-consciousness (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).|$|E

He told stories from his own marriage, offered statistics, and dropped jokes without their feeling forced. Every few minutes he would sniff in a thoughtful, practiced sort of way.

The first experiment with 24 subjects examined how different <b>presentation</b> <b>styles</b> affect the effectiveness of UNs advice.
