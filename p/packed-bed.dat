50|$|There {{have been}} a few {{technical}} issues that have limited adoption of SFC technology, first of which is the high pressure operating conditions. High-pressure vessels are expensive and bulky, and special materials are often needed to avoid dissolving gaskets and O-rings in the supercritical fluid. A second drawback is difficulty in maintaining pressure (backpressure regulation). Whereas liquids are nearly incompressible, so their densities are constant regardless of pressure, supercritical fluids are highly compressible and their physical properties change with pressure - such as the pressure drop across a <b>packed-bed</b> column. Currently, automated backpressure regulators can maintain a constant pressure in the column even if flow rate varies, mitigating this problem. A third drawback is difficulty in gas/liquid separation during collection of product. Upon depressurization, the CO2 rapidly turns into gas and aerosolizes any dissolved analyte in the process. Cyclone separators have lessened difficulties in gas/liquid separations.|$|E

The use of fluidized bed mixer results in better mixture, {{which in turn}} increases the mean quantity of oil yield and oil shale throughput. From the fluidized bed mixer oil shale moves downward to the <b>packed-bed</b> pyrolyzer. The heat is transferred from the heated spent oil shale to the raw oil shale causing pyrolysis.

The spent oil shale, still including residual carbon (char), by the air pneumatic lift pipe to the delayed-fall combustor where it is combusted to heat the process. The delayed-fall combustor used in this process gives greater control over the combustion process as compared to a lift pipe combustor. From the delayed-fall combustor the oil shale ash and spent shale falls into a fluidized bed classifier where the finest parts of solids are removed and hot spent shale is forwarded to the fluidized bed mixer.|$|E

40|$|Biotransformation of 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (CH 3 CCl 3) was {{observed}} in an anaerobic <b>packed-bed</b> reactor under conditions of both sulfate reduction and methanogenesis.

A fraction of the CH 3 CCl 3 was completely dechlorinated via an unknown pathway. The rate of transformation and the transformation products formed depended on the concentrations of CH 3 CCl 3, acetate and sulfate. With an increase in sulfate and CH 3 CCl 3 concentrations and a decrease in acetate concentration, the degree of CH 3 CCl 3 dechlorination decreased. Both <b>packed-bed</b> reactor studies and batch experiments with bromoethanesulfonic acid, an inhibitor of methanogenesis, demonstrated the involvement of methanogens in CH 3 CCl 3 transformation. Batch experiments with molybdate showed that sulfate-reducing bacteria in the <b>packed-bed</b> reactor were also able to transform CH 3 CCl 3.

40|$|<b>Packed-bed</b> digesters are an {{alternative}} to covered lagoon digesters for methane production and anaerobic treatment of dilute wastewaters such as dairy barn flush water. The physical media of packed-beds retain biofilms, often allowing increased treatment rates. Previous studies have evaluated several types of media for digestion of dilute wastewaters, but cost and media fouling have setback commercial development. A major operational cost has been effluent recirculation pumping. In the present effort, a novel approach to anaerobic digestion of flush dairy water was developed at pilot-scale: broken walnut shells were used as a low-cost <b>packed-bed</b> medium and effluent recirculation was replaced by reciprocation mixing to decrease pumping costs {{and the risk of}} media clogging. Three <b>packed-bed</b> digesters containing walnut shells as media were constructed at the on-campus dairy and studied for about six months. Over that time, several organic loading rates (OLRs), measured as both chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile solids (VS) were applied to the new <b>packed-bed</b> digesters to allow modeling of methane production. The influence of temperature on methane production was also investigated. Additionally, the study measured solids accumulation in the walnut shell <b>packed-bed</b> as well as the effectiveness and durability of walnut shells as packing media. Finally, a simple economic analysis was developed from the methane model to predict the financial feasibility of <b>packed-bed</b> digesters at flush water dairies under similar OLR conditions. Three methane production models were developed from organic loading: saturation-type (following the form of the Monod equation), power and linear. The models were evaluated in terms of regression analysis and the linearity of experimental to predicted methane production. The best model was then chosen to develop the economic predictions. Economic predictions for <b>packed-bed</b> digesters were calculated as internal rate of return (IRR) using the methane models along with additional input variables. Comparisons of IRRs were made using electric retail rates of $ 0. 10 to $ 0. 20 per kilowatt-hour and capital cost subsidies from zero to 50 %. Sludge accumulation in the <b>packed-bed</b> was measured via change in porosity, and walnut shell durability was measured as the change in mass of representative walnut shells {{over the course of the}} study. The linear-type model of methane production from volatile solids OLR best represented this data set. Digester temperature was not found to influence methane production in this study, likely due to the small daily average ambient temperature range experienced (14 °C to 24 °C) and the greater influence of organic loading. Porosity of the walnut shell <b>packed-bed</b> decreased from 0. 70 at startup to 0. 34 ± 0. 06 at the end of the six-month study, indicating considerable media fouling. Sludge accumulated in each digester from zero at startup to 281 ± 46 liters at termination. Walnut shells in the <b>packed-bed</b> lost on average 31. 4 ± 6. 3 % mass during the study period which may be attributed to degradation of more readily bio-degradable cellulose and hemi-cellulose within the walnut shells. Given the predicted methane production and media life, at present, the economic outlook for <b>packed-bed</b> digesters at commercial dairies is quite dependent on utility electrical rates, available subsidies and future improvements to <b>packed-bed</b> digester technology. The predicted IRRs ranged from below 0 % (at 0 % capital subsidy and $ 0. 10 /kWh) up to 25 % (at 50 % capital subsidy and $ 0. 20 /kWh) at large dairies (3000 milking cows). Increases in organic loading were not shown to necessarily increase IRR, particularly at OLRs above 10 g/Lliquid-d (as COD or VS). Ultimately, to better assess the value of <b>packed-bed</b> digesters for flush dairies, additional study is needed on topics such as sludge accumulation prevention, long-term walnut shell degradation, dairy barn flush water mixing, and more detailed economic analysis...|$|E

The nitrate was quickly denitrified at very low flow rates (0. 11 m h- 1) for the <b>packed-bed</b> reactors, but as the flow rate was greater than 0. 13 m 1 - 1, the nitrate removal rate increased as the flow rate increased. In the static fermentor system, the denitrification can be described by a secondary reaction, but at a flow rate between 1. 31 to 1. 49 m h- 1, the reactor performance can be described using the zero-order reaction in the <b>packed-bed</b> reactor. As the speed increases, the zero-order reaction translates into half-order reaction as the penetration efficiency of nitrate decreases. The mass ratios between the nitrate removed and the sulfate produced were determined to be 6. 81 and 9. 32 in the reactor column and fermentor, respectively.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of adipic acid from cyclohexene and hydrogen peroxide {{was investigated in}} micro-flow <b>packed-bed</b> reactors. The isolated yield of adipic acid increases with increasing residence time in micro-flow <b>packed-bed</b> reactors. The addition of phosphoric acid cannot effectively improve the isolated yield of adipic acid though it is generally known to reduce the decomposition of H 2 O 2. Then, different temperatures were tested along the reactor length, since the adipic acid synthesis is known to consist of 6 elementary reactions with different temperature needs. For experiments with 2 -stage temperature ramping, 70 °C and 100 °C, respectively, are the optimal temperatures for the first stage and second stage reactor, which lead to 63 % isolated yield of adipic acid. Furthermore, 3 -stage temperature ramping improves the yield of adipic acid to 66 %. Multi-injection of hydrogen peroxide at different stages {{does not lead to}} a further increase in adipic acid yield. Although high temperatures are used in this transformation, the in-line recording of temperature profiles along the flow axis shows that safe operation for this exothermic reaction can be realized in the micro-flow <b>packed-bed</b> reactors.

Experimental examples are presented for the dissolution kinetics of calcite, fluorite and magnetite in simple aqueous systems to 350 "C and 140 bars using CSTR, <b>packed-bed</b> plug flow and semi-static modes...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the preparation and characterization of a simplified <b>packed-bed</b> microreactor using an immobilized TEMPO catalyst shown to oxidize {{primary and secondary}} alcohols via the biphasic Anelli-Montanari protocol. Oxidations occurred in high yields with great stability over time. We observed that plugs of aqueous oxidant and organic alcohol entered the reactor as plugs but merged into an emulsion on the <b>packed-bed.</b> The emulsion coalesced into larger plugs upon exiting the reactor, leaving the organic product separate from the aqueous by-products. Furthermore, the microreactor oxidized {{a wide range of}} alcohols and remained active in excess of 100 trials without showing any loss of catalytic activity...|$|E
40|$|Wastes from {{olive oil}} and wine {{industries}} (as exhausted grape mark, vineshoot trimmings, olive pomace and vinasses) were used as substrate for lignocellulolytic enzymes production (as endocellulases, endoxylanase) by solid state fermentation in a <b>packed-bed</b> bioreactor. In previous works, A. uvarum was selected as suitable fungus to produce cellulases and xylanases, also composition of substrate, temperature and moisture content were optimized. An important parameter in <b>packed-bed</b> bioreactors is air flow rate, thus its effect on enzymes production was studied. The highest enzyme production was obtained for the lower aeration rate (0. 2 L/min). It was observed that increasing air flow the enzyme production was lower...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} four different absorber designs {{in this type of}} system: cross-current and counter-current <b>packed-bed</b> absorbers, the spray absorber and fluid-bed absorber. In a laboratory pilot, plant, working lines for the absorbers were determined under adiabatic conditions. The influences of internal solution flow, gas flow, pressure drop and dissipation are discussed. The working lines represent the efficiency for each absorber. The highest performance occurs with the <b>packed-bed</b> absorbers, followed by the fluid-bed absorber and finally the spray absorber. For open absorption systems in air-conditioning applications (small scale), the cross-current absorber is preferable, and for industrial utilization (large scale) the fluid-bed absorber should be chosen. ...|$|E
