5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented four {{witnesses to}} the court. Robert Chobert, a cab driver who testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White, a prostitute, testified that Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, testified that from two car lengths away, he saw a man, matching Abu-Jamal's description, run {{across the street from}} a parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the shooting, testified to seeing Faulkner <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> Cook's car. As Abu-Jamal started to cross the street toward them, Magilton turned away and lost sight of what happened next.|$|E
5|$|It was Hamilton's {{teammate}} {{and defending}} race winner Rosberg who topped the time sheets {{at the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting a 1:12.385 lap time. He led Hamilton by almost half a second, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen about a second adrift. Slight rain saw most drivers head out early, but the conditions never became wet enough to require intermediate tyres. After starting on the medium compound tyres, many drivers switched to the softer compound for race simulations, only for the session to be red flagged shortly after when Fernando Alonso spun at turn four, only to <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> {{at the side of}} the road with smoke coming from his car some corners later. Valtteri Bottas was sixth fastest, behind Daniel Ricciardo, suffering a spin at turn nine.|$|E

5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on a routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to <b>pull</b> <b>over,</b> and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins as police {{officers}} and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them. As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a gunmetal grey Aston Martin while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico, clips of the police {{from the beginning of}} the video are cut into the scene. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police. As Beyoncé and Jay-Z count money in the bedroom, the police discover their hiding place and go upstairs only to find that the two have fled the scene in their car. Scenes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a Mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall is a tribute to Tupac Shakur. The duo again elude the police who are following one step behind. After Beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and Jay-Z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car. The video ends as Beyoncé and Jay-Z light a bonfire on the beach and drive away in a different car.|$|E

25|$|Emergency vehicle {{lighting}} is generally used {{to clear the}} right of way for emergency vehicles, or to warn approaching motorists of potential hazards, such as a vehicle that is stopped or moving slower than the rate of traffic, or a car that has been pulled over. It may also be used to provide specific directions to motorists, such as a command to <b>pull</b> <b>over.</b> Some vehicles incorporate a small arrow board to direct traffic.|$|E
25|$|To enforce speed limits, two {{approaches}} are generally employed. In the United States, {{it is common}} for the police to patrol the streets and use special equipment (typically a radar unit) to measure the speed of vehicles, and <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> any vehicle found to be in violation of the speed limit. In Brazil, Colombia and some European countries, there are computerized speed-measuring devices spread throughout the city, which will automatically detect speeding drivers and take a photograph of the license plate (or number plate), which is later used for applying and mailing the ticket. Many jurisdictions in the U.S. use this technology as well.|$|E

Two Malaysian men, Chew Seng (Ah Sung) Liew and Choon Tee (Phillip) Lim, ran their car into Chang's vehicle, forcing him to <b>pull</b> <b>over.</b> After getting into an argument with Chang who refused to give them money, Liew fired the fatal shots; the first entered near the right cheek and exited below the right ear, while the fatal second, fired from point-blank range, entered the right temple and passed through the brain. Police investigators initially suspected the involvement of Triad syndicates, but later concluded the killing was an amateur act.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Sullivan {{was working}} inside a ranger station in Shenandoah National Park when another strike occurred. It set his hair on fire; {{he tried to}} smother the flames with his jacket. He then rushed to the restroom, but couldn't fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although he never was a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death. For months, whenever he {{was caught in a}} storm while driving his truck, he would <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> and lie down on the front seat until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he would somehow attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 2015, {{a three-hour}} shootout broke {{out between the}} Mexican Federal Police and alleged members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) in Tanhuato and Ecuandureo, Michoacán, leaving 43 dead. One of the {{fatalities}} was a Federal Police officer, while the others were suspected to be organized crime members. The confrontation started when the Federal Police spotted a suspicious vehicle on a highway. The authorities had received information {{that one of the}} properties in the area had been overrun by criminals. Unconfirmed reports suggested that the CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes was in the area. When they tried to <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> the vehicle, however, the men onboard opened fire at the police units. A vehicle chase ensued and the security forces made their way into a large, rural property where the shootout intensified. The Federal Police then called for ground and air reinforcements and neutralized the situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is blue. Vehicles using flashing blue lights and siren have {{right of way}} over all other vehicles. Only designated emergency/priority vehicles may use blue lights; this includes police, fire brigade, ambulance service and a few other, smaller services such as the blood bank and some lifeguard organizations. Dutch police vehicles have an LED matrix display, which can show different texts in red lighting. Most often used are STOP POLITIE (ordering a driver to <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> and stop) or VOLGEN POLITIE (ordering driver to follow the police vehicle). Standard Dutch police cars often have the text bar incorporated in the light bar, vans and motorcycles usually have a separate sign {{on the front of}} the vehicle. On ambulances, a green beacon indicates the command vehicle when multiple units are responding to an incident - usually this is the first vehicle that arrives on the scene. Newer ambulance models also have a text display that will alternate the words ‘Ambulance’ and ‘Spoed’ (‘urgent’). When ever the vehicles are on scene (usually fire brigade vehicles and some police vans), or staying in place for an other reason, they need to switch to amber lighting to signal that they are not moving.|$|E

500|$|The dissent argued that, for {{a section}} 1983 {{claim to be}} valid, [...] "harm alone is not enough; {{it has to be}} the right kind of harm." [...] Thomas {{provided}} an example of a law allowing police to <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> any driver without cause. This would obviously violate the Fourth Amendment rights of anyone stopped, but people stuck in traffic who were injured by the collateral damage of unconstitutional actions {{would not be able to}} sue because none of their rights was violated. Similarly, it is not enough for Heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well. For the dissent, even if the dismissal was for the wrong reason and harm was suffered, the dismissal cannot infringe upon rights he never exercised.|$|E
500|$|The {{remaining}} expressway {{portion of}} SR54 {{was replaced by}} a freeway in two phases in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The first phase corresponded with construction of SR125 north of Jamacha Boulevard to SR94; construction began in 1996 and was completed in 2003. The second phase consisted of the construction of the SR125 toll road and opened on November 19, 2007. While California Transportation Ventures owned the franchise on the tolled portion of SR125, the interchange with SR54 was constructed with $160million (about $ in [...] dollars) of public funding. From 2005 to 2007, [...] of rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions to allow for the interchange to be built. The project to convert the HOV lanes to regular mixed traffic lanes was authorized in 2006. Caltrans determined that the lack of space for law enforcement to <b>pull</b> <b>over</b> carpool lane violators, as well as a missing barrier separating the HOV lanes from regular traffic, made the lanes less effective.|$|E

Beyoncé sits opposite to her boyfriend, Gibson, but becomes tired of his stupidity and poisons him, but it does not kill him like she had hoped. The video later shifts to an intermediate sequence called [...] "Let's Make a Sandwich", where Gaga stands in a kitchen, wearing a folded-up telephone on her head, while dancers cavort behind her, holding salad tongs and assorted cutlery. Ultimately, Gaga prepares a sandwich and eats it, after a dance sequence. In the meantime, Gaga mixes poison into all of the dishes she is preparing for the unsuspecting customers causing Gibson and everybody else, including characters played by Semi Precious Weapons and her Great Dane, Lava, to die. Gaga and Beyoncé perform another dance sequence, wearing American flag inspired garments and shredded denims, while strutting around the dead bodies. Gaga and Beyoncé leave the diner in the [...] "Pussy Wagon" [...] and travel on a highway as a news reporter (played by Jai Rodriguez) reports the murders at the diner.
