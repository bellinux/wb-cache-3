5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
25|$|Other medical {{techniques}} are e.g. tuboplasty, assisted hatching, and <b>Preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis. By {{retrieving}} the mother's {{eggs for}} in vitro fertilization, {{it is possible}} to test the embryo for the disorder prior to implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother's womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay–Sachs disease, <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders.|$|E
25|$|In oocyte selection, the oocytes with optimal {{chances of}} live birth can be chosen. It {{can also be}} used as a means of <b>preimplantation</b> genetic screening.|$|E
25|$|In some {{diseases}} requiring hematopoietic {{stem cell}} transplantation, <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis {{may be used to}} give rise to a sibling with matching HLA, although there are ethical considerations.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to FISH and PCR, single cell genome sequencing {{is being tested}} {{as a method of}} <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis. This characterizes the complete DNA sequence of the genome of the embryo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Preimplantation</b> genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD) {{involves the use}} of genetic screening mechanisms such as fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to help identify genetically abnormal embryos and improve healthy outcomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Preimplantation</b> genetic haplotyping (PGH) is a PGD {{technique}} wherein a haplotype {{of genetic}} markers that have statistical associations to a target disease are identified {{rather than the}} mutation causing the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedures}} {{may also}} be called <b>preimplantation</b> genetic profiling {{to adapt to the}} fact that they are sometimes used on oocytes or embryos prior to implantation for other reasons than diagnosis or screening.|$|E
25|$|Dual FISH was {{considered}} to be an efficient technique for determination of the sex of human <b>preimplantation</b> embryos and the additional ability to detect abnormal chromosome copy numbers, which is not possible via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).|$|E
25|$|Cord blood can be {{harvested}} from {{the umbilical cord}} of a child being born after <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis (PGD) for human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matching (see PGD for HLA matching) in order to donate to an ill sibling requiring HSCT.|$|E
25|$|<b>Preimplantation</b> genetic {{screening}} (PGS) or <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis (PGD) {{has been suggested}} {{to be able to}} be used in IVF to select an embryo that appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing randomised controlled trials came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy as measured by live birth rate. On the contrary, for women of advanced maternal age, PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy significantly lowers the live birth rate. Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and non-representative samples because of mosaicism are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGS.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal {{testing is}} another {{possibility}} for prevention or awareness, {{and this can}} be done through molecular genetic testing or ultrasounds at later stages of pregnancy. Additionally, <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis (PGD) should be considered for families where papillorenal syndrome is known to be an issue.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>preimplantation</b> period, two {{variables}} are predicted to predispose to the syndrome. First is low sinus rate, and second {{is a higher}} programmed lower rate limit. In postimplantation, an increased percentage of ventricular paced beats is the only variable that significantly predicts development of pacemaker syndrome.|$|E
25|$|APBD {{can only}} be {{prevented}} if parents undergo genetic screening to understand their risk of producing a child with the condition; if in vitro fertilization is used, then <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis {{can be done to}} identify fertilized eggs that do not carry two copies of mutated GBE1.|$|E
25|$|Economically, for carrier couples of cystic fibrosis, when {{comparing}} <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis (PGD) with natural conception (NC) followed by prenatal testing and abortion of affected pregnancies, PGD provides net economic benefits up to a maternal age around 40 years, after which NC, prenatal testing, and abortion have higher economic benefit.|$|E
25|$|The <b>preimplantation</b> genetic {{diagnosis}} for aneuploidy (PGS/PGD-A) is an accepted method as well. It is currently recommended {{in case of}} multiple miscarriages, and/or several failed IVF treatments, and/or when the mother is older than 35 years. Despite being an approved method, PGD-A is available at only one Fertility Clinic in Hungary.|$|E
25|$|Mixoploidy {{is quite}} {{commonly}} observed in human <b>preimplantation</b> embryos and includes haploid/diploid {{as well as}} diploid/tetraploid mixed cell populations. It is unknown whether these embryos fail to implant and are therefore rarely detected in ongoing pregnancies or if there is simply a selective process favoring the diploid cells.|$|E
25|$|As PGD can be {{performed}} on cells from different developmental stages, the biopsy procedures vary accordingly. Theoretically, the biopsy can {{be performed}} at all <b>preimplantation</b> stages, but only three have been suggested: on unfertilised and fertilised oocytes (for polar bodies, PBs), on day three cleavage-stage embryos (for blastomeres) and on blastocysts (for trophectoderm cells).|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} {{of the use of}} FISH to study the {{chromosomal}} constitution of embryos is the elevated mosaicism rate observed at the human <b>preimplantation</b> stage. A meta-analysis of more than 800 embryos came to the result that approximately 75% of <b>preimplantation</b> embryos are mosaic, of which approximately 60% are diploid–aneuploid mosaic and approximately 15% aneuploid mosaic. Li and co-workers found that 40% of the embryos diagnosed as aneuploid on day 3 turned out to have a euploid inner cell mass at day 6. Staessen and collaborators found that 17.5% of the embryos diagnosed as abnormal during PGS, and subjected to post-PGD reanalysis, were found to also contain normal cells, and 8.4% were found grossly normal. As a consequence, it has been questioned whether the one or two cells studied from an embryo are actually representative of the complete embryo, and whether viable embryos are not being discarded due to the limitations of the technique.|$|E
25|$|<b>Preimplantation</b> genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD or PIGD) refers to genetic profiling of embryos prior to implantation (as {{a form of}} embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization. When used to screen for a specific genetic sequence, its main advantage is that it avoids selective pregnancy termination, as the method makes it highly likely that a selected embryo will {{be free of the}} condition under consideration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Preimplantation</b> genetic {{profiling}} (PGP) {{has been}} suggested as a method to determine embryo quality in in vitro fertilization, in order to select an embryo {{that appears to have}} the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, as the results of PGP rely on the assessment of a single cell, PGP has inherent limitations as the tested cell may not be representative of the embryo because of mosaicism.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>preimplantation</b> genetic {{screening}} (PGS) {{is used to}} denote procedures that do not look for a specific disease but use PGD techniques to identify embryos at risk. The PGD allows studying the DNA of eggs or embryos to select those that carry certain mutations for genetic diseases. It is useful when there are previous chromosomal or genetic disorders {{in the family and}} within the context of in vitro fertilization programs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis: Genetic testing {{procedures}} that are performed on human embryos {{prior to the}} implantation {{as part of an}} in vitro fertilization procedure. Pre-implantation testing is used when individuals try to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization. Eggs from the woman and sperm from the man are removed and fertilized outside the body to create multiple embryos. The embryos are individually screened for abnormalities, and the ones without abnormalities are implanted in the uterus.|$|E
25|$|During embryogenesis, {{replication}} of mtDNA is strictly down-regulated from the fertilized oocyte through the <b>preimplantation</b> embryo. The resulting reduction in per-cell copy number of mtDNA {{plays a role}} in the mitochondrial bottleneck, exploiting cell-to-cell variability to ameliorate the inheritance of damaging mutations. At the blastocyst stage, the onset of mtDNA replication is specific to the cells of the trophectoderm. In contrast, the cells of the inner cell mass restrict mtDNA replication until they receive the signals to differentiate to specific cell types.|$|E
25|$|Embryos who {{reach the}} day 3 cell stage {{can be tested}} for {{chromosomal}} or specific genetic defects prior to possible transfer by <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis (PGD). Transferring at the blastocyst stage confers {{a significant increase in}} live birth rate per transfer, but also confers a decreased number of embryos available for transfer and embryo cryopreservation, so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage transfer. Transfer day 2 instead of day 3 after fertilization has no differences in live birth rate.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the wide}} variety of {{mutations}} leading to TSC, no simple genetic tests are available to identify new cases, nor are any biochemical markers known for the gene defects. However, once a person has been clinically diagnosed, the genetic mutation can usually be found. The search is time-consuming and has a 15% failure rate, which is thought to be due to somatic mosaicism. If successful, this information can be used to identify affected family members, including prenatal diagnosis. , <b>preimplantation</b> diagnosis is not widely available.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} patient {{deferoxamine}} complaint {{is that they}} are painful and inconvenient. The oral chelator deferasirox was approved for use in 2005 in some countries, it offers some hope with compliance at a higher cost. Bone marrow transplantation is the only cure and is indicated for patients with severe thalassemia major. Transplantation can eliminate a patient's dependence on transfusions. Absent a matching donor, a savior sibling can be conceived by <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis (PGD) to be free of the disease as well as to match the recipient's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type.|$|E
25|$|IVF is also {{considered}} suitable {{in cases where}} any of its expansions is of interest, that is, a procedure that is usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without concomitantly performing methods of IVF. Such expansions include <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis (PGD) to rule out presence of genetic disorders, as well as egg donation or surrogacy where the woman providing the egg isn't the same who will carry the pregnancy to term. Further details in the Expansions-section below.|$|E
25|$|Assisted {{reproductive}} technology (ART) is {{the technology}} used to achieve pregnancy in procedures such as fertility medication, {{in vitro fertilization}} and surrogacy. It is reproductive technology used primarily for infertility treatments, and {{is also known as}} fertility treatment. It mainly belongs to the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and may also include intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and cryopreservation. Some forms of ART are also used with regard to fertile couples for genetic reasons (<b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis). ART is also used for couples who are discordant for certain communicable diseases; for example, HIV {{to reduce the risk of}} infection when a pregnancy is desired.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{genetic testing}} {{is used for}} more than an initial diagnosis. It is used to confirm {{diagnostic}} testing, for carrier testing females, prenatal diagnosis, and <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis. There are three types of clinical molecular genetic testing. In approximately 85% of males, mis-sense and splice mutations of the NDP gene and partial or whole gene deletions are detected using sequence analysis. Deletion/duplication analysis can be used to detect the 15% of mutations that are submicroscopic deletions. This is also used when testing for carrier females. The last testing used is linkage analysis, which is used when the first two are unavailable. Linkage analysis is also recommended for those families who have more than one member affected by the disease.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{drawbacks}} to this approach, due to {{the stage}} at which it is performed. First, only {{approximately half of the}} <b>preimplantation</b> embryos reach the blastocyst stage. This can restrict the number of blastocysts available for biopsy, limiting in some cases the success of the PGD. Mc Arthur and coworkers report that 21% of the started PGD cycles had no embryo suitable for TE biopsy. This figure is approximately four times higher than the average presented by the ESHRE PGD consortium data, where PB and cleavage-stage biopsy are the predominant reported methods. On the other hand, delaying the biopsy to this late stage of development limits the time to perform the genetic diagnosis, making it difficult to redo a second round of PCR or to rehybridize FISH probes before the embryos should be transferred back to the patient.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases {{who are in the}} process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. <b>Preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{methods of}} opening the zona pellucida have the same success rate because the {{well-being}} of the embryo and/or blastomere may be impacted by the procedure used for the biopsy. Zona drilling with acid Tyrode's solution (ZD) was looked at in comparison to partial zona dissection (PZD) to determine which technique would lead to more successful pregnancies and have less of an effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. ZD uses a digestive enzyme like pronase which makes it a chemical drilling method. The chemicals used in ZD may have a damaging effect on the embryo. PZD uses a glass microneedle to cut the zona pellucida which makes it a mechanical dissection method that typically needs skilled hands to perform the procedure. In a study that included 71 couples, ZD was performed in 26 cycles from 19 couples and PZD was performed in 59 cycles from 52 couples. In the single cell analysis, there was a success rate of 87.5% in the PZD group and 85.4% in the ZD group. The maternal age, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and other variables did not differ between the ZD and PZD groups. It was found that PZD led to a significantly higher rate of pregnancy (40.7% vs 15.4%), ongoing pregnancy (35.6% vs 11.5%), and implantation (18.1% vs 5.7%) than ZD. This suggests that using the mechanical method of PZD in blastomere biopsies for <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis may be more proficient than using the chemical method of ZD. The success of PZD over ZD could be attributed to the chemical agent in ZD having a harmful effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. Currently, zona drilling using a laser is the predominant method {{of opening the}} zona pellucida. Using a laser is an easier technique than using mechanical or chemical means. However, laser drilling could be harmful to the embryo and it is very expensive for in vitro fertilization laboratories to use especially when PGD is not a prevalent process as of modern times. PZD could be a viable alternative to these issues.|$|E
500|$|There are ethical {{concerns}} {{related to}} prenatal genetic testing or <b>preimplantation</b> genetic diagnosis {{to ensure a}} child is not born with a given disease. For example, prenatal testing raises the issue of selective abortion, a choice considered unacceptable by some. As it is a dominant disease, there are difficulties in situations in which a parent {{does not want to}} know his or her own diagnosis. [...] This would require parts of the process to be kept secret from the parent.|$|E
