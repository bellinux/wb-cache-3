50|$|It was {{formerly}} {{the site of}} a large chalk quarry featuring a <b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> <b>stall</b> mine, an entrance to which still exists, however, it is sealed off for human entry.|$|E
50|$|The blonde {{sandstone}} however {{was still}} {{considered to be}} of such value that in the 1850s when the depth of overburden became too great for opencast quarrying, it was mined using the traditional <b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> <b>stall</b> technique. Quarrying ceased in 1907 however after a fall at Huntershill killed several men.|$|E
5000|$|The mine {{itself was}} {{excavated}} in a <b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> <b>stall</b> method, whereby cavities ("rooms") approximately 7 yd in width were excavated first, separated by [...] "pillars" [...] that were 14 yd in width. Once {{the rooms were}} all excavated, the pillars were then removed, in a specific order {{so as to avoid}} a mine collapse. The removal of the pillars had almost been completed by 1900 when the accident occurred.|$|E
60|$|It was a long, {{rambling}} place, that show-room, {{a gallery}} broken up by stands <b>and</b> <b>stalls</b> <b>and</b> <b>pillars,</b> with archways leading off to other departments, {{in which the}} queerest-looking assistants loafed and stared at one, and with perplexing mirrors and curtains. So perplexing, indeed, were these that I was presently unable {{to make out the}} door by which we had come.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chapter house}} is notable for its {{octagonal}} shape, slender central <b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> decorative medieval frieze. It was redecorated in 1855-9 by William Burges. The frieze circles the interior above the <b>stalls</b> <b>and</b> depicts scenes and {{stories from the}} books of Genesis and Exodus, including Adam and Eve, Noah, the Tower of Babel, and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.|$|R
50|$|The temple is {{enclosed}} by 7 concentric walls (termed prakarams (outer courtyard) or mathil suvar) {{with a total}} length of 32,592 feet or over six miles. This temple has 21 gopurams (towers), 39 pavilions, fifty shrines, Ayiram kaal mandapam (a hall of 1000 <b>pillars)</b> <b>and</b> several small water bodies inside. The space within the outer two prakarams (outer courtyard) is occupied by several shops, restaurants <b>and</b> flower <b>stalls.</b> Non-Hindus are allowed {{up to the second}} prakaram (outer courtyard) but not inside the gold topped sanctum sanctorum.|$|R
5000|$|Room and pillar (variant {{of breast}} stoping), also called <b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> <b>stall,</b> is a mining {{system in which}} the mined {{material}} is extracted across a horizontal plane, creating horizontal arrays of rooms and pillars. The ore is extracted in two phases. In the first, [...] "pillars" [...] of untouched material are left to support the roof overburden, and open areas or [...] "rooms" [...] are extracted underground; the pillars are then partially extracted {{in the same manner as}} in the [...] "Bord & Pillar method". The technique is usually used for relatively flat-lying deposits, such as those that follow a particular stratum.|$|E
50|$|The mines are {{an example}} of <b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> <b>stall</b> mining, with the roof having support {{provided}} by pillars of stone left in place when mining was taking place. There are two sets of caverns, {{the first and most}} noticeable caves have seven portals and lead down into a large cavern. To the back and to the left of this was a roadway which was sealed in 1948. Beyond the roadway is an extensive network of tunnels, with access being possible from secure location. The other set of caves lies north west of the first set. These caves lie {{at the bottom of a}} deep ditch. One is simply a short tunnel, the other leads into a deeper set of caves. The entrance to the deeper set of caves is gated.|$|E
50|$|New Winning Pit SD691718Stable End Pit was sunk in 1831 {{and hit the}} Four Foot seam at a {{depth of}} 80 yards. A 40 hp steam engine drove the pumps, and a 4 hp engine raised the coal. A second shaft was sunk next to new Winning House in 1834. It reached the Six Foot seam {{at a depth of}} 120 yards. The shaft was {{subsequently}} used as the upcast shaft by Wilson Wood Colliery. Haulage roads were driven from west to east along the strike of the coal which was worked up-dip by <b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> <b>stall.</b> In 1844 a drift was cut into the Four Foot seam. New Winning Pit was prone to flooding but firedamp was not a problem. New Winning employed about 100 men and boys. By 1853 it was decided to sink new shafts in Wilsons Wood.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{results obtained}} from a remarkably small-scale helicopter airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey of a closed landfill. The landfill, occupying a former quarry, is situated among shallow, worked-out coal seams (<b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> <b>stall</b> workings) and was located over at least two mineshafts that occupied the quarry floor. The landfill {{was known to be}} leaking from an extensive borehole investigation {{that took place in the}} 1970 ’s, when the landfill was active. Redevelopment issues and associated, proposed surface extraction of coals have renewed interest in the possible pollution threat of waste products. Of particular concern is the extent to which pollution has, potentially, transgressed a fault to the north and entered the area of proposed regeneration. The airborne survey data (EM and magnetic) were obtained using the six-frequency RESOLVE bird using a flight line spacing of 40 m. The data acquired have been subjected to 1 D regularized inversion to enable a 3 D conductivity model to be assessed. The model clearly identifies the landfill as a source term of highly conductive materials. At conductivities that are a factor of 3 above background, evidence for a variety of vertically compact, lateral migration pathways, largely below the base of the quarry, is obtained...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} an airborne electromagnetic survey {{carried out in}} February 2004 {{in the vicinity of}} the Eastfield quarry, former landfill situated in West Lothian, Scotland. The landfill is situated on the former Polkemmet colliery site. The survey consisted of 54 km of line coverage. The purpose of the survey was to investigate the capabilities of the technique in relation to mapping subsurface leakage and migration of conductive materials from a former waste disposal site. The survey took place some 24 years after closure of the landfill. The landfill, occupying a former quarry, is situated among shallow, worked-out coal seams (<b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> <b>stall</b> workings) and was located over at least two mineshafts that occupied the quarry floor. The landfill was known to be leaking from an extensive borehole investigation that took place in the 1970 ’s, when the landfill was active. Redevelopment issues and associated, proposed surface extraction of coals have renewed interest in the possible pollution threat of waste products. Of particular concern is the extent to which pollution has, potentially, transgressed a fault to the north and entered the area of proposed regeneration. The airborne survey data (EM and magnetic) were obtained using the six-frequency RESOLVE bird and a flight line spacing of 40 m. The data acquired have been subjected to 1 D regularized inversion to enable a 3 D conductivity model to be assessed. The main site assessment covers a 600 x 600 x 100 m volume in the immediate vicinity of the landfill and Polkemmet Fault to the north. The model clearly identifies the landfill as a source term of highly conductive materials. At conductivities that are a factor of 3 above background, evidence is obtained for a variety of vertically compact, lateral migration pathways, largely below the base of the quarry. A limited amount of ground geophysical follow-up (Vertical Electric Sounding) has provided a degree of confirmation of the airborne conductivity model...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was -undertaken to {{investigate}} the mechanism of void migration and the collapse characteristics of old shallow surface (< 50 m), <b>pillar</b> <b>and</b> <b>stall</b> coal mine workings. Simple stereo-photographic techniques have been employed to record these structures where they occur in the high walls of NCB and private opencast coal sites. Several relationships have been identified from this data, and the investigation concludes that the crushing of coal pillars at depth is rare and that the principal mechanism of failure involves {{the collapse of the}} roof material into the working. A classification of failure mechanisms based on the frequency and spacing of horizontal and vertical discontinuities relative to the span of the working is proposed. Two distinct situations for analysis are recognised. The first involves the stability of the immediate roof, while the second is concerned with the stability of the 'arch' that develops when the immediate roof beam collapses. Continuous roof beams {{have been found to be}} rare in Coal Measures rocks and therefore simple beam analysis is considered to be of little use. Where discontinuities are present Voussoir beam analysis may be appropriate, and Voussoir beam theory has been corrected and extended to overcome some of the problems recognised with the technique. Bulking and arching have been recognised as the 'normal' limiting factors on the height of collapse and are considered as complimentary failure mechanisms. For a 'typical coal mine collapse' situation arching is shown to be the dominant control. However, a review of arching has shown that in general all the theories underestimate the height of collapse. Thus, a statistically derived relationship of (collapse height = 2. 68 X span of working) has been proposed as the limiting height for arching situations. Existing bulking relationships have been shown to be rather simplistic and appropriate corrections to the theories are suggested. An analysis of bulking factors derived from colliery discard has shown that a regional variation in this parameter is likely...|$|E
