40|$|Based on the {{observation}} that ray parenchyma cell death took place prior to nematode population increase in pine wood,the authors suspected that any microorganisms carried by pathogenic nematodes would be involvedin the pathogenic process. The authors screened pathogenic nematode-accompanying microbes for their toxicity against cultured cells of Pinus thunbergiis and isolated and identified 3 toxic strains,Bacillus cereus HY- 3,B. subtilis HY- 16,and Bmegaterium HY- 17, whose toxic products were identified as phenylacertic acid. Inoculation of pine seedlings with the toxic bacterium alone did not cause the seedling to wilt, but inoculation of pine seedlings with the toxic bacterium carried by weakly pathogenic nematodes wilted the seedling as much as strongly pathogenic nematodes. These results suggested that phenyllacetic acid-producing bacteria could invade pine trees by accompanying <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> <b>nematodes,</b> and produce phenylacetic acid, a toxic metabolite, in the wood. マツ材線虫病の初期症状である樹脂道エピセリウム細胞や周辺柔細胞の変性は、マツノザイセンチュウのその場への到着および増殖に先行して起こることから、マツノザイセンチュウに随伴する微生物が発病に関与しているのだはないかと推論し、本研究では、クロマツ培養細胞に対する毒性を指標にして強病原生マツノザイセンチュウから毒物質生産細菌を数株を単離したえ。さらに、この毒性代謝物質を単離し、フェニル酢酸と同定した。フェニル酢酸生産細菌は、普遍的に存在するが、フェニル酢酸生産性には、大きい差があることを確認した。このフェニル酢酸生産細菌のみを接種しても、アカマツ実生は萎凋しなかったが、弱病原性マツノザイセンチュウに保持されて接種すると、ザイセンチュウの病原性が強くなった。このかとから、フェニル酢酸生産細菌は、マツノザイセンチュウに運搬されて松樹体内を移動し病原毒素フェニル酢酸を生産するものと推論した...|$|R

50|$|Scots pine {{has also}} been widely planted in New Zealand {{and much of the}} colder regions of North America; {{it was one of the}} first trees {{introduced}} to North America, in about 1600. It is listed as an invasive species in some areas there, including Ontario, Michigan and Wisconsin. It has been widely used in the United States for the Christmas tree trade, and was one of the most popular Christmas trees from the 1950s through the 1980s. It remains popular for that usage, though it has been eclipsed in popularity, by such species as Fraser fir, Douglas-fir, and others. Despite its invasiveness in parts of eastern North America, Scots pine does not often grow well there, partly due to climate and soil differences between its native habitat and that of North America, and partly due to damage by pests and diseases; the tree often grows in a twisted, haphazard manner if not tended to (as they are in the Christmas tree trade). Scots pines may be killed by the <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> <b>nematode,</b> which causes pine wilt disease.

40|$|We {{report the}} cloning and {{characterisation}} of genes encoding expansin-like proteins from the <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> <b>nematodes,</b> Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and B. mucronatus.

Molecular modelling suggests that the genes could encode a protein with a structure {{similar to that of}} functionally characterised expansins. Expression analysis showed that the Bursaphelenchus expansin-like genes are expressed solely in the pharyngeal gland cells, implying a role in the host-parasite interaction, most likely in assisting migration through the plant. Some G. rostochiensis and root-knot nematode expansins are composed of a carbohydrate-binding domain coupled to an expansin domain but no carbohydrate binding domain is present on any of the Bursaphelenchus sequences.

Conversely, the proliferation rate of B. xylophilus on mycelial mats of Botrytis cinerea was significantly different from that of B. mucronatus. The study using 4 -year-old P. thunbergii seedlings also showed that B. mucronatus can migrate to distal portions of the pine seedlings the same as B. xylophilus, but the populations of B. xylophilus remaining in the pine seedlings were relatively larger than those of B. mucronatus.

In total, 15 highly expressed proteins were identified in B. xylophilus compared with B. mucronatus. Subsequently, the specificity of the proteins identified was confirmed by PCR using the genomic DNA of other nematode species. Finally, a gene encoding a specific protein (Bx-Prx) was obtained.

40|$|Pine {{wilt disease}} (PWD), {{which is caused}} by <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> <b>nematodes</b> (PWN), {{is one of the}} most serious forest {{diseases}} worldwide. To clarify the mechanism of resistance to PWD, we compared metabolites from resistant and susceptible Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii) families after inoculation with PWN. After 2 weeks to 1 month post inoculation, the number of PWN dramatically increased in susceptible plants, but not in resistant plants. At this PWN-proliferation phase, ethyl acetate soluble fractions extracted from PWN-inoculated plants were analyzed by gas chromatogramphy- mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Although most compounds were qualitatively and quantitatively similar between resistant and susceptible plants, resistant plants accumulated 2. 0 -fold more linoleic acid (LA) than susceptible plants. On the other hand, benzoic acid (BA) was barely detected in resistant plants, but it accumulated in susceptible plants as the number of PWN increased. Susceptible plants contained greater levels of the nematicidal compounds pinosylvin and pinosylvin monomethyl ether, compared with resistant plants. These results suggested that LA is involved in the resis tance reaction against PWN-proliferation, and that BA could be a good biomarker for PWD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is the causative {{agent of}} pine wilt disease {{which has caused}} huge {{economic}} losses in many countries.

We found 238 transcripts and 84 exons which showed notable changes between the two virulent forms. Functional analyses of both differentially expressed transcripts and exons indicated that different virulence strains showed dissimilar nematode growth, reproduction, and oxidoreductase activities. In addition, we also detected a small number of exon-skipping events in B. xylophilus. Meanwhile, 117 SNPs were identified as potential genetic markers in distinguishing the two forms. Four of them were further proved to have undergone allele specific expressions and possibly interrupted the target site of evolutionary conserved B. xylophilus miR- 47. These particular SNPs were experimentally verified by including eight additional strains to ensure the validity of our sequencing results.

40|$|In pine {{wilt disease}} (PWD), embolized tracheids arise after virulent <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> <b>nematodes</b> (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, invade the resin canal of pine tree; {{infected}} pine trees finally die from significant loss of xylem water conduction. We used a compact {{magnetic resonance imaging}} system with a U-shaped radio frequency (rf) probe coil to reveal the developmental process of the xylem dysfunction in PWD. Multiple cross-sectional slices along the stem axis were acquired to periodically monitor the total water distribution in each 1 -year-old main stem of two 3 -year-old Japanese black pines (Pinus thunbergii) after inoculation of PWN. During the development of PWD, a mass of embolized tracheids around the inoculation site rapidly enlarged in all directions. This phenomenon occurred before the significant decrease of water potential. Some patch-like embolisms were observed at all monitoring positions during the experimental period. Patchy embolisms in a cross-section did not expand, {{but the number of}} patches increased as time passed. When the significant decrease of water potential occurred, the xylem dysfunctional rate near the inoculation point exceeded 70 %. Finally, almost the whole area of xylem was abruptly embolized in all cross-sections along the stem. This phenomenon occurred just after water conduction was mostly blocked in one of the cross-sections. Thus, it appears that the simultaneous expansion of embolized conduit clusters may be required to induce a large-scale embolism across the functional xylem. Consequently, xylem dysfunction in infected trees may be closely related to both the distribution and the number of PWN in the pine stem...|$|R

To estimate the effectiveness of these measures, a simulation model was developed and calibrated using experimental data specifying the dispersal capabilities of the insect vector Monochamus galloprovincialis.

The simulations that were then carried out under different scenarios (preventive or curative) showed that the clear-cuts currently requested by European and French regulations would not be effective in a landscape configuration of continuous plantations of maritime pine.
