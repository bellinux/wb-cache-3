25|$|A sea kayak's <b>primary</b> <b>safety</b> {{device is}} its paddler. Although some kayakers {{consider}} a well-practised self-righting move {{such as an}} Eskimo roll to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises {{in order to maintain}} an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, the reality is that having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace can put the paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in surf zones, rocky surf zones (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.|$|E

40|$|Safety {{precautions}} {{utilized for}} control and cominement of fissionable and radioactive {{materials in the}} various aqueous reprocessing operations performed at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant are presented. Three <b>primary</b> nuclear <b>safety</b> controls, geometrical, mass limitation, and concentration control, are used. Operations are penformed according to standard operating procedures which are set up to prevent circumvention of the <b>primary</b> nuclear <b>safety</b> controls. The various processing operations with their particular safety features are discussed. The operations include receipt, handling, and storage of irradiated fuel elements, dissolution of the fuel elements in various reagents, separation of the unburned fissionable material from fission products and fuel element structural materials by solvent extraction, salvage or recycle operations of off- specifications product or waste solutions that exceed the dispossble fuel concentrationalimits, product packaging, storage and shipment, fission product recovery, and waste collection, handling and disposal. The originai plant design and later additions and modifications included built-in geometrical control wherever practical with allowances for possible neutron interaction between vessels. The standard operating procedures specificaily state mass limits and concentration controls required for certain operations which involve appreciable quantities of uranium. Administrative control insures compliance with the standard operating procedures. (auth...|$|R

50|$|In the {{automotive}} sector the term active safety (or <b>primary</b> <b>safety)</b> refers to safety {{systems that are}} active prior to an accident. This has traditionally referred to non-complex systems such as good visibility from the vehicle and low interior noise levels. Nowadays, however, this area contains highly advanced systems such as anti-lock braking system, electronic stability control and collision warning/avoidance through automatic braking. This compares with passive safety (or secondary safety), which are active during an accident. To this category belong seat belts, deformation zones and air-bags, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Reefing is {{the means}} of {{reducing}} the area of a sail, usually by folding or rolling one edge of the canvas in on itself.

50|$|As {{with all}} of these types of {{recoilless}} rocket weapons, the backblast that is created when it is fired is a <b>primary</b> <b>safety</b> concern. When the rocket is fired, the rocket propellant in expended entirely within the rocket encasement. This is the cause of the extremely loud and violent backblast. This backblast extends in a 90-meter, 60° cone {{to the rear of the}} weapon. The backblast is lethal out to 30 m, and still extremely dangerous to 90 m. Rounds are under development that would enable a user to fire the rocket from an enclosed building without risk of injury.|$|E
50|$|A 2016 phase 1-2 {{prospective}} study orally administered 800 mg per day to 27 patients with telomere diseases.

The study was halted early, after telomere attrition was reduced in all 12 patients who could be evaluated. 12 of 27 patients achieved the primary efficacy end point, 11 of whom increased telomere length at 24 months. Hematologic responses (secondary efficacy endpoint) occurred in 10 of 12 patients who could be evaluated at 24 months. Elevated liver-enzyme levels and muscle cramps (known adverse effects) of grade 2 or less occurred in 41% and 33% of the patients, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>safety</b> concern {{cited by}} {{community}} members is petty theft. Djougou {{has a reputation}} for being a “city of voleurs,” and community members take precautions by keeping valuables under lock and key. Instances of theft are rarely solved by the police, but are instead resolved by community pressure or occasionally physical, public retribution. There are two major gendarmerie offices in Djougou, but generally community members do not rely on them to handle safety and security issues. Children tend to be victimized by safety and security concerns, as beatings are commonplace. A five year old drowned in a well that was not properly covered and an older child was killed while playing near the dam in 2009.|$|E
