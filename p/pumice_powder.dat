So the aim of this study is Kinetic and isotherm study of methylene blue adsorption by <b>powdered</b> <b>pumice</b> from the aquatic environment. Methods: Adsorption process was investigated in vitro at neutral pH, a constant concentration of dye and adsorbent dosage. The residual concentration of the dye solution through adsorption was measured at a wavelength nm 665 by using a spectrophotometer (Cary 50 manufacturers of Perkin Elmer). In order to understand how to adsorption, obtained data were fitted with Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Harikens-jura and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms and Pseudo –first –order, Pesedo – second – order, Intraparticle diffusion and Elovich Kinetics. Results: Results showed that in the between of five isotherm models, the adsorption process is most obeyed of Harikens-jura isotherm (R 2 = 0. 9914). Also the adsorption process has appropriate obeyed of both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms (R 2 = 0. 9633 and R 2 = 0. 9365) and it is means that the adsorption process occurs in a mono- layer and multi-layer. The low of mean free energy (E= 0. 323 KJ/mol) in Dubinin-Radushkevich showed that the physical absorption process is dominant adsorption. Also adsorption process is obeyed of pseudo – second – order model. Conclusion: According to the results, can say Methylene blue adsorption multi -layer is most occurs than mono- layer and the pumice is the effectiveness adsorbent for removal methylene blue dye (RL= 0. 2) ...|$|R

Symmetric four-point and five-point systems and an asymmetric four-point system were investigated. The landing-gear legs were inverted tripod arrangements having a telescoping main strut which incorporated a yielding-metal strap for energy dissipation, hinged V-struts, and circular pads. The landing tests were made by launching a free model onto an impenetrable hard surface (concrete) and onto a powdered-pumice overlay of various depths. Landing motion and acceleration data were obtained for a range of touchdown speeds, touchdown speeds, touch attitudes, and landing-surface conditions. Symmetric four-point and five-point systems and an Maximum normal acceleration experienced at the module center of gravity during landings on hard surface or pumice was 2 g (full-scale lunar value in terms of earth's gravity) over a wide range of touchdown conditions. Maximum angular acceleration experienced was 12 - 1 / 2 radians/sec(exp 2) and maximum longitudinal acceleration was 1 - 3 / 4 g. The module was very stable with all gear configurations during landings on hard surface (coefficient of friction, microns= 0. 4) at all conditions tested.

40|$|We are {{currently}} establishing the phase relationships of Vesuvius phonolites (white pumices of Mercato, Avellino, Pompei and Pollena eruptions) and tephrites {{with the aim}} of defining the P-T-fH 2 O-fO 2 pre-eruption conditions of erupted magmas. Here we will present the results so far obtained on the phonolites. We used dry starting glasses prepared from fusing twice <b>powdered</b> <b>pumice</b> at 1 bar, to which various amounts of H 2 O and CO 2 were added to achieve fluid saturation, loaded to Au capsules. Experiments were performed at 1 - 3 kbar, 750 - 900 °C, H 2 Omelt 1 - 10 wt% and NNO-NNO+ 1, using an IHPV fitted with a H 2 -membrane, with Ar-H 2 mixtures as pressure media. Run durations were 7 - 30 days, and were ended by isobaric quenches. Phase relationships were established either isobarically (2 kb, 750 - 900 °C) or isothermally (800 °C, 1 - 3 kb). Phases crystallised are: sanidine, plagioclase, leucite, nepheline, analcime, scapolite, sodalite, biotite, amphibole, garnet, clinopyroxene, magnetite. Under water-rich conditions, clinopyroxene is the liquidus phase in all compositions. In Pompei and Pollena phonolites, however, it reacts out to garnet at temperatures below 800 - 820 °C. Amphibole is not stable at temperatures above 825 °C at 2 kb in Avellino, Mercato and Pompei pumices, and it is always absent in Pollena at any P-T so far explored. Experiments realised below 2 kb and 800 °C do not crystallise amphibole in any compositions, except in Pompei at low H 2 Omelt. Similarly, at 3 kb and 800 °C, amphibole is absent in the Pompei. Leucite crystallises only in Pompei and Pollena, and is present at and below 2 kb. At 2 kb, garnet crystallisation is restricted to below 825 °C in Pompei and below 800 °C in both Mercato and Avellino pumices, whereas it is stable up to 900 °C in Pollena. The presence of amphibole in Mercato, Avellino and Pompei pumices constrains pre-eruption temperatures of the magmas to be below 825 °C. For Pompei, amphibole and leucite occurrences suggest a pressure of magma storage of 2. 1 ± 0. 2 kb. At this pressure, the phase assemblage of Pompei white pumice is reproduced at 815 ± 10 °C, H 2 Omelt of 6 - 6. 5 wt% (XH 2 Ofluid of 0. 8 ± 0. 05), at an fO 2 of NNO+ 0. 5 ± 0. 5, in agreement with melt inclusion constraints (Cioni, 2000). For both Mercato and Avellino, experiments are not yet conclusive with respect to pressure. If, however, the magma reservoir that fed these two eruptions was at a similar pressure depth than that of the Pompei event then phase equilibria imply pre-eruption temperatures 0. 8) which contrast with melt inclusion data for Avellino (3. 1 ± 0. 7 wt%, Signorelli et al., 1999). Additional experiments will test these estimates. For Pollena, the presence of amphibole in the pumice shows that there too additional experiments are needed. Ignoring this problem, phase equilibria suggest temperatures higher than 800 °C, H 2 Omelt < 6 wt% (XH 2 Ofluid< 0. 8) and pressure below 3 kb.

Conclusion. The prophylactic techniques used in this study had a negative effect on the marginal gaps of Cl V resin-modified glass-ionomer restorations...|$|E
40|$|Statement of problem: The {{longevity}} of a post-endodontic restoration with adhesively luted fiber posts depends {{heavily on the}} amount of the remaining tooth structure as well as a minimally invasive post space preparation and sufficient adhesion of the luting agent to the intra-radicular dentin. Bonding to root canal dentin is still a challenge due to limited access and visibility. Moreover, dentin hybridization can be compromised by remnants of sealer and gutta-percha in the endodontic space. It is also not clear which luting strategy might be beneficial for luting fiber posts. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of cleaning method, luting agent and preparation procedure on the retention of fiber posts. Materials and methods: 156 human canines were allocated to twelve groups (n = 13). The teeth were decoronated, instrumented and root filled using warm vertical compaction. 78 roots received post space preparations using dedicated drills of the fiber post system DT Light Post SL (group PD), and in 78 roots gutta-percha was removed using a rose-head bur up to a depth of 8 mm (group RHB). In both groups 26 root canals each were rinsed using 1 % NaOCl (control), 26 were cleaned using rotating brushes and <b>pumice</b> <b>powder</b> and 26 were sandblasted with Al 2 O 3 (50 µm) using an intraoral device. Cleanliness of the root canal was investigated using an operating microscope. Furthermore a qualitative SEM-analysis of one specimen of each group was performed. Fiber posts were inserted using self-adhesive resin cement (SmartCem 2) or a core build-up material (CoreX Flow/XP Bond). Pull-out force was measured using a universal testing machine. Subsequently, the failure mode was determined using a stereomicroscope. Moreover, two specimens of each group were evaluated using CLSM to analyze the adhesive interface. Results: The cleanliness of the root canals was not affected by the cleaning method (p = 0. 618; Chi-square-test). The pull-out force of the fiber posts was significantly affected by the cleaning method (p = 0. 008), the luting agent (p < 0. 0005) and the preparation procedure (p < 0. 0005; 3 -way ANOVA). Group RHB demonstrated significantly higher pull-out forces [399 (88) N] compared to group PD [287 (105) N]. Posts that were inserted using CoreX Flow showed significantly higher pull-out forces [370 (62) N] compared to SmartCem 2 [315 (141) N]. Pull-out force of fiber posts inserted into root canals that were cleaned using rotating brushes was significantly lower [315 (124) N] compared to controls [370 (104) N] (p = 0. 005; Tukey-HSD). Conclusions: The investigated cleaning methods after post space preparation did not impact the cleanliness of the root canal and could not enhance fiber post retention. The use of a core build-up material with an etch-and-rinse adhesive for luting fiber posts resulted in higher post retention compared to a self-adhesive cement. Post space preparation using a rose-head bur might be beneficial for improving retention especially when cements with a minor adhesive performance are used. Further studies should clearify whether the post space preparation with dedicated drills of the fiber post system is more invasive than the rose-head bur approach by using a µCT-analysis of the hard tooth tissue that was lost during preparation. Clinical significance: The investigated cleaning methods after post space preparation did not succeed in cleaning the canal-walls that were covered with gutta-percha and sealer remnants and could not enhance fiber post retention inside the root canal. Further studies should evaluate the effects of sonically activated canal brushes on the cleanliness of the root canal. Moreover, research is needed to clearify whether the rose-head bur-approach is beneficial for preserving sound tooth structure compared to the post space preparation with dedicated drills of the post system...|$|E
