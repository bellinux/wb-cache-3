40|$|In {{some wild}} Atlantic salmon populations, rapid declines in numbers of wild {{returning}} adults {{has been associated}} with an increase in the prevalence of farmed salmon. Studies of phenotypic variation have shown that interbreeding between farmed and wild salmon may lead to loss of local adaptation. Yet, few studies have attempted {{to assess the impact of}} interbreeding at the genome level, especially among North American populations. Here, we document temporal changes in the genetic makeup of the severely threatened Magaguadavic River salmon population (Bay of Fundy, Canada), a population that might have been impacted by interbreeding with farmed salmon for nearly 20 years. Wild and farmed individuals caught entering the river from 1980 to 2005 were genotyped at 112 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and/or eight microsatellite loci, to scan for potential shifts in adaptive genetic variation. No significant temporal change in microsatellite-based estimates of allele richness or gene diversity was detected in the wild population, despite its precipitous decline in numbers over the last two decades. This might reflect the effect of introgression from farmed salmon, which was corroborated by temporal change in linkage-disequilibrium. Moreover, SNP genome scans identified a temporal decrease in candidate loci potentially under directional selection. Of particular interest was a SNP previously shown to be strongly associated with an important quantitative trait locus for <b>parr</b> <b>mark</b> number, which retained its genetic distinctiveness between farmed and wild fish longer than other outliers. Overall, these results indicate that farmed escapees have introgressed with wild Magaguadavic salmon resulting in significant alteration of the genetic integrity of the native population, including possible loss of adaptation to wild conditions...|$|E
5000|$|The Little Kern {{golden trout}} is a brightly colored fish with profuse black {{spots on the}} back and tail. The belly and cheeks are {{typically}} a bright orange to orange-red. The lower sides of the fish range from a light yellow to bright gold. The back is olive green. The pectoral, pelvic and anal fins are orange with white tips. Unlike many varieties of rainbow trout, but similar to other redband trout and trout in the [...] "Golden Trout Complex", the Little Kern Golden Trout typically retain into adulthood up to ten <b>parr</b> <b>marks</b> along their sides.

50|$|The Mexican {{golden trout}} is sexually dimorphic, males {{can easily be}} {{identified}} from females due to their much longer jaws or kype. Mexican golden trout are brightly colored with blue <b>parr</b> <b>marks</b> on {{both males and females}} {{along the side of the}} body. Purple scaling is visible along the lateral line. Both sexes also have bright golden-yellow belly coloration. The top of the fish and the tailfin are covered in small black spots with much larger spotting on the dorsal fin. The pectoral fins, pelvic fin and anal fin are light orange in color with white tips. Due to their harsh and small stream habitat the Mexican golden trout remains small even when fully grown. Adults rarely reach over a foot long with the maximum size probably being 10 inches (25 cm). Overall body shape and fin placement nearly identical to Rainbow trout <b>Parr</b> <b>marks</b> usually remain distinct throughout the fish's life.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{a model for}} biological pattern formation during growth development. The pattern formation phenomenon is described by a reaction-diffusion system on a time-dependent domain. We prove the global existence of solutions to reaction-diffusion systems on time-dependent domains. We extend global existence results for a class of reaction-diffusion systems on fixed domains to the same systems posed on spatially linear isotropically evolving domains. We demonstrate that the analysis is applicable to many systems that commonly arise {{in the theory of}} pattern formation. Our results give a mathematical justification to the widespread use of computer simulations of reaction-diffusion systems on evolving domains. We propose a finite element method to approximate the solutions to reaction-diffusion systems on time-dependent domains. We prove optimal convergence rates for the error in the method and we derive a computable error estimator that provides an upper bound for the error in the semidiscrete (space) scheme. We have implemented the method in the C programming language and we verify our theoretical results with benchmark computations. The method is a robust tool for the study of biological pattern formation, as it is applicable to domains with irregular geometries and nonuniform evolution. This versatility is illustrated with extensive computer simulations of reaction-diffusion systems on evolving domains. We observe varied pattern transitions induced by domain evolution, such as stripe to spot transitions, spotsplitting, spot-merging and spot-annihilation. We also illustrate the striking effects of spatially nonuniform domain evolution on the position, orientation and symmetry of patterns generated by reaction-diffusion systems. To improve the efficiency of the method, we have implemented a space-time adaptive algorithm where spatial adaptivity is driven by an error estimator and temporal adaptivity is driven by an error indicator. We illustrate with numerical simulations the dramatic improvements in accuracy and efficiency that are achieved via adaptivity. To demonstrate the applicability and generality of our methodology, we examine the process of <b>parr</b> <b>mark</b> pattern formation during the early development of the Amago trout. By assuming the existence of chemical concentrations residing {{on the surface of the}} Amago fish which react and diffuse during surface evolution, we model the pattern formation process with reactiondiffusion systems posed on evolving surfaces. An important generalisation of our study is the experimentally driven modelling of the fish’s developing body surface. Our results add weight to the feasibility of reaction-diffusion system models of fish skin patterning, by illustrating that a reaction-diffusion system posed on an evolving surface generates transient patterns consistent with those experimentally observed on the developing Amago trout. Furthermore, we conclude that the surface evolution profile, the surface geometry and the curvature are key factors which play a pivotal role in pattern formation via reaction-diffusion systems...|$|E

40|$|In 2011, steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous rainbow trout) will be {{systematically}} transported above Howard Hanson Dam, Green River, Washington. We {{are interested}} in providing data to help manage the stock of fish that are selected to recolonize the upper river and to track how resident rainbow trout above the dam respond genetically after 80 years of isolation. We characterized relevant gene pools in the upper Green River before fish transportation with 11 microsatellite loci to evaluate the genetic variability within and among collections. We also examined morphometric and coloration patterns as potential indicators of adaptive variation. Hatchery steelhead are clearly different from wild steelhead (F(ST) = 0. 037); genetic assignment tests correctly distinguished 91 % of the steelhead. While there was no reduction {{in the amount of}} genetic variability in the resident rainbow trout above Howard Hanson Dam compared with that of wild steelhead collections below the dam, the two groups had low but statistically significant differences (F ST 0. 03). The transport of juvenile and adult steelhead above the dam in the last 20 years may have affected these genetic results. Two collections of hatchery rainbow trout were highly differentiated from all other collections, and a STRUCTURE analysis indicated that there was no introgression of their genes into Green River fish. Morphologically, significant differences were seen between juvenile resident rainbow trout and steelhead. Resident trout had a stout caudal peduncle and more <b>parr</b> <b>marks,</b> whereas juvenile steelhead had a more elongate tail and fewer <b>parr</b> <b>marks.</b> Given these genetic and phenetic measures of differentiation, managers can monitor and screen the upstream passage of steelhead, and will be able evaluate the level of participation of resident rainbow trout gene pools in the recolonization even...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{formation}} of the large dark patterns, known as <b>parr</b> <b>marks,</b> that form on the Amago trout as it grows from the early larval stages to adulthood. The Amago trout, known as Oncorhynchus masou ishikawa, exhibits stripes during the early stages of development that in turn evolve (through reorientation and peak insertion) to form zigzag spot patterns as the fish grows to adulthood. By considering a standard representation of the Turing model for biological self-organization via interacting and diffusing morphogens, we illustrate that a diffusively driven instability can generate transient patterns consistent with those experimentally observed during the process of parr-mark formation in the early development of the Amago trout. Surface evolution is modeled through an experimentally driven growth function. Our studies conclude that the surface evolution profile, the surface geometry, and the curvature are key factors that play a pivotal role in reaction-diffusion systems in a study motivated by observations of Amago trout parr-mark pattern formation. © 2011 American Physical Society...|$|R

5000|$|The eggs hatch in {{the late}} winter or early spring after six to seven weeks in the redd. Once hatched, they remain mostly {{immobile}} in the redd during the alevin life stage, which lasts for 6-7 weeks. Alevin {{no longer have the}} protective egg shell, or chorion, and rely on their yolk sacs for nourishment during growth. The alevin life stage is very sensitive to aquatic and sedimental contaminants. When the yolk sac is completely resorbed, the alevin leaves the redd. Young coho spend one to two years in their freshwater natal streams, often spending the first winter in off-channel sloughs, before transforming to the smolt stage. Smolts are generally 100 - 150 mm and as their <b>parr</b> <b>marks</b> fade and the adult's characteristic silver scales start to dominate. Smolts migrate to the ocean from late March through July. Some fish leave fresh water in the spring, spend summer in brackish estuarine ponds, and then return to fresh water in the fall. Coho salmon live in salt water for one to three years before returning to spawn. Some precocious males, known as [...] "jacks", return as two-year-old spawners. Spawning males develop kypes, which are strongly hooked snouts and large teeth.|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.,Colorectal {{cancer is}} {{a major cause of}} cancer {{mortality}} and is considered to be largely attributable to inappropriate lifestyle and behavior patterns. The purpose of this review was to undertake a comparison of the strength of the associations between known and putative risk factors for colorectal cancer by conducting 10 independent meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies. Studies published between 1966 and January 2008 were identified through EMBASE and MEDLINE, using a combined text word and MESH heading search strategy. Studies were eligible if they reported estimates of the relative risk for colorectal cancer with any of the following: alcohol, smoking, diabetes, physical activity, meat, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables. Studies were excluded if the estimates were not adjusted at least for age. Overall, data from 103 cohort studies were included. The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly associated with alcohol: individuals consuming the most alcohol had 60 % greater risk of colorectal cancer compared with non- or light drinkers (relative risk 1. 56, 95 % CI 1. 42 - 1. 70). Smoking, diabetes, obesity and high meat intakes were each associated with a significant 20 % increased risk of colorectal cancer (compared with individuals in the lowest categories for each) with little evidence of between-study heterogeneity or publication bias. Physical activity was protective against colorectal cancer. Public-health strategies that promote modest alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, weight loss, increased physical activity and moderate consumption of red and processed meat are likely to have significant benefits at the population level for reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer.

40|$|Research was {{completed}} to determine factors affecting smolt production and overwinter mortality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stocked as fry in Vermont tributaries of the Connecticut River. Specific focuses included: (1) timing of smolt migration relative to environmental and physiological factors; (2) effect of ice formation on habitats selected and winter distribution of parr; (3) effect of maturation on parr growth and smolt recruitment; and (4) smolt production dynamics and recruitment modeling. Smolt migration timing and recruitment was determined using net weirs and counting fences and mark-recapture and winter habitat studies were completed by night snorkeling. Tributaries differed in {{the timing of}} smolt migration with the tributary warming earliest in the spring generally experiencing earlier smolt migration. Initiation and cessation of smolt migratory activity appeared {{to be linked to}} smolt physiological development. Peaks in river discharge increased smolt migratory activity after water temperature thresholds were surpassed, yet only while smolts maintained elevated gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity. Ice formation caused significant changes in the physical stream environment, including a reduction in the abundance of habitats often selected by parr. Changes in the distribution of parr over the winter generally corresponded to changes in the distribution of high velocity habitats they rarely selected and low velocity habitats they often selected. Mature parr were abundant across and within tributaries. Percent mature in October/November was positively correlated with mean size the preceding June. Studies on individually <b>marked</b> <b>parr</b> showed that mature parr exhibited poorer June to October growth than immature parr resulting in large differences in fall size. Mature parr were recruited to smolt at a reduced frequency relative to immature parr and modeling analysis indicated that this difference resulted primarily from a one-third probability of smolting for mature parr rather than differences in fall to spring survival. Simulation modeling revealed that losses in potential smolt production attributable to parr maturation may be as high as 35...|$|R
