This {{study was conducted in}} order to assess whether different degrees of preservation of riparian forest (from well preserved with 30 m wide up to degraded with < 5 m wide) influence <b>potamoplankton</b> community structure. The study was conducted in three streams in the upper region of the Rio dos Sinos basin, at four sampling sites, with different width of the forest. Samplings were gathered for abiotic and biological analysis in winter (August 2010) and summer (January/February 2011). The analysis of environmental and biotic variables indicated that seasonality was the main determinant of biomass patterns, regardless of the width of riparian vegetation. The <b>potamoplankton</b> community of the studied streams responded to environmental conditions, although lack of significant difference among the different degrees of riparian vegetation preservation has been observed. Increasing trends on biomass, richness and diversity of species, and higher concentrations of total phosphorus and nitrogen in the non-preserved areas might indicate that the different gradients of preservation of riparian vegetation are related with the water quality in subtropical streams and consequently with the <b>potamoplankton</b> structure...|$|E
40|$|POTAMON is a unidimensional, non-stationary model, {{designed}} for simulating <b>potamoplankton</b> from source to mouth. The forcing variables are discharge, river morphology, water temperature, available light and nutrient inputs. Given {{the description of}} several algal categories, POTAMON allows to simulate algal "successions" at a particular site, as well as longitudinal changes of <b>potamoplankton</b> composition and biomass. The algal categories differ by their physiology, their loss rates, and their sensitivity to grazing by zooplankton. Two zooplankton categories were considered, Brachionus-like and Keratella-like, which differ by their clearance rate, their incipient limiting level, their selectivity towards phytoplankton, and their growth yield. The model simulates satisfactorily the onset and {{the magnitude of the}} phytoplankton spring bloom in the Belgian part of R. Meuse, the biomass decrease in early summer, and the autumn bloom. It also renders the major variations of algal assemblages along the river. The model allows to confirm that the main driving variables of <b>potamoplankton</b> dynamics in a eutrophic river are physical factors: discharge and related variables (e. g. retention time), light and temperature.

40|$|Aim: The composition, abundance, {{community}} {{structure of}} <b>potamoplankton</b> and major {{physical and chemical}} variables of the Nile water in Upper Egypt were investigated to assess its status in different seasons during 2007. MethodsWater samples were collected seasonally during 2007 from six investigated sites from variable depths at levels of 0, 2. 5 and 5 m. The area of this investigation {{is defined as the}} southern 120 Km of the main stream of the Nile in Upper Egypt (24 ° 04 &# 8217; &# 8211; 25 ° 00 &# 8217; latitudes and 32 ° 51 &# 8217; &# 8211; 32 ° 54 &# 8217; longitudes), downstream of Aswan Old Dam. ResultsAltogether, 121 <b>potamoplankton</b> species, of which 85 related to phytoplankton and 36 appertaining to zooplankton were recorded. Most numerous phytoplankton were Chlorophyceae (42 species) followed by Bacillariophyceae (30 species). Cyanobacteria and Dinophyceae were less numerous with only 11 and 2 species, respectively. Zooplankton species were mainly belonging to three systematic groups namely; Rotifera (24 species), Copepoda (3 species) and Cladocera (9 species). Besides, other rare zooplankton including Platyhelminthes, Nemata and Ciliophora were sparsely encountered. The main hydrological conditions characterizing the investigated area include water level fluctuations (&# 706; 82 - &# 707; 85 m above sea level), relatively high current velocity (0. 8 - 1. 3 m sec&# 8211; 1) and disposal of wastewater. Plankton populations were variably but rather weakly dependent on the major nutrients due to their excessive availability in accessible form for uptake by the producers. For phytoplankton, the community structure was categorized in relation to temperature, pH, SO 42 &# 8211; and Mg 2 +. For zooplankton, the community structure was categorized in relation to conductivity as well as Mg 2 +. Sampling intervals were inadequate to demonstrate the existing successional pattern of the Nile <b>potamoplankton</b> community. Alterations in the phytoplankton community structure accompanied changes in water temperature represented by the alternate dominance between diatoms and cyanobacteria, while zooplankton community was always dominated by rotifers. Phytoplankton populations were numerically more abundant in autumn and zooplankton peaked in spring. ConclusionsWastewater disposal restricted the abundance of the Nile zooplankton assemblages mainly due to the numerical decline of Rotifera and Cladocera. Otherwise, wastewater did not exert major limits for phytoplankton. The data obtained in this investigation will be crucial to understand <b>potamoplankton</b> regulation and contribute to the knowledge regarding the Limnology of the Nile basin...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} the size structure and taxonomic composition of phytoplankton in temperate rivers during base flows of summer {{to investigate the}} influence of river size, ambient nutrient concentration, and light availability on <b>potamoplankton</b> community structure. Algal biomass was measured in three size classes (2 – 20, 20 – 64, and � 64 �m) by microscope enumeration of water samples collected in 31 rivers and by chlorophyll a in water samples collected in 46 rivers in another year across Ontario and western Quebec. Nanoplankton dominated the <b>potamoplankton</b> biomass across the range of river nutrient concentrations (total phosphorus 5 – 280 �g PL� 1), water residence times (1 – 39 d), and light regimes (euphotic zone to mixing depth ratio 0. 1 – 33). Both nanoplankton (2 – 20 �m) and total <b>potamoplankton</b> biomass were significantly correlated with water column total phosphorus concentrations and were not related to water residence time or light availability. On average, diatoms contributed {{the largest percentage of}} the total biomass, followed by cryptophytes and an equal percentage of chlorophytes and chrysophytes. The contribution of any one division to total biomass was not significantly correlated with nutrients, water residence time, or light regime. In contrast to temperate lake systems, both the proportion of biomass in larger size classes and the contribution of cyanobacteria did not change significantly as a function of nutrient concentrations. However, community size structure varied in relation to river size: netplankton (� 64 �m) contributed slightly more to total biomass at sites with both shorter (� 2 d) and longer (� 10 d) water residence times. These results point to differences between the phytoplankton of lakes and rivers in response to eutrophication.

40|$|As part {{of ongoing}} {{research}} evaluating the baseline {{conditions of the}} Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR), Michigan, prior to a large scale floodplain wetland restoration, this project focused the variation in phytoplankton and water chemistry; spatially, seasonally, and hydrologically. During the growing season of 2014, phytoplankton and water chemistry parameters were surveyed throughout the SNWR and Saginaw River. These samples were synthesized and data were compared for patterns by season, sample location, and longitudinal position on the Saginaw River. Phytoplankton and water chemistry were also compared to hydrologic data including river slope (which served {{as an indicator of}} hydraulic residence time) as well as the occurrence of reverse or stalled flow in the Saginaw River. Results indicated that phytoplankton communities in floodplain wetlands, tributaries, and the main river channel varied significantly by taxonomic composition and abundance, as did key water chemistry parameters (Total Phosphorus, Nitrate, Total Dissolved Solids). Additionally, <b>potamoplankton</b> communities in the Saginaw River varied longitudinally, becoming more abundant, taxonomically rich, and diverse from upstream to downstream. Prolonged residence times due to low slopes also showed more diverse and abundant <b>potamoplankton</b> communities with fewer diatoms than times of high slopes.

40|$|Simple {{morphological}} {{traits of}} phytoplankton {{have proven to}} correlate well with the functional properties of taxa. A logical way of distinguishing functional groups of phytoplankton is to cluster species according to their morphological traits, instead of phytosociological traits, which are difficult to measure and incomplete {{for the vast majority}} of phytoplankton species. This novel approach inspired the establishment of morphologically based functional groups (MBFG) for lake phytoplankton. This study considers the MBFG as a potentially suitable tool for investigating and comparing the <b>potamoplankton</b> assemblages in riverine ecosystems. This study constructed a special version of MBFG that is aimed at rivers, termed MBFG R. MBFG R is based on information obtained from more than 800 samples of <b>potamoplankton</b> and zooplankton collected from 101 rivers located in four climate zones. Their habitat templates were also described by the thresholds of the environmental variables that promote group dominance. Despite its similar framework with MBFG, MBFG R emphasized the presence of flagella, size and shape, exoskeletal structures, life strategy and subdivision of diatoms. Their habitat templates are outlined by additional factors connected to hydrology and river types. Moreover, each discussed template includes consideration of grazing by zooplankton. Theoretically, MBFG R is better than MBFG because it can sensitively capture the ecological preferences of phytoplankton groups most associated with rivers and provides empirical values to reflect the environmental conditions in riverine ecosystems. </p...|$|E

40|$|Observations on {{phytoplankton}} in {{the lower}} reaches of the rivers Rhine and Meuse were {{carried out in the}} framework of the national monitoring programme of the main water systems in The Netherlands. Seasonal changes in density and species composition were analysed to detect the major variables and to discuss whether this monitoring meets its goals. Phytoplankton reached peak densities of 140 and 65 mu g L- 1 Chi alpha in the Rhine and Meuse, respectively. Overall density was correlated with seasonal variation in water discharge rather than with nutrient concentrations, that are high in both rivers. The position of sampling sites in relation to the downstream development of the plankton was very important, especially in the regulated Meuse. Despite hydrographic and chemical differences between the two rivers, many species, predominantly diatoms and green algae, were shared. The occurrence of the diatom Skeletonema subsalsum in the Rhine and the green algae Neodesmus danubialis, Micractinium pusillum and Pseudotetrastrum punctatum in the Meuse (1992, but not 1996) was interpreted as a feature related, respectively, to the high salinity of the Rhine and specific riverine conditions of the Meuse. In general the <b>potamoplankton</b> was characterised as an opportunistic assemblage exploiting the high nutrient contents and disturbed hydrography of both rivers. Nevertheless, the phytoplankton contributed to the characterisation of the present river communities, ones that differ rather strongly in historic records. Although year to year variation in phytoplankton density is mainly related to variation in water discharge, phytoplankton biomass did increase as a result of eutrophication over a period of decades. The widespread nature of many of today's <b>potamoplankton</b> species in the two rivers render these organisms less useful for indicating short-term changes in water quality. However the importance of phytoplankton in trophic relationships merits its inclusion in the monitoring of riverine ecosystems...|$|E

Highly significant linear regressions were obtained for chlorophyll o-total biomass, fucoxanthin-diatoms, lutein-green algae, chlorophyll fr-green algae. However, no relationship was found for cyanobacteria or cryptomonads and their specific pigments, which {{may be attributed to}} poor accuracy of biomass estimates for these non-dominant algae. In conclusion, the good relationship found for dominant algae and their specific pig-ments confirms the value of pigments as quantitative markers of phytoplankton, as detected in other marine and freshwater environments...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} changes in <b>potamoplankton</b> structure caused by lakes in the fluvial system of the small River Wel. The river flows through 10 lakes. The study was conducted in 2007 and 2008. The selection of sites enabled the assessment of the impact exerted by hydrological conditions of the river on zooplankton, as well as the determination of the effect of lakes situated within the river course on the analysed assemblage of organisms. In total 95 species were determined with an average abundance 1026 ind. 10 dm- 3. Rotifers dominated qualitatively and quantitatively and among crustaceans - Copepods. Lakes seem to be the main source of zooplankton in the fluvial system of the Wel River. The lakes disturb the river continuum, but their impact on the structure of zooplankton is short-lived. Due to the presence of flow-through lakes along the river, species richness of zooplankton in the Wel River is similar to that in large rivers...|$|E
40|$|The species composition, {{longitudinal}} distribution and seasonal dynamics of zooplankton were {{studied in the}} Zagyva River, Hungary. A total of 108 taxa was recorded from which 61 were new for the river. Rotatoria was the most abundant group, microcrustaceans were less important, only nauplii and copepodites were represented in similar individual numbers. Frequent species included Anuraeopsis fissa, Pompholyx spp., Keratella cochlearis, Brachionus angularis, Bdelloida sp., Bosmina longirostris. Dominance of cosmopolitan species was observed both in the river and its reservoir, and species characteristic of eutrophic waters were of major importance in the latter. There was a downstream decrease in zooplankton densities, which was explained by modified conditions. The relatively large number of individuals in autumn months, and the characteristic large number of individuals in the upper section contrasted general findings of <b>potamoplankton</b> dynamics. On {{the basis of the}} species abundance matrix, three river sections can be distinguished (upper, middle, lower section).

Foram {{realizadas}} coletas mensais, a subsuperfície, em 3 estações, no período de novembro de 1996 a novembro de 1997, e, bimestrais {{de janeiro}} de 1998 a maio de 1999. Foram analisados os padrões de distribuição do fitoplâncton em relação a alguns fatores limnológicos: temperatura da água, vazão, turbidez, condutividade elétrica, fósforo solúvel reativo, íon amônio, nitrato e nitrogênio Kjeldahl total, utilizando-se análise de correspondência canônica. Foram identificados 162 táxons. As classes Cyanophyceae e Bacillariophyceae foram as mais abundantes, sendo responsáveis pelos picos de densidade registrados. Durante o período de estudo, a maior densidade fitoplanctônica (28. 313 ind. ml - 1) foi registrada no rio Corumbá a jusante do reservatório, com dominância da diatomácea Achnanthes minutissima. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, cianoprocariota heterocitada, apresentou elevadas abundâncias nas estações a montante do reservatório, no período de seca. As variações observadas mostraram uma clara sazonalidade relacionada ao ciclo hidrológico, sendo que as menores densidades fitoplanctônicas ocorreram no período de maior vazão, enquanto que os máximos de abundância foram registrados durante reduzida vazão. Assim, a dinâmica da comunidade fitoplanctônica foi fortemente determinada pela vazão do rio Corumbá, temperatura da água e concentração de nutrientes Although phytoplankton {{plays an important}} role in the trophic web of lotic environments, studies on <b>potamoplankton</b> in Brazil are still scarce. The present study aims at characterizing the phytoplankton community in stations upstream and downstream Corumbá reservoir in the state of Goiás, and at identifying the main environmental variables that influence its structure. Samples of sub-surface water were collected monthly in 3 stations (2 upstream Corumbá reservoir and 1 downstream), from November 1996 to November 1997, and bimonthly from January 1998 to May 1999. The distribution pattern of phytoplankton was analyzed through the limnological factors of water temperature, flow, turbidity, electric conductivity, reactive soluble phosphorus, ammonium, nitrate, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen, using canonical correspondence analysis. Among the 162 taxa identified, Cyanophyceae and Bacillariophyceae were the most abundant and were responsible for density peaks. During the study period, the largest phytoplankton density (28. 313 ind. ml - 1) registered in the Corumbá river occurred in the station lying downstream the reservoir, with the dominance of the diatom Achnanthes minutissima. The heterocytous cyanoprokaryote Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii presented high abundance in the stations upstream the reservoir during the dry season. Variations showed a sharp seasonality related to the hydrological cycle, or rather, the lowest phytoplankton density occurred in the period of largest flow and maximum abundance was registered during reduced flow. Therefore, the dynamics of the phytoplankton community was strongly determined by the flow, temperature and nutrient concentrations of the Corumbá rive...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe river Rhine has lain under {{considerable}} anthropogenic {{stress of}} its water quality for 100 years. As early as 1905 the first results {{of studies of}} the plankton in the Rhine were published. Due to the long residence time of the water a real <b>potamoplankton</b> can develop {{and at the end}} of the Lower Rhine it reaches its highest density. The paper consists of two parts. At first an overview is given about the history of plankton studies in the Rhine. The second part is the presentation of results from a monitoring at the Lower Rhine from 1979 to 2004. First systematic studies started at the beginning of the 20 th century at the beginning of pollution. Our studies started during a phase of recreation from extreme pollution and eutrophication. Samples were taken at four stations: Bad Honnef, km 640, entrance to North Rhine-Westphalia, Düsseldorf, km 732, Duisburg, km 792 downstream large industrial effluents and big cities, Kleve-Bimmen, km 865 at the border to the Netherlands. In the 1970 s nutrients were high, especially phosphate 0. 65 mg PO 4 -PL− 1 in 1979. After 1980 phosphate dropped to 0. 11 mg PO 4 -PL− 1 in 2004 (mean values of the growing season). Ammonia was reduced from about 0. 52 (1979) to 0. 02 (2004) mg NH 4 -NL− 1. Nitrate remained between 3. 72 (1989) and 2. 26 (2004) mg NO 3 -NL− 1 at a relatively high level. Oxygen concentrations were very low during the 1960 s and 1970 s, sometimes only 4 mgL− 1 O 2. During our studies the oxygen increased up to 9 mgL− 1 O 2 with a tendency to 11 mgL− 1 O 2 in the last years. Chlorophyll a was estimated to be between 59 (1979) and 31 μgL− 1 (1986) with short peaks up to 170 μgL− 1 (1989). Since 1992 the mean values have varied between 30 (1993) and 21 μgL− 1 (2004). The floristic phytoplankton composition is characterised by the dominance of the centric diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii. Other diatoms like Skeletonema subsalsum, Skeletonema potamos and Asterionella formosa were regularly present in smaller quantities. The second dominant group was coccale green algae. During the 1980 s they formed up to 35 % of the biomass. Since the 1990 s their contribution to the phytoplankton became much smaller. This change corresponds with the increase of wastewater treatment and the diminution of nutrients. All the other groups of algae were present in minor quantities. During the time of higher trophy in the 1970 s and 1980 s the phytoplankton formed two peaks, in recent years only one peak has developed, depending on different flow conditions during the growing season and lower trophic state in the upstream parts of the river. Excellent correspondence exists between cell number, biovolume and chlorophyll a content and the results of delayed fluorescence (DF) measurement. The trophic status in the Lower Rhine may be estimated as (moderate) eutrophic. The ecological status of the phytoplankton is good based on the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The zooplankton consists mainly of rotatoria and larvs of Dreissena polymorpha. Grazing on phytoplankton seems to be mainly due to the large quantities of benthic Dreissena and the newly introduced mussel Corbicula...|$|E
