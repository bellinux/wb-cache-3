50|$|The Lighted <b>Program</b> <b>Function</b> <b>Keyboard</b> (LPFK) is a {{computer}} input device manufactured by IBM that presents an array of buttons associated with lights.Each button is associated to a function in supporting software, {{and according to the}} availability of that function in current context of the application, the light is switched on or off, giving the user a graphical feedback on the set of available functions. Usually the button to function mapping is customizable.|$|E

5000|$|The 2250 {{was housed}} in a desk with an {{alphanumeric}} (QWERTY) keyboard and a separate <b>programmed</b> <b>function</b> <b>keyboard</b> which had keys, indicator lights and switches. A plastic overlay label could be placed over the <b>function</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Punches on {{the top edge of}} the overlay could be sensed by the computer so the keys, lights and switches could be reprogrammed simply by changing overlays. The 2250s CRT measured 21" [...] diagonal, but the useful display area was 12 inch by 12 inch. A light pen was provided as a pointing device, serving the function of the modern computer mouse.|$|R
40|$|The Small Interactive Image Processing System (SMIP) is {{designed}} to facilitate the acquisition, digital processing and recording of image data as well as pattern recognition in an interactive mode. Objectives of the system are ease of communication with the computer by personnel who are not expert programmers, fast response to requests for information on pictures, complete error recovery as well as simplification of future programming efforts for extension of the system. The SMIP system is intended for operation under OS/MVT on an IBM 360 / 75 or 91 computer equipped with the IBM- 2250 Model 1 display unit. This terminal is used as an interface between user and main computer. It has an alphanumeric <b>keyboard,</b> a <b>programmed</b> <b>function</b> <b>keyboard</b> and a light pen which are used for specification of input to the system. Output from the system is displayed on the screen as messages and pictures...|$|R

50|$|Hollywood's {{focus is}} on ease of use and {{platform}} independence. It was mainly designed {{for the creation of}} games and multimedia applications. The language set comprises roughly 700 different commands from the following fields of application: 2D graphics, sound, file system operations, text output, animations, sprites, layers, transition effects, image manipulation, saving of images and video files, time and date <b>functions,</b> input <b>functions</b> (<b>keyboard,</b> joystick, mouse) as well as mathematical operations and string <b>functions.</b> <b>Programming</b> in Hollywood is done via so called Hollywood scripts (using the file extension *.hws). These scripts are compiled dynamically and can be converted into stand-alone executables. All Hollywood programs run inside a sandbox, which makes it impossible for them to crash.|$|R
