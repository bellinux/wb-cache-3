40|$|When {{a slight}} adductive {{force is applied}} by forceps to the {{straight}} or master eye in exotropia, the exodeviated or slave eye assumes the straight position. The nature of this phenomenon was studied. The reflex occurred in an all-or-none form and showed little dose response, that is, the slave eye did not adduct beyond the straight position even if an extreme forced adduction {{was applied to the}} master eye. Once the slave eye assumed the straight position by the reflex it maintained this position, even when the master eye was covered, except when the master eye was released from the forced adduction. This reflex movement response occurred promptly on repeated forced adduction at 9 Hz on the master eye, while the visual movement of the eye was limited to follow 1 Hz movement of the target. The reflex occurred readily in the light but hardly at all in the dark. From these facts the authors conclude that the reflex is brought about as a result of interaction between the <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>impulse</b> and the visual input, where the former may chiefly constitute the signal, while the latter restricts the threshold of the reflex pathway...|$|E

40|$|Muscle {{hardness}} measurements in a squeezing {{dynamometer test}} are interpreted for expressions of adjustment {{effects of the}} central nervous system in rapid response to a starting signal. It is shown that preliminary muscle tension leads to the transmission of inhibiting <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>impulses</b> to the nervous system centers and that the degree of pre-working changes depends on the individual's typological personality characteristics. Concentration of attention during the pre-working adjustment is considered the primary emotional factor that controls sensorimotor performance...|$|R
40|$|Three {{cases of}} facial nerve palsy with {{abnormal}} synkinetic movement manifesting with eye closure on jaw opening (Marin-Amat Syndrome) are described. The eye closure occurred only with wide jaw opening {{and it is}} felt that the disorder represents aberrant regeneration within the facial nerve with <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>impulses</b> associated with muscle stretch acting as the trigger. Though the movement is {{the exact opposite of}} what happens in the Marcus-Gunn phenomenon it is suggested that the term inverse Marcus-Gunn phenomenon be reserved for a congenital lesion with a different pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|A {{resonance}} technique {{was used to}} compare the muscle activity of groups of neu-rotic, schizophrenic, and control subjects matched for age and sex. Measurements were taken with subjects relaxing or experiencing a delayed auditory feedback. A replicated three-way analysis of variance showed the test to be reliable, and the groups were differentiated from each other at better than the 0. 01 probability level. G,TELLHOHN AND LOOFBOUHROW 4 have described a positive feedback system in which <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>impulses</b> from the striated muscles cause an increase in the activity of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus which, in turn, pro-duces an increase in hypothalamic-corti-cal discharges. They suggest that hy-pothalamic excitability in neurotic pa-tients may be reduced not only by psy-chotherapy but by the latter achieving a relative relaxation of the skeletal mus...|$|R
40|$|Proprioception is {{a quality}} of {{sensibility}} that originates in specialized sensory organs (proprioceptors) that inform {{the central nervous system}} about static and dynamic conditions of muscles and joints. The facial muscles are innervated by efferent motor nerve fibers and typically lack proprioceptors. However, facial proprioception {{plays a key role in}} the regulation and coordination of the facial musculature and diverse reflexes. Thus, facial muscles must be necessarily supplied also for afferent sensory nerve fibers provided by other cranial nerves, especially the trigeminal nerve. Importantly, neuroanatomical studies have demonstrated that facial <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>impulses</b> are conveyed through branches of the trigeminal nerve to the central nervous system. The multiple communications between the facial and the trigeminal nerves are at the basis of these functional characteristics. Here we review the literature regarding the facial (superficial) communications between the facial and the trigeminal nerves, update the current knowledge about proprioception in the facial muscles, and hypothesize future research in facial proprioception...|$|R
40|$|IT {{was shown}} in a {{preceding}} paper (Gellhorn, 1948) that alterations in posture influence quantitatively the movements resulting from stimulation of the motor cortex in the monkey. The postural changes consisted in varying the angle of a joint {{just prior to the}} application of the cortical stimulus. If, for example., the elbow formed an obtuse angle the reactivity of the biceps was greater than when the elbow was placed at an acute angle: conversely the latter condition was shown to enhance the reactivity of the triceps. The experiments seemed to show the validity of the von Uexkull-Magnus rule according to which central excitation has a tendency to flow into the stretched muscle. Our observations indicated, however, a definite limitation of this rule. Whereas Magnus observed that even the type of reflex movement depended on <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>impulses</b> which occurred in a certain posture no qualitative but only quantitative changes of cortically induced movement were seen in our earlier studies in different postures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: ION {{receives}} <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>impulses</b> from spino-olivary tract and {{conveys the}} fibers to the cerebellum through olivo-cerebellar tract. There is paucity of data in human olivary complex, hence {{the present study}} is done. Materials And Methods: 15 adult brains and 25 fetuses of different gestations were perfused with 10 % formalin and processed for histological examination. Results: Rounded cells have been seen infiltrating the entire field. at 16 weeks of gestation. Segregation of neurons into principal, medial, and dorsal accessory olivary nuclei at 20 wks gestation. Discussion: Neuron differentiation into oval, round, multipolar types has begun at 40 wks gestation. Neurons in the olivary subdivisions are grouped in separate clusters as per Ramon y Cajal, 1909; Scheibel and Scheibel, 1955, Bowman and King, 1973. Multipolar neurons dominated in adult inferior olivary nucleus. Conclusion:The greater development of neurons is a consequence of finer regulation of various movements of hands and finger associated with movement of head and eye...|$|R
40|$|The {{communication}} between the auriculotemporal and the facial nerves, i. e. the communicating auriculotemporal nerves (CATN), was studied in 55 facial sides from Thai cadavers. CATN only joined the temporofacial (upper) division of the facial nerve. CATN patterns were classified as follows: (1) the facial nerve was joined by 1 CATN (20. 7 %), (2) by 2 separate CATN branches (60. 4 %), (3) by 3 separate CATNs (15. 1 %); (4) several CATNs ran parallel to the zygomatic and buccal nerves to the muscles of facial expression (3. 8 %). The 4 types of CATN pattern showed further variations according {{to the site of}} union with the facial nerve. The superficial temporal artery was crossed by CATN branches anteriorly in 47. 1 %, posteriorly in 18. 9 %, and anteriorly and posteriorly in 34. 0 % of the cases. The facial nerve branches that were joined by CATNs were observed to supply the upper muscles of facial expression, i. e. frontalis, orbicularis oculi and zygomaticus major. Some offshoots from CATNs were seen to innervate orbicularis oculi. On the basis of our results we suggest that CATNs may convey <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>impulses</b> from orbicularis oculi...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{there have}} been no reports of {{experiments}} designed to induce scoliosis by direct damage of different areas of the spinal cord. In a series of rabbits with medullary damage, the authors attempted selectively to interrupt the pathways that mediate proprioceptive input. Unilateral lesion of the dorsal column and posterior horn of the spinal cord was performed using three different techniques: coagulation with laser, stereotaxic microcoagulation, and longitudinal electrocoagulation. Of 32 operated rabbits, 17 developed scoliosis, exhibiting clear pathologic damage of the spinal cord. Electrophysiologic study, including EMG and analysis of the tonic [...] vibratory reflex, was performed on 10 rabbits with medullary damage (scoliotic and non-scoliotic) and 12 matched controls. The data suggest disturbance of the sensory afferences that control the postural tone and consequent muscular imbalance, expressed as reduced activity in the muscles of the convex side. This work supports the view that loss of <b>proprioceptive</b> neural <b>impulses</b> caused by medullary damage can induce scoliosi...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in {{previous}} investigations that the recruitment order of motor units is different in tonic and in phasic voluntary activity. The significance of the pre-existing state of facilitation in the motoneurone pool for the recruitment of units is studied, using the phasic flexion reflex in the anterior tibial muscle as test reflex. It is shown that the recruitment order of units in a series of reflexes (1) is unstable if the subject does not expect the stimulus; (2) is stable and identical with that in tonic activity if the subject subliminally facilitates the motoneurone pool before the reflex activation; (3) is stable and almost identical with that in tonic activity if the subject expects the stimulus and therefore involuntarily influences the motoneurone pool; (4) is stable and similar to that in phasic voluntary activity if the subject inhibits the motoneurone pool before the activation and the stimulus strength thus consequentially is increased; and (5) is influenced by blockade of the <b>proprioceptive</b> afferent <b>impulses</b> from the muscle. It is concluded that normal man can select in advance the recruitment order of motor units most appropriate for the work intended...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cervical ripening, is a {{prerequisite}} for successful labor, which is often very painful and involves an inflammatory reaction. However, little is presently known con-cerning nerve-related changes in the human uterus during labor and the fundamental hy-pothesis tested here was that labor pain emanates primarily from the cervix uteri. To this end, the general innervation of the corpus and cervix uteri, as well as the possible pres-ence of neurotrophins and TPRV 1 (major factors involved in nociception) and of sensory corpuscles in these same two tissues were examined in term pregnancy prior to and after the onset of labor and compared to the non-pregnant state. Methods: Biopsies were collected from the corpus and cervix uteri of non-pregnant wom-en after hysterectomy and women who, following term pregnancy, either had a caesarean section prior to onset of labor or an emergency caesarean section during established labor. Serial sections prepared from the frozen biopsies were analyzed immunohistochemically employing antibodies directed specifically against PGP 9. 5, S- 100, NGF, BDNF, NGFR p 75, Trk B, NFILS and TRPV 1. Moreover, the levels of the mRNA species encoding NGFbeta, NGFR p 75, TrkA and TrkB in these same tissue samples were determined by Real-Time PCR. Results: The innervation of the corpus in term pregnancy, both prior to and after the onset of labor, differed profoundly from that of the cervix under the same conditions, as well as from that of the corresponding non-pregnant tissues. Thus, in term pregnancy, most nerve fibers staining positively for PGP 9. 5, NGFR p 75, NFILS and TRPV 1 -IR had virtually disappeared from the corpus, but remained in the cervix. At the same time, the numbers of nerve fibers expressing BDNF-IR, as well as of NGF-positive cells increased in both the corpus and cervix during labor. Corpus levels of NGFbeta, NGFR p 75 and TrkB mRNA were lower in term pregnancy with and without labor than in the non-pregnant control tissue, whereas the level of TrkA mRNA in the corpus was elevated. In the case of the cer-vix, expression of both NGFbeta and TrkA mRNA was up-regulated during labor. Moreover, sensory corpuscles were detected in both the non-pregnant corpus and cervix and also in the term pregnant cervix but only prior to the onset of labor. Conclusion: The observations documented here indicate unambiguously that during la-bor, the numbers of nerve fibers and levels of neurotrophins and TRPV 1 in the human cervix are considerably higher than in the corpus. These findings lend support to our hypothesis that the cervix uteri is the major site from which labor pain emanates. Further-more, the sensory corpuscles identified in the non-distended corpus and cervix probably convey mechanosensitive (<b>proprioceptive)</b> <b>impulses...</b>|$|R
