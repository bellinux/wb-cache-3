Although the estate adopted machine <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> in {{a quest to}} resolve imminent financial problems faced at Southdown the costs kept escalating. Therefore this study was undertaken to compare the two <b>harvesting</b> <b>methods</b> (hand <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> and machine <b>harvesting</b> <b>method)</b> in order to evaluate {{the costs and benefits}} for the two <b>harvesting</b> <b>methods</b> in tea production. In order to answer the first objective which was assessing the financial viability of machine versus hand picking in tea production a gross margin was used. The second objective was to compare costs and benefits of hand picking versus machine <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> and a cost and benefit analysis was conducted to attain the second objective. The results revealed that machine <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> is more viable than hand picking because it yielded a higher gross margin of US 17639. 36 as compared to hand <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> which yielded a gross margin of US 9534. 34.

Regarding the population growth, increase of rice production and reduction of losses have special importance in prevention of rice import. Rice losses in the harvest stage are the highest through the whole production period of this crop and hence the reduction of these losses is necessary. Provision of this purpose depends on on-time harvesting and separation of grains from chaff with the least grain losses, and choosing a suitable <b>harvesting</b> <b>method.</b> The choice of <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> depends on various factors in each region; thus, different <b>harvest</b> <b>methods</b> in each region must be compared while conducted in the same conditions. In order to recommend the beast <b>harvest</b> <b>method</b> in Shivan-Chardavol region, three <b>harvesting</b> <b>methods</b> (manually, rice-specific combine harvester and conventional cereals combine harvester) were considered as three experimental treatments and four different parts of this region considered as experimental blocks. The experimental design was randomized complete block design. This study was carried out on Anbarboo variety and the measured factors were: effective farm capacity, percent of total losses, percent of harvesting losses, number of workers and harvesting cost. The results of this study indicated that the total difference of factors was significant at the 1 % error level among all treatments. The effective farm capacity in harvesting by cereals combine harvester was more than other treatments. The lowest percent of loss was observed for harvesting by rice-specific combine harvester (2. 32 %) and the highest percent of loss was obtained for cereals combine harvester (3. 816 %).

40|$|Introduction One time tomato harvesting, in {{addition}} to labor saving, provides a possibility of increasing the cultivated area which lead to increase the total output (1). Varieties of tomato that has multiple harvest usually have a lower density in farm compared to one time harvest (2). In the late 1940 s, the processing tomato industry in California was concerned that expected shortage of labor would prevent harvest of its increasing tomato production. Commercial use of the new variety and the new <b>harvesting</b> <b>method,</b> began in early 1960 s. New <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> had a labor requirement of 2. 9 hours per ton, compared with 5. 3 hours per ton for hand-harvest in several times. Total labor use for the crop dropped from 13. 5 million hours in the hand-harvest years to about 3. 8 million hours per year in 1997, while fruit yield increased 4 -fold (3). Materials and Methods This study {{was carried out in}} two years (2010 - 2011) at Mazrae Nemone Astan Ghods Razavi using a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with 4 replications. The first factor was planting space within row at three levels including 20, 30 and 40 cm and the second factor was <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> at two levels including multiple and one time on tomato variety hypeel 347. Measured traits included fruit number per plant, fruit weight per plant, yield, as quantitative also pH, brix as qualitative and labor consumption per each ton of harvested fruit were investigated. Each plot consisted of 5 rows with a length of 6 meters, the plant in the row bilaterally (a total of 10 lines per plot) were planted. Drip irrigation method was performed using the T-tape with 1. 6 liters per hour. Harvesting started in mid-September and ended in late October. Fully ripe and healthy fruits were harvested and rotten fruits were not collected. Results and Discussion Quantitative traits Analysis of variance showed that the effect of year and planting space on all quantitative traits was significant while <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> significantly affected fruit weight per plant and fruit yield. Interaction between year and planting space had significant effect on the fruit number and weight per plant. Moreover, interaction of year and <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> had a significant effect only on fruit number per plant. Means comparison indicated that fruit number, fruit weight per plant and fruit yield in first year were 31. 1, 21. 3 and 20. 1 percent higher than second year, respectively. The highest and the lowest fruit number and fruit weight per plant obtained on 40 cm and 20 cm, respectively. The maximum yield with 16. 2 percent was observed in 30 cm space treatment compared to 40 cm which had the lowest rate on those traits. The maximum fruit number and fruit weight per plant obtained in the first year and 40 cm planting space while the minimum number obtained in the second year and 20 cm planting space,. The fruit harvested at several times had 9. 9 and 9. 6 percent higher than fruit weight per plant and yield respectively, compared to <b>harvested</b> <b>method</b> at once. The maximum and minimum of fruit number per plant achieved in the first year and several time harvesting also in the second year and <b>harvested</b> <b>method</b> at once, respectively with 45. 5 percent difference. Qualitative traits Analysis of variance revealed that only year had significant effect on brix and pH. Means comparison showed that pH had 9. 3 percent superiority in the first year compared to the second year while brix was 25. 2 percent lower in the first year compare to the second year. Labor working time Analysis of variance showed that planting space, <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> and their interaction had significant effect on this labor time. Means comparison illustrated that the maximum labor time with 10. 5 percent difference were observed in 20 cm planting space treatment compared to 40 cm which had the lowest rate on this trait. The fruit <b>harvested</b> multiple times <b>method</b> needed 127. 1 percent more labor compared to <b>harvested</b> <b>method</b> at once. The highest and the lowest labor consumption with 151. 6 percent difference, were observed in 30 cm and 20 cm respectively.

30|$|Regarding the {{harvesting}} process, currently applied {{methods include}} chemical coagulation/flocculation, gravity sedimentation, flotation, filtration, centrifugation and electrical-based processes [14, 24, 25]. Selection of an appropriate <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> {{depends on the}} end product, namely its value and properties [14]: {{it is important to}} consider the acceptable level of moisture, salt concentrations, cell damage and strain features, such as their density and size. Additionally, selection of an effective harvesting procedure must take into account that microalgal biomass must be further processed. Therefore, these procedures must not be toxic or contaminate microalgal biomass. It is also desirable that the selected <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> allows the recycling of the culture medium [25]. In this sense, bioflocculation appears as a viable alternative for the commonly used procedures. This method consists in the addition of other microorganisms or microbial metabolites to microalgal cultures, trying to stimulate microbial aggregation and flocs formation. The use of bioflocculation as <b>harvesting</b> <b>method</b> is more energetically efficient and reduces the impact of the addition of chemical flocculants to microalgal biomass, which tend to be an expensive and toxic alternative [26]. The ability of microorganisms to form flocs strongly depends on their surface physicochemical properties.|$|R
