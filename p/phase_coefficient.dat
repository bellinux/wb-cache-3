We find that all the targets except Nereid have linear phase curves at small phase angles ( 3 deg, the Centaurs (54598) Bienor and (32532) Thereus have phase curves that flatten.

Together these two properties are a likely indication for large TNOs of high-albedo, freshly coated icy surfaces. We find several bodies with significantly wavelength-dependent phase curves.

40|$|The phase {{components}} of complex valued transform coefficients retain the edge information of an image. Fast Generalized Fourier Transform (FGFT) is a complex, non-redundant, progressive resolution, globally referenced phase output, time-frequency representation applicable for non-stationary signals.

40|$|One of the {{limitations}} of using OFDM technique is its higher PAPR in the time domain signal. The higher PAPR OFDM signal would cause the fatal degradation of BER performance and undesirable spectrum regrowth in the nonlinear channel. One of the promising PAPR reduction methods for OFDM signal is the Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) method which can achieve better PAPR performance with reasonable computation complexity. However the PTS method is required to inform the <b>phase</b> <b>coefficients</b> of PTS as the side information to the receiver for the correct demodulation of data information through the data or separate channels. To simplify the transceiver of OFDM system with the PTS method, the <b>phase</b> <b>coefficients</b> of PTS are usually embedded in the data information. However since the <b>phase</b> <b>coefficients</b> of PTS are obtained after the PTS processing only for the data information at each OFDM symbol, it is hard to embed the <b>phase</b> <b>coefficients</b> of PTS in the data information separately without degradation of PAPR performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new PAPR reduction method based on the packet-switched transmission systems in which all the clusters within the certain number of OFDM symbols have the sequential cluster ID numbers embedded in the header of each cluster. The salient features of the proposed method are to reduce the PAPR performance by re-ordering of clusters (ROC) in the frequency domain at the transmitter and to reconstruct the original ordering of clusters by using the cluster ID number demodulated from each cluster at the receiver. This paper also proposes a reduction technique of computation complexity for the proposed ROC method by using the feature of IFFT processing. This paper presents various computer simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ROC method with the reduction technique of computation complexity. </p...|$|R

Therefore, in recent years, significant research work {{has been carried out}} to incorporate ZM <b>phase</b> <b>coefficients</b> along with their magnitudes as invariant feature descriptors.

The method provides excellent pattern matching performance but at the cost of enhanced computation time. In the second approach, the rotation angle between a query image and the database image is estimated. It is assumed that the query image is the rotated version of the original database image. The estimated rotation angle is used to cancel the effect of rotation in order to compare the phases of the query and database images.

Close flybys of PHAs {{provide an opportunity to}} study their surface photometric and spectral properties that enable identification of their source regions in the main asteroid belt. We observed PHA (357439) 2004 BL 86 during a close flyby of the Earth at a distance of 1. 2 million km (0. 0080 AU) on January 26, 2015, with an array of ground-based telescopes to constrain its photometric and spectral properties. Lightcurve observations showed that the asteroid was a binary and subsequent radar observations confirmed the binary nature and gave a primary diameter of 300 meters and a secondary diameter of 50 - 100 meters. Our photometric observations were used to derive the phase curve of 2004 BL 86 in the V-band. Two different photometric functions were fitted to this phase curve, the IAU H-G model (Bowell et al. 1989) and the Shevchenko model (Shevchenko 1996). From the fit of the H-G function we obtained an absolute magnitude H= 19. 51 +/- 0. 02 and a slope parameter G= 0. 34 +/- 0. 02. The Shevchenko function yielded an absolute magnitude of H= 19. 03 +/- 0. 07 and a <b>phase</b> <b>coefficient</b> b= 0. 0225 +/- 0. 0006. The <b>phase</b> <b>coefficient</b> was used to calculate the geometric albedo (Ag) using the relationship found by Belskaya and Schevchenko (2000), obtaining a value of Ag= 40 +/- 8 % in the V-band.
