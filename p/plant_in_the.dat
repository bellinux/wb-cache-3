500|$|Molecules {{are moved}} within plants by {{transport}} processes that operate {{at a variety}} of spatial scales.

Diffusion, osmosis, and active transport and mass flow are all different ways transport can occur. Examples of elements that plants need to transport are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. In vascular plants, these elements are extracted from the soil as soluble ions by the roots and transported throughout the <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> xylem. Most of the elements required for plant nutrition come from the chemical breakdown of soil minerals.
