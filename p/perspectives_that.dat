5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical <b>perspectives</b> <b>that</b> organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E

25|$|Performance {{evaluations}} {{have been}} based on various operational or financial measures of performance, but no one factor provides a clear indication of productive or ineffective performance. The response has been to focus on too many measures on which to base performance assessment. Some of the various <b>perspectives</b> <b>that</b> are often considered when measuring evaluation are customers' perspectives, internal business perspectives, innovation perspective and financial perspectives.|$|E

He characterized this a form of hybrid warfare blending traditional propaganda with computer tools and subversion of media organizations. As a case study he cited Russian political scientist with views favored by Putin, Aleksandr Dugin, who exemplified on Twitter <b>perspectives</b> <b>that</b> U.S democratic institutions were not successful.|$|E

25|$|Diversity between team members’ {{backgrounds}} and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique {{information that is}} available to the team and introducing different <b>perspectives</b> <b>that</b> can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by {{making it more difficult}} for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives. Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.|$|E
25|$|Addams {{had long}} discussions with philosopher John Dewey {{in which they}} redefined {{democracy}} in terms of pragmatism and civic activism, with an emphasis more on duty and less on rights. The two leading <b>perspectives</b> <b>that</b> distinguished Addams and her coalition from the modernizers more concerned with efficiency were the need to extend to social and economic life the democratic structures and practices that had been limited to the political sphere, as in Addams' programmatic support of trade unions; and second, their call for a new social ethic to supplant the individualist outlook as being no longer adequate in modern society.|$|E
25|$|After {{observing that}} most civil-military theory {{assumes that the}} {{civilian}} and military worlds must necessarily be separate, both physically and ideologically, Rebecca L. Schiff offered a new theory—Concordance—as an alternative. One of the key questions in Civil-Military Relations (CMR) theory {{has always been to}} determine under what conditions the military will intervene in the domestic politics of the nation. Most scholars agree with the theory of objective civilian control of the military (Huntington), which focuses on the separation of civil and military institutions. Such a view concentrates and relies heavily on the U.S. case, from an institutional perspective, and especially during the Cold War period. Schiff provides an alternative theory, from both institutional and cultural <b>perspectives,</b> <b>that</b> explains the U.S. case as well as several non-U.S. civil-military relations case studies.|$|E

25|$|Techno-liberals {{look for}} change. By their nature, they're not {{satisfied}} with the way things are and want {{to find new ways to}} do things. Liberals in technology arena move a society forward as the opportunists. Technoliberalism is actually more about civil liberties and individual rights such as Free Internet, Net neutrality for landline Internet not for mobile or satellites, gun control and Pro abortion, etc. Techno-liberalism represents socio-cultural <b>perspectives</b> <b>that</b> imply all human endeavors. This includes how we develop and use technology, especially computer technology. In the technology arena, liberalism normally points to innovation and risk-taking. Furthermore, if you're a techno-liberal in information technology, the future can't come soon enough. For those who see the true promise of the web for multi-media and as a general platform for application software, the Internet is still far too slow and primitive.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two <b>perspectives</b> <b>that</b> we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two <b>perspectives</b> <b>that</b> Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

30|$|Cloud {{computing}} has two perspectives: first, an outward-looking <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> embodies {{an elastic}} application executed in a secure container and accessible over the internet, {{as seen by}} developers and end users; Secondly, an inward-looking <b>perspective</b> <b>that</b> describes the large scale distributed cloud computing platform and its middleware as implemented and operated by the provider [1]. CMQ presents a message passing model (that is a middleware abstraction) implemented in Haskell that addresses the reality of both perspectives.|$|R

500|$|Although Escher did {{not have}} {{mathematical}} training—his understanding of mathematics was largely visual and intuitive—his art had a strong mathematical component, {{and several of the}} worlds which he drew were built around impossible objects. After 1924, Escher turned to sketching landscapes in Italy and Corsica with irregular <b>perspectives</b> <b>that</b> are impossible in natural form. His first print of an impossible reality was Still Life and Street (1937); impossible stairs and multiple visual and gravitational perspectives feature in popular works such as Relativity (1953). House of Stairs (1951) attracted the interest of the mathematician Roger Penrose and his father the biologist Lionel Penrose. In 1956 they published a paper, [...] "Impossible Objects: A Special Type of Visual Illusion" [...] and later sent Escher a copy. Escher replied, admiring the Penroses' continuously rising flights of steps, and enclosed a print of Ascending and Descending (1960). The paper also contained the tribar or Penrose triangle, which Escher used repeatedly in his lithograph of a building that appears to function as a perpetual motion machine, Waterfall (1961).|$|E
