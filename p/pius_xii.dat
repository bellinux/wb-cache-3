5|$|As Apostolic Delegate, Lefebvre's chief {{duty was}} the {{building}} {{up of the}} ecclesiastical structure in French Africa. Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII</b> wanted to move quickly towards a proper hierarchy (with bishops instead of vicariates and apostolic prefectures). Lefebvre was responsible for selecting these new bishops, {{increasing the number of}} priests and religious sisters, as well as the number of churches in the various dioceses.|$|E
5|$|Founded in Spain in 1928 by the Catholic saint and priest Josemaría Escrivá, Opus Dei {{was given}} final Catholic Church {{approval}} in 1950 by Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII.</b> In 1982, by the apostolic constitution Ut sit, St. John Paul II {{made it a}} personal prelature—that is, the jurisdiction of its own bishop covers the persons in Opus Dei wherever they are, rather than geographical dioceses.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{after two}} centuries, the Holy See re-assessed the issue. Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII</b> issued a decree on December 8, 1939, authorizing Chinese Catholics {{to observe the}} ancestral rites and {{participate}} in Confucius-honoring ceremonies. The general principle of sometimes admitting native traditions even into the liturgy of the church, provided that such traditions harmonize with the true and authentic spirit of the liturgy, was proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65).|$|E

5|$|On 14 September 1955, the Apostolic Vicariate of Dakar {{became an}} archdiocese, and Lefebvre thus {{became the first}} Metropolitan Archbishop of Dakar. Archbishop Lefebvre {{was the first and}} {{foremost}} advisor to <b>Pius</b> <b>XII</b> during the writing of the encyclical Fidei Donum (1957), which instructed the clergy and laity on the missions in the Third World countries and called for more missionaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII</b> {{died and}} was succeeded by Pope John XXIII, who, in 1959, after giving Lefebvre {{the choice between}} {{remaining}} either as Apostolic Delegate or as Archbishop of Dakar, appointed another to the post of Apostolic Delegate for French Africa. Lefebvre continued as Archbishop of Dakar until 23 January 1962, when he {{was transferred to the}} diocese of Tulle in France, retaining his personal title of archbishop. Shortly after his appointment as Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers (see below), he resigned from the diocese of Tulle on 7 August, 1962.|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre's {{return to}} France {{was not to}} last long. On 12 June 1947, Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII</b> {{appointed}} him Vicar Apostolic of Dakar in Senegal; he received the titular episcopal see of Anthedon (El Blakiyeh near Gaza in Palestine). On 18 September 1947 he was consecrated a bishop in his family's parish church in Tourcoing by Achille Liénart (who had previously ordained him a priest); acting as co-consecrators were Bishop Jean-Baptiste Fauret, C.S.Sp. and Bishop Alfred-Jean-Félix Ancel.|$|E

On 26 June Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva sent a telegram to England calling on the Allies to hold members of the Hungarian government personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted by the Hungarian government and shown to Prime Minister Döme Sztójay, who passed it to Horthy. Horthy ordered {{an end to the}} deportations on 7 July and they stopped two days later.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 1953, Cooper {{accompanied}} {{his wife}} and daughter, who were devout Catholics, to Rome, where they had an audience with Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII.</b> Cooper {{and his wife were}} still separated at the time, but the papal visit marked the beginning of their gradual reconciliation. In the coming years, Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal behavior, and started discussing Catholicism with his family. He began attending church with them regularly, and met with their parish priest, who offered Cooper spiritual guidance. After several months of study, Cooper was baptized as a Roman Catholic on April 9, 1959, before a small group of family and friends at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills.|$|E
5|$|After {{violations}} of the 1933 Reichskonkordat between the Church and Nazi Germany, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the Church and their ideology of neopaganism and racial superiority. The Church condemned the 1939 invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions. Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein. While Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII</b> has been credited with helping to save {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews in the Holocaust, the Church has also been accused of encouraging centuries of antisemitism and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Ted was {{frequently}} uprooted as {{his family moved}} among Bronxville, New York, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Palm Beach, Florida, and the Court of St. James's in London, England. His formal education started at Gibbs School, in Sloane Street, Kensington, London. He attended ten different schools {{by the age of}} eleven, with his education suffering as a result. Ted was an altar boy at the St. Joseph's Church and received his First Communion from Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII</b> in the Vatican at age seven. Ted spent sixth and seventh grades in the Fessenden School, where he was a mediocre student, and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School; both schools were in Massachusetts. His parents were affectionate toward him as the youngest child, but also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of Serbs killed on 11–13 May vary. Historians Jozo Tomasevich and Ivo Goldstein put the number at 260. Historians Sabrina P. Ramet and Marko Attila Hoare {{estimate}} that about 300 Serbs were massacred while historian Davide Rodogno puts the number at 417 killed. On 14 May, the Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, sent a letter of protest to Pavelić after receiving news of the killings. He failed to condemn the atrocity publicly. The next day, Pavelić visited Rome and was granted a private audience with Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII,</b> who offered de facto recognition of the NDH on behalf of the Holy See. Although he was aware that Pavelić was a totalitarian dictator, {{there is no evidence that}} he had knowledge of the first Glina massacre at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII,</b> while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, {{the first}} Miss World contest (originally the Festival Bikini Contest), was {{organized}} by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains {{the first and last}} Miss World to be crowned in her bikini, a crowning that was condemned by Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII</b> who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls, though she did not mind French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette (1947) and the model on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini.|$|E
5|$|The army sent about 800soldiers to Toronto {{to assist}} with the cleanup, {{providing}} blankets and mattresses. Toronto residents helped out with the relief effort: the Salvation Army received so many donations of clothes, footwear, blankets, food, and money that its storage facilities were overfilled, forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed. A Hurricane Relief Fund was established to coordinate financial donations, ultimately raising about $5.3million (CAD). The fund received donations from organisations, companies, and individuals including Pope <b>Pius</b> <b>XII,</b> the Ford Motor Company of Canada, the United Church of Canada, Laura Secord Candy Shops, and the British-American Oil Company. A portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Comos {{celebrated their}} silver wedding anniversary {{with a family}} trip to Italy.

A thorough check of both the Como and NBC publicity offices found that neither was responsible for the release of the photos to the media; it was done by the Vatican's press department. When Perry and Roselle became Knight Commander and Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1952, it was a news item only after Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, who had been honored at the same ceremony, mentioned it some time later.|$|E
