5|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} {{was first}} {{described by the}} American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time {{it was thought that}} there were two subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the New Guinea crocodile native to Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea, and C. n. mindorensis, the <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile,</b> native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that the <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile</b> is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that the <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile</b> is, in part, paraphyletic with regard to the New Guinea crocodile, and that the latter may constitutes a population within the <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile.</b> Among their two samples for the New Guinea crocodile, one was part of the <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile</b> clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6–6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (could potentially be misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution.|$|E
5|$|The gharial has {{undergone}} a chronic long-term decline, combined with a rapid short-term decline, leading the IUCN to list the species as critically endangered. In 1946, the gharial population had been widespread, numbering around 5,000 to 10,000; by 2006, however, it had declined 96–98%, reduced to {{a small number of}} widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals. This long-term decline had a number of causes, including egg collection and hunting, such as for indigenous medicine. The rapid decline of about 58% between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of gill nets and the loss of riverine habitat. The gharial population continues to be threatened by environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites, but as of 2013 numbers are rising, due to the protection of nests against egg predators. The Chinese alligator was historically widespread throughout the eastern Yangtze River system but is currently restricted to some areas in southeastern Anhui province thanks to habitat fragmentation and degradation. The wild population is believed to exist only in small fragmented ponds. In 1972, the species was declared a Class I endangered species by the Chinese government and received the maximum amount of legal protection. Since 1979, captive breeding programs were established in China and North America, creating a healthy captive population. In 2008, alligators bred in the Bronx Zoo were successfully reintroduced to Chongming Island. The <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile</b> is perhaps the most threatened crocodilian and is considered by the IUCN to be critically endangered. Hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its population to around 100 individuals by 2009. In the same year, 50 captive bred crocodiles were released into the wild to help boost the population. Support from local people is crucial for the species survival.|$|E
500|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} {{grows to}} {{a length of}} up to [...] for males and [...] for females, although most specimens are smaller. The body ranges from grey to brown in colour, with darker bandings on the tail and body which become less noticeable as the animal grows. Longitudinal ridges {{in front of the}} eyes and some granular scales {{on the back of the}} neck between four large scales are distinctive features of this species. There are some differences between the northerly and southerly populations in the morphology of the skull and the arrangement of the scales. The snout is pointed and relatively narrow during juvenile stages and becomes wider as the animal matures. The New Guinea crocodile bears a physical similarity to the nearby <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile</b> (C. mindorensis) and Siamese crocodile (C. siamensis). The colouring is similar to that of the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnsoni) of northern Australia, but the snout is somewhat shorter and broader.|$|E

500|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} (Crocodylus novaeguineae) {{is a small}} {{species of}} crocodile found {{on the island of}} New Guinea where there are two geographically isolated populations to the north and south of the mountain ridge that runs along the centre of the island. In the past it included the <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile,</b> C. n. mindorensis, as a subspecies, but today they are regarded as separate species. The habitat of the New Guinea crocodile is mostly freshwater swamps and lakes. It is most active at night when it feeds on fish and a range of other small animals. A female crocodile lays a clutch of eggs in a nest composed of vegetation and she lies up nearby to guard the nest. There is some degree of parental care for newly hatched juveniles. This crocodile was over-hunted for its valuable skin in the mid 20th century, but conservation measures have since been put in place, it is reared in ranches and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists it as being of [...] "Least Concern".|$|E

5000|$|The Tropical Realm is {{also the}} centre of the reptile collection. The {{crocodile}} pools (which formerly housed West African dwarf crocodiles, American alligators and <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodiles)</b> currently house spectacled caimans in one and white-winged wood ducks in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for tuataras. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving sphenodont, a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) rhinoceros ratsnakes, emerald tree boas and eyelash vipers now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of Serrated Casquehead Iguanas, Green-Crested Lizards, caiman lizards, and a Parson's chameleon.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile</b> became nationally {{protected}} by law in 2001 with {{the enactment of}} Republic Act 9147 known as the Wildlife Act. It is punishable to kill a crocodile, with a maximum penalty of ₱100,000 (equivalent to about $2,500). The Philippine Senate introduced resolution no. 790 on May 31, 2012, to further strengthen and augment existing laws {{for the protection of}} the <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile</b> and the saltwater crocodile.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus mindorensis), {{also known}} as the Mindoro crocodile, the Philippine {{freshwater}} crocodile or locally, bukarot, is one of two species of crocodiles found in the Philippines; the other is the larger Indo-Pacific crocodile or saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). [...] The <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the species endemic only to the country, became data deficient to critically endangered in 2008 from exploitation and unsustainable fishing methods, such as dynamite fishing. Conservation methods are being taken by the Dutch/Filipino Mabuwaya foundation, the Crocodile Conservation Society and the Zoological Institute of HerpaWorld in Mindoro island. It is strictly prohibited to kill a crocodile in the country, and it is punishable by law.|$|E

40|$|Crocodiles {{have a long}} {{breeding}} life, which {{ranges from}} 25 - 30 years. There are 27 species and subspecies of crocodiles throughout the world, 18 {{of which are in}} danger of extinction, the rest being threatened with declining population due to overhunting and habitat destruction. Two known crocodile species exist in the Philippines: Crocodylus mindorensis (freshwater crocodile) and C. porosus (saltwater crocodile). Killing adult crocodiles, as is being done now, drastically reduces the potential population. Moreover, toxic wastes from mines, destruction of marshes and riverine habitats, and the conversion of their natural habitats for fishponds additionally threaten their populations. Estimates indicate that there are only about 100 <b>Philippine</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in the wild now. The Crocodile Farming Institute (CFI) was established in Palawan, in 1987, in order to save the crocodiles from extinction in the Philippines. It {{is now one of the}} components of the Palawan Wildlife and Conservation Center, and aims to conserve the 2 endangered species in the Philippines and also to develop and introduce a suitable crocodile farming technology that will help uplift the socio-economic well-being of the Filipino people. CFI believes in the potential of commercial utilization of crocodiles as a dollar-generating industry for the Philippines. It is a very profitable business and could be a multi-million dollar industry. A brief outline is given of the economic and marketing potentials of farming crocodiles in the Philippines...|$|R
