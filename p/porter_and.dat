5|$|Settlements grew {{up around}} both castles on the Medina, but East Cowes Castle was rapidly {{abandoned}} and ultimately destroyed by coastal erosion; as a result, today West Cowes Castle is often simply referred to as Cowes Castle.

Armor would provide the edge. Mallory gathered about himself a group of men who could put his vision into practice, among them John M. Brooke, John L. <b>Porter,</b> <b>and</b> William P.
