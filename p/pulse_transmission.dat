40|$|Solid-density plasmas {{driven by}} intense x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) {{radiation}} are seeded by sources of non-thermal photoelectrons and Auger electrons that ionize and heat the target via collisions. Simulation codes that {{are commonly used}} to model such plasmas, such as collisional-radiative (CR) codes, typically assume a Maxwellian distribution and thus instantaneous thermalization of the source electrons. In this study, we present a detailed description and initial applications of a collisional particle-in-cell code, PICLS, that has been extended with a self-consistent radiation transport model and Monte-Carlo models for photoionization and KLL Auger ionization, enabling the fully kinetic simulation of XFEL-driven plasmas. The code is used to simulate two experiments previously performed at the Linac Coherent Light Source investigating XFEL-driven solid-density Al plasmas. It is shown that PICLS-simulated <b>pulse</b> <b>transmissions</b> using the Ecker-Kröll continuum-lowering model agree much better with measurements than do simulations using the Stewart-Pyatt model. Good quantitative agreement is also found between the time-dependent PICLS results and those of analogous simulations by the CR code SCFLY, which {{was used in the}} analysis of the experiments to accurately reproduce the observed Kα emissions and <b>pulse</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Finally, it is shown that the effects of the non-thermal electrons are negligible for the conditions of the particular experiments under investigation.

50|$|A passive {{radar system}} must detect very small target returns in the {{presence}} of very strong, continuous interference. This contrasts with a conventional radar, which listens for echoes during the periods of silence in between each <b>pulse</b> <b>transmission.</b> As a result, it is essential that the receiver should have a low noise figure, high dynamic range and high linearity. Despite this, the received echoes are normally well below the noise floor and the system tends to be externally noise limited (due to reception of the transmitted signal itself, plus reception of other distant in-band transmitters). Passive radar systems use digital receiver systems which output a digitized, sampled signal.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} of return delay time to geometric range {{can be very}} accurate because of the natural constancy of the speed and direction of propagation of electromagnetic waves. However, for an aircraft flying through the never-uniform and never-quiescent atmosphere, the relating of <b>pulse</b> <b>transmission</b> and reception times to successive geometric positions of the antenna {{must be accompanied by}} constant adjusting of the return phases to account for sensed irregularities in the flight path. SAR's in spacecraft avoid that atmosphere problem, but still must make corrections for known antenna movements due to rotations of the spacecraft, even those that are reactions to movements of onboard machinery. Locating a SAR in a manned space vehicle may require that the humans carefully remain motionless relative to the vehicle during data collection periods.|$|E
5000|$|In 1930 Womersely left Imperial College {{to take up}} a {{position}} as a junior research officer at the Shirley Institute (British Cotton Industry Research Institute), Manchester. There he applied mathematical techniques to problems in textile manufacture, including research on cotton spinning, drafting fibrous materials, and, through L. H. C. Tippett, the use of mathematical statistics in industrial production and quality control. While at the Shirley Institute he also met Leslie Comrie and became interested in computational techniques. [...] As a result, he spent a month at HM Nautical Almanac Office, London learning Comrie's numerical approaches. In 1936 he collaborated with Douglas Hartree who had built a Differential Analyser at the University of Manchester; together they devised a much cited method for the numerical integration of partial differential equations. In 1937, with war looming, he joined the armaments research department at Woolwich as a scientific officer, and worked on using statistical techniques applied to ballistics and ammunition proofing. In 1942, after the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed assistant director of scientific research at the Ministry of Supply and asked to set up and head the Advisory Service on Statistical Methods (later known as SR17). This organization was responsible for advice and research into ammunition supply, engineering factories and the investigations of a range of Government Inspectorates. It was particularly important in ensuring quality control and promoting sample inspection methods to British Industry during wartime. In 1944 he joined the British Association mathematical tables committee and in the same year he was appointed as the first superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). In addition to being responsible for statistical quality control, NPL was tasked with building an electronic computer, for which Womersley coined the name Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), echoing Babbage's Analytical Engine. Womersely was therefore responsible for the set up and operation of the first national computing centre in UK. One of his first actions was to visit the USA for a fact-finding tour, where he learned about ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), Howard Aitken's Harvard machine, George Stibitz's machines and von Neumann's plans for the binary computer, EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). On his return, he recruited Alan Turing to work on the ACE section and backed him strongly. Womersley also recruited Donald Davies in 1947. However, progress on the ACE project was delayed and Turing developed a dislike of Womersley and disdain for his abilities and left the project in 1948. Davies then took over from Turing and a small experimental model, pilot ACE was produced in 1950. Whether Womersely led NPL successfully has been questioned, although the consensus seems to be that he did a good job in difficult circumstances. He himself left the project in 1950, before the prototype pilot ACE was completed, to join the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), a forerunner of International Computers Limited (ICL). There he recognised that the computers previously developed by academia or governments were too large and expensive to be commercially viable and he recruited Andrew Booth who had developed the All Purpose Electronic Computer at Birbeck University, as a consultant to develop a smaller inexpensive computer. The computer copied from Booth's original design by Ray Bird was named the Hollerith Electronic Computer (HEC1), and was Britain's first mass-produced business computer.In 1954 Womersley left BTM and joined a research team, led by Donald McDonald at St Bartholomew's Hospital, who were studying blood flow in arteries. This change {{seems to have been a}} temporary arrangement to 'fill in time whilst awaiting completion of arrangements to come to WADC' (the Wright Air Development Center, Dayton, Ohio, USA). His collaboration with McDonald may have been prompted by his eldest daughter, Barbara, who was studying medicine at St Bartholomew's. Whatever the reason, this move led to a new and highly productive period in his research, as he applied mathematical and computational techniques to the analysis of blood flow and hemodynamics. Most notably in 1955 he published an article which described a dimensionless parameter (α) which characterised the nature of unsteady flow; subsequently this has been called the Womersley number. In July 1955, as planned, he moved to WADC to take a post as acting chief of the Analysis Section, System Dynamics Branch Aeronautical Research Laboratory. In 1956, he was promoted to Supervisory Mathematician and then Supervisory Aeronautical Research Engineer (Flight Systems), although he continued to publish on mathematical aspects of blood flow until his early death in 1958. His 1957 monograph on 'An elastic tube theory of <b>pulse</b> <b>transmission</b> and oscillatory flow in mammalian arteries' is widely regarded as a major influence in the field. In 1957 he returned to Britain for treatment of cancer. He underwent a number of operations in London and returned to Ohio in 1957, but never fully recovered and died at Ohio State University Hospital, Columbus, on 7 March 1958.|$|E
30|$|BTPS works {{similarly}} to the IEEE 802.11 DCF, with the difference that high priority and low priority stations behave differently during IFS and backoff stages.

However, during DIFS and backoff stages, high priority stations with queued packets send an energy pulse every M slots, where M is a constant. Between two consecutive busy tone <b>pulse</b> <b>transmissions,</b> {{there should be}} at least one empty Slot Time interval, as the station must have a chance to listen to the data channel.

40|$|Abstract. During the Kauai {{experiment}} in summer of 2003 a bottom-mounted vertical line array containing 8 hydrophones spaced 0. 6 meter apart was deployed in a 100 -m shallow water region near the Pacific Missile Range Facility. The acoustic source was placed about 2 km {{away on a}} flat sea bottom at 95 meter water depth. The element spacing was sufficiently small to allow measurements of the temporal variability of time-angle intensity fluctuations of the acoustic energy. Measurements were made simultaneously of the broadband acoustic <b>pulse</b> <b>transmissions</b> (8 - 50 kHz) and environmental parameters. The latter measurements included current, temperature and salinity profiles, directional surface wave spectra, as well as wind speed and direction above the sea surface. Arrival time-angle fluctuations {{were found to be}} correlated with the environmental variability due to ocean dynamics in this region. It is shown that variations of the sea surface dynamics exhibit different temporal effects than those occurring within the water column...|$|R

40|$|An {{account is}} given of night {{observations}} of oblique-incidence <b>pulse</b> <b>transmissions</b> on 5. 8 Mc/s. over a baseline of 763 km., using a responder technique. The experiment aimed at measuring apparent path lengths {{as a guide}} to the identification of the reflecting layer in the ionosphere. The characteristics of beacon triggering are discussed in relation to the echo system received after ionospheric reflection. A correlation of Es occurrences as observed at oblique incidence and vertical incidence near the midpoint of the trajectory was effected, and certain characteristics of the Es layer are presented. Unusual records of Pedersen rays are reproduced and sudden height increases and diffuseness of F 2 echoes are discussed. A check on the oblique-incidence theory using a Millington transmission curve on vertical-incidence h′f records yielded reasonable agreement between measured and deduced reflection heights, although there is evidence of a tendency for the predicted obliquity factor to be too low. A rough analysis of oblique-incidence penetrations yielded an average value for the frequency separation of the magneto-ionic M. U. F. ’s close to half the gyromagnetic frequency...|$|R
