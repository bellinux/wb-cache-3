There has been no research to-date to measure compliance by General Practitioners. Inappropriate <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> minors may result in increased use or misuse of benzodiazepines.

40|$|Abstract Background Behavioural {{approaches}} to knowledge translation inform interventions to improve healthcare. However, such approaches often {{focus on a}} single behaviour without considering that health professionals perform multiple behaviours in pursuit of multiple goals in a given clinical context. In resource-limited consultations, performing these other goal-directed behaviours may influence optimal performance of a particular evidence-based behaviour. This study aimed to investigate whether a multiple goal-directed behaviour perspective might inform implementation research beyond single-behaviour approaches. Methods We conducted theory-based semi-structured interviews with 12 general medical practitioners (GPs) in Scotland on their views regarding two focal clinical behaviours [...] providing physical activity (PA) advice and <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> reduce blood pressure (BP) to Results Most GPs reported strong intention <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> <b>to</b> reduce BP but expressed reasons why they would not. Intention to provide PA advice was variable. Most GPs reported that time constraints and patient preference detrimentally affected their control over providing PA advice and <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> reduce BP, respectively. Most GPs perceived many of their other goal-directed behaviours as interfering with providing PA advice, while fewer GPs reported goal-directed behaviours that interfere with <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> reduce BP. Providing PA advice and <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> reduce BP were perceived to be facilitated by similar diabetes-related behaviours (e. g., discussing cholesterol). While providing PA advice was perceived to be mainly facilitated by providing other lifestyle-related clinical advice (e. g., talking about weight), BP prescribing was reported as facilitated by pursuing ongoing standard consultation-related goals (e. g., clearly structuring the consultation). Conclusion GPs readily relate their other goal-directed behaviours with having a facilitating and interfering influence on their performance of particular evidence-based behaviours. This may have implications for advancing the theoretical development of behavioural {{approaches to}} implementation research beyond single-behaviour models. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Simple linear {{accounts}} of prescribing do not adequately address reasons “why” doctors <b>prescribe</b> psychotropic medication <b>to</b> people with intellectual disability (ID). Greater {{understanding of the}} complex array of factors that influence decisions <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> is needed. Design/methodology/approach – After consideration {{of a number of}} conceptual frameworks that have potential <b>to</b> better understand <b>prescribing</b> of psychotropic medication to adults with ID, an ecological model of prescribing was developed. A case study is used to outline how the model can provide greater understanding of prescribing processes. Findings – The model presented aims to consider the complexity and multi-dimensional nature of community-based psychotropic <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> adults with ID. The utility of the model is illustrated through a consideration of the case study. Research limitations/implications – The model presented is conceptual and is as yet untested. Practical implications – The model presented aims to capture the complexity and multi-dimensional nature of community-based psychotropic <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> adults with ID. The model may provide utility for clinicians and researchers as they seek clarification of prescribing decisions. Originality/value – The paper adds valuable insight into factors influencing psychotropic <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> adults with ID. The ecological model of prescribing extends traditional analysis that focuses on patient characteristics and introduces multi-level perspectives that may provide utility for clinicians and researchers...|$|R

5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily <b>prescribed</b> <b>to</b> reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess.

Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E

5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be <b>prescribed</b> <b>to</b> individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal.

Theory-based constructs investigated were: intention and control beliefs from the theory of planned behaviour, and perceived interfering and facilitating influence of other goal-directed behaviours performed in a diabetes consultation. We coded interview content into pre-specified theory-based constructs and organised codes into themes within each construct using thematic analysis. Results: Most GPs reported strong intention <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> <b>to</b> reduce BP but expressed reasons why they would not. Intention to provide PA advice was variable. Most GPs reported that time constraints and patient preference detrimentally affected their control over providing PA advice and <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> reduce BP, respectively.

Dhumavati's worship is <b>prescribed</b> <b>to</b> ward off all the negativity that she stands for and to transcend the smoke screen to acquire true knowledge. By worshipping and confronting her, the embodiment of the impure, the inauspicious and outside the fringes of society, one can look beyond the arbitrary dichotomies of society and acquire ultimate knowledge to become spiritually enlightened.|$|E

It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E

40|$|High-risk {{prescribing}} {{in primary}} care is common and causes considerable harm. Feedback interventions to improve care are attractive because they are relatively cheap to widely implement. There is good evidence that feedback has small to moderate effects, but the most recent Cochrane review called for more high-quality, large trials that explicitly test different forms of feedback. The study is a three-arm cluster-randomised trial with general practices being randomised and outcomes measured at patient level. 262 practices in three Scottish Health Board areas have been randomised (94 % of all possible practices). The two active arms receive different forms of prescribing safety data feedback, with rates of high-risk prescribing compared with a ‘usual care’ arm. Sample size estimation used baseline data from participating practices. With 85 practices randomised to each arm, then there is 93 % power to detect a 25 % difference {{in the percentage of}} high-risk prescribing (from 6. 1 % to 4. 5 %) between the usual care arm and each intervention arm. The primary outcome is a composite of six high-risk prescribing measures (antipsychotic <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> people aged ≥ 75  years; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> people aged ≥ 75 without gastroprotection; NSAID <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> people <b>prescribed</b> aspirin/clopidogrel without gastroprotection; NSAID <b>prescribing</b> <b>to</b> people <b>prescribed</b> an ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and a diuretic; NSAID prescription <b>to</b> people <b>prescribed</b> an oral anticoagulant without gastroprotection; aspirin/clopidogrel prescription <b>to</b> people <b>prescribed</b> an oral anticoagulant without gastroprotection). The primary analysis will use multilevel modelling to account for repeated measurement of outcomes in patients clustered within practices. The study was reviewed and approved by the NHS Tayside Committee on Medical Research Ethics B (11 /ES/ 0001). The study will be disseminated via a final report to the funder with a publicly available research summary, and peer reviewed publications...|$|R
