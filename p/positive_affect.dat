5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP. The targeting of NMDA receptors {{is thought to be}} one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{set-point}} model, {{levels of}} positive and negative affects are more or less fixed within each individual, hence, after a positive or negative event, people's moods tend {{to go back to the}} pre-set level. According to the set-point model, extraverts experience more happiness because their pre-set level of <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> is set higher than the pre-set point of <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> in introverts, therefore extraverts require less positive reinforcement in order to feel happy.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for more happiness among extraverts {{comes from the fact}} that extraverts are able to better regulate their affective states.

Extraverts may also choose activities that facilitate happiness (e.g., recalling pleasant vs. unpleasant memories) more than introverts when anticipating difficult tasks.|$|E

25|$|Extensive {{personality}} {{research has}} been done that links positive emotional states to individual differences in risky behaviour. The trait positive urgency, defined as the tendency to engage in risky behaviour under conditions of extreme <b>positive</b> <b>affect,</b> is predictive of substance or behavioural problems that lead to addiction. This trait represents an underlying dysregulation in response to extreme affective states and has a direct impact on behaviour. The trait 'positive urgency' has been shown to have a predictive relationship with increases in drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems in college, as well as drug use in college. Furthermore, this trait provides important information on how <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> can increase the likelihood of engaging in substance abuse.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the social}} {{activity}} hypothesis, more frequent participation in social situations creates more frequent, and higher levels, of <b>positive</b> <b>affect.</b> Therefore, {{it is believed that}} since extraverts are characterized as more sociable than introverts, they also possess higher levels of <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> brought on by social interactions. Specifically, the results of Furnham and Brewin's study (1990) suggest that extraverts enjoy and participate more in social activities than introverts, and as a result extraverts report higher level of happiness. Also, in the study of Argyle and Lu (1990) extraverts were found to be less likely to avoid participation in noisy social activities, and to be more likely to participate in social activities such as: party games, jokes, or going to the cinema. Similar results were reported by Diener, , and Emmons (1984) who found that extraverts seek social situations more often than introverts, especially when engaging in recreational activities.|$|E
25|$|As earlier stated, extraverts {{are often}} {{found to have}} higher levels of {{happiness}} and <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> than introverts. An influential review article concluded that personality, specifically extraversion and emotional stability, was the best predictor of subjective well-being. As examples, Argyle and Lu (1990) found that the trait of extraversion, as measured by Extraversion Scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), was positively and significantly correlated with happiness, as measured by the Oxford Happiness Inventory. Using the same happiness and extraversion scales, Hills and Argyle (2001) found that happiness was again significantly correlated with extraversion. Also, the study by Emmons and Diener (1986) showed that extraversion correlates positively and significantly with <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> but not with negative affect. Similar results were found in a large longitudinal study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992), which assessed 14,407 participants from 100 areas of continental United States. Using the abbreviated General Well-Being Schedule, which tapped positive and negative affects, and Costa and McCrae's (1986) short version of the NEO's Extraversion scale, the authors reported that extraverts experienced greater well-being at two points in time, during which data were collected: first between 1971 and 1975, and later between 1981 and 1984. Furthermore, Larsen and Ketelaar (1991) showed that extraverts respond more to <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> than to negative affect, since they exhibit more positive-affect reactivity to the positive-affect induction, yet they do not react more negatively to the negative-affect induction.|$|E
25|$|Low {{levels of}} effortful control can render the {{individual}} {{less able to}} distract themselves from unpleasant feelings or overcome strong affective impulses, resulting in maladaptive responses to distress – such as continued substance use.

25|$|According to the {{instrumental}} view, {{one explanation for}} greater subjective well-being among extraverts could be that extraversion helps {{in the creation of}} life circumstances, which promote high levels of <b>positive</b> <b>affect.</b> Specifically, the personality trait of extraversion is seen as a facilitator of more social interactions, since the low cortical arousal among extraverts results in them seeking more social situations in order to increase their arousal.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion {{has been}} linked to higher {{sensitivity}} of the mesolimbic dopamine system to potentially rewarding stimuli. This in part explains the high levels of <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> found in extraverts, since they will more intensely feel the excitement of a potential reward. One consequence of this is that extraverts can more easily learn the contingencies for positive reinforcement, since the reward itself is experienced as greater.|$|E
25|$|A general {{inability}} to control affective states may impair the conditioning of behaviour associated with rewards and punishment, may increase susceptibility to biasing by substance-related cues, and could tax self-regulatory capacity. Such conditions may render individuals unable to interrupt automatic drug-seeking behaviours. Abnormal levels {{of positive and}} negative affect can be increased by low effortful control. For example, high <b>positive</b> <b>affect</b> may interact with low effortful control in increasing risk of addiction amongst vulnerable populations.|$|E
40|$|Sometimes we {{say that}} {{pleasure}} is distinct form joy, happiness, or good mood. Some other times we say the joy, happiness or good mood are types of pleasure. This suggests the existence of two concepts of pleasure: one specific, the other generic. According to the specific concept, pleasure is one type of <b>positive</b> <b>affects</b> among others. Pleasure is to be distinguished from joy, gladness, contentment, merriment, glee, ecstasy, euphoria, exhilaration, elation, jubilation; happiness, felicity, bliss, well-being; enjoyment, amusement, fun, rejoicing, delectation, enchantment, delight, rapture, relish, thrill; satisfaction, gratification, pride, triumph; good mood, jollity, gaiety, cheerfulness; relief (or at least from some of these concepts). According to the generic concept of pleasure, a pleasure is any of these <b>positive</b> <b>affects.</b> Joy, gladness, contentment, merriment, glee, ecstasy, euphoria, exhilaration, elation, jubilation, happiness, felicity, bliss, well-being, enjoyment, amusement, fun, rejoicing, delectation, enchantment, delight, rapture, relish, thrill, satisfaction, gratification, pride, triumph, good mood, jollity, gaiety, cheerfulness, relief and pleasure in the specific sense are all species of pleasures. In this thesis, I shall focus on the generic concept of pleasure, {{in order to address}} the question “what is the property of pleasantness common to all positive affects?” In order to address this question nevertheless, one need to have at least rough grip on pleasure in the specific sense and on what distinguishes it from other <b>positive</b> <b>affects.</b> I shall therefore start by hinting at the problem of the definition of the specific concept of pleasure...|$|R
