50|$|The {{working volume}} of the {{intensifier}} {{is limited by the}} stroke of the piston. This in turn limits the amount of work that may be done by one stroke of the intensifier. These are not reciprocating machines (i.e. continually running multi-stroke machines) and so their entire work must be carried out by a single stroke. This limits their usefulness somewhat, to machines that can accomplish their task within a single stroke. They are often used where a powerful hydraulic jack is required, but there is insufficient space to fit the cylinder size that would normally be required, for the lifting force necessary and with the available system <b>pressure.</b> Using an <b>intensifier,</b> mounted outside the jack, allows a higher pressure to be obtained and thus a smaller cylinder used for the same lift force. Intensifiers are also used as part of machines such as hydraulic presses, where a higher pressure is required and a suitable supply is already available.|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} a new rotary type water hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>intensifier.</b> The object {{of this paper}} is to introduce the structure and the working principle of the <b>pressure</b> <b>intensifier,</b> and to present the fundamental characteristics by experimental results. The basic structure is similar to that of a water hydraulic planetary gear motor. Its main part consists of a stator, a rotor, nine planetary gears and two side plates. The inside of the stator is formed by a curve with 5 lobes and the outside of the rotor is formed by a curve with 4 lobes. Their curved surfaces have teeth like a gear. Nine displacement chambers are formed by the stator, rotor, planetary gears and side plates, and the each chamber's volume varies periodically when the rotor rotates. A side plate has 5 inlet distribute holes and 5 outlet distribute holes alternately located on its surface. Each displacement chamber connects to an inlet distribute hole during the volume is increasing, and it connects to an outlet distribute hole during the volume is decreasing. Now, one of the outlet distribute holes is separated from the other 4, the intensified higher pressure water is discharged from the separated distribute hole. It is found that the critical intensification ratio is about 2. 5 by experimental results with a prototype...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{increase}} energy efficiency of a pneumatic system the compressed air discharged from pneumatic actuator is being collected. In those conditions, the air contains {{a certain amount of}} energy and can be used at the points that require a lower level of pressure for their operations. If the collected air can not be directly returned and used in a pneumatic system, then the air pressure is increased by using <b>pressure</b> <b>intensifier</b> which is known in the commercial use as pneumatic booster. For that operation, the booster uses and consumes a part of the collected air. In this paper we analyze the dynamic behavior of a pressure booster and calculate its energy efficiency by using mathematical modeling and simulation in Simulink. The model of one pneumatic booster and its energy efficiency is verified by conducted experimental testing...|$|E

The Clark pump reciprocating <b>pressure</b> <b>intensifier</b> is a well established mechanism for highly efficient brine stream energy recovery in small scale seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination systems. This paper describes operation of a modified Clark pump in which the roles of the two pairs of chambers are reversed and the general arrangement of the complete RO system is substantially altered. In particular, the low-pressure motorised pump that feeds into the standard Clark pump is replaced by a high-pressure motorised pump that sits in parallel with it. A conceptual comparison of the original and modified arrangements is presented, followed by a discussion of the practical modifications made to a standard Clark pump in order to test the concept. The initial tests were successful and results indicating specific energies in the range 3. 5 to 4. 5 kWh/m 3 are presented...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} advantages of water jet are {{the capability to}} cut nearly every material, the low cutting temperature and the negligible cutting forces. When end users are interviewed, most of them {{point out that the}} most critical problem of water jet machines is the reliability of the system components, together with the difficulty in estimating their life time. As far as the UHP (Ultra High <b>Pressure)</b> <b>intensifier</b> is concerned, there are several components that work under extreme fatigue conditions, as the pressure inside the cylinders can reach 400 or even 600 MPa. Nearly every critical component is located into the UHP intensifier, but different failure scenarios can be envisaged, leading to different pattern deviations from nominal behavior conditions. In this paper a correlation analysis on multiple signal features with the health status of the machine is presented.

A Finnish company has developed a new type of water hydraulic intensifier pump in which the control valve is integrated in the plunger.

This paper deals with the optimi-zation of the intensifier pump using computer simulation and experimental measurements. The aim of the work is to improve the characteristics and reliability of the <b>pressure</b> <b>intensifier</b> pump. The effect of integrated control valve characteristics to intensifier pump properties is discussed. The optimum performance is studied via varia-tion of significant parameters of the intensifier pump.

40|$|There are few energy {{recovery}} devices (ERD) {{available on the}} market for small reverse osmosis units (RO). With reference to small units, installations have been considered which could be driven easily by a photovoltaic (PV) generator with an output of 200 litres up to 10 m(3) desalinated water per day [1 - 14]. In this paper, a systematic analysis for typical reverse osmosis concepts is presented which allows better understanding of the energy demand of small RO processes with {{energy recovery}} and which {{can be used as a}} decision tool. In contrast to publications already in existence which compare energy recovery devices [9, 10, 12, 15 - 27], the smallest devices are considered here. These are often positive displacement devices [3, 10, 16, 28, 29]. The new method of analysis takes as a basis the same physical parameters for all RO concepts, starting with the calculation of the osmotic pressure. Assumptions by an expert for possible operating parameters (recovery ratio, the feed and the concentrate pressure), known as the hydraulic envelope (suggested by Manth and Oklejas [30]) are not required. All parameters are considered dependent on the recovery rate. The following RO concepts are analysed: without energy recovery (noER) with energy recovery via reverse running pump or turbine (ER-EC) pressure exchanger (ER-PE) intermittent operation with pressure storage (ER-BP) <b>pressure</b> <b>intensifier</b> (ER-PI) These basic concepts are compared for steady state operation. The analysis shows the ideal recovery ratio related to the specific energy consumption (SEC) for each RO concept. With this basic analysis it is possible to choose the most energy-efficient hydraulic concept for a specified RO capacity in order to combine it with a solar energy supply. In particular variable operation and frequent shutdowns and start-ups are typical requirements for small PV-RO systems without energy storage. The best performance in this calculation is achievable for the RO process with pressure exchanger...|$|E
40|$|Abrasive {{waterjet}} (AWJ) cutting is a {{machining process}} to cut {{wide range of}} materials from soft materials such as rubber, leather to hard materials such as metals {{by means of a}} high-velocity slurry jet, formed as a result of injecting abrasive particles into a waterjet. The machining action is the result of these particles impacting against a workpiece with a high velocity. Conventional AWJ equipments generate water pressures up to 400 MPa (= 4000 bar = 58000 psi) and use orifices whose diameters are in the range of 0. 08 mm to 1 mm to generate plain waterjet. The abrasive particles of sizes 0. 07 mm to 0. 36 mm in diameter entrain to the jet former with air and mix with the waterjet in the mixing chamber to form the three phase slurry jet. The abrasive particles are accelerated and focused in the focusing tube. The width of the focusing tube determines the cutting width which is in the range of 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm in diameter. This study investigates the applicability and the performance of waterjet (WJ) and AWJcutting process beyond 400 MPa water pressure, which is called ultra-high pressures during the study. One of the objectives is to expand the application domain of the process. With higher water pressure, plain WJ is capable of cutting harder materials and it is possible to cut intricate details with AWJ due to the availability of high energy density with small orifices. Moreover, reduction in cutting costs is expected as a result of higher feed speeds or reduced abrasive consumption. The initial focus of the research is to provide guidelines to develop a reliable AWJ cutting system above 400 MPa. It was shown that the plastic deformation takes place at the thick walled cylinders subjected to internal pressure of more than 700 MPa with the current types of materials that are generally used in high pressure components. Therefore, imposing compressive residual stress to the bore of the cylinder is necessary for the parts such as high <b>pressure</b> <b>intensifier</b> cylinder where plastic deformation is unacceptable. Autofrettage and multi layer construction are the two techniques to create residual stresses in the cylinder. An optimum autofrettage pressure exists due to the Bauschinger effect. Therefore, a multi layer cylinder construction provides cylinders with higher pressure capacity. A simplified model for predicting the pressure output for double acting pressure intensifiers is presented after the design considerations for thick walled cylinders in order to estimate the required attenuator volume and the high pressure cylinder dimensions to limit the pressure fluctuations. The model is in good agreement with the pressure measurements. The energy conversions and the related efficiencies during the AWJ formation process provide a perspective to the performance of the process. Energy density of the plain and abrasive waterjet is defined to correlate with the cutting performance. Reducing the focusing tube diameter and increasing the water pressure are the most beneficial methods to increase the energy density. Other methods such as increasing the orifice diameter or reducing the feed speed are in conflict with cutting intricate details and economical considerations. With the insight gained at the previous step, the performances of plain and abrasive waterjet are evaluated. The increase in pressure results in a more scattered jet. A diverted jet generates wider cuts with wider damaged zones and rounded edges in WJ cutting. In AWJ cutting, it accelerates the wear of the entry region of the focusing nozzle. The experiments show that the length and diameter of upstream tube {{play an important role in}} jet quality. The turbulences in the flow are reduced in the upstream tube. It should be sufficiently large to make the flow laminar. Moreover, when the streamlines are guided towards the orifice with a conical seal, the resultant jet disintegrates later. After the quality of the jet is ensured, the cutting performance tests are conducted. The maximum feed rate increases more than the hydraulic power of the waterjet which shows that increasing the pressure leads to a more power efficient process. Moreover, at the same hydraulic power, the smaller jets perform better. On the other hand, the increase in depth of cut with pressure is directly proportional with the hydraulic power. It is proposed that the depth of cut is directly proportional with the energy density of the jet. However, at the low feed rates the relation is no longer linear. Therefore, the feed rate term of the energy density equation is modified to predict the depth of cut. Due to the cutting mechanism of the plain waterjet, the surface quality is poor with burrs in the case of metals and fiber damages in the case of composite materials. Therefore, plain waterjet cutting is suitable for separating instead of precision cutting of metal sheets and composites. The mixing and acceleration of the particles with a waterjet determine the cutting ability of AWJ. It becomes less efficient at high abrasive loads. The momentum from the plain waterjet to the abrasives transfers more efficient with the increase in pressure at the same abrasive load ratio. The efficiency of power transferred from the water to the abrasives decreases when the abrasive load ratio exceeds 0. 3 for low focusing tube to orifice diameter (df / do) ratios and 0. 4 for high df /do ratio. The optimum abrasive flow rate does not depend on pressure. As it was in the plain waterjet, the energy density of the jet correlates well with the cutting ability of the jet. The linear relation between these parameters becomes non-linear at high energy densities due to the increased energy losses at longer traveling lengths through the material at higher depths of cut. The final consideration of this study is the economical aspects of ultra-high pressure AWJ cutting. The cost advantage depends on the increase of the cost of the pump, the maintenance and the life of the consumables with the pressure increase. The pressure increase is cost effective if the investment costs and maintenance costs are below certain values. If several engineering issues such as the lifetimes of the critical components and the availability of wear resistant sufficiently long focusing tubes are solved, the ultra-high abrasive waterjet cutting can be implemented successfully to industrial applications.
