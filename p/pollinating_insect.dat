50|$|An entomovector is a <b>pollinating</b> <b>insect</b> {{used as a}} vector {{to spread}} a {{substance}} used in the biocontrol of plant pests and diseases. The insect is typically a honey bee, bumble bee, or mason bee, but may be any variety of insect that spreads pollen among plants.

50|$|Cyp. reginae reproduces sexually and {{depends on}} insects such as syphid flies, beetles and Megachile bees for pollination. The {{structure}} of the flower creates a tight space through which insects have to squeeze. A <b>pollinating</b> <b>insect</b> first passes by the stigma, and upon exiting the trap rubs against the anther. Pollination typically occurs in June and the seed pod or fruit is ripe by September and dehisces by October. Although a single seed pod can produce over 50,000 seeds low germination and a seed to flowering term of about 8 years indicate that sexual reproduction is inefficient. Asexual reproduction from rhizomes in the Showy Lady's slipper is a common means of sustaining a population.|$|E

40|$|A path-coefficient {{analysis}} was used to furnish information on the inter-relationships of <b>pollinating</b> <b>insect</b> activity and components of seed yield in inbreds of Allium cepa L. The inbreds differed very significantly in their attentiveness to pollinating insects. Only one inbred exhibited a significant correlation (P 3 ̆c 0. 05 positive) between numbers of honey bees and seed yields. Separating the correlation coefficients into components of direct and indirect effects indicated that pollination attractiveness was not the limiting factor in seed set for inbreds in the experiment. Moreover, most of the variation in seed yield could be attributed to indirect effects on the components of yield, umbels per plant, flowers per umbel, percent per fertilized flower, and seeds per fertilized flower...|$|E

40|$|Pollination of {{flowering}} plants {{is an important}} ecosystem service provided by wild insect pollinators and managed honey bees. Hence, losses and declines of <b>pollinating</b> <b>insect</b> species threaten human food security and are of major concern not only for apiculture or agriculture but for human society in general. Honey bee colony losses and bumblebee declines have attracted intensive research interest {{over the last decade}} and although the problem is far from being solved we now know that viruses are among the key players of many of these bee losses and bumblebee declines. With this special issue on bee viruses we, therefore, aimed to collect high quality original papers reflecting the current state of bee virus research.

40|$|Chemosensory receptors {{play key}} roles in insect behavior. Thus, genes {{encoding}} these receptors have {{great potential for}} use in integrated pest management. The hover fly Scaeva pyrastri (L.) is an important <b>pollinating</b> <b>insect</b> and a natural enemy of aphids, mainly distributed in the Palearctic and Nearctic regions. However, a systematic identification of their chemosensory receptor genes in the antennae has not been reported. In the present study, we assembled the antennal transcriptome of S. pyrastri by using Illumina sequencing technology. Analysis of the transcriptome data identified 60 candidate chemosensory genes, including 38 for odorant receptors (ORs), 16 for ionotropic receptors (IRs), and 6 for gustatory receptors (GRs). The numbers {{are similar to those}} of other Diptera species, suggesting that we were able to successfully identify S. pyrastri chemosensory genes. We analyzed the expression patterns of all genes by using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and found that some genes exhibited sex-biased or sex-specific expression. These candidate chemosensory genes and their tissue expression profiles provide information for further studies aimed at fully understanding the molecular basis behind chemoreception-related behaviors in S. pyrastri...|$|E
40|$|Whilst ‘exotic’ {{plants are}} now {{commonly}} available across Europe, orchids are {{still able to}} inspire strong passions. Edwina became so fascinated by orchid collectors and their obsessions, that she painstakingly replicated over 200 phalaenopsis (moth) orchids {{as an act of}} homage. These 3 d, life sized paper flowers are pinned to the gallery wall as though they’re 19 th century butterfly specimens. Whilst looking identical to living orchids, these replicas flatten and ‘neuter’ the plants reproductive (bi sexual) organs. No <b>pollinating</b> <b>insect</b> would approach them, although they have a strong allure for humans because they are beautiful, ‘exotic’ and mimic female sexual parts. Poignantly, most phalaenopsis orchids are infertile due to constant hybridisation by international breeding programmes. 'An Orchid Collection' consists of a series of installations and sculptures which explore nature, nurture and obsession. Together, they unfold the intricacies and unpredictability of breeding patterns, and raise questions about race, otherness, and integration. They look at biodiversity - making connections between human activity and plants' sustainability. Other works explore our current fixation on youth and longevity.

40|$|Urbanization {{affects the}} {{availability}} and diversity of floral resources (pollen and/or nectar) for wild <b>pollinating</b> <b>insects.</b> For example, urban green areas are characterized by an abundance of ornamental plant species. Increasingly, trees are planted to improve the aesthetics of urban streets and parks. These urban trees might offer important floral resources to <b>pollinating</b> <b>insects.</b> To examine the suitability of urban trees as resources for <b>pollinating</b> <b>insects,</b> we investigated the chemical composition of pollen and nectar {{as well as the}} amount of nectar produced by the nine major insect-pollinated tree species planted in cities of Western Europe, namely Acer pseudoplatanus, Aesculus carnea, A. hippocastanum, Robinia pseudoacacia, Tilia cordata, T. x euchlora, T. x europaea, T. platyphyllos and T. tomentosa. The analyses revealed that globally the Tilia trees provide pollen with lower contents of polypeptides, amino acids and phytosterols compared with the other species. Urban tree flowers offer abundant nectar with relatively high sugar contents (0. 16 – 1. 28 mg/flower); sucrose was the predominant sugar in all nectars. The investigated tree species could therefore be considered in future city plantings. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The orchid mantis, Hymenopus coronatus (Insecta: Mantodea), is renown for its visual {{resemblance}} to a flower blossom. It has been hypothesised that the 'flowerlike' orchid mantis is an aggressive mimic that attracts pollinators as prey items. This {{is the first}} study into the morphology of the orchid mantis that explores this widely discussed hypothesis. We quantified color and shape patterns of orchid mantises {{that are likely to}} present visual cues to pollinators. We used spectrometry to measure their overall coloration and geometric morphometric techniques to quantify the shape of their 'petal-like' mid- and hind-legs. This was done for both juvenile and adult female orchid mantises. To investigate how this stimulus may be perceived by a <b>pollinating</b> <b>insect</b> we investigated within-individual color variation using physiological models of hymenopteran vision. Mantises were found to reflect primarily UV- absorbing white. Visual models indicated that within individuals, different body parts did not contrast highly in color. Femoral lobes showed patterns of bilateral symmetry with juveniles expressing similar patterns of shape variation to adults. The results are used to provide specific and testable hypotheses as to how the morphology of the orchid mantis may constitute a signal directed towards pollinating insects. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{causes and}} {{consequences}} of flower constancy have {{been the focus of}} many studies, but almost all have examined the foraging behavior of bumblebees, honeybees, or butterflies. We test whether constancy occurs in an overlooked group of pollinators, the syrphid flies. Foraging sequences of wild flies of two species, Episyrphus balteatus and Syrphus ribesii were examined when visiting flowers in seminatural plant communities and in artificial arrays of two color morphs of Lobularia maritima planted at a range of frequencies. Both species exhibited marked floral constancy when foraging in the mixed-plant community. Because all groups of <b>pollinating</b> <b>insect</b> so far examined exhibit constancy at least under some circumstances, we suggest that this is the predominant strategy used by pollinators and that there is probably a common explanation. Neither syrphid species exhibited constancy to different color morphs within a plant species, in contrast to previously published studies of Hymenoptera foraging among polymorphic flowers, which all describe positive frequency-dependent selection. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. We argue that constancy in these syrphids is unlikely to result from learning constraints on handling ability, currently the most widely accepted explanation for flower constancy, because they forage primarily for pollen which is easily located inmost flowers they visit...|$|E
40|$|Interspecific {{relationships}} among pollinators and predators give insight to pollination and plant fitness {{for a given}} ecosystem. We focused on pollinator-predator interactions on three common native plants (Eriogonum fasciculatum, Baccharis pilularis, Encelia californica) in California coastal sage scrub habitat. When allowed to forage at an array of five inflorescences (one with a crab spider), the pollinators (honey bees, Vespidae, other Diptera and other Hymenoptera) exhibited fear by spending less time on the dangerous inflorescence. There is also a spatial effect that depends upon pollinator type. Syrphid flies spent more time on safe inflorescences that were further away from the dangerous inflorescence. We then focused on honey bees (Apis mellifera), the most common visitor to these native plants. Honey bees exhibited fear and significantly avoided a feeder with crab spider odor. However, they did not avoid an artificial spider that did not provide spider odor. When spider odor {{was added to the}} model, they showed significant avoidance. This suggests that honey bees used olfaction as the primary cue to identify crab spiders (Mecaphesa celer and Xysticus elegans). In addition, honey bees avoided the odors of dead heterospecific pollinators (Villa lateralis, Agapostemon texanus, Ceratina sp. and Vespula pensylvanica) that are abundant in their environment. Thus, pollinator fear of predation mediated by olfactory detection can allow information about predator danger to flow in a community of <b>pollinating</b> <b>insect...</b>|$|E
