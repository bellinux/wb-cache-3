25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{acquisition}} of Burger King by TPG Capital in 2002, its new CEO Bradley (Brad) Blum set about reversing {{the fortunes of the}} company's advertising programs. The company reinstated its famous Have it your way motto and engaged Miami-based advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B), which was known for having a hip, subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients. CP+B updated Burger King's image and changed its marketing strategy. The cups, bags and the company logo were redesigned with the intent to give and BK an appealing, culturally aware and modern image. Humorous statements, claims and product descriptions were printed on bags, product packaging and on in-store promotional materials, including a Burger King Bill of Rights, using the slogan Have it Your Way. CP+B created an advertising campaign that focused on television spots, <b>print,</b> <b>web</b> and product tie-ins.|$|E
2500|$|The {{past several}} years have seen the growth of student media within the Union, which now {{includes}} <b>print,</b> <b>web</b> and broadcast. The Gown {{is seen as the}} paper of record of the Union although it is entirely independent and relies solely on advertising revenues. The Union has also funded its own publication for several decades, but following the failure of several different papers in previous years, the SU Mag was launched in September 2007 by former Deputy President Sarah McCaffrey. The SU Magazine {{went on to win the}} Best Student Magazine of the Year and Best Design and Layout at the annual Student Media Awards in Dublin. Plans were also announced by Sarah McCaffrey in November 2007 to launch a Union television station called 'SU TV' which would initially be broadcast in the Union and on a re-launched 'SU Website', it is expected to be up and running in early 2008 and will use the studio in the Union building built by the University's Film Studies Department. The Union is also home to the student station, Queen's Radio (QR) who broadcast on 1134MW in a 12-mile radius from a transmitter based in the Student's Union, as well as online via their website. [...] Unlike SU TV, Queen's Radio is an official society and independent of the Union. The station is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland and has one of the largest membership of any QUB society. All four media outlets, regardless of their status, are, or will be based, primarily in the Union building.|$|E
