5|$|<b>Polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (PKD) is a slowly {{progressive}} disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed {{with a low}} incidence in Maine Coons, PKD {{appears to be a}} misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, in the absence of other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported alive and well in adulthood. Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment. Ultrasonography is currently the only valid diagnostic method for its detection in this breed.|$|E

40|$|Deregulation of cell {{survival}} in cystic and dysplastic renal development. Various aberrations of cell biology {{have been reported}} in <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> and in cystic renal dysplasias. A common theme in these disorders is failure of maturation of renal cells which superficially resemble embryonic tissue. Apoptosis is a feature of normal murine nephrogenesis, where it has been implicated in morphogenesis, and fulminant apoptosis occurs in the small, cystic kidneys which develop in mice with null mutations of bcl- 2. Therefore, we examined the location and extent of apoptosis in pre- and postnatal samples of human <b>polycystic</b> and dysplastic <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> using propidium iodide staining, in situ end-labeling and electron microscopy. In dysplastic kidneys cell death was prominent in undifferentiated cells around dysplastic tubules and was occasionally found in cystic epithelia. The incidence of apoptosis was significantly greater than in normal controls of comparable age both pre- and postnatally. In the <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidneys</b> there was widespread apoptosis in the interstitium around undilated tubules distant from cysts, in undilated tubules between cysts and in cystic epithelia. The level of apoptosis compared to controls was significantly increased postnatally. A similar increase of cell death was also noted in the early and late stages of renal disease in the polycystic cpk/cpk mouse model. We speculate that deregulation of cell {{survival in}} these kidneys may reflect incomplete tissue maturation, and may contribute to the progressive destruction of functional <b>kidney</b> tissue in <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidneys</b> and the spontaneous involution reported in cystic dysplastic kidneys...|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate CKD from acute kidney injury (AKI) because AKI can be reversible.

Kidneys with CKD are usually smaller (≤ 9nbsp&cm) than normal kidneys, with notable exceptions such as in early diabetic nephropathy and <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Another diagnostic clue that helps differentiate CKD from AKI is a gradual rise in serum creatinine (over several months or years) as opposed to a sudden increase in the serum creatinine (several days to weeks).

It is also the most common of the inherited cystic kidney diseases — a group of disorders with related but distinct pathogenesis, characterized by the development of renal cysts and various extrarenal manifestations, which in case of ADPKD include cysts in other organs, such as the liver, seminal vesicles, pancreas, and arachnoid membrane, as well as other abnormalities, such as intracranial aneurysms and dolichoectasias, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, and abdominal wall hernias. Over 50% of patients with ADPKD eventually develop end stage kidney disease and require dialysis or kidney transplantation.

40|$|Cilia are {{microtubule}} based organelles with {{roles in}} motility and sensory perception. An emerging pattern suggests that various human diseases {{are caused by}} defects in the assembly, maintenance or function of cilia. Some ciliopathies, such as the <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, involve aberrant cell proliferation in conjunction with ciliary defects. Recent data suggests that the cilium serves as a highly conserved organizing center for early steps in signal transduction pathways that control cell growth and division. As such, signaling molecules important for growth, mitosis or differentiation have been localized to cilia. The relationship between cilia and cell cycle progression is poorly defined, but may involve regulation by the NIMA-family of kinases (Neks). Our discovery that the Nek Fa 2 p is important for ciliary function and cell cycle progression in Chlamydomonas provides a direct link between these two processes. Fa 2 p was originally identified from a screen for deflagellation-defective mutants in Chlamydomonas and shown to be defective in calcium-induced severing of the axonemal microtubules. We subsequently showed that fa 2 mutants are delayed in transit through at least two points in the cell cycle: (1) G 2 /M transition; (2) assembly of flagella after exit from mitosis. In this study, we show that Fa 2 p localizes to a unique site at the proximal end of cilia in Chlamydomonas and kidney epithelial cells, suggesting {{a high level of}} conservation of this signaling complex. In both cell types, Fa 2 p localization is dynamic; when cells enter the cell cycle, Fa 2 p becomes reduced in the cilium and accumulates {{at the base of the}} basal bodies/centrioles. It remains associated with the spindle poles throughout the cell cycle and is assembled on cilia when they begin to regenerate after exit from mitosis. Importantly, Fa 2 p kinase activity is required for deflagellation, but does not appear to be essential for localization and efficient cell cycle progression. Furthermore, we show that two mammalian Nek homologs of Fa 2 p (mNek 1 and mNek 8), which are defective in murine models of <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases,</b> localize to primary cilia and centrosomes. Finally, biochemical analysis reveals the interaction of two proteins (~ 20 and ~ 60 kDa) with Fa 2 p in situ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> (PKD) are a {{group of}} {{inherited}} ciliopathies in which the formation and growth of multiple cysts derived from the distal nephron and collecting duct leads to the disruption of normal kidney architecture, chronic interstitial inflammation/fibrosis and hypertension.

In vitro, ATP-P 2 signaling promotes cystic epithelial cell proliferation, chloride-driven fluid secretion and apoptosis. Furthermore, dysfunction of the polycystin signal transduction pathways promotes the secretagogue activity of extracellular ATP by activating a calcium-activated chloride channel via purinergic receptors. Finally, ATP is a danger signal and could potentially contribute to interstitial inflammation associated with PKD.
