40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} concept of {{clinical}} legal education and access to justice in South Africa through an in-depth study of the Campus Law Clinic of the University of Natal, Durban. Chapter 1 and 2 outline the object, <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> of concepts and describes the method used. Chapter 3 presents the background to clinical legal education and access to justice. The chapter begins with {{a brief overview of}} the history of clinical legal education and continues with a short description of the two dimensions of clinical legal education. Chapter 4 deals with clinical legal education and access to justice in South Africa during the apartheid days and currently. It describes the evolution of state strategies and non-governmental initiatives during this broad time period. It attempts to present a balanced picture reflecting advantages and disadvantages of clinical legal education and ends with a discussion of the role of paralegals and a brief discussion of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this system. This lays the foundation for Chapter 5, which contains an in-depth discussion of the Campus Law Clinic. It is examined how and why it was established, how it operated during the apartheid years and how it evolved during the post apartheid period. Its current goals and strategies, its role in promoting access to justice and clinical legal education and its impact in these two areas is thereafter discussed. Chapter 6 examines the current initiatives and future plans for clinical legal education and access to justice in South Africa as a whole. It looks at transformation initiatives that the South African government is currently involved in and also at policy issues related to it. Chapter 7 is aimed at the Swedish context. This chapter examines potential effects of clinical legal education and paralegals in Sweden. It begins with a brief background discussion of access to justice and legal education in Sweden and thereafter develops to include highlights of areas where clinical legal education and paralegals could affect the system of access to justice and legal education in Sweden. Finally, Chapter 8 presents some conclusions where the overriding suggestion is to re-examine and evaluate systems to ensure that they evolve as society changes...|$|E

To create value is the central focus of any economic action and transaction. Therefore the concept of value added has been discussed and used in several countries- especially in Europe- as an useful measure for different <b>purposes</b> in accounting <b>and</b> other economic areas. Literature refers to Germany and France as being two {{of the countries in}} the world where the idea of value added is somehow integrated in several areas of accounting.

In {{the run-up to the}} NATO Summit in Riga in November 2006, a debate {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic has now evolved over NATO's global engagement that touches on the very foundations of NATO's original <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition.</b> Critically, the debate is no longer about wether NATO should go 'out of area or out of business' but whether the Alliance should enlarge on a global level from Vancouver to Tokyo and Wellington. In order to place this debate into the recent historical context of the Alliance, this article examines U. S. -European security relations since September 11 within the institutional framework of NATO and, subsequently, draws conclusions for the future role of the Alliance. As the transatlantic community faces security threats of inherently global nature such as internationally organized terrorism and crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, collapse or lack of state structures in certain regions, and ruptures in the stable supply of energy resources, NATO will have to define its role as a global security actor if it wishes to avoid becoming a mere service provider of security.

40|$|Discussions of {{architectural}} education invite consideration of assumptions concerning the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of an architectural education. Such pursuits raise questions {{that each of}} us should confront regarding our assumptions about what kinds of knowledge, values and relationships are deemed legitimate educational concerns. 1 This thesis gives shape to the architectural student campaigns of the 1930 's and the 1960 's, their efforts to make sense of their experiences as well as their search for meaning in architectural education. In many of these instances, students began by drawing strength from a number of leftist protests which swept university campuses, but {{in the course of the}} ensuing controversy students ultimately concluded by raising questions about the nature {{of architectural}} education and developing a radically new consciousness concerning the purpose of education. Students emerged from these campaigns with fresh thinking about the objectives and methods of an architectural education. Such investigations invite consideration for contemporary student engagement in architectural education to undergo a similar sense of self examination and are encouraging of the fundamental changes such an examination often demands. 2 1 Henry A.

40|$|Defense {{programs}} {{still play}} a central role in protecting and defending US interests, while the government has also developed threat reduction programs to reduce dangers posed by the increasing specter of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Like other defense programs, threat reduction programs produce and manage a great deal of information. The programs involve interaction between collaborative partners, foreign and domestic, that act to prevent the spread of WMD. The unhindered flow of information between those involved in these projects is of great importance to the successes of these programs. For the nuclear threat reduction programs, a system with comprehensive access control was needed to support daily business processes, and to capture programmatic information, simplify it, and synthesize it [...] the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of information management in this case. Using these criteria, the Threat Reduction ExtraNet (TREND) system, formerly referred to as the US/NIS ExtraNet, was created and implemented by Los Alamos National Laboratory to meet the information management needs of threat reduction programs such as the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program. By supporting this nonproliferation program alone, the TREND system supports US nuclear nonproliferation objectives, and it has enabled new opportunities for enhanced program transparency at many different levels, both in the US and Newly Independent States (NIS) of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter aims {{to add to}} the {{accumulative}} {{knowledge in}} the field of e-marketing through conceptualising e-marketing as a new marketing philosophy. The review of the literature has revealed that one of the main obstacles to developing e-marketing potential is the absence of a clear conceptualisation of e-marketing <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition.</b> The majority of researchers within the field misuse the term e-marketing and are using the terms e-business, e-marketing, e-commerce and Internet-marketing interchangeably as if they are similar or have the same meaning, which is incorrect. For example, e-marketing is broader in scope than Internet marketing since it refers not only to digital media such as the Web, e-mail, and wireless media, but also includes electronic customer relationship management systems and the management of digital customer data, etc. In contrast, e-commerce and e-business have a wider and broader scope than e-marketing. The differences between these terms as well as the main components of e-marketing are illustrated and discussed in detail within the chapter towards achieving a conceptualisation of e-marketing as a new marketing philosophy and to build a ground base of understanding for these different concepts. The chapter will help researchers and scholars in the field of e-marketing to have a clearer view towards its concept that in turn will contribute to the related accumulated knowledge in the field. © 2011, IGI Global...|$|R

It is difficult to measure effectiveness in not-for-profit organisations like schools; there is no ‘bottom-line’ against which to gauge performance and managers struggle to make meaningful comparisons between outcomes and targets. In education, well-publicised {{attempts have been made to}} establish - some would say impose - a set of criteria against which schools can measure success or failure. These have so far centred on measuring external stakeholder outcomes like examination results, parental satisfaction, inspection grades and so on, but have failed to capture the essence of what it is to be - or what it takes to become - a successful school. This book is an attempt to describe the potential of a school for improvement and to guage its success in new intrinsic terms [...] . in terms of its internal intellectual capital; the resource that comes from relationships between a school and its stakeholders, from its ability to innovate and manage change, from its infrastructure, and from the knowledge and transferable competencies of its staff.

Departments that are involved in the {{management of parking}} space in campus are different compared to other areas. In this research, MARA University of Technology (UiTM) Shah Alam was chosen as a case study. This institution is chosen because UiTM Shah Alam has a management system that is managed by its own unit. The objective of this research is to identify the problems and effectiveness of parking space management in UiTM Shah Alam. In addition, the objective is also to evaluate the satisfaction level of the user on management of parking space. The method carried out was through questionnaires and analysis. Then, after the analysis of all the data and information, recommendations are given on the problems stated. In generally, the facilities management for management of parking space is essential for planning, controlling, and to prevent problems such as insufficient parking space.

40|$|Teaching and Learning Department Capstone ProjectIn recent years, {{theorists have}} begun to explore {{the ways in which}} the {{narratives}} our children read influence the democratic ideals we wish to impart. In a nation so stratified along both racial and socioeconomic lines with a long history of various forms of systemic oppression, this issue is particularly relevant to how children in the most inequitable learning environments, situated in the most marginalized communities, come to see and know how to effect social change. In order to begin an investigation into the ways in which our democracy is conveyed through various forms of storytelling, this paper will interrogate the narrative space of children’s literature with particular focus on the American civil rights movement. The question that will guide this examination will concern the implicit and explicit ways that differing narrative types promote or hinder central ideals of democracy. Based on Bell’s (2009) story type framework, I will conceptualize different types of stories as integrated pedagogical, philosophical, and curricular extensions that are produced, consumed, and regulated with specific political purposes in mind. My framework will be grounded in principles of democratic education, social justice education, critical pedagogy, and critical race theory. I will utilize the philosophical underpinnings that constitute this theoretical framework to iteratively insert empirical data to interrogate the thematic composition and narrative structure of the children’s literature discussed. Thus, the central aim of this paper is to explore a conceptual framework from which to illuminate the foundation, <b>purpose,</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of alternative forms of narratives. Additionally, standards-based exercises that combat and build upon narrative types will be discussed. Department of Teaching and LearningPeabody College of Education and Human Developmen...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} results of a study undertaken within a small local authority. It examines the relevance of both stakeholder theory and contemporary strategic thinking to determine whether stakeholder voice has an impact upon the formulation of strategy {{within the context of the}} local authority examined. The role of the stakeholder is argued as being fundamental in the development of effective strategy, and therefore "logical incrementalism" is challenged in favour of the need for strategic forward planning to formalise the involvement of stakeholders. However, whilst this research indicates a development toward a planned approach to strategy, this can be constrained by other factors that divert managers away from strategic issues, including a flat management structure, strategically indifferent political support and limited time and resources. Moreover, the multiplicity [in both number and influence] of the stakeholders to the local authority supports the situational and subjective nature of the stakeholder concept, which can lead to both positive and negative stakeholder influences. Accordingly, it is argued that stakeholder voice is ultimately related to an individual stakeholder's ability to sanction, support and/or exert power over the local authority. A model of stakeholder power has been developed, which postulates that such power is derived from the impact of legislation upon the stakeholder relationship in combination with the stakeholder's ability to control resources as well the stakeholder's impact upon the reputation of the local authority. The ability to comprehend the complexity and nuances of the stakeholder concept is therefore of paramount importance, however it was observed that managers do not fully understand the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of strategy <b>and</b> therefore do not fully comprehend the stakeholder concept and its relationship to strategy. Therefore a significant need for training was identified with regard to both stakeholder involvement and strategy formulation. The research concludes that stakeholder voice does affect strategy formulation, but this relationship can be very situational, resulting in positive and negative connotations about the involvement of stakeholders to the various strategic processes of the local authority examined...|$|R

40|$|It remains {{fashionable to}} {{describe}} classical music as being either in crisis, or, {{at the very}} least, in need of robust defence. Bloggers and critics, e. g. Lebrecht (2008), have long lamented its alleged social or economic decline, and the less polemical Johnson (2002), Koehne (2004), Fineberg (2006) and Kramer (2009) have also scrutinised the place, <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of classical music in the twenty-first century. At the same time, many still see classical music as stuffy, elitist and {{out of touch with}} societies that are increasingly pluralist. Efforts to make classical music more accessible by embracing digital technology or informality in presentation often serve only to add further stereotypes: witness a ‘popular’ classical radio station said to “remove the guts of classical music, transforming it into a kind of fragrant security blanket” (Morley, 2013). This chapter seeks to cut through the hyperbole to examine how the use of language in the sector creates and drives such polarised impressions. Language is used in various ways to contextualise and set expectations about classical music. Many forms of communication currently slip under the radar, academically speaking, but are central to how classical music is perceived: from programme notes, liner notes and reviews that steer audiences’ experiences, to ‘bluffers’ guides and the work of marketers and musicologists to promote, demystify and reinterpret classical music. Add to the mix verbal commentaries such as radio ‘sells’, the rise of social media, and popular culture’s keen appropriation of classical music, and it is clear that much work remains to be done to understand how perceptions of classical music are shaped in the broadest sense. Pitts (2005) and Hellmuth Margulis (2010) have begun to highlight how diversely audiences feel about, and interact with, classical music. Drawing on their research, I take as my starting point the idea that “those who speak of a crisis in classical music are really describing the irrevocable demise of old, familiar attitudes, expectations and ways of working. ” (Levitt and Rennie, 1999). The chapter, then, assumes a causal link exists between the stereotypes and vocabularies that frame classical music. It probes that link by exploring how the use of language varies across and within classical genres, for example mainstream vs. experimental opera, a metropolitan chamber music society, and the popular classical canon. In doing so, the chapter assesses the prescriptive, emotive and ‘intellectualised’ ways in which classical music is discussed and received...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present note is to {{contribute}} in clarifying the relation between representation bases used in the closure for the redistribution (pressure-strain) tensor ϕ_ij, and to construct representation bases whose elements have clear physical significance. The representation of different models in the same basis is essential for comparison <b>purposes,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>definition</b> of the basis by physically meaningfull tensors adds insight to our understanding of closures. The rate-of-production tensor can be split into production by mean strain and production by mean rotation P_ij=P_S̅_ij+P_Ω̅_ij. The classic representation basis B[b, S, Ω] of homogeneous turbulence [eg Ristorcelli J. R., Lumley J. L., Abid R. : J. Fluid Mech. 292 (1995) 111 [...] 152], constructed from the anisotropy b, the mean strain-rate S, and the mean rotation-rate Ω tensors, is interpreted, in the present work, in terms of the relative contributions of the deviatoric tensors P^(dev) _S̅_ij:=P_S̅_ij- 23 P_kδ_ij and P^(dev) _Ω̅_ij:=P_Ω̅_ij. Different alternative equivalent representation bases, explicitly using P^(dev) _S̅_ij and P_Ω̅_ij are discussed, and the projection rules between bases are caclulated, using a matrix-based systematic procedure.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{responsibility}} {{will always be}} actual in all human activities. In the construction industry and real estate engineering, the impact of human activities always have a tangible link, {{it seems to be}} the assessment of duties and responsibility of each participant seemingly simple. The opposite is true, however, as construction and real estate business has passed in the last few decades significant development so that some activities in these fields have become for the general public is almost unreadable. And not only the lay the general public, but also experts and professionals in the field are often lost in the complicated process of construction, of the various stages and its connections with individual activities which have result in the effective complex. Construction Law, building regulations and authorization law can not be regarded as something of directive and bureaucracy of the state and its institutions, but it needs to see them particularly in terms of protection when it was, is and will be primarily in the interests of professionals to clearly defined rules and limits of their activities. It is therefore in the interest of authorized persons to best oriented in the regulations so that they help to improve the performance of their profession. For each authorized person working in the construction industry is important to know the extent of its competences, duties and responsibilities. Without knowledge of these principles can not be selected activities done and can not fulfill their <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> - which is certainly a quality building work which meets all requirements with respect to all subjects of its surroundings. The knowledge gained from this work should serve to simplify the view of the complicated system building regulations for obtaining a healthy perspective and eliminating concerns of this difficult structure. Diploma work does not attempt to change regulations, but rather to understand their meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose,</b> <b>and</b> point out their necessity. It can be said that knowledge of the legal context is a necessary condition for the performance of selected activities in construction. In any architect, designer and site management must have been a piece of "lawyer", when these people will be able to clearly understand the regulations not only in their profession, but also in connection with the other professions. Based on the findings contained in this thesis it is possible to establish for example open discussion, whether or not to introduce more fields in the building educational system, such as the real estate engineering at USI in Brno, whether and how to create the most appropriate implementation of the construction legal system in the curricula of technical faculties, how to create conditions for systematic knowledge of construction law of authorized persons throughout their careers...|$|R
