40|$|International audienceThe {{fluctuation}} of phreatic {{surfaces in}} tropical floodplain was studied {{for the lower}} part of the Yom's river basin at Phichit Province in Thailand. The simple water balance budget model was applied to estimate the groundwater recharge. The hydrologic components i. e. average rainfall, surface runoff, and deep percolation were calculated by using climatologically recorded and measured data. The Penman-Monteith's evapotranspiration method was used to estimate potential evapotranspiration for crop water requirement based on climatic data. The 49 -points of field infiltration and theirs distribution over the floodplain were measured using ring-infiltrometers. The surface water and phreatic surface deviations from the existing 22 -observation wells nearby the Yom River daily observed continuously for 3 years. The observed river water levels and phreatic surface water levels were agreed very well with R 2 approx. 0. 90. The rising <b>or</b> <b>recessing</b> of those fluctuations was depended on the inundated depth over floodplain or the amount of groundwater withdrawal for crop consuming. Understanding and quantifying the phreatic surface fluctuations in lowland paddy field is crucial for further floodplain management...|$|R
40|$|The term “cutting tool” in fact {{covers a}} very large variety of tools: turning tools, drill bits, planer tools and {{slotting}} tools, scraping or shaving tools, drill spindles, milling cutters, facing cutters, <b>recessing</b> <b>tools,</b> reamers, taps and dies, files, and grinding wheels. HSS cutting tool was commonly used for turning process for manufacturing. At common market there is many large selection of HSS tool steel with different type and mark. One of them was HSS tool steel made in Germany and Taiwan which share the same trade mark but have significant differences at price. At this paper our testing focused on comparation between HSS tool steel made in German and the one made in Taiwan which we can commonly found at the market. Our testing consist of hardness test, micrography test and chemical composition test. By that test we want to obtain which HSS more reliable for manufacturing process. The specimen were BOHLER MO RAPID EXTRA 1200 with ¼”x 1 / 4 ” x 4 ” made in Taiwan and the one Made in Germany. The result showing that HSS cutting tool Made in Germany has 64, 42 HRC and HSS Taiwan has 62, 35 HRC.
