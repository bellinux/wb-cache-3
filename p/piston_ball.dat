5000|$|An {{alternate}} design, the Rand cam engine, {{replaces the}} plate {{with one or more}} sinousoidal cam surfaces. Vanes mounted parallel to a shaft mounted inside a cylindrical 'barrel' that are free to sliding up and down ride the sinuous cam, the segments formed by rotor, stator walls and vanes constituting combustion chambers. In effect these spaces serving the same purpose as the cylinders of an axial engine, and the sinuous cam surface acts as the face of the pistons. In other respect this form follows the normal cycles of internal combustion but with burning gas directly imparting a force on the cam surface, translated into a rotational force by timing one or more detonations. This design eliminates the multiple reciprocal <b>pistons,</b> <b>ball</b> joints and swash plate of a conventional 'barrel' engine but crucially depends on effective sealing provided by sliding and rotating surfaces.http://www.regtech.com/radmax_technology/ ...|$|R
50|$|After Dumars made a layup, James Worthy hit a {{free throw}} and Bill Laimbeer canned a three-pointer, pushing the score to 106-105 with six seconds showing. A. C. Green {{completed}} the scoring with a layup off a length-of-the court pass from Magic, making it 108-105, {{and although the}} <b>Pistons</b> got the <b>ball</b> to Thomas at midcourt with a second remaining, he fell without getting off a shot.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, {{especially}} with engines {{that have had}} a lot of use, the <b>piston</b> / conrod <b>ball</b> socket joint is very loose and will adversely affect performance. A Cox “reset” tool, available for the [...]010, 020, 049/051 and the 09 series engines, is used to tighten the ball joint back up again. The correct free play is [...]001 to [...]003 inches. The [...]15 engines use a wrist pin so a socket reset tool is not required for these.|$|R
50|$|Oswald {{was riding}} through the Egyptian desert on his camel. The camel, though looking real on the exterior, is {{actually}} mechanical {{because of the}} two ball-shaped pistons inside which Oswald manipulates with his feet like bike pedals. One day, a lion was running toward them. To defend himself, Oswald brought out a rifle but it malfunctioned. As a final resort, Oswald fired the <b>ball</b> <b>pistons</b> from the camel like a cannon and aimed into the lion's mouth. Terrified by its lumpy back, the lion runs away in panic.|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} flexural {{strengths of}} five dental ceramic materials {{were evaluated by}} biaxial (<b>piston</b> on three <b>ball)</b> test. The materials were VMK 68, Vitadur N body feldspathic porcelains, Dicor and IPS Empress castable ceramics and In ceram aluminous core porcelain. Ten discs from each material were tested. The mean of flexural strength of In Ceram core porcelain {{was significantly higher than}} all the other materials tested the mean flexural strength of Dicor and IPS Empress castable ceramics were not significantly different (P >. 05). Though they were both significantly stronger than the two conventional feldspathic porcelains, VMK 68 and Vitadur N, which did not show significantly different mean strengths between them when the two porcelains were compared. This study indicated that newer improved ceramic materials exhibited greater flexural strengths than conventional feldspathic porcelains. However, the selection of appropriate restorative material requires consideration of several physical properties including flexural strengthKing Saud Universit...|$|R

This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record. In the post season, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the change in the flexural strength of pressable all-ceramic materials after repeated firings, which may be unavoidable when color and shape corrections are necessary for use in dental restorations. Materials and methodsForty disc specimens (15. 5  mm ×  2. 1  mm) were prepared for each of four pressable ceramic materials (Empress 2, Finesse, Cergo, and Evopress) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Each group of specimens was tested for biaxial flexural strength (<b>piston</b> on three <b>balls</b> test) after the first (n =  10), third (n =  10), fifth (n =  10), and seventh (n =  10) firing periods. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. The Tukey multiple comparison test was then used to compare the strength of the different materials, and the Newman–Keuls multiple comparison test was used to compare the strength at each firing interval measured (α =  0. 05). ResultsThe strengths of all of the pressable ceramic materials were decreased by repeated firings, especially after the seventh firing period, the only case in which the decrease was statistically significant. The flexural strength of the leucite-reinforced ceramic (Cergo) after the seventh firing was significantly lower than after the first firing (P =  0. 04). The other materials were not significantly affected by repeated firings (P >  0. 05).

5000|$|... ===Background=== The NBA (National Basketball Association) had {{problems}} attracting fans (and positive media coverage) before the shot clock's inception. This {{was due to}} teams running out the clock once they were leading in a game; without the shot clock, teams passed the ball nearly endlessly without penalty. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls {{to get the ball}} back following the free throw. Very low-scoring games with many fouls were common, which bored fans. The most extreme case occurred on November 22, 1950, when the Fort Wayne Pistons defeated the Minneapolis Lakers by a record-low score of 19-18, including 3-1 in the fourth quarter. The <b>Pistons</b> held the <b>ball</b> for minutes at a time without shooting (they attempted 13 shots for the game) in order to limit the impact of the Lakers' dominant George Mikan. The Pistons' performance led the St. Paul Dispatch to write [...] "Pistons gave pro basketball a great black eye." [...] NBA President Maurice Podoloff said, [...] "In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of necessity run up big scores." [...] A few weeks after the Pistons/Lakers game, the Rochester Royals and Indianapolis Olympians played a six-overtime game with only one shot in each overtime - in each overtime period, the team who had the ball first held the ball for the entirety of the period before attempting a last-second shot. The NBA tried several rule changes in the early 1950s to speed up the game and reduce fouls before eventually adopting the shot clock.|$|R

5000|$|Before Chamberlain, {{the most}} {{dominant}} big man in the NBA was 6 ft George Mikan. In November 1950, the Fort Wayne <b>Pistons</b> held the <b>ball</b> for {{minutes at a time}} without shooting to limit the impact of the Minneapolis Lakers' Mikan. The Pistons attempted 13 shots in the game, and won 19-18. NBA President Maurice Podoloff said, [...] "In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of necessity run up big scores." [...] In the , teams averaged just above 80 points per game. The NBA introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954, and league scoring and attendance increased. By the , teams were averaging 119 points each game. Chamberlain that season was one of 37 black players in the league, the NBA having started integration of blacks in 1950. With their emergence, the NBA game was stylistically being played faster and above the rim. Many of the league's great players were black, and blacks believed they were limited by a league quota of four black players per team. Critics suggested that basketball was becoming uninteresting with taller players dominating. Warriors teammate Joe Ruklick thought that [...] "the attitude white players in the NBA was, in my opinion, 'Chamberlain is a freak who will come and go. There will never be a black guy doing this again.'" [...] Chamberlain, nicknamed Dipper, was revolutionizing the sport with his slam dunks, nicknamed the Dipper Dunk. Traditionalists considered dunking poor sportsmanship, and their occurrence was rare. As the league's second tallest player, Chamberlain began dunking more regularly. He was still more of a finesse player, preferring fadeaway shots and finger rolls. He rarely dunked forcefully. Teammate Paul Arizin believed Chamberlain {{did not want to be}} perceived as great merely from being tall.|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Despite the {{esthetic}} {{advantage of}} finishing and polishing, there remains concern that these procedures might reduce {{the strength of}} a finished ceramic restoration. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of surface finishing procedures on the flexural strength of four dental ceramic materials. Material and Methods: The materials used were feldspathic porcelain (Vitadur N), Dicor, IPS Empress glass ceramic, and In-Ceram aluminous core porcelain. Abiaxial flexure test was conducted on a total of 10 specimens each in 9 groups. These groups were as-fired, polished and glazed Vitadur N discs; as-cast and polished Dicor discs; as-cast and polished IPS Empress discs; and as-fired and polished In-Ceram core porcelain discs. The flexural strength was evaluated using biaxial <b>Piston</b> on three <b>ball</b> test. Results: The mean biaxial flexural strength values were 63 ± 4 MPa for as fired feldspathic porcelain specimens, 100 ± 9 MPa for polished feldspathic porcelain, and 66 ± 7 MPa for glazed porcelain, 106 ± 13 MPa for as cast Dicor specimens and 229 ± 13 MPa for their polished counterparts. 109 ± 9 MPa for IPS Empress specimens and 218 ± 13 MPa for their polished counterparts 343 ± 34 MPa for nonpolished IN-Ceram core porcelained discs and 536 ± 37 MPa for their polished counterparts. The In-Ceram core materials resulted in the highest mean flexural strength values regardless of the surface finish. Though polished In-Ceram core specimens were 56 % stronger than their as fired counterpart. The strength of glass ceramic specimens (Dicor and IPS Empress specimens) was double that of their unpolished counterparts indicating a higher sensitivity to surface finish. Conclusion: In general, within the limitation of this experiment, the results suggests that strength of a ceramic restoration may be increased by finishing and polishing. Nevertheless, clinical trials are necessary to confirm these findings. Clinical Implications: The results of this in vitro experiment suggest that surface finishing may have an effect on the strength of the ceramic specimens tested. King Saud Universit...|$|R
