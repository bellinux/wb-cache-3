To date, six species of insects have been released on bitou bush, four of which have established. The bitou tip moth (Comostolopsis germana Prout) and bitou seed fly (Mesoclanis polana Munro) are now widely established in New South Wales and two other agents, the bitou tortoise beetle (Cassida sp.) and the bitou leaf roller (‘Tortrix’ sp.) are currently surviving in low numbers in New South Wales {{but only in the}} vicinity of their initial release sites. A total of six species have been released for boneseed, but despite repeated and often large releases, none of these agents have established in the field.

40|$|Strains of Xylella fastidiosa {{isolated}} from grape, almond, maple, and oleander {{were characterized by}} enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-, repetitive extragenic palindromic element (REP) -, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -PCR; contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) gel electrophoresis; plasmid content; and sequencing of the 16 S- 23 S rRNA spacer region. Combining methods gave greater resolution of strain groupings than any single method. Strains {{isolated from}} grape with Pierce's disease (PD) from California, Florida, and Georgia showed greater than previously reported genetic variability, including plasmid contents, but formed a cluster based on analysis of RAPD-PCR products, NotI and SpeI genomic DNA fingerprints, and 16 S- 23 S rRNA spacer region sequence. Two groupings of almond leaf scorch (ALS) strains were distinguished by RAPD-PCR and CHEF gel electrophoresis, but some ALS isolates were clustered within the PD group. RAPD-PCR, CHEF gel electrophoresis, and 16 S- 23 S rRNA sequence analysis produced the same groupings of strains, with RAPD-PCR resolving the greatest genetic differences. Oleander strains, phony peach disease (PP), and oak leaf scorch (OLS) strains were distinct from other strains. DNA profiles constructed by REP-PCR analysis were the same or very similar among all grape strains and most almond strains but different among some almond strains and all other strains tested.

40|$|Within plant {{dispersal}} of Banks grass mite (BGM), Oligonychus pratensis (Banks), and twospotted spider mite (TSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch, was evaluated through field experiments. Mites were introduced onto host plants at three {{levels in the}} canopy: flag leaf, ear leaf and third lowest <b>leaf.</b> <b>Mites</b> introduced onto the flag leaf survived poorly {{and moved to the}} lower parts of the plants. Both BGM and TSM did the best on the middle and lower leaves. TSM was more likely to disperse both upwards and downwards from the infested leaf than BGM. ^ Dispersal behavior of the predatory mite (NEO), Neoseiulus fallacis (Garman), was evaluated by simulating walking patterns for various prey and temperature combinations. The results were that NEO exhibited a random walk type of search more frequently at moderate to high prey densities (search for prey within a prey patch) and a very non-random, directional search more frequently at low prey densities (search for new prey patches). The non-random search allows the mite to closely follow leaf edges and quickly travel substantial distances in search of new prey patches. ^ A simulation model of the mite predator/prey system consisting of BGM and NEO was developed and validated. This model included the effects of temperature, humidity and predation and was coupled to a detailed plant canopy model. Results demonstrated the importance of using leaf surface conditions instead of weather station conditions to simulate the mite system on corn in Nebraska. Also, humidity was determined to be critically important (in addition to temperature) in NEO/BGM population dynamics. The temperature and humidity at the leaf surface of moderately drought stressed corn (compared to well watered corn) resulted in higher populations of BGM. Simulation studies also showed that colonization of a corn field by less than 1 adult female BGM/plant in June can result in crop destruction by August. ...|$|R
40|$|Xylella fastidiosa is a {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} leaf scorch and related diseases in over 100 plant species, including Pierce's disease in grapevines (PD), phony peach disease (PP), <b>plum</b> <b>leaf</b> scald (PLS), and leaf scorch in almond (ALS), oak (OAK), and oleander (OLS). We used a high-resolution DNA sequence approach {{to investigate the}} evolutionary relationships, geographic variation, and divergence times among the X. fastidiosa isolates causing these diseases in North America. Using a large data set of 10 coding loci and 26 isolates, the phylogeny of X. fastidiosa defined three major clades. Two of these clades correspond to the recently identified X. fastidiosa subspecies piercei (PD and some ALS isolates) and X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex (OAK, PP, PLS, and some ALS isolates). The third clade grouped all of the OLS isolates into a genetically distinct group, named X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi. These well-differentiated clades indicate that, historically, X. fastidiosa has been a clonal organism. Based on their synonymous-site divergence (∼ 3 %), these three clades probably originated more than 15, 000 years ago, long before {{the introduction of the}} nonnative plants that characterize most infections. The sister clades of X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi and X. fastidiosa subsp. piercei have synonymous-site evolutionary rates 2. 9 times faster than X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex, possibly due to generation time differences. Within X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex, a low level (∼ 0. 1 %) of genetic differentiation indicates the recent divergence of ALS isolates from the PP, PLS, and OAK isolates due to host plant adaptation and/or allopatry. The low level of variation within the X. fastidiosa subsp. piercei and X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi clades, despite their antiquity, suggests strong selection, possibly driven by host plant adaptation...|$|R

This study aimed to analyze the capture rate of Cicadellinae at higher and lower portion of the vegetative strata in two plum orchards variety ?Letícia?. The orchards (1 ha each, containing 10 years old plants) were located in the municipality of Videira, state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Sampling was carried out from December 2010 to December 2012 using yellow sticky cards (8. 5 x 11. 5 cm), installed in 10 equidistant points (35 x 35 m). At each point, two traps were installed and replaced monthly; low (B) at 0. 5 m above the ground and high (A) at 1. 7 m above the ground. During the survey, 25 species were identified, included in 18 genera: Cicadellini - Bucephalogonia sp.; B. xanthophis; Caragonalia carminata; Diedrocephala sp.; D. variegata; Dilobopterus costalimai; D. dispar; Erythrogonia dorsalis; Hortensia similis; Macugonalia sp.; M. cavifrons; M. leucomelas; Pawiloma victima; Parathona gratiosa; Sibovia sagata; Spinagonalia rubrovittata; Tettisama quinquemaculata and Torresabela fairmairei; Proconiini - Aulacizes sp.; A. obsoleta; Homalodisca ignorata; Molomea personata; Oncometopia facialis; O. fusca and Phera carbonaria.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that pest species diversity enhances biological pest control with generalist predators, we studied the dynamics of three major pest species on greenhouse cucumber: Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), and two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch {{in combination with the}} predator species Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot. When spider mites infested plants prior to predator release, predatory mites were not capable of controlling spider mite populations in the absence of other pest species. A laboratory experiment showed that predators were hindered by the webbing of spider mites. In a greenhouse experiment, spider <b>mite</b> <b>leaf</b> damage was lower in the presence of thrips and predators than in the presence of whiteflies and predators, but damage was lowest in the presence of thrips, whiteflies and predators. Whitefly control was also improved in the presence of thrips. The lower levels of spider <b>mite</b> <b>leaf</b> damage probably resulted from (1) a strong numerical response of the predator (up to 50 times higher densities) when a second and third pest species were present in addition to spider mites, and (2) from A. swirskii attacking mobile spider mite stages outside or near the edges of the spider mite webbing. Interactions of spider mites with thrips and whiteflies might also result in suppression of spider mites. However, when predators were released prior to spider mite infestations in the absence of other pest species, but with pollen as food for the predators, we found increased suppression of spider mites with increased numbers of predators released, confirming the role of predators in spider mite control. Thus, our study provides evidence that diversity of pest species can enhance biological control through increased predator densitie...|$|R
