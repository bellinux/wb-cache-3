50|$|Historically, the {{securities}} lending {{market has been}} a very manually intensive one, with <b>post-trade</b> <b>processing</b> involving many man hours of effort. In recent years, various vendors have appeared to help provide much needed automation in the industry. The market leader in Europe for <b>post-trade</b> <b>processing,</b> Pirum, has been providing such automation services to its clients since 2000, more recently working with Eurex on automating CCP services. With pressures in the industry driving for more transparency and balance sheet optimisation since the global financial crisis of 2008 many more technology vendors are creating solutions to meet the impending regulations.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, Edelstein was {{recruited}} by Thomson Financial, {{which was in}} the early stages of developing straight-through processing systems for equity market investors. He was named president and CEO of its newly established <b>post-trade</b> <b>processing</b> business, Thomson Financial Electronic Settlements Group. In that role, Edelstein eventually succeeded in securing an SEC ruling to overturn a longstanding New York Stock Exchange rule that had given the Depository Trust & Clearing Company (“DTCC”) a monopoly on equity trade confirmation services. Thomson’s electronic network replaced the industry’s paper-based processes to enable speedy, efficient, straight-through transaction processing. In 2000, the Boston Globe estimated that Edelstein's Thomson Financial Electronic Settlements Group was responsible for processing one third of the world's daily stock transactions. A year later, Edelstein orchestrated the merger of Thomson's trade confirmation business with a subsidiary of the DTCC to create the new company, Omgeo, which was the first commercial provider of such services. In 2003, Edelstein became president and CEO of Radianz, a joint venture of Reuters and Equant that operated a financial industry telecommunications platform. The company had not yet turned a profit at the time, and Edelstein redefined the Equant's mandate to embrace an early version of cloud computing. After bringing Radianz to profitability, Edelstein facilitated the sale of the company to BT Group, which then named Edelstein CEO of BT Radianz.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a working}} paper: SWIFT Institute Working Paper No. 2015 - 007. This paper reports {{the outcome of}} a series of {{interviews}} and focus group meetings with professionals working in <b>post-trade</b> <b>processing</b> and the provision of mutual distributed ledger services. The objective was to elicit and document views on three research hypotheses about the potential impact of mutual distributed ledger technology (‘blockchain’) on <b>post-trade</b> <b>processing</b> global securities markets. These hypotheses are (a) on the appropriate access to mutual distributed ledger; (b) on whether change would be piecemeal or ‘big bang’; and (c) {{on the extent to which}} applying mutual distributed ledger in securities settlement would require major changes in business processes. Our research finds that while the use of blockchain to validate operational data in mutual distributed ledgers can yield substantial reductions in both cost and risk, the concept of data sharing itself is far from new. Current interest in mutual distributed ledgers has established significant momentum, but there is a danger of building unrealistic expectations of the extent to which the technology on its own will address the underlying need for co-ordination of business processes both within and between firms. Achieving all the potential benefits from mutual distributed ledgers will require board level buy-in to a substantial commitment of time and resource, and active regulatory support for process reform, with relatively little short term payoff...|$|E

40|$|As recent {{experience}} all too clearly demonstrates, liquid markets {{do not exist}} for all financial assets at all times. In some respects, this {{can be thought of}} as a market failure. This paper addresses how best to promote asset market liquidity given this market failure, and the appropriate balance between the private and public sectors in establishing arrangements for dealing with liquidity problems. There are three main conclusions. First, improvements in the financial infrastructure – including arrangements for disclosure and <b>post-trade</b> <b>processing</b> – have a role to play in limiting the sharp rise in information asymmetries that can occur when conditions in financial markets are strained and at turning points in the financial cycle. Second, recent events have shown up shortcomings in the way that financial institutions manage their own liquidity, and these shortcomings need addressing. Third, it may be welfare-improving for the public sector to provide liquidity services when liquidity is strained. The central bank can smooth liquidity over the cycle, and the public sector can facilitate the change of ownership of assets from a troubled institution, which in extremis may include the public sector buying assets outright. If the public sector does actively provide liquidity services, then arrangements need to be put in place to ensure that the potential welfare gains from doing so are not undermined by financial institutions taking on greater risk than is warranted. asset market liquidity; central bank market operations; lender of last resort...|$|E
