40|$|Text in EnglishIn South Africa, {{retention}} of newly qualified <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> {{in public health}} institutions upon completion of their year of compulsory remunerated community service remains a challenge that exacerbates the shortage of <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> in these institutions. The literature indicates that many newly qualified <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> leave the public health institutions {{due to lack of}} professional development support and heavy workloads while they are still finding their feet. A mixed-methods design of concurrent triangulation approach was used to answer the question: How are the newly qualified <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> supported in terms of induction and professional development during community service in South Africa? Triangulation was achieved by using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Induction/orientation documents from public health institutions were analysed using a checklist. A survey questionnaire with mixed quantitative closed items (1 – 43) and qualitative open-ended questions (43 – 46) was sent to newly qualified <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> who had recently completed community service. Focus groups held with operational nurse managers and individual interviews with coordinators of community service for nurses yielded rich qualitative data. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to describe and synthesise data. The qualitative findings confirmed the quantitative findings. Findings were lack of professional development support in some public health institutions, informal, non-comprehensive support where given, shortage of experienced <b>professional</b> <b>nurses,</b> reluctance by some <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> and operational nurse managers to supervise newly qualified nurses, and increased workload due to the shortage of experienced <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> in the public health institutions. Inadequate clinical skills, poor discipline and lack of professionalism in the newly qualified <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> also played a part. Respondents suggested constructive recommendations for the induction and professional development support of the newly qualified <b>professional</b> <b>nurses,</b> and these were incorporated in the recommended guidelines for the induction and professional development support of newly qualified <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> during community service.

The performance of health care workers, including <b>professional</b> <b>nurses,</b> link closely to the productivity and quality of care provision within health care organisations. It was important to identify factors influencing the performance of <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> if the quality of health care delivery was to improved. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to identify factors affecting the performance of <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> in Namibia. Method: A quantitative, descriptive survey was used to collect data by means of a questionnaire. A random sample of 180 <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> was selected from six hospitals in three regions of Namibia. Results: Factors affecting the performance of nurses negatively were identified such as: lack of recognition of employees who are performing well, quality performance outcomes and an absence of a formal performance appraisal system and poor working conditions. Various factors contribute to both the positive and negative performance of <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> in Namibia. Strategies were developed for addressing the negative factors that could positively affect the performance of <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> in Namibia. Conclusions: This study emphasises the importance of developing strategies to promote the performance of nurses; build knowledge and expertise; develop mechanisms for improving the performance of nurses; expand leadership and management capacity; and generate information and knowledge through research. </p...|$|R

The world here, the world to come, were all too dark, too confused, to enable her to bear such a doom. She saw her peril in her mother's face; in the reiterated visits of the medical man, whom she no longer spurned; in the calling in of the Avoncester physician; in the introduction of a <b>professional</b> <b>nurse,</b> and the strong and agonizing measures to which she had to submit, every time with the sensation that the suffering could not possibly be greater without exceeding the powers of endurance.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010 Research {{on human}} {{resilience}} {{has attempted to}} uncover how certain individuals, even when faced with adverse working conditions can bounce back without serious psychological harm and continue their development. There is a paucity {{of information on the}} concept resilience as it pertains to <b>professional</b> <b>nurses.</b> Relevant information in this regard can equip nurses who are fleeing the profession, or who are becoming physically or mentally ill because they are not coping. Information on the prevalence of resilience in <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> and {{a better understanding of the}} coping skills and resilient adaptations of identified resilient <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> can lead to the formulation of guidelines with strategies for interventions that can facilitate growth in <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> and be of benefit to the health care service. This research investigated the prevalence of resilience in <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> and listened to the stories of identified resilient <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> in order to get a better understanding of their coping skills and resilient adaptations. The data was used to formulate broad guidelines with specific strategies that can be used by hospital managers for in-service training purposes and other programs to facilitate growth in <b>professional</b> <b>nurses.</b> The research was conducted in South Africa amongst nurses in private and public hospitals in the following suburban areas: Potchefstroom, Carletonvi 1 le, Randfontein and Krugersdorp. A sequential exploratory design was used where one phase is followed by another phase: the first phase was quantitative research conducted with validated psychometric instruments measuring aspects of resilience, namely: The Mental Health Continuum, The Coping Self-efficacy Scale, Sense of Coherence Scale, The Adult Dispositional Hope Scale. The Life Orientation Test-Revised, The Resilience Scale, and The General Health Questionnaire. The second phase was qualitative and explored the stories of the resilient <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> by requesting them to write their stories on how they manage to stay resilient and compassionate in the profession followed by focus group interviews also with resilient nurses. The prevalence of resilience in the <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> in the first phase indicated the following: 10 % with low resilience, 47 % as moderate and 43 % with high resilience, but with mostly negative feelings toward the profession and with many considering leaving their current job. The stories followed by focus group interviews with resilient <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> produced useful data that could be used to formulate guidelines with strategies for interventions to facilitate and enhance resilience and psycho-social well-being in <b>professional</b> <b>nurses</b> thereby improving the nursing profession and health care service overall.
