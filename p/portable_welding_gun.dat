40|$|Accutron Tool & Instrument Co. 's welder was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} tool specifically for joining parts made of plastic or composite materials in any atmosphere to include the airless environment of space. Developers decided on induction or magnetic heating to avoid causing deformation and it {{also can be used}} with almost any type of thermoplastic material. Induction coil transfers magnetic flux through the plastic to a metal screen that is sandwiched between the sheets of plastic to be joined. When welder is energized, alternating current produces inductive heating on the screen causing the adjacent plastic surfaces to melt and flow into the mesh, creating a bond on the total surface area. Dave Brown, owner of Great Falls Canoe and Kayak Repair, Vienna, VA, uses a special repair technique based on operation of the Induction Toroid Welder to fix canoes. Whitewater canoeing poses the problem of frequent gashes that are difficult to repair. The main reason is that many canoes are made of plastics.

40|$|AbstractManual {{spot welding}} loses the {{comparison}} with automated spot welding, {{not because of}} a higher execution time, but due to an inferior quality of welded points, mostly a low repeatability. It is not a human fault. Human welder is compelled to operate without having at disposal the knowledge of significant process features that are known by the robot: exact position of the welding spot, electric parameters to be adopted for every specific point, quality of the welded spot and, based on it, possible need for repetition of a defective weld. The research shows that, using an augmented reality device, {{it is possible to}} display this very data to the human operator, in order to enhance the manual process execution. The adopted device is a tablet mounted on the <b>welding</b> <b>gun.</b> It displays the working area seen by the built-in camera.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the effect}} of gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (GTAW) parameters on the pitting corrosion on AISI 202 chromium manganese stainless steel was investigated. An empirical mathematical equation correlating pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN) with the welding parameters such as welding current, <b>welding</b> speed, <b>welding</b> <b>gun</b> angle and gas flow rate was developed. Central composite response surface methodology with four parameter and five levels was employed for conducting the experiments. The adequacy of the developed model was checked using ANOVA. The main effects of the process parameters on PREN of the welded joints were studied using surface and contour plots. The quality of the weld joint is also highly influenced by the microstructure of the weldment. The quality of the weldment gets deteriorated due to metallurgical changes such as micro-segregation, precipitation of secondary phases, presence of porosities, grain growth in the heat affected zone and loss of material by vaporization. This paper also investigates the influence of <b>welding</b> <b>gun</b> angle on the microstructure examination of the weldment. The microstructure study concentrated on the grain structure, presence of carbides and formation of ferrite, austenite and martensite in the weldment. The results obtained from the present investigation helps in quickly selecting the required process parameters to achieve the desired PREN and weld quality...|$|R

500|$|The typical GMAW <b>welding</b> <b>gun</b> has {{a number}} of key partsa control switch, a contact tip, a power cable, a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed. The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. [...] A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a water hose is also built into the <b>welding</b> <b>gun,</b> cooling the gun in high heat operations.|$|R
