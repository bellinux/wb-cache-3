50|$|Groups with unshared {{pairs of}} electrons, {{such as the}} amino group of aniline, are {{strongly}} activating and ortho/para-directing by resonance. Such activating groups donate those unshared electrons to the pi system, creating a negative charge on the ortho and <b>para</b> <b>positions.</b> These positions are thus the most reactive towards an electron-poor electrophile. The highest electron density is located on both ortho and <b>para</b> <b>positions,</b> although this increased reactivity might be offset by steric hindrance between substituent and electrophile. The final result of the electrophilic aromatic substitution might thus be hard to predict, and it is usually only established by doing the reaction and determining the ratio of ortho versus para substitution.|$|E

50|$|The triphenylmethyl cation, C(C6H5)3+, is {{especially}} stable because the positive charge can be distributed among 10 {{of the carbon}} atoms (the 3 carbon atoms in the ortho and <b>para</b> <b>positions</b> {{of each of the}} three phenyl groups, plus the central carbon atom). It exists in the compounds triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate (C(C6H5)3PF6) and triphenylmethyl perchlorate (C(C6H5)3ClO4).|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the increased nucleophilic nature of the original ring, when the electrophile attacks the ortho and <b>para</b> <b>positions</b> of aniline, the nitrogen atom can donate electron density to the pi system (forming an iminium ion), giving four resonance structures (as opposed to three in the basic reaction).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Time-resolved laser flash {{spectroscopy}} with transient detection by time-resolved UV-vis, IR, and EPR {{has been}} employed {{to investigate the}} photochemistry and photophysics {{of a series of}} derivatives of 2 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 1 -phenyl propanone, a model photoinitiator for free radical polymer-ization. H, Cl, and F substituents at the <b>para</b> <b>position</b> promote the n,ð * nature of the lowest triplet state and favor fast and efficient R-cleavage from T 1 upon irradiation. In contrast, dimethylamino and thioether substitution in the <b>para</b> <b>position</b> of the benzoyl moiety change the configuration of the lowest triplet states into a ð,ð * and are characterized by a lack of R-cleavage from T 1. Alkoxy substitution in the <b>para</b> <b>position</b> represents an intermediate for which R-cleavage occurs efficiently, but at a relatively slow rate. Alkylation of the 2 -hydroxy group promotes fast R-cleavage upon irradiation (picosecond time scale), in contrast to the analogous ester derivative for which slow cleavage was observed (microsecond time scale). The conclusions are consistent with phosphorescence characterization of the triplet states and are supported by photopolymerization studies...|$|R
50|$|Phenylpyruvate tautomerase {{has also}} been found to exhibit the same keto-enol {{tautomerism}} for 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, which is structurally similar to phenylpyruvate but contains an additional hydroxyl moiety in the <b>para</b> <b>position</b> of the aromatic ring.|$|R
50|$|It is {{typically}} encountered with nitroarenes and especially with nucleophiles, resulting in alkylated arenes: the new substituent {{can take the}} ortho or <b>para</b> <b>positions,</b> reversing the selectivity for the meta position that is usually observed with such compounds under electrophilic substitution. Carbon nucleophiles carry an electron-withdrawing group and a leaving group: the nucleophile attacks the aromatic ring, and excess base can eliminate to form an exocyclic double bond which is successively protonated under acidic conditions, restoring aromaticity.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the factors}} {{contributing}} to the reactivity of 2-nitroaniline is the relative positioning of the nitro and amine groups and their activating/deactivating properties. The nitrogroup is an electron withdrawing group deactivating ortho and <b>para</b> <b>positions.</b> This leaves meta position with electron density {{and more likely to}} undergo substitution. Reinforcing this reactivity, the amino group activates ortho and para with respect to the amine. The net effect is that these sites, which are also meta to the nitro group undergo reactions.|$|E
50|$|Electron {{donating}} {{groups are}} typically {{divided into three}} levels of activating ability. Electron withdrawing groups are assigned to similar groupings. Activating substituents favor electrophilic substitution about the ortho and <b>para</b> <b>positions.</b> Weakly deactivating groups direct electrophiles to attack the benzene molecule at the ortho- and para- positions, while strongly and moderately deactivating groups direct attacks to the meta- position. This is {{not a case of}} favoring the meta- position like para- and ortho- directing functional groups, but rather disfavoring the para- and ortho- positions more than they disfavor the meta- position.|$|E

50|$|The first {{reported}} Claisen rearrangement is the 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangement of an allyl phenyl ether to intermediate 1, which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol.Meta-substitution affects the regioselectivity of this rearrangement. For example, electron withdrawing groups (e.g. bromide) at the meta-position direct the rearrangement to the ortho-position (71% ortho-product), while electron donating groups (e.g. methoxy), direct rearrangement to the para-position (69% para-product). Additionally, presence of ortho-substituents exclusively leads to para-substituted rearrangement products (tandem Claisen and Cope rearrangement).If an aldehyde or carboxylic acid occupies the ortho or <b>para</b> <b>positions,</b> the allyl side-chain displaces the group, releasing it as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Both the regioselectivity—the {{different}} possible arene substitution patterns—and {{the speed}} of an electrophilic aromatic substitution {{are affected by the}} substituents already attached to the benzene ring. In terms of regioselectivity, some groups promote substitution at the ortho or <b>para</b> <b>positions,</b> while other groups increase substitution at the meta position. These groups are called either ortho-para directing or meta directing. In addition, some groups will increase the rate of reaction (activating) while others will decrease the rate (deactivating). While the patterns of regioselectivity can be explained with resonance structures, the influence on kinetics can be explained by both resonance structures and the inductive effect.|$|E

5000|$|Paraquat (trivial name; [...] ) or N,N′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium {{dichloride}} (systematic name) is {{the organic}} compound with the chemical formula (C6H7N)2Cl2. It {{is classified as}} a viologen, a family of redox-active heterocycles of similar structure. Paraquat was manufactured by Chevron. This salt {{is one of the}} most widely used herbicides. It is quick-acting and non-selective, killing green plant tissue on contact. It is also toxic to human beings and animals. It is linked to development of Parkinsons disease. The name is derived from the <b>para</b> <b>positions</b> of the quaternary nitrogens. Quantities are sometimes expressed by cation mass alone (paraquat cation, paraquat ion); other salts (with other anions besides chloride) exist. In fact, its redox activity, which produces superoxide anions, is why it is toxic.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} of pentafluorophenyl derivatives has been long puzzling for its mechanism. Independent of the substituent, they all exhibit an para directing effect. The new introduced group too {{has no effect}} on the directing behaviour. In all cases, a 1,4-disubstituted-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene derivative shows up. Finally, the clue is found not {{in the nature of the}} non-fluorine substituent, but in the fluorines themselves. The π-electropositive effect introduces electrons into the aromatic ring. The non-fluorine substituent is not capable of doing so. As charge accumulates at the ortho and <b>para</b> <b>positions</b> relative to the donating group, the ortho and para-positions relative to the non-fluorine substituent receive less charge, so are less negative or more positive. Furthermore the non-fluorine substituent in general is more bulky than fluorine, so its ortho-positions are sterically shielded, leaving the para-position as the sole reaction site for anionic entering groups.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronegativity}} (withdrawal of electron density) of the halogens present (bromine and fluorine) on 4-bromofluorobenzene cause deactivation of the {{benzene ring}} and direct reactivity to ortho and <b>para</b> <b>positions</b> on the ring. This redirection of reactivity makes it {{useful as a}} precursor other compounds that serve {{a wide variety of}} needs.The bromine on 4-bromofluorobenzene allows it to become a Grignard reagent when reacted with magnesium metal. Preparation of a Grignard reagent using it makes it useful as an intermediate in the synthesis of atypical antipsychotic agents (especially those with a 4-fluorophenyl moiety), and in pesticides such as Flusilazole.This compound is also used as a tuning solution, internal standard, and/or surrogate (a compound that is similar in chemical composition to the analyte(s) of interest and is spiked into environmental and batch quality control samples prior to sample preparation and analysis) in several EPA gas chromatography methods, such as those for drinking water, wastewater pollutants, and organic pollutant monitoring in groundwater, wastewater, and solid waste.|$|E
50|$|The {{intermediate}} of {{the above}} reaction is the di-anion and the stereoelectronic effect that stabilizes this intermediate over {{the other one is}} the fact that the anionic charge at the <b>para</b> <b>position</b> could delocalize to the oxygen atom via orbital interaction: π(benzene) → σ*(O-CH3).|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied by}} tandem mass {{spectrometry}} two isomers of nitro meso-tetraphenylporphyrin, {{one with a}} nitro group in the <b>para</b> <b>position</b> of a phenyl ring {{and the other with}} the same group in a β-pyrrolic position, and their copper complexes. Collisional activation of the molecular ions of both free-base porphyrins and of their copper complexes produces an array of product ions that permit ready differentiation of the two positional isomers. The diagnostic ions, when the nitro group is in a β-pyrrolic position, may be produced through intramolecular and double cyclization processes, triggered by the interaction of the nitro substituent with the neighboring meso-phenyl ring. These diagnostic ions do not form when the nitro group is in the <b>para</b> <b>position.</b> The gas-phase processes have precedents in solution chemistry...|$|R
