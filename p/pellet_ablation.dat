The database represents an international effort to assemble data from several tokamaks of different magnetic configuration and auxiliary heating methods. In the initial configuration, data from JET, Tore Supra, DIII-D, FTU, TFTR, ASDEX-U, JIPP T-IIU, RTP, and T- 10 have been included. The database contains measurements of deuterium and hydrogen <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation,</b> including pellet mass and speed, plasma electron density and temperature profiles, and <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> light emission.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{observation of}} the solid hydrogen <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> has been performed by using a fast stereo imaging camera to investigate the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> dynamics. The initial velocity component of the injected pellet is maintained during ablation in a hot plasma, and the pellet penetrates to the core plasma. On the other hand, {{it has been observed}} that part of high density pellet plasmoid, which is formed around the pellet substance by ablating hydrogen pellet, intermittently breaks away from the pellet ablating position and the breakaway plasmoid is transported across a confinement field. The breakaway plasmoid recurrently develops at the rate of about 100 times per millisecond and it is non-diffusively transported approximately 0. 1 m during its several 10 ?s lifetime in the opposite direction to the pellet motion, namely, toward the low magnetic field side. This observation gives a reasonable explanation for the difference between the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> position and the effective particle deposition profile...|$|E
40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of performance of nuclear fusion plasmas, pellet injection experiments have been actively carried out in many toroidal devices {{in the sense of}} controlling density profile, obtaining high density or improved confinement, and diagnostic purposes. In order to have a common measure of <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation,</b> the regression study has been performed as an international cooperation activity, obtaining "IPAD" (International <b>Pellet</b> <b>Ablation</b> Database) >. However, these are an empirical scaling, and the mechanism of <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> still remains to be studied. According to the code calculations based on a typical <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> model (e. g., so-called the neutral gas shielding model), it is understood that the penetration depth into plasma is always quite sensitive to the pellet size. If the pellet size is too large, the pellet passes through the plasma, and if it is too small, it is trapped at the plasma surface. Also, an effective or suitable range of the pellet size for a certain plasma is generally very narrow, and this range largely varies depending on each plasma size and plasma parameters. Thus, the precise controllability of the pellet size, especially the size controllability with continuously variable system will be quite effective in order to carry out the detailed studies on <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> and associated phenomena. A pellet injector of new type with precisely and continuously controllable system of pellet size is being developed. This has a unique mechanics and structure of producing a frozen pellet in extremely low temperature region. In the device presently developed in this research, we will precisely adjust the length of the cylindrical pellet (Φ 1. 0 mm) from 0. 5 to 3 mm by using the special "length restriction rod". &# 12288;&# 12288...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrated}} model JINTRAC is employed {{to assess the}} dynamic density evolution of the ITER baseline scenario when fuelled by discrete pellets. The consequences on the core confinement properties, α-particle heating due to fusion and {{the effect on the}} ITER divertor operation, taking into account the material limitations on the target heat loads, are discussed within the {{integrated model}}. Using the model one can observe that stable but cyclical operational regimes can be achieved for a pellet-fuelled ITER ELMy H-mode scenario with Q[*][*]=[*][*] 10 maintaining partially detached conditions in the divertor. It is shown that the level of divertor detachment is inversely correlated with the core plasma density due to α-particle heating, and thus depends on the density evolution cycle imposed by <b>pellet</b> <b>ablations.</b> The power crossing the separatrix to be dissipated depends on the enhancement of the transport in the pedestal region being linked with the pressure gradient evolution after pellet injection. The fuelling efficacy of the deposited pellet material is strongly dependent on the E[*][*]×[*][*]B plasmoid drift. It is concluded that integrated models like JINTRAC, if validated and supported by realistic physics constraints, may help to establish suitable control schemes of particle and power exhaust in burning ITER DT-plasma scenarios...|$|R

40|$|In modern tokamak {{experiments}} refueling of plasmas by {{the injection}} of frozen hydrogen isotope pellets is a promising approach. By injecting the pellets from the magnetic high field side (HFS) a grad B induced drift [1] accelerates the deposited material {{toward the center}} of the plasma, hence achieving a higher fuelling efficiency. Therefore the pellet injection system was adapted to HFS in several tokamaks, and this scenario is foreseen to be the main ITER fuelling scheme as well. In order to further improve our understanding of the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> physics and to facilitate future scaling studies for the next generation of tokamaks, an HFS pellet injection database had been developed based on experimental results obtained at the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. The database contains the most relevant pellet and plasma parameters determining the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation,</b> with the aim to complete the already existing international Low Field Side (LFS) database, called the IPADBASE [2].

40|$|Abstract. Excitation of snake {{perturbations}} {{has been}} observed in the core region of pellet-fuelled HL- 1 M plasmas when the pellets cross surface with q value 1. Through measurements of plasma q profile by means of multi-exposures with CCD camera during <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation,</b> and investigation on <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> process, possible mechanisms {{for the formation of}} snake oscillation are discussed. In addition, a large, long-lived snake-like oscillation is frequently observed in lower hybrid current driven discharge in which the sawtooth has been stabilized at early times. There is evidence that such a perturbation is due to impurity accumulation during sawtooth-stabilization, and the good performance with peaking profiles after LHCD is limited by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities including sawtooth and snake activities in HL- 1 M plasma. 1...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} a diploma-thesis investigating {{the possibility of}} q-profile determination at ASDEX Upgrade by observation of <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> by use of a high speed framing camera. The q-profile is correlated to the tokamak's current density profile. Knowledge {{and control of the}} current density profile is of great interest for fusion research, as the profile governes plasma stability and confinement. It is possible to determine the current profile from measurements of the magnetic field. Pellet injection can be applied to visualize the magnetic field lines. The ablated material is ionized. The ionized particles stick to the magnetic field lines, as will be shown in this report. In the early stages the pellet is surrounded by a cold, dense plasma cloud. This cloud contains a small fraction of neutral particles, undergoing collisional excitation and emitting photons. Therefore it is possible to observe this plasma cloud. The inclination angle of the cloud with respect to the torus midplane shows the ratio B_v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l/B_t_o_r_o_i_d_a_l. Only B_v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l {{is a function of the}} current density profile in the plasma, while B_t_o_r_o_i_d_a_l is well known. For the observation of the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> with high temporal resolution a fast-framing camera was used. This camera was installed and brought into operation during the first period of this work. It was possible to observe the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> with high temporal (4 #mu#s) and spatial resolution for a large number (63) of frames. Special software for the analyses of the data has been developed. Different methods of data analysis have been applied in order to detect possible systematic errors in the procedures used. A detailed analysis of the errors will be presented. The results of the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> method will be compared to the results of other measurement techniques 66 refs.

[...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Mathematics, Statistics and PhysicsWe {{implemented}} a rotational cloud {{model for the}} simulation of <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> in a Tokamak reactor.

40|$|A kinetic gasdynamic scaling for {{hydrogen}} <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> {{is obtained}} {{in terms of}} a neutral gas shielding model using both numerical and analytical approaches. The scaling on plasma and pellet parameters proposed in the monoenergy approximation by Milora and Foster dR_pe/dt~S_n^ 2 / 3 R_p^- 2 / 3 q_eo^ 1 / 3 m_i^- 1 / 3 is confirmed. Here R_p is the pellet rsdius, S_n is the optical thickness of a cloud, q_eo is the electron energy flux density and m_i is the molecular mass. Only the numeral factor is approximately two times less than that for the monoenergy approach. Due to this effect, the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> rates, which were obtained by Kuteev {{on the basis of the}} Milora scaling, should be reduced by a factor of 1. 7. Such a modification provides a reasonable agreement (even at high plasma parameters) between the two-dimensional kinetic model and the one-dimensional monoenergy approximation validated in contemporary tokamak experiments. As the cloud (in the kinetic approximation) is significantly thicker than that for the monoenergy case as well as the velocities of the gas flow are much slower, the relative effect of plasma and magnetic shielding on the ablation rate is strongly reduced. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} density {{profiles}} {{observed in the}} Large Helical Device (LHD) have suggested an interesting core impurity transport. The edge impurity transport in the ergodic layer formed by stochastic magnetic field lines with long connection length (10 - 2000 m) can also exhibit interesting phenomena in the competition of perpendicular and parallel transport. The LHD discharge is highly robust against impurity buildup, and operation is possible essentially up to the global power balance limit because current-driven instability does not principally exist. The LHD plasma has therefore provided information on many interesting physics issues closely related to impurities. Recent results of impurity-related physics experiments in the LHD are briefly reviewed. The specific contents presented here are (1) core impurity behavior with perpendicular transport, (2) edge impurity behavior with parallel transport, (3) high-Z discharges with high ion temperature, (4) impurity pellet injection with improved plasma performance, (5) impurity <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> {{in the presence of}} energetic ions with high heat flux and (6) observation of magnetic dipole forbidden transitions for high-Z elements.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} hydrogen <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation,</b> a novel method of high-speed imaging spectroscopy {{has been used in}} the Large Helical Device (LHD) for identifying the internal distribution of the electron density and temperature of the plasma cloud surrounding the pellet. This spectroscopic system consists of a five-branch fiberscope and a fast camera, with each objective lens having a different narrow-band optical filter for the hydrogen Balmer lines and the background continuum radiation. The electron density and temperature in the plasma cloud are obtained, with a spatial resolution of about 6 mm and a temporal resolution of 5 × 10 ? 5 ?s, from the intensity ratio measured through these filters. To verify the imaging, the average electron density and temperature also have been measured from the total emission by using a photodiode, showing that both density and temperature increase with time during the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation.</b> The electron density distribution ranging from 1022 to 1024 ?m? 3 and the temperature distribution around 1 eV have been observed via imaging.

This means that the plasmoid drifts to the lower field side in the former and to the higher field side in the latter.

The crucial diagnostic in these experiments is the Thomson scattering system, with a radial resolution of 1 % of the minor radius.

The Ar <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> is typically found to be much larger than expected from the thermal plasma electron temperature alone; the additional ablation is interpreted as being due to non-thermal runaway electrons (REs) formed during the pellet-induced temperature collapse. Simple estimates of the RE seed current using the enhanced ablation rate give values of order 1 - 10 kA, roughly consistent with estimates based on avalanche theory.

40|$|From {{the results}} of the {{simulation}} study including <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> and 1 -D transport code, it is found that a high speed pellet injector with pellet velocity of more than 3 km/s is necessary for the penetration of the pellet with diameter of 3 mm into the core region under the expected plasma condition of Large Helical Device (LHD) of heliotron/stellarator type with superconducting coils at NIFS in Japan. Therefore, a two stage pellet injector was constructed and tested successfully in order to obtain the pellet velocity range of 3 km/s. Based upon the above results, a high speed flexible multiple-pellet injection system "HIPEL" for LHD is proposed. HIPEL consists of independent (1) 10 two-stage gun barrels and (2) 10 single-stage gun barrels.

40|$|A {{kinetic model}} for {{depletion}} effect, which determines <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> when the pellet passes a rational magnetic surface, is formulated. The model predicts a moderate decrease of the ablation rate {{compared with the}} earlier considered monoenergy versions [1, 2]. For typical T- 10 conditions the ablation rate reduces {{by a factor of}} 2. 5 when the 1 -mm pellet penetrates through the plasma center. A substantial deceleration of pellets -about 15 % per centimeter of low shire rational q region; is predicted. Penetration for Low Field Side and High Field Side injections is considered taking into account modification of the electron distribution function by toroidal magnetic field. It is shown that Shafranov shift and toroidal effects yield the penetration length for HFS injection higher by a factor of 1. 5.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} hydrodynamic simulation code CAP {{has been}} developed in order to investigate the dynamics of hydrogenic <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> in magnetized plasmas throughout their temporal evolution. One of {{the properties of the}} code is that it treats the solid-to-gas phase change at the pellet surface without imposing artificial boundary conditions there, as done in previous ablation models. The simulation includes multispecies atomic processes, mainly molecular dissociation and thermal ionization in the ablation flow beyond the pellet, with a kinetic heat flux model. It was found that ionization causes the formation of a quasistationary shock front in the supersonic region of the ablation flow, followed by a "second" sonic surface farther out. Anisotropic heating, due to the directionality of the magnetic field, contributes to a nonuniform ablation (recoil) pressure distribution over the pellet surface. Since the shear stress can exceed the yield strength of the solid for a sufficiently high heat flux, the solid pellet can be fluidized and flattened into a "pancake" shape while the pellet is ablating and losing mass. The effect of pellet deformation can shorten the pellet lifetime almost 3 × from that assuming the pellet remains rigid and stationary during ablation...|$|E
40|$|Peaked density {{profiles}} may {{not only}} improve confinement properties, but also give the additional benefits of increased fusion production and ignition margin in BPX, {{as shown in}} Fig. 8. 1. The ability to control density profiles in the core and scrape-off regions is governed {{by a number of}} both physics and operational considerations that make it difficult to specify optimized fueling systems. For this reason, the fueling systems for BPX are designed to maximize flexibility, allowing operation to determine optimal scenarios. After listing some of the issues impacting fueling assessments, we present the latest information on <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> and penetration and then give example fueling scenarios. Some degree of external control over the density profile in the core can be achieved through pellet injection, but recycle and other plasma edge physics limit the degree of control that is possible.

40|$|A new pellet {{injection}} system was installed at JET designed for both fuelling and ELM pacing. The {{purpose of the}} pacing section was to validate pellet ELM pacing as a suitable tool for ELM mitigation in ITER. Pellet pacing was confirmed at the large size scale of JET. The dynamics of triggered ELMs was investigated {{with respect to their}} spontaneous counterparts. Triggered ELMs show features also typical for spontaneous ELMs in several operational regimes. Since none of these regimes was unsettled by the pellets this is a strong hint for compatibility with other plasma control tools. Observations and modelling results indicate the ELM triggering occurs by the evolution of the <b>pellet</b> <b>ablation</b> plasmoid into the first ELM filament followed by a poloidal spread of the instability. An ELM obviously can be forced by a pellet due to the strong local perturbation imposed already under unusual onset conditions but then evolves like any ELM typical for the corresponding plasma regime. For tool optimization the pellet mass and hence the convective confinement losses imposed have to be minimized. In our experiments, a lower mass threshold was observed for the first time. It has been found that to reliably trigger an ELM the pellet needs to be sufficiently large (and fast) to penetrate close to the pedestal top. Recent investigations are clear steps forward to validate the pellet pacing approach for ITER...|$|E
