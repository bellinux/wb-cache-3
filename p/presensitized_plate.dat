The use of such a plate greatly simplifies flexographic platemaking by reducing the process to a level {{similar to that of}} a <b>presensitized</b> <b>plate</b> for offset lithography. A series of experiments were conducted {{to determine whether or not}} there were significant differences in the areas of half tone dots in different areas of the tonal scale on different types of flexographic plate materials all made from a single negative with a specially designed test object on it. Assuming significant differences were found in the dot areas among the various plates, we further wished to discover whether or not these differences would have a significant effect on the tones printed from these plates or whether differences would be overshadowed by the multitude of other press variables. Differences in the areas of halftone dots among the different types of printing plates were confirmed at the 95 % level of statistical significance. Further, these differences were detectable in printed reproductions made from these plates, although other variables of flexographic printing had a much greater confirmed influence on tone reproduction...|$|E
5000|$|Screenless {{lithography}} is a reprographic {{technique for}} halftoning dating to 1855, when the French chemist and civil engineer Alphonse Poitevin discovered the light-sensitive properties of bichromated gelatin and invented both the photolithography and collotype processes. After {{the invention of}} the halftone screen in the 1880s, screenless lithography was abandoned. Until the end of World War II, two kinds of photomechanically made plates were used in lithography: albumin plates and deep-etch <b>plates.</b> <b>Presensitized</b> <b>plates</b> appeared in the 1950s, and wipe-on plates appeared in the 1960s.|$|R

This paper wilt discuss the steps invotved in making surface, deep-etch, hard metal, and wipe-plates and those chemicals that are conunmly used. It dl 1 also cover methods by which printing shops can pretreat their wastes before the wastes are discharged into sewer Zines or otherwise disposed of. Although there are many <b>presensitized</b> <b>plates</b> on the market today, this paper will concern itself mainly with surface, deep-etch, hard metal, and wipe-on plates. A step-by-step description of how each type of plate is processed will show us which chemicals are involved. Surface plates, like deep-etch plates, are made of either zinc or aluminum. In the making of a surface plate, the plate is coate...|$|R

The Stouffer scale or the sensitivity guide is used to measure this dark reaction which takes place also as a result of high temperature and relative humidity. If there is much dark reaction taking place, more solid steps will show up on a negative working plate. For the purpose of this experiment diazo and photopolymer presensitised, negative working, lithographic plates were chosen. These plates were cut into small sections to eliminate plate variables. They were then subjected to different levels of temperature and relative humidity in a temperature controllable oven. The relative humidity being controlled by using various super- saturated salt solutions. A light integrator was used to expose the plates to the same amount of light energy, with a sensitivity guide. The plates were then developed by hand and the critical or solid step determined visually to measure the dark reaction undergone by the plates due to variations in temperature, relative humidity, and time. With the results obtained curves were drawn to study the relationship between dark reaction and temperature, dark reaction and relative humidity, and dark reaction and time. The curves show an increase in dark reaction with an increase in temperature, relative humidity, and time in the case of diazo plates. The photopolymer plates, on the other hand, seemed to be more stable at higher temperatures, but a high relative humidity destroys the plate coating. A statistical analyses was done on the results and the percentage dependence of dark reaction on temperature, relative humidity, and time were determined. It is concluded that dark reaction does occur in diazo and photopolymer <b>presensitized</b> <b>plates.</b> And that these plates would last longer if stored under the optimum temperature and relative humidity as suggested by analyzing the data. The results obtained disprove the assumption that photopolymer <b>presensitized</b> <b>plates</b> are not influenced by temperature and relative humidity...|$|R
