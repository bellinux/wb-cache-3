40|$|In plant factories, {{plants are}} usually {{cultivated}} in nutrient solution under a controllable environment. Plant quality and growth are closely monitored and precisely controlled. For plant growth evaluation, plant weight {{is an important}} and commonly used indicator. Traditional plant weight measurements are destructive and laborious. In order to measure and record the plant weight during plant growth, an automated measurement system was designed and developed herein. The weight measurement system comprises a weight measurement device and an imaging system. The weight measurement device consists of a top disk, a bottom disk, a <b>plant</b> <b>holder</b> and a load cell. The load cell with a resolution of 0. 1 g converts the plant weight on the <b>plant</b> <b>holder</b> disk to an analogue electrical signal for a precise measurement. The top disk and bottom disk {{are designed to be}} durable for different plant sizes, so plant weight can be measured continuously throughout the whole growth period, without hindering plant growth. The results show that plant weights measured by the weight measurement device are highly correlated with the weights estimated by the stereo-vision imaging system; hence, plant weight can be measured by either method. The weight growth of selected vegetables growing in the National Taiwan University plant factory were monitored and measured using our automated plant growth weight measurement system. The experimental results demonstrate the functionality, stability and durability of this system. The information gathered by this weight system can be valuable and beneficial for hydroponic plants monitoring research and agricultural research applications...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{the first comprehensive}} account of the Peruvian expropriation of the Tarapaca nitrate industry from its origins in 1870 - 1875 to its conclusion in 1879. The data on sellers of nitrate <b>plants,</b> <b>holders</b> of production contracts, and quotations of the nitrate bonds furnished in payment for the plants included in this work had been missing from prior, sketchy accounts of the expropriation. The sharp and protracted domestic debate in Peru over the scheme, both prior to and during the operation, presented here in detail, has never been noted or analyzed before. The parallel history of the Antofagasta Company, a Chilean-British nitrate company competing with Tarapaca at the time, is described here based on the previously unavailable correspondence of the local manager in Antofagasta. The main contribution of this thesis is its reinterpretation {{of the origins of}} the expropriation, as well as its impact on the Antofagasta Company in particular and Chilean interests in general. The ostensible justification of the Peruvian Government for launching the operation was to curtail nitrate exports in order to allow larger guano sales at higher prices, a goal viewed as both commendable and feasible by virtually all authors dealing with the issue. This account shows that it was demonstrably impossible for Peru to control the world supply of sodium nitrate at the time because it had ceased to be the sole exporter of the product after the Antofagasta Company started operating in 1872. It is also documented {{here for the first time}} that the local opposition repeatedly cautioned that any attempt at restricting Tarapaca nitrate exports would only end up increasing the share of the market held by the rival Antofagasta Company. The conclusion of this work is that the Peruvian Government had a second, thinly veiled, agenda in proposing the purchase of the Tarapaca nitrate industry, namely to secure a new overseas loan to pursue railroad construction, imperiled by the 1876 default of the country on its foreign debt. It also demonstrates that the Antofagasta Company, as well as other emerging Chilean nitrate regions, viewed the operation as extremely favourable for them. The latter conclusion refutes the notion that the expropriation was a nationalistic measure negatively affecting Chilean interests...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2002. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{table grape}} {{industry}} is {{a major contributor to}} the South African economy, directly through foreign earnings from this predominantly export-based industry, as well as indirectly through the employment of thousands of people. It is a growing industry and consists of several production areas. The fastest growing table grape production area in South Africa is the Lower Orange River area, which produces some of the earliest grapes in the Southern Hemisphere. The biggest river in South Africa irrigates this area and it has an extreme climate characteristic of semi-desert areas. This area is considered to be optimal for the production of high quality, early, white seedless grapes. Previously, this area was predominantly planted to Sultanina vines for the purpose of raisin production. When seedless table grapes became a consumer preference, the producers very successfully converted their production practices to yield export quality seedless grapes from the established Sultanina vineyards. Extensive new plantings as well as re-plantings occurred in this area, also including newer cultivars from local and overseas breeding programmes. Being a viticultural and economical hot-spot, the Lower Orange River area is attracting much attention as a table grape production area and it also formed the backdrop to this study. The cultivar profile is changing in the area and it is projected that Sultana-, Regal-, Prime Seedless and Sugraone will be the four major early, white seedless cultivars in 2005. Based on this knowledge and prompted by a lack of information regarding production costs and general profitability of the new cultivars, this study was initiated {{in the form of a}} comparative analysis between the four mentioned cultivars spanning the early, middle and late regions of the Lower Orange River area. The approach used extracted information regarding cultural input costs (specifically labour as man-hours and the consequent costs) per manipulation performed in the vineyards. This approach is different from the more general method of obtaining input costs for a specific area based on combined mean values, often not distinguishing between cultivars. The specific aims of the study included a comparative analysis of input costs for production cultural practices per main manipulation action, as well as a comparative analysis taking into account productivity, value and extraordinary costs related to each of the four cultivars. To this end, 22 experimental plots were identified for use in the study. Collaboration of the production managers of each of the experimental plots were procured and information regarding production costs per manipulation and productivity of each cultivar and experimental plot were extracted from their own record keeping systems or from documents provided to the production managers. The value (price achieved) of the various cultivars for the 2001 / 2002 table grape season were put into perspective by using data from a survey which included information regarding payments for the various cultivars during the season in the Lower Orange River area. Information regarding fruit and vine royalties was obtained from the various <b>plant</b> breeders' rights <b>holders</b> of the various cultivars, where applicable. Primary descriptions of each experimental plot concerning general cultivation practices and information regarding the specific season were used to qualify results obtained from the various blocks. Several complicating factors impacted on the study and specifically the subsequent analyses of the results. Some of the factors were already identified as complicating factors in the planning stage of the study and were mostly linked to the recent introduction of two of the cultivars to the Orange River area. From the data gathered and the analyses performed it became clear that it would be difficult to discern significant differences (where significant is defined as PS 0. 10), but clear trends were observed and indications obtained. Based on the input cost analyses of this study it is proposed that mature Prime Seedless will have the highest labour input and cultural production cost of the four cultivars, followed by Sugraone. The labour input and the cost for the production cultural practices studied for young Prime Seedless vines were very high in comparison to the mature Sultana Seedless and Sugraone vines, especially for the canopy management and bunch manipulation actions. Prime Seedless was especially prone to the set of small and uneven berries, which lead to very high labour input requirements and subsequent cost for bunch manipulations. Sugraone is also known for the set of small and uneven berries in the Lower Orange River area, especially in difficult climatic seasons, also requiring high labour input for bunch manipulations. The initial indication is that mature Sultana- and Regal Seedless will require similar labour inputs for cultural production practices. The fact that Regal Seedless does not require expensive gibberellic acid (GA) applications, or girdling for thinning and berry enlargement purposes, is a tremendous advantage from a production cost point of view. Accordingly, initial indications are that Regal Seedless will have the lowest cultural production cost of the four cultivars. Regal Seedless was prone to the set of uneven berries during the year of study and accordingly it is suspected that this factor will ultimately determine the labour requirements and cultural production input cost, especially in difficult climatic seasons. The labour input and ultimately the cultural production cost for Sultana Seedless will be determined by the correct timing and concentration of the GA applications for thinning and berry sizing. Sultana Seedless and Sugraone produced high yields during the 2001 / 2002 table grape season in the Lower Orange River area. Yield information from the various experimental plots confirmed that there is little to choose between the two cultivars in terms of yield when cultivation conditions and practices are optimal. Large variation was observed in the yield results from the Regal- and Prime Seedless experimental plots. This is largely due to the recent introduction of the cultivars to the area and the consequent scarcity of blocks of these cultivars that are in full production. It was impossible to identify clear trends in terms of the future productivity of mature Regal- and Prime Seedless, but some indications of labour inputs could be extracted and qualified. Early maturing Prime Seedless and Sugraone performed very well in terms of price, especially in the harvest period prior to week 50. This advantage of high prices early in the season is, however, not always applicable to early cultivars in the later maturing regions of the Lower Orange River area. Later during the season, after week 50, when the supply of table grapes to the overseas markets has increased sharply, Sultana Seedless is usually the best performer in terms of price of the four cultivars. The ultimate price obtained by a cultivar is to a large extent determined by supply and demand, quality and acceptance of the specific cultivar. This study and its outcomes have a strong regional (Lower Orange River) and local (South Africa) impact and the specific results will undoubtedly be valuable to the producers, exporters and other role-players with vested interest in the cultivars studied or in table grape production per se. The methodology adopted in this study, however, is of broader interest and dearly shows the advantage of having detailed and qualified information regarding cultivation practices and bringing it in relation to the labour and consequent costs required per action. This should lead to more business intelligence and realistic planning on the producer side when decisions regarding the choice of a cultivar for a specific production area with a particular marketing scope have to be made. This study has also paved the way for similar studies, specifically with regard to the detailed description of the methodology that was established. Knowledge of the problems experienced in this study provides a useful reference for the planning and execution of similar studies. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die tafeldruifindustrie dra grootskaals by tot die Suid- Afrikaanse ekonomie: regstreeks deur middel van buitelandse valuta vanaf hierdie hoofsaaklik uitvoer-gebaseerde industrie, asook indirek deur werkverskaffing aan duisende mense. Dit is 'n vinnig groeiende industrie en bestaan uit verskeie produksie-areas waarvan die Benede-Oranjerivierarea, waar van die vroegste druiwe in die suidelike halfrond geproduseer word, tans die meeste groei toon. Die grootste rivier in Suid-Afrika vloei deur hierdie gebied wat deur uiterste klimaatstoestande, soortgelyk aan die van semi-woestyngebiede, gekenmerk word. Hierdie gebied is baie gunstig vir die produksie van hoë-gehalte, vroeë, wit pitlose druiwe. In die verlede is hoofsaaklik Sultanina vir die produksie van rosyne in hierdie gebied verbou. Namate pitlose tafeldruiwe voorkeur begin geniet het onder verbruikers wêreldwyd, het produseerders in die area hul verbouingspraktyke suksesvol aangepas vir die produksie van uitvoergehalte tafeldruiwe vanaf die grootskaalse, reeds gevestigde Sultanina-wingerde. Uitgebreide aanplantings en heraanplantings, wat nuwe cultivars van plaaslike en oorsese teelprogramme ingesluit het, is in hierdie gebied gedoen. Die vinnige groei in tafeldruifaanplantings en -uitvoere, asook die ekonomiese impak van die industrie in die Benede-Oranjeriviergebied, het die afgelope aantal jaar sterk op die voorgrond getree en het gevolglik gedien as agtergrond vir hierdie studie. Die cultivarprofiel in dié area is besig om te verander en volgens vooruitskattings gaan Sultana, Regal, Prime Seedless en Sugraone die vier prominente vroeë, wit, pitlose tafeldruifcultivars in 2005 wees.
