5000|$|What {{the name}} of the goddess means remains uncertain. One recent {{suggestion}} by Stephen Quirke (Ancient Egyptian Religion) explains it as meaning [...] "She of the ointment jar". This ties in with the observation that her name was written with the hieroglyph for ointment jar (bꜣs) and that she was associated with <b>protective</b> <b>ointments,</b> among other things. The name of the material known as [...] might, through Greek, come from {{the name of}} the goddess.|$|E
50|$|A {{barrier cream}} is a topical {{formulation}} used in industrial applications {{and as a}} cosmetic to place a physical barrier between the skin and contaminants that may irritate the skin (contact dermatitis or occupational dermatitis). There are many other terms for creams designed to protect skin from harmful substances, including skin protective creams, pre-work creams, antisolvent gels, <b>protective</b> <b>ointments,</b> and shielding lotions. Three classes of barrier creams are used: water repellent creams, water-soluble creams, and creams designed for special applications. Barrier creams may contain substances such as zinc oxide, talc or kaolin to layer over the skin. For hand care {{they are designed to}} protect against the harm from detergents and other irritants.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} and the risk factors for local cold injuries of the face and ears in peacetime military service. DESIGN [...] Prospective, controlled epidemiological study using a questionnaire. SETTING [...] Finnish defence forces, 1976 - 89. SUBJECTS [...] 913 young male conscripts with local frostbite of the head that needed medical attention and 2478 uninjured control conscripts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Type of activity, clothing, and other risk factors {{at the time of}} cold injury. Odds ratios were used to calculate risk. Controls were handled as one group. RESULTS [...] The mean annual incidence of frostbite was 1. 8 per 1000 conscripts. Frostbite of the ear was most common (533 conscripts (58 %)), followed by frostbite of the nose (197 (22 %)) and of the cheeks and other regions of the face (183 (20 %)). Most conscripts (803 (88 %)) had mild or superficial frostbite. Risk factors included not wearing a hat with earflaps (odds ratio 18. 5 for frostbite of the ear); not wearing a scarf (odds ratio 2. 1 and 3. 8 for frostbite of the ear and cheeks respectively); using <b>protective</b> <b>ointments</b> (odds ratio 3. 3, 4. 5, and 5. 6 for frostbite of the cheeks, ear, and nose respectively); being extremely sensitive to cold and having hands and feet that sweat profusely (odds ratio 3. 5 for frostbite of the nose); and being transported in the open or in open vehicles under windy conditions (odds ratio 2. 2 for frostbite of the cheek). CONCLUSIONS [...] Wearing warm clothing, including a scarf and a hat with earflaps, helps to prevent frostbite. Each person's sensitivity to cold may also be important. The routine use of <b>protective</b> <b>ointments</b> should not be recommended...|$|E
30|$|Objectives: To compare {{transparent}} catheter dressings {{either with}} or without the application of a <b>protective</b> skin <b>ointment</b> for skin integrity, dressings disruptions and dwell time; in addition, we assessed rates of catheter colonization and CLABSI in transparent dressing either {{with or without}} a CHG-pad.|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{considers}} {{an investigation}} of <b>protective</b> formulations (<b>ointment,</b> cream) containing enzyme inhibitors. Model experiments have been made on the enzyme trypsin. It is well accepted that feces and urine are an important causing factor for skin irritation (dermatitis) while using diaper. A protective formulation is a physical barrier that separates the harmful substances from the skin. It can also be an active barrier containing active substances, which can be active both towards the skin, and the substances from feces and urine. By preventing contact from these substances the skin will not be harmed, {{at least for a}} period of time. A number of different inhibitors were tested towards trypsin and they all showed good inhibition, two of the inhibitors were selected to be immobilized with the help of NHS-­activated Sepharose. Immobilization of these two inhibitors leads to a lesser extent of the risk of developing allergy and also that the possible toxic effect can be minimized. ...|$|R
40|$|This volume, {{the second}} {{in a series of}} three devoted to the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in World War II, now the Chemical Corps, covers research, development, procurement, and {{distribution}} of chemical warfare materiel. It traces the history of these activities from the World War I period, when the CWS was activated to supervise the offensive and defensive aspects of gas warfare throughout the Army, until the end of World War II. The first volume in the series, "Organizing for War", discusses the development of the CWS organization and mission as well as personnel management and military training. The third volume, entitled "Chemicals in Combat", will deal with the chemical warfare activities in the theaters of operations. In treating research and development, the present volume concentrates on CWS projects that proved of greatest significance to the armed forces during World War II. It attempts to point up the problems that arose in course of research and development and to indicate the solutions which the scientists hit upon. Since research and development in the zone of the interior was closely related to research and development in the theaters of operations, the volume covers activities in both areas. In contrast to research and development, procurement and distribution differed considerably as between the zone of the interior and the theaters of operations; in the theaters these activities were closely associated with the commanders' combat responsibilities. The volume, therefore, confines itself to a review of procurement and distribution in the zone of the interior, leaving narration of theater activities to the volume "Chemicals in combat". U. S. G.
