40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the {{evaluation}} of the criterion defining the specific features of tax residency for legal entities. This study analyses the approaches and principles that determine tax residency for legal entities. The paper is based on the analysis of theoretical changes in the current legislation related to tax administrations of foreign countries as well as the analysis of the basic principles for defining the residency for legal entities. The study is conducted by utilising econometric and statistic methods. This study emphasises the tax residency as one of the fundamental concepts in developing the tax systems. The tax residency also plays an important part in the formalization of relations between subjects of international economic activity and various tax jurisdictions. The main principles to determine tax residency for legal entities are the following: (1) the place of incorporation, (2) the center of management and control, (3) the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>management,</b> and (4) the place of effective management. This study indicates the problem of defining tax residency for legal entities. It also focuses on criteria of tax residency in Russia, including the place of incorporation and the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> In addition, the study determines the main and auxiliary criteria as well as voluntary recognition of tax residency and company re-domiciliation. According to the study, the approach to determine the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> by foreign legal entities in Russia is formal and creates opportunities for manipulation. The Federal law № 376 -FZ {{does not take into account}} the fact that in many cases the actual management is carried out by shareholders or beneficiaries who transfer the appropriate instructions to the executive body of a foreign legal entity and/or governing officials.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} indicates that the contribution of management to economic growth has been largely obscured in theory and ignored in empirical work.

Routine innovation in established firms is emphasised as a fundamental, normal part of management activity, and as such highlights the importance of management for economic growth. However, management is not homogeneous and the actions of managers differentially affect the performance outcomes of firms. Hence the quality of management, and the adoption of appropriate management practices, matters and directly impacts economic growth. In recognising that management makes a significant contribution, both in terms of ensuring efficiency in the use of factor inputs and effectiveness in terms of driving incremental innovation, new research is necessary at the firm level in order to develop this understanding...|$|E

The realm of management that began with starched devotion to the scientific approach where workers were seen as a means and not the end in the production process and were treated as mechanistic items and economic articles that are to aid the realisation of organisational goals has given way to the human relations and behavioural schools which respected workers, emphasised the need to motivate them and sought to create an attractive work environment that aimed to achieve a marriage of organizational development with workers' development. Therefore, focus has consistently shifted towards value-based models of growth in the workplace.

40|$|MCom (South African and International Tax), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Since the {{declaration}} of South Africa as the Gateway to Africa in 2010 by National Treasury, various changes {{have been made to}} South African legislation to make South Africa more attractive to foreign investors looking to expand their operations into Africa. The headquarter company regime was introduced with the purpose to provide a base from which these investments may be managed. From a tax perspective this regime eliminates or reduces specific taxes or rates of taxes for companies who elect to be classified as headquarter companies, provided that certain requirements are met. These requirements refer specifically to investments in qualifying foreign companies. The reference to foreign companies inevitably requires that the resident definition be considered. In South Africa residence of a person other than a natural person is the place where the company is incorporated, formed or established or the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>management</b> which is a term subject to various interpretations. Regardless of the differences, all the interpretations refer to a senior level <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> Foreign incorporated companies with their <b>place</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>management</b> in South Africa are excluded from the definition should they qualify as controlled foreign companies with foreign business establishments subject to a high level of tax if the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>management</b> is disregarded. The lack of skills in African countries as a product of shortfalls in the quality of education result in challenges to establish appropriately skilled management teams in these countries. When a centralised management team is set up at the headquarter company in South Africa the African subsidiaries risk being resident in South Africa and therefore the structure would not qualify for the benefits of the headquarter company regime. Further challenges arise when the exclusion to the resident definition is applied as shares held by a headquarter company are disregarded when the controlled foreign company status of the subsidiaries are determined. Therefore it is recommended that the headquarter company legislation be changed to correspond with successful regimes such as the Luxembourg and the Netherlands in that it does not only apply to foreign investment. It is further recommend that the resident definition be changed to exclude from the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>management</b> test group structures that would comply with section 9 I should the test be disregarded.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Patient characteristics, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> of attacks, comparison of actual management with recommended guidelines. RESULTS [...] Of the 1805 attacks, 300 occurred in boys aged 0 - 9, 144 in girls aged 0 - 9, and 118 in women aged 20 - 29. The estimated frequency of attacks in the community was 14. 3 per 1000 patients per year. 1546 (86 %) patients with attacks were managed within general practice, 225 (12 %) were admitted to hospital, and 34 (2 %) were discharged from an accident and emergency department. Two patients died. On initial presentation, 248 (14 %) patients were "not breathless," 900 (50 %) were "moderately breathless," 535 (30 %) were "breathless and distressed," 68 (4 %) were "too breathless to talk," and 2 were "moribund. " Recording of clinical data was variable. Underuse of nebulised bronchodilators and systemic steroid was apparent in all grades of clinical severity. Contrary to current guidelines for asthma management, "step up" in maintenance therapy after an attack was often not practised.

Aim: To assess admission prognostic factors and outcome of CAP in immunocompetent adult patients hospitalized in 21 medical centers in Chile. Material and methods: Prospective evaluation of non immunocompromised adults with CAP admitted to 21 Chilean hospitals between July and August, 1999. All patients were assessed on admission and followed until discharge or death. Results: During the study period, 1, 194 patients (aged 68 ± 17 years, 573 males) were evaluated. Seventy two percent had an underlying disease (especially chronic cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory diseases and diabetes mellitus), and 90 % were treated with ß-lactamic agents (especially a third generation cephalosporin or penicillin). Mean hospital length of stay was 11 ± 9 days, 10 % were admitted to Intermediate Care or Intensive Care Units (ICU), 6 % were mechanically ventilated and in-hospital mortality was 15. 7 %. Admission prognostic factors associated with hospital mortality were: advanced age, male gender, presence of comorbidity (chronic cardiovascular, renal, neurological and hepatic disease), undernutrition, suspicion of aspiration, altered mental status, low blood pressure, tachypnea, absence of fever, high blood urea nitrogen, multilobar radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, high risk categories from Chilean Respiratory Diseases Society Consensus, admission to Intermediate Care Units or ICU, and mechanical ventilation. In the multivariate analysis, prognostic factors associated with high hospital mortality were: mental confusion, high blood urea nitrogen, multilobar pneumonia, presence of comorbidity and absence of fever on admission.

40|$|MA (Pastoral Studies), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Godly Church {{leadership}} {{is essential to}} the life (its impact, efficiency, relevance, growth, holiness, and witness to the world) of the Church. Church {{leadership is}} under constant review in order to remain relevant {{in a world that is}} ever changing. The rate of change experienced in the modern world is very fast and Church leadership is constantly challenged to change and adapt. Often the Church has turned to the business world for answers, solutions and guidance to remain relevant in terms of its leadership output. The Church has, therefore, often adopted business management tools into its own leadership paradigms. One of these management tools is Management by Objectives. This study’s aim is to critically review the relationship between Management by Objectives as a management tool and Church leadership. This study has set out to evaluate the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Management</b> by Objectives within a Church leadership context by considering its impact (if any) on the Church as the Body of Christ. The study commences with the motifs that initiated the research project and refers to the personal and practical reasons thereof. In order to present an objective review it was necessary to state clearly how Management by Objectives is defined in the business world and by the business world. The study relied mainly on literature from the business sector to define Management by Objectives. The study then interacted with leaders and members of ten target churches to solicit their perspectives on the issue of Church leadership and the application of business management tools (specifically MBO) in a Church context. The study then discussed the biblical fundamentals of Church leadership with specific reference to the teaching of the New Testament. The conclusions of this part of the study were then applied to the process of formulating a framework within which to assess the compatibility/non-compatibility of Management by Objectives with Church leadership. The study concludes by formulating and recommending guidelines for the most appropriate relationship between MBO and Church leadership. Master...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{sought to}} advance {{understanding}} {{of the politics of}} workplace reform, explaining the respective roles of management and employees and how they relate. The literature on workplace reform usually argues that reform is predicated on greater workforce participation in managerial decisions. More specifically, different approaches to workplace reform can be aligned to different forms of participation. Thus quality management can be associated with direct forms of participation, institutional workplace reform may depend on representative forms, and best practice may require a combination of both. This thesis uses empirical evidence to explore this alignment between the different approaches to workplace reform and forms of participation. The period chosen for empirical study is approximately 1985 - 1992 - an era of rapid innovation in workplace reform for Australian manufacturing. Three workplaces were chosen for intensive study from automotive component manufacturers because that industry was itself a laboratory for workplace reform and also because these firms exemplified different approaches to competitiveness and reform. Three approaches to workplace reform - quality management, institutional workplace reform, and best practice - were distinguished to capture the range of Australian practice at that time. Similarly two approaches to workplace participation were distinguished - direct and representative - to reflect the range of observable practices at that time and to represent competing philosophies. Direct participation illustrated an approach founded in managerial context of the political status quo, whilst representative forms were considered to permit a pluralist shift of power to enable employees to manage in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> The three case studies depict companies sharing the competitive crisis of their industry. From this stems the impetus for workplace reform. At this point the firms diverged in their choice of competitive strategies for workplace reform. The case studies reveal, at the superficial level, a match between the chosen approaches to workplace reform and forms of participation. Basically, quality management is associated with direct employee participation, institutional workplace reform with collective bargaining and representative consultative committees, and best practice with both. However when the implementation of reform and participation are examined this match becomes less significant. One firm, Auto Air, achieved highly effective outcomes in both reform and participation. Another firm, Auto Electrical, failed in both. The thesis concluded that the relationship between forms of participation and reform is less significant than the effective implementation of policy. Unitarist or pluralist approaches to power distribution count less than managerial capacity to integrate successive reform initiatives and their commitment to workforce participation hi change...|$|E
