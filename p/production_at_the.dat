5|$|A New York Metropolitan staging was in 1996 under James Levine, {{a revival}} of John Dexter's 1978 {{production}} with stage designs by Josef Svoboda. In 2005 The Bartered Bride returned to New York, at the Juilliard School theatre, in a new production by Eve Shapiro, conducted by Mark Stringer.

5|$|After World War II, the US {{wanted to}} {{guarantee}} the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the Germans had been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border.

5|$|Among {{the leading}} singers {{associated}} with the opera, Tito Gobbi was particularly prominent in the 1950s and 1960s. He first sang the role of Schicchi in the Rome production in 1951; in subsequent years he appeared in further Rome seasons, in Bologna, and at La Scala, Milan, where Renata Scotto sang Lauretta in Carlo Maestrini's production. Gobbi directed and sang in the 1969 <b>production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Teatro Comunale di Firenze, and later that year performed in and directed the same version at the August 1969 Edinburgh Festival.|$|E
5|$|Among {{those who}} contributed to Aalborg's {{prosperity}} in the 19th century were Poul Pagh who significantly developed trade and shipping, and Christen Winther Obel who increased <b>production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> C.W. Obel tobacco factory until it became the city's main employer. Another important figure of the times was Marie Rée who ran the local newspaper Aalborg Stiftstidende until 1900, often promoting women's rights.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the usual}} method of BBC {{television}} drama <b>production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, the play was produced in a multi-camera electronic studio on video cameras, although it was recorded as a 35mm film telerecording rather than on videotape. This 35mm master was released for junking in 1968, and no copy of the play is known to exist.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, {{he moved}} to London, with his first major role being in a {{production}} of Romeo and Juliet at the Strand Theatre. He had particular success with the lead role of Stanhope in R. C. Sherriff's play Journey's End, playing the part in a 1929 tour of Australia and New Zealand and again for a 1934 revival <b>production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Criterion Theatre in London.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, it was {{announced}} that producer David De Silva was developing a stage version of the film.

5|$|Sarah Siddons {{starred in}} John Philip Kemble's 1794 <b>production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Theatre Royal, Drury Lane {{and offered a}} psychologically {{intricate}} portrait of Lady Macbeth {{in the tradition of}} Hannah Pritchard. Siddons was especially praised for moving audiences in the sleepwalking scene with her depiction of a soul in profound torment. Siddons and Kemble furthered the view established by Pritchard and Garrick that character was the essence of Shakespearean drama.|$|E
5|$|The L-100 series entered <b>production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{same time}} as the M-100. It was an economy version, with various {{cost-cutting}} changes so the organ could retail for under $1000. The vibrato was a simpler circuit than on other consoles and spinets. Two variations of the vibrato were provided, plus a chorus that mixed various vibrato signals together. The expression pedal, based on a cheaper design, was not as sophisticated as on the other organs. The L-100 was particularly popular in the UK and sold well, with several notable British musicians using it instead of a B-3 or C-3.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{partially}} cast with stock actors that Corman had used in previous films. Writer Charles B. Griffith portrays several small roles. Griffith's father {{appears as a}} dental patient, and his grandmother, Myrtle Vail, appears as Seymour's hypochondriac mother. Dick Miller, who had starred as the protagonist of A Bucket of Blood was offered the role of Seymour, but turned it down, instead taking the smaller role of Burson Fouch. <b>Production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bucket of Blood sets was compressed into three days of cast rehearsals, immediately followed by two days and one night of principal photography.|$|E

5|$|The last train ran on 4 July 1991, {{four days}} after the plant closed. Without <b>production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plants {{there was no need for}} the railway; it would be more {{economical}} to transport the few last products by truck. The final hauled several wagons down to the coast for scrapping. The closing of the Rjukan Line also terminated operations on the Tinnoset Line, where passenger traffic had remained until 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{real-time}} battle {{system used}} in Secret of Mana {{has been described}} by its creators {{as an extension of the}} battle system used in the first three flagship Final Fantasy titles. The system for experience points and leveling up was taken from Final Fantasy III. According to Tanaka, the game's battle system features mechanics that had first been considered for Final Fantasy IV. Similarly, unused features in Secret of Mana were appropriated by the Chrono Trigger team, which like Final Fantasy IV was in <b>production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{translated}} back to French by Felix Coveliers for a <b>production</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Fantaisies-Parisiennes in Brussels, which opened on 28 December 1878, despite concerns from Scribe's widow. However, in Paris, she refused permission for the Gaîté {{to mount the}} work in that form, and {{the directors of the}} Théâtre des Nouveautés, Boulevard des Italiens therefore procured a much altered libretto from Alfred Delacour and Victor Wilder, and in this form the Paris première was produced at that theatre on 15 March 1879, with costumes by Grévin, running for 59 nights. Revived in April 1882, the production received 55 more performances, with Marguerite Ugalde in the title role.|$|E
