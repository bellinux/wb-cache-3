5|$|According to a trade data study, painted turtles {{were the}} second most popular pet turtles after red-eared sliders in the early 1990s. As of 2010, most U.S. states allow, but discourage, painted turtle pets, {{although}} Oregon forbids keeping them as <b>pets,</b> <b>and</b> Indiana prohibits their sale. U.S. federal law prohibits sale or transport of any turtle less than , to limit human contact to salmonella. However, a loophole for scientific samples allows some small turtles to be sold, and illegal trafficking also occurs.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} use of <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PET/CT aids physicians and patients in developing lymphoma prognoses, specifically for Hodgkin disease and aggressive types of non-Hodgkin lym-phoma. <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PET/CT {{are used to}} initially stage lymphoma, restage disease, and check for remission or recurrence of malignant tissue after treatment. PET/CT is more sensitive and specific than CT alone and has better accuracy concerning lymphoma relapse and remission. In conjunction with other tests, such as blood laboratory work <b>and</b> biopsy, <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PET/ CT allow the lymphoma to be staged appropriately and treated correctly. Results from <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PET/CT contribute {{to the formation of}} a specialized treatment plan that leads to the best possible care for each individual patient. <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PET/CT positively affect the management of patients with lymphoma...|$|R

5|$|Orangutans may {{be killed}} for the {{bushmeat}} trade, crop protection, or for use for traditional medicine. Orangutan bones are secretly traded in souvenir shops in several cities in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Mother orangutans are killed so their infants {{can be sold}} as <b>pets,</b> <b>and</b> many of these infants die {{without the help of}} their mother. Since 2004, several pet orangutans were confiscated by local authorities and sent to rehabilitation centres.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{have been}} used as food, for clothing, as <b>pets,</b> <b>and</b> as {{laboratory}} animals in research. Some species, in particular the brown rat, the black rat, and the house mouse, are serious pests, eating and spoiling food stored by humans, and spreading diseases. Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive, and have caused the extinction of numerous species, such as island birds, previously isolated from land-based predators.|$|E
5|$|The greater Phoenix {{region is}} home to the only {{thriving}} feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released <b>pets,</b> <b>and</b> by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.|$|E

30|$|Descriptive {{statistics}} will {{summarize the}} location {{and the number of}} positive cases for each lymph node using CT (where the test positive is defined as a lymph node short axis diameter[*]>[*] 1  cm), PET (where the test positive is defined as that SUV >[*] 3.0), and DECT (where the test positive is defined as that the iodine is <[*] 2.5 mgI/mL). To address clustering, we will perform a multilevel model test. The diagnostic power will be summarized by the area under the curve at receiver operating characteristic analysis (AUC), comparing CT <b>and</b> <b>PET,</b> CT <b>and</b> DECT, as well as <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> DECT. Multilevel models will be used to estimate the probability of a positive, which will be used to estimate the empirical AUC. The following additional analysis will be done to further understand the performance of CT, <b>PET,</b> <b>and</b> DECT. First, the Cohen’s κ statistics will be used to assess the concordance between CT <b>and</b> <b>PET,</b> DECT <b>and</b> <b>PET,</b> <b>and</b> DECT and CT. Second, for patients with known disease status, the AUC will be evaluated comparing CT <b>and</b> <b>PET,</b> <b>and</b> DECT <b>and</b> <b>PET,</b> using the complete PET/CT examination and the pathological specimens, if available, as a reference standard for lesion detection and characterization.|$|R

Unknown to them, she manages to escape the farm, only to run into a mysterious hooded figure who has two armless walker <b>pets</b> <b>and</b> wields a katana.|$|E
5|$|Wild wolves are {{sometimes}} kept as exotic <b>pets</b> <b>and,</b> in some rarer occasions, as working animals. Although {{closely related to}} domesticated dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, and generally, much more work is {{required in order to}} obtain the same amount of reliability. Wolves also need much more space than dogs, about , so they can exercise.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated by humans both as <b>pets</b> <b>and</b> for {{practical}} purposes. Colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, {{a practice that}} has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species. Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing, respectively. Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.|$|E
30|$|The medical {{community}} is also {{using the term}} multimodality imaging, when referring to procedures implying the use of different modalities, not necessarily at the same time. Typical examples are: <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT, or SPECT <b>and</b> CT, or <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> MR.|$|R
40|$|Noninvasive imaging of {{atherosclerosis}} {{could potentially}} move patient management towards individualized triage, treatment, and followup. The newly introduced combined {{positron emission tomography}} (<b>PET)</b> <b>and</b> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system could emerge as {{a key player in}} this context. Both <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> MRI have previously been used for imaging plaque morphology and function: however, the combination of the two methods may offer new synergistic opportunities. Here, we will give a short summary of current relevant clinical applications of <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> MRI in the setting of atherosclerosis. Additionally, our initial experiences with simultaneous PET/MRI for atherosclerosis imaging are presented. Finally, future potential vascular applications exploiting the unique combination of <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> MRI will be discussed...|$|R

The emerald dove {{is most likely}} {{to be confused with the}} bleeding-heart, but the emerald dove is distinguished by a larger and whiter shoulder patch, a white supercilium, and dark chestnut underparts. Two bleeding-hearts are kept as <b>pets</b> <b>and</b> may escape on Tawi-Tawi; the Sulu bleeding-heart differs from the Luzon bleeding-heart by not having the Luzon bleeding-heart's purple nape and back, and from the Mindanao bleeding-heart by lacking prominent gray wing-bars and an orange belly.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their <b>pets</b> <b>and</b> livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E
40|$|In this research, waste textile {{materials}} like polyethylene terephthalate (<b>PET)</b> <b>and</b> cotton were compression molded into composites. The main {{idea was to}} use waste textiles to develop composites like <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> cotton. <b>PET</b> acts as matrix and cotton as reinforcement because PET is thermoplastic whereas cotton is non thermoplastic. Approximately about 21 million tons of textile solid waste is being disposed into landfills annually, leading to vast environmental properties and waste of valuable raw materials. By using waste <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> cotton textiles there are technical as well as environmental viabilities. However, implementing them into fabricating composites is not widely conducted. Compression molding is a feasible approach to use waste <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> cotton textiles into fabricating composites that have good potential for industrial applications. In this research, investigating the effects of plasticizers and alkalis on decreasing the processing temperatures of composites was studied so that the cotton is protected during compression molding. In the following paper, it is shown how plasticizers can be effectively used to decrease the melting temperature of PET. The influences of chemicals on the melting temperature of <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> the mechanical properties of the composites are investigated. In my future research, the feasibility of compression molding <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> cotton fabrics into composites with other chemicals will be studied. More molecular characterizations of individual <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> cotton components plus static and dynamic mechanical characterizations of composites will be conducted. Advisor: Yiqi Yan...|$|R
30|$|In this study, image {{patches of}} both {{modalities}} (<b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT) were mixed {{into the same}} network. Such mixed setting may potentially limit the performance of CNN, because the <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT patches contained different types of diagnostic information. It should be more appropriate to process the <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT patches with separated subnetworks and combine the results of different subnetworks at the output layers. However, there is currently no such architecture for dual-modality PET/CT images, we will leave this issue for future research.|$|R
40|$|This {{prospective}} study compares the efficacies of whole-body 18 F-FDG <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> a conventional work-up (CWU) {{in evaluating the}} treatment response for patients with locoregional advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after primary curative therapy and investigates the impact of PET on patient management. Methods: Patients who had locoregional advanced NPC (stages III and IVa-b, staged by 18 F-FDG <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CWU) and who had completed primary curative therapy for 3 mo were enrolled. The curative therapy consisted of concurrent chemoradiother-apy with or without induction chemotherapy. All of the patients also underwent 18 F-FDG <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CWU to evaluate the re-sponse. The criteria for final diagnosis were based on pathology or subsequent follow-up for at least 6 mo.

5|$|Crickets {{often appear}} as {{characters}} in literature. The Talking Cricket features in Carlo Collodi's 1883 children's book, The Adventures of Pinocchio, and in films {{based on the}} book. The eponymous insect is central to Charles Dickens's 1845 The Cricket on the Hearth, as is the chirping insect in George Selden's 1960 The Cricket in Times Square. Crickets are celebrated in poems by William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Du Fu. They are kept as pets in countries from China to Europe, sometimes for cricket fighting. Crickets are efficient at converting their food into body mass, making them a candidate for food production. They are used as food in Southeast Asia, where they are sold deep-fried in markets as snacks. They are also used to feed carnivorous <b>pets</b> <b>and</b> zoo animals. In Brazilian folklore, crickets feature as omens of various events.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Legend of Mana displays an angled top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the unnamed main character, and is assisted by up to two companions. One of these companions is an optional support character, which depends on what quest the player is performing, while another companion can be chosen by the player out of a roster of monsters, <b>pets,</b> <b>and</b> golems. Both companions are typically controlled by the game's AI, though a second player can {{take control of the}} support character, or load in their own character from a different save file, if present. The main character and companions each have their own set of numerical attributes including hit points and strength, which represent the amount of damage the player can take or cause. These stats grow whenever the player advances a level, after gaining enough experience points from battle with enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as <b>pets</b> <b>and</b> the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E

40|$|PurposeBoth perfusion-weighted MR imaging (PWI) and O-(2 - 18 F-fluoroethyl) -L-tyrosine PET (18 F–FET) provide grading {{information}} in cerebral gliomas. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the diagnostic value of 18 F–FET <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PWI for tumor grading in a series of patients with newly diagnosed, untreated gliomas using an integrated PET/MR scanner. MethodsSeventy-two patients with untreated gliomas [22 low-grade gliomas (LGG), and 50 high-grade gliomas (HGG) ] were investigated with 18 F–FET <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PWI using a hybrid PET/MR scanner. After visual inspection of <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PWI maps (rCBV, rCBF, MTT), volumes of interest (VOIs) with a diameter of 16 mm were centered upon the maximum of abnormality in the tumor area in each modality and the contralateral unaffected hemisphere. Mean and maximum tumor-to-brain ratios (TBRmean, TBRmax) were calculated. In addition, Time-to-Peak (TTP) and slopes of time–activity curves were calculated for 18 F–FET PET. Diagnostic accuracies of 18 F–FET <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PWI for differentiating low-grade glioma (LGG) from high-grade glioma (HGG) were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analyses (area under the curve; AUC). ResultsThe diagnostic accuracy of 18 F–FET <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PWI to discriminate LGG from HGG was similar with highest AUC values for TBRmean and TBRmax of 18 F–FET PET uptake (0. 80, 0. 83) and for TBRmean and TBRmax of rCBV (0. 80, 0. 81). In case of increased signal in the tumor area with both methods (n = 32), local hot-spots were incongruent in 25 patients (78 %) with a mean distance of 10. 6 ± 9. 5 mm. Dynamic FET <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> combination of different parameters did not further improve diagnostic accuracy. ConclusionsBoth 18 F–FET <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PWI discriminate LGG from HGG with similar diagnostic performance. Regional abnormalities in the tumor area are usually not congruent indicating that tumor grading by 18 F–FET <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> PWI is based on different pathophysiological phenomena...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare PET with 18 F-FDG <b>PET,</b> in-line PET/CT, <b>and</b> {{software}} fusion of independently acquired CT <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> scans for staging of recurrent colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: Fifty-one patients with suspected recurrent CRC were studied with in-line PET/CT. Thirty-four of these patients underwent an additional CT scan of the chest or ab-domen within 4 wk of PET/CT. Software fusion of <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT was performed using a fully automated, intensity-based algo-rithm. The accuracy of the coregistration of <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT scans was evaluated by measuring the distance between landmarks visible in the <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT images. Histologic evaluation and follow-up for 6 mo served as the gold standard for the presence or absence of recurrent CRC. Results: On a patient basis, the accuracy of staging was significantly higher for in-line PET/CT than for PET (88 % vs. 71 %, P 0. 01). Software fusion of the independently acquired <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT images was unsuccessful in 8 patients (24 %). In the remaining patients, the mean distance between 62 landmarks visible in <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT was 12. 9 7. 9 mm, whereas it was only 7. 7 4. 7 mm for in-line PET/CT (P 0. 001). Conclusion: In patients with suspected recurrent CRC, in-line PET/CT significantly improves staging compared with PET alone. Due to its high failure rate, software fusion of inde-pendently acquired <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> CT studies cannot be considered to represent an alternative to in-line PET/CT...|$|R
