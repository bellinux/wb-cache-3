5|$|The {{situation}} {{reached a}} crisis on May 7, 1963. Breakfast {{in the jail}} took four hours to distribute to all the prisoners. Seventy members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> the protest organizers to stop the actions. The NAACP asked for sympathizers to picket in unity in 100 American cities. Nineteen rabbis from New York flew to Birmingham, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Local rabbis disagreed {{and asked them to}} go home. The editor of The Birmingham News wired President Kennedy and <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> him to end the protests.|$|E
5|$|Ochs's friends {{tried to}} help him. His brother Michael {{attempted}} to have him committed to a psychiatric hospital. Friends <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> him to get help voluntarily. They feared for his safety, because he was getting into fights with bar patrons. Unable to pay his rent, he began living on the streets.|$|E

5|$|Crawford {{continued}} her reign {{as a popular}} movie actress well into the mid-1930s. No More Ladies (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama I Live My Life (1935), directed by W.S. Van Dyke. It was well received by critics and made a larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E
5|$|In early 1969, Quaife {{told the}} band he was leaving. The other members {{did not take}} his {{statement}} seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling {{the rest of the}} Kinks. Ray Davies <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.|$|E
5|$|There was {{one report}} {{that her father}} gave Olga a small revolver, which she {{concealed}} in a boot while in captivity at Tsarskoe Selo and at Tobolsk. Colonel Eugene Kobylynsky, their sympathetic jailer, <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> the grand duchess to surrender her revolver before she, her sisters, and brother were transferred to Yekaterinburg. Olga reluctantly gave up her gun and was left unarmed.|$|E

5|$|Although court {{entertainments}} {{were few}} after the Prince Consort's death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed tableau vivant photography, which was often {{performed at the}} royal residences. Henry, increasingly bored {{by the lack of}} activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted malaria and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, Beatrice, who was waiting for her husband at Madeira, received a telegram informing her of Henry's death two days earlier.|$|E
5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army {{was on its}} way to the palace to stop him, and that he should give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan what he was trying to accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E
5|$|As Vizier he {{had taken}} all powers under his control as the king was only a puppet, a figurehead, who was into enjoying life with wine, opium and women. But he {{overestimated}} and over exercised his powers {{with the result that}} the Emperor’s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy to help them get rid of their Vizier. A civil strife ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was driven out of Delhi. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.|$|E

A request that another may work for us never does our work.

5|$|By 1388, {{the devastation}} of Dalmatia by the Bosnian army had become so severe that the {{authorities}} of the cities <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> Sigismund to either help them or {{to allow them to}} save themselves by submitting without being labeled as traitors. Neither Sigismund's army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen were able to counter Tvrtko's advances. Split, Zadar, and Šibenik having lost all hope, Tvrtko called upon them to negotiate their surrender in March 1389. Each of the cities asked to be the last one to submit and even to be allowed to request Sigismund's assistance once more. Tvrtko granted their wish and decided that Split should be the last to submit, by 15 June 1389.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E
5|$|Even then, Eberstein {{refused to}} ask Schack for {{assistance}} in the battle. Colonel Ditlev Ahlefeldt of the allied forces would not to let pride and vanity be {{the downfall of the}} attack and <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> Schack to attack. Shack brandished his rapier and mounted a forceful attack into the Swedish left flank. A bloody engagement ensued, but the Swedish cavalry was no match for the rested Danish forces—they fled towards Nyborg leaving the infantry defenseless. The Polish riders showed no pardon, cutting down the Swedish infantry almost to a man. The Dutch also intervened with an expeditionary fleet led by Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter.|$|E

5|$|Following Wyatt's rebellion, Guildford Dudley was {{beheaded}} on 12 February 1554 {{shortly before}} his wife. Knowing the Queen's character, in June 1554 Jane Dudley <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> the authorities to allow her remaining sons to hear mass. During 1554 the Duchess and her son-in-law Henry Sidney worked hard pleading with the Spanish nobles around England's new king consort, Philip of Spain. Lord Paget may also have proved helpful, and Henry Sidney even travelled to Spain in their cause. In the autumn of 1554 the Dudley brothers were released from the Tower, though the eldest, John, died immediately afterwards at Sidney's house Penshurst in Kent. At the same location Philip Sidney was born on 30 November 1554. His godmother was his grandmother Jane Dudley, while his godfather was Philip of Spain.|$|E
5|$|Her {{more radical}} {{positions}} included acceptance of interracial marriage. Despite her opposition to giving African American men {{the right to}} vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to in expressing this opposition, Stanton had no objection to interracial marriage and wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to Helen Pitts, a white woman, in 1884. Anthony, fearing public condemnation of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost, <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in the pipeline project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E

5|$|In 1631 Wiśniowiecki {{returned}} to the Commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father's huge estate, which included {{a large part of}} what is now Ukraine. In 1632 he converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism, an action that caused much concern in Ukraine. His decision has been analyzed by historians, and often criticized, particularly in Ukrainian historiography. The Orthodox Church feared to lose a powerful protector, and Isaiah Kopinsky, metropolitan bishop of Kiev and a friend of his mother, unsuccessfully <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> him to change his mind. Jeremi would not budge although he remained on decent terms with the Orthodox Church, avoiding provocative actions, and supported his uncle and Orthodox bishop Peter Mogila and his Orthodox Church collegium.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 2012, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was driving}} her {{daughter}} to school in Morelia at around 8:30a.m. when a vehicle ran them off the road. Two armed men descended from their vehicle and forced {{her out of her}} car as onlookers watched. Gorrostieta Salazar <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> her abductors to let her daughter go unharmed, and then agreed to go with the kidnappers. The family of the former mayor initially thought it was a ransom kidnapping. After not hearing from Gorrostieta Salazar or her abductors for two days, they notified the police. On 15 November, police identified the body after farm workers from the rural community of San Juan Tararameo in Cuitzeo found the corpse on their way to work.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Franjo Gregurić advised Tuđman to {{implement}} Špegelj's plan. According to General Anton Tus, Tuđman ordered the ZNG to capture JNA barracks on 12 September, but rescinded the order the next day. The order was reinstated on 14 September after Tus <b>pleaded</b> <b>with</b> Tuđman to re-authorize action, {{arguing that the}} ZNG {{was running out of}} time. The same day, the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities it had access to, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. This action comprised blockades of 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia, and numerous smaller facilities, including border posts, and weapons and ammunition storage depots.|$|E
