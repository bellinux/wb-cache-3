5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first <b>polarizer,</b> allowing its transmission through the second <b>polarizer</b> (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first <b>polarizer</b> is absorbed at the second <b>polarizer,</b> and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to create circularly {{polarized}} light, the cheapest and most common involves placing a quarter-wave plate after a linear <b>polarizer</b> and directing unpolarized light through the linear <b>polarizer.</b> The linearly polarized light leaving the linear <b>polarizer</b> is transformed into circularly polarized light by the quarter wave plate.|$|E
25|$|When one {{attempts}} to pass unpolarized {{light through the}} linear <b>polarizer,</b> only light that has its electric field at the positive 45° angle leaves the linear <b>polarizer</b> and enters the quarter-wave plate. In the illustration, the three wavelengths of unpolarized light represented would be transformed into the three wavelengths of linearly polarized light {{on the other side}} of the linear <b>polarizer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thin-film <b>polarizers</b> {{generally}} do not perform as well as Glan-type <b>polarizers,</b> but they are inexpensive and provide two beams that are about equally well polarized. The cube-type <b>polarizers</b> generally perform better than the plate <b>polarizers.</b> The former are easily confused with Glan-type birefringent <b>polarizers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thin-film linear <b>polarizers</b> are glass {{substrates}} {{on which}} a special optical coating is applied. Either Brewster's angle reflections or interference effects in the film cause them to act as beam-splitting <b>polarizers.</b> The substrate for the film can either be a plate, which is inserted into the beam at a particular angle, or a wedge of glass that is cemented to a second wedge to form a cube with the film cutting diagonally across the center (one form {{of this is the}} very common MacNeille cube).Thin-film <b>polarizers</b> generally do not perform as well as Glan-type <b>polarizers,</b> but they are inexpensive and provide two beams that are about equally well polarized. The cube-type <b>polarizers</b> generally perform better than the plate <b>polarizers.</b> The former are easily confused with Glan-type birefringent <b>polarizers.</b>|$|R

Advantageously, the guest-host <b>polarizers</b> can be patterned and applications are envisioned in liquid-crystal displays...|$|R
25|$|To {{create a}} {{circular}} <b>polarizer</b> that instead passes right-handed polarized light and absorbs left-handed light, one again rotates the wave plate and linear <b>polarizer</b> 90° relative to each another. It {{is easy to}} appreciate that {{by reversing the positions}} of the transmitting and absorbing axes of the linear <b>polarizer</b> relative to the quarter-wave plate, one changes which handedness of polarized light gets transmitted and which gets absorbed.|$|E
25|$|The {{illustration}} {{above is}} identical to the previous similar one with the exception that the left-handed circularly polarized light is now approaching the <b>polarizer</b> from the opposite direction and linearly polarized light is exiting the <b>polarizer</b> toward the right.|$|E
25|$|Had it been right-handed, {{clockwise}} {{circularly polarized}} light approaching the circular <b>polarizer</b> from the left, its horizontal component would {{have also been}} retarded, however the resulting linearly polarized light would have been polarized along the absorbing axis of the linear <b>polarizer</b> {{and it would not}} have passed.|$|E
25|$|Given this assumption, {{there is}} a Bell {{inequality}} between the coincidence rates with <b>polarizers</b> and coincidence rates without <b>polarizers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent {{simulation}} {{and experimental}} work {{has resulted in}} the realization of low-cost, substrate-based, THz wire-grid <b>polarizers</b> fabricated on crystalline-quartz substrates that exhibit both high extinction ratios and low insertion losses.

The <b>polarizers</b> exhibited extinction ratios as high as 50 dB at low frequencies and 30 dB at higher ones...|$|R
25|$|To create right-handed, {{clockwise}} {{circularly polarized}} light one simply rotates {{the axis of}} the quarter-wave plate 90° relative to the linear <b>polarizer.</b> This reverses the fast and slow axes of the wave plate relative to the transmission axis of the linear <b>polarizer</b> reversing which component leads and which component lags.|$|E
25|$|A {{homogeneous}} circular <b>polarizer</b> passes one handedness of {{circular polarization}} unaltered and blocks the other handedness. This {{is similar to}} the way that a linear <b>polarizer</b> would fully pass one angle of linearly polarized light unaltered, but would fully block any linearly polarized light that was orthogonal to it.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a <b>polarizer</b> which creates a given handedness of circularly polarized light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the circularly polarized light displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the linearly polarized light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear <b>polarizer</b> section of the circular <b>polarizer</b> it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular <b>polarizer</b> again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear <b>polarizer</b> and in the process, its horizontal component {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the linear <b>polarizer.</b>|$|E
40|$|Infrared grid <b>polarizers</b> {{consisting}} of copper lines with a 3. 6 -micron grid constant on a 4 -micron-thick Mylar polyester substrate {{have been prepared}} by the techniques of photolithography and sputter-etching. Their polarization properties have been measured and found to be suitable for use at infrared frequencies below 700 /cm. The <b>polarizers</b> {{have been used to}} extend the useful frequency range of a Martin-Puplett polarizing interferometer designed for Fourier transform spectroscopy. The efficiency of the interferometer has been measured over a frequency range from 50 to 700 /cm and compared to that of a conventional Michelson interferometer. The results are shown to be consistent with the measured properties of the <b>polarizers.</b> Methods are suggested for improving the efficiency of a Martin-Puplett interferometer which employs these <b>polarizers...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Alignment of {{the polymer}} {{molecules}} within the lamellae results in birefringence producing {{a variety of}} colored patterns when spherulites are viewed between crossed <b>polarizers</b> in an optical microscope. In particular, the so-called [...] "Maltese cross" [...] is often present which consists of four dark perpendicular cones diverging from the origin (see right picture), sometimes with a bright center (front picture). Its formation can be explained as follows. Linear polymer chains {{can be regarded as}} a linear <b>polarizers.</b> If their direction coincides with that of one of the crossed <b>polarizers</b> then little light is transmitted; the transmission is increased when the chains make a non-zero angle with both <b>polarizers,</b> and the induced transmittance is dependent on the wavelength, partly because of the absorption properties of the polymer.|$|R
25|$|Real <b>polarizers</b> {{are also}} not perfect {{blockers}} of the polarization orthogonal to their polarization axis; {{the ratio of}} the transmission of the unwanted component to the wanted component is called the extinction ratio, and varies from around 1:500 for Polaroid to about 1:106 for Glan–Taylor prism <b>polarizers.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the {{arrangement}} above, the transmission {{axis of the}} linear <b>polarizer</b> is at a positive 45° angle relative to the right horizontal and is represented with an orange line. The quarter-wave plate has a horizontal slow axis and a vertical fast axis and they are also represented using orange lines. In this instance the unpolarized light entering the linear <b>polarizer</b> is displayed as a single wave whose amplitude and angle of linear polarization are suddenly changing.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} axis of {{the linear}} <b>polarizer</b> needs to be half way (45°) between the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate.|$|E
25|$|First {{note that}} a quarter-wave plate always {{transforms}} circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light. It is only the resulting angle of polarization of the linearly polarized light that {{is determined by the}} orientation of the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate and the handedness of the circularly polarized light. In the illustration, the left-handed circularly polarized light entering the <b>polarizer</b> is transformed into linearly polarized light which has its direction of polarization along the transmission axis of the linear <b>polarizer</b> and it therefore passes. In contrast right-handed circularly polarized light would have been transformed into linearly polarized light that had its direction of polarization along the absorbing axis of the linear <b>polarizer,</b> which is at right angles to the transmission axis, and it would have therefore been blocked.|$|E

40|$|A {{photometric}} detector for an optically active compound {{is described in}} which two <b>polarizers</b> are set {{on both sides of}} the flow cell. When a nonchromophoric, optically active compound passes through the cell, the intensity of natural light transmitted through the <b>polarizers</b> and flow cell is changed. The detection of such a sample is possible photometrically. A large inclination angle between the <b>polarizers</b> increases the absorbance change and allows dextrorotatory and levorotatory to be differentiated. The direct HPLC/photometric detection of sugars is presented as an axample of this device...|$|R
25|$|Beam-splitting <b>polarizers</b> {{split the}} {{incident}} beam into two beams of differing linear polarization. For an ideal polarizing beamsplitter {{these would be}} fully polarized, with orthogonal polarizations. For many common beam-splitting <b>polarizers,</b> however, {{only one of the}} two output beams is fully polarized. The other contains a mixture of polarization states.|$|R
25|$|To {{understand}} this process, {{refer to the}} illustration on the right. It is absolutely identical to the earlier illustration even though the circularly polarized light at the top is now considered to be approaching the <b>polarizer</b> from the left. One can observe from the illustration that the leftward horizontal (as observed looking along the direction of travel) component is leading the vertical component and that when the horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength it will be transformed into the linearly polarized light illustrated {{at the bottom and}} it will pass through the linear <b>polarizer.</b>|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{some light}} {{is lost in}} the <b>polarizer</b> and the actual {{transmission}} will be somewhat lower than this, around 38% for Polaroid-type polarizers but considerably higher (>49.9%) for some birefringent prism types.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence {{is used in}} many optical devices. Liquid-crystal displays, {{the most}} common sort of flat panel display, cause their pixels to become lighter or darker through {{rotation}} of the polarization (circular birefringence) of linearly polarized light as viewed through a sheet <b>polarizer</b> at the screen's surface. Similarly, light modulators modulate the intensity of light through electrically induced birefringence of polarized light followed by a <b>polarizer.</b> The Lyot filter is a specialized narrowband spectral filter employing the wavelength dependence of birefringence. Wave plates are thin birefringent sheets widely used in certain optical equipment for modifying the polarization state of light passing through it.|$|E

40|$|<b>Polarizers</b> are {{essential}} in diverse photonics applications including display [1], microscopy [2], polarimetric astrophysical observation [3], laser machining [4], and quantum information processing [5]. Whereas conventional <b>polarizers</b> based on natural crystals and multilayer thin films are commonplace, nanostructured <b>polarizers</b> offer compact integrability [6, 7], thermal stability in high-power systems [4, 8], and space-variant vector beam generation [9, 10]. Here, we {{introduce a new}} class of reflectors and <b>polarizers</b> fashioned with dielectric nanowire grids that are mostly empty space. It is fundamentally extremely significant that the wideband spectral expressions presented can be generated in these minimal systems. We provide computed results predicting high reflection and attendant polarization extinction in multiple spectral regions. Experimental results with Si nanowire arrays show ~ 200 -nm-wide band of total reflection for one polarization state and free transmission for the orthogonal state. These results agree quantitatively with theoretical predictions...|$|R

25|$|Birefringence is {{utilized}} in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes {{is a pair}} of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the X direction after passing through the first <b>polarizer,</b> but above the specimen is a <b>polarizer</b> (a so-called analyzer) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the X-polarized light into the Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.|$|E
25|$|Waveplates {{in general}} {{as well as}} polarizers can be {{described}} using the Jones matrix formalism, which uses a vector to represent the polarization state of light and a matrix to represent the linear transformation of a waveplate or <b>polarizer.</b>|$|E
25|$|If two polarizers {{are placed}} {{one after another}} (the second <b>polarizer</b> is {{generally}} called an analyzer), the mutual angle between their polarizing axes gives the value of θ in Malus's law. If the two axes are orthogonal, the polarizers are crossed and in theory no light is transmitted, though again practically speaking no <b>polarizer</b> is perfect and the transmission is not exactly zero (for example, crossed Polaroid sheets appear slightly blue in colour). If a transparent object is placed between the crossed polarizers, any polarization effects present in the sample (such as birefringence) will be shown as an increase in transmission. This effect is used in polarimetry to measure the optical activity of a sample.|$|E
