30|$|A {{previous}} study at our institution looked at giant cell tumor defects in distal femurs reconstructed {{with three different}} techniques—intramedullary Steinmann pins, crossed screws, and <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> constructs [6]. The femora treated with <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> constructs had a greater stiffness and load to failure {{than the other two}} groups. The <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group was 43 and 53  % stiffer than the intramedullary pin group and the crossed pin group, respectively. The failures noted in the <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group were extra-articular, which as previously stated by Toy et al., is desirable compared to intra-articular failures [13]. The <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> were hypothesized to be stronger because they transferred the load from the joint surface to the intact femoral shaft more effectively than the other groups. The use of <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> has been shown by other groups to be an effective treatment in other orthopedic oncology reconstructions [14].|$|R
30|$|Our {{study showed}} a {{significant}} improvement in the stiffness and fatigue properties of proximal tibial defects treated with a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> construct compared to three intramedullary Steinmann pins placed in an inverted tripod position. None of the <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> constructs failed during fatigue testing, while two of the other group failed with intra-articular fractures. The significant increase in fatigue properties likely translates into increased stability of the <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> construct over time. We believe that proximal tibial <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> represent a viable alternative treatment to the traditional treatment using Steinmann pin constructs.|$|R
30|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> are {{fundamentally}} different from conventional plates [2, 3, 5]. The biomechanical properties of <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> are, more appropriately, likened to external fixators than traditional plates and screws [5, 17]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> rely on fixed angle screws to provide stability rather than the friction between the plate and bone generated by screw torque [17]. This intrinsic dissimilarity makes conventional <b>plates</b> and <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> suited for use in different clinical scenarios [3, 18]. Conventional plates are ideal for achieving union through primary bone healing, with precise reduction, interfragmentary compression and rigid fixation [5, 17, 18]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> {{on the other hand}} are better suited for providing elastic fixation that result in secondary fracture healing with callus formation [3, 5, 17, 18].|$|R
40|$|Fixation of {{fragility}} fractures with {{plates and}} screws {{often results in}} loss of fixation and need for revision surgery. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> and screw were introduced to improve fixation of fragility fractures and have been in use for a decade. This review was conducted to compile evidence that <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> and screws improve fixation of fragility fractures. A search of PubMed was performed to identify biomechanical studies as well as clinical series of fragility fractures treated with <b>locking</b> <b>plates.</b> Biomechanics papers had to use models of osteoporotic bone and had to directly compare <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> with traditional plates. Clinical studies included case series in which <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> were applied to elderly patients with fractures of the proximal humerus and periprosthetic distal femur fractures. Most studies are retrospective case series. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> lead to greater stability and higher loads to failure than traditional plates. When applied to proximal humerus fractures, uncomplicated healing occurs in 85 % of patients. Constant and Dash scores approach normal values. For distal femoral periprosthetic fractures, union rates of 75 % are reported with a malunion rate of 10 %. Early evidence suggests that <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> improve results of treatment of proximal humerus fractures and distal femoral periprosthetic fractures in the elderly. Loss of fixation is associated with failure to achieve stability at the fracture site.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Axial {{dynamization}} of fractures {{can promote}} healing, and overly stiff fixation can suppress healing. A novel technology, termed active plating, provides controlled axial dynamization by the elastic suspension of locking holes within the plate. This prospective, controlled animal study evaluated {{the effect of}} active plates on fracture-healing in an established ovine osteotomy model. We hypothesized that symmetric axial dynamization with active plates stimulates circumferential callus and delivers faster and stronger healing relative to standard <b>locking</b> <b>plates.</b> METHODS: Twelve sheep {{were randomly assigned to}} receive a standard <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> or an active <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> for stabilization of a 3 -mm tibial osteotomy gap. The only difference between <b>plates</b> was that <b>locking</b> holes of active plates were elastically suspended, allowing up to 1. 5 mm of axial motion at the fracture. Fracture-healing was analyzed weekly on radiographs. After sacrifice at nine weeks postoperatively, callus volume and distribution were assessed by computed tomography. Finally, to determine their strength, healed tibiae and contralateral tibiae were tested in torsion until failure. RESULTS: At each follow-up, the active <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group had more callus (p < 0. 001) than the standard <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group.

40|$|Background: <b>Locked</b> bridge <b>plating</b> {{relies on}} {{secondary}} bone healing, which requires interfragmentary motion for callus formation. This study evaluated healing of fractures stabilized with a <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct and a far cortical locking construct, {{which is a}} modified <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> approach that promotes interfragmentary motion. The study tested whether far cortical locking constructs can improve fracture-healing compared with standard <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs. Methods: In an established ovine tibial osteotomy model with a 3 -mm gap size, twelve osteotomies were randomly stabilized with <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> or far cortical locking constructs applied medially. The far cortical locking constructs were designed to provide 84 % lower stiffness than the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs and permitted nearly parallel gap motion. Fracture-healing was monitored on weekly radiographs. After the animals were killed at week 9, healed tibiae were analyzed by computed tomography, mechanical testing in torsion, and histological examination. Results: Callus on weekly radiographs was greater in the far cortical locking constructs than in the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs. At week 9, the far cortical locking group had a 36 % greater callus volume (p = 0. 03) and a 44 % higher bone mineral content (p = 0. 013) than the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> group. Callus in the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> specimens was asymmetric, having 49 % less bonemineral content in the medial callus than in the lateral callus (p = 0. 003).

30|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> technology for periarticular distal femur fracture fixation {{led to the}} design of a similar fixation construct for the proximal lateral tibia [17, 18]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> function as internal fixators with the locking screws creating a fixed angle construct providing angular stability. The fixed angle nature of the <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> circumvents the need for additional medial stabilization, reducing the risk of injury to medial soft tissues [19]. Some literature has suggested that the use of <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> technology to be biomechanically equivalent to the historical control of double plating [20 – 22], with the advantage of less soft tissue dissection. Numerous studies have reported successful outcomes with the use of single lateral <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> fixation of complex bicondylar tibial plateau fractures [9, 20, 23 – 26].

30|$|The {{advent of}} modern <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> has allowed {{improved}} fixation of the peri-articular fractures. Numerous {{studies have demonstrated}} and confirmed the increased stability provided by <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> at the distal femur, proximal tibia, calcaneum, distal radius and proximal humerus [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. This increased strength of fixation has in some cases obviated the need for dual column fixation.

30|$|The final aspect {{that should}} be taken into {{consideration}} is the biomechanical behavior of different types of plates. Several studies have confirmed the biomechanical superiority of <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> over conventional plates [8, 26]. This has also contributed to the increasing number of fractures treated with palmar <b>locking</b> <b>plates.</b> However, the biomechanical equality of palmar versus dorsal <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> still remains debatable. While several studies show no biomechanical differences between the two implants [27], others still advocate the biomechanical superiority of the dorsal plates, which are supposed to be stiffer and stronger [28]. As long as no undisputable proof of the biomechanical equality between palmar and dorsal <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> exists, the use of dorsal locking implants for the treatment of fractures in high risk for secondary loss of reduction may be taken into consideration.|$|R
30|$|One {{patient in}} the volar <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group {{developed}} complex regional pain syndrome type 1 that improved within 2  months by physical therapy and pain medication. Swelling, inflammation and occasional pain were observed in two patients in the external fixation group and one {{patient in the}} volar <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group.|$|R
30|$|They {{concluded}} that the maximal subsidence found in the specimens was mainly reversible or elastic and depended on the fixation technique with the <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> group having a significantly higher maximal subsidence. The amount of irreversible or plastic deformation did not differ between the two fixation methods. The authors felt that this difference was {{due to a lack}} of interfragmentary compression in the <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> group. In the <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> group the meta-diaphyseal gap remained in the specimens. The authors also stated that the higher amount of reversible motion may be desirable because this micromotion may enhance fracture callus formation. It was {{concluded that}} the <b>locked</b> <b>plates</b> had similar amounts of plastic deformation compared to a dual plating construct with less soft tissue stripping and therefore might be a better construct in the treatment of these complex fractures.|$|R
40|$|Contemporary <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> promote {{biological}} fixation through indirect reduction {{techniques and}} by elevating the plate from the bone. They have improved fixation strength in osteoporotic bone. Periarticular <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> are rapidly being adopted for bridge plating of periprosthetic femur fractures. When these plates {{are used for}} indirect reduction and bridge plating osteosynthesis, fracture union occurs by secondary bone healing with callus formation which is stimulated by interfragmentary motion. In two patients with similar periprosthetic femur fractures treated with periarticular <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> one fracture healed by ample callus formation while the other resulted in a non-union and had no callus formation six months post-operatively. The case, which progressed to secondar y bone healing with callus formation, exhibited varus migration {{as a result of}} loss of fixation. The non-union case retained stable fixation. The difference in outcome may indicate that callus formation was promoted by interfragmentary motion secondary to loss of fixation. Conversely, in absence of fixation failure, callus formation was suppressed by stable fixation with a stiff <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> construct which reduced interfragmentary motion. These observations suggest that <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs should be sufficiently flexible when applied for bridge plating of comminuted fractures to promote callus formation...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> {{transmit}} load through fixed-angle locking screws instead {{of relying on}} plate-to-bone compression. Therefore, locking screws may induce higher stress at the screw-bone interface than that seen with con-ventional nonlocked plating. This study investigated whether <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> in osteoporotic diaphyseal bone causes a greater periprosthetic fracture risk than conventional plating because of stress concentrations at the plate end. It further investigated the effect of replacing the locked end screwwith a conventional screw {{on the strength of}} the fixation construct. Methods: Three different bridge-plate constructs were applied to a validated surrogate of the osteoporotic femoral diaphysis. Constructs were tested dynamically to failure in bending, torsion, and axial loading to determine failure loads and failuremodes. A <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct was compared with a nonlocked conventional plating construct. Subsequently, the outermost locking screw in <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs was replaced with a conventional screw to reduce stress concentrations at the plate end. Results: Compared with the conventional <b>plating</b> construct, the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct was 22 % weaker in bending (p = 0. 013), comparably strong in torsion (p = 0. 05), and 15 % stronger in axial compression (p = 0. 017). Substituting the locked end screw with a conventional screw increased the construct strength by 40 % in bending (p = 0. 001) but had no significant effect on construct strength under torsion (p = 0. 22) and compressive loading (p = 0. 53) compared with the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether one can achieve stable fixation of a two column (transverse) acetabular fracture by only fixing a single column with a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> and unicortical <b>locking</b> screws. We hypothesized that a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> applied to the anterior column of a transverse acetabular fracture would create a construct that is more rigid than a non-locking plate, and that this construct would be biomechanically comparable to two column fixation. Methods Using urethane foam models of the pelvis, we simulated transverse acetabular fractures and stabilized them with 1) an anterior column plate with bicortical screws, 2) an anterior <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> with unicortical screws, 3) an anterior plate and posterior column lag screw, and 4) a posterior plate with an anterior column lag screw. These constructs were mechanically loaded on a servohydraulic material testing machine. Construct stiffness and fracture displacement were measured. Result and Discussion We found that two column fixation is 54 % stiffer than a single column fixation with a conventional plate with bicortical screws. There was no significant difference between fixation with an anterior column <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> with unicortical screws and an anterior plate with posterior column lag screw. We detected a non-significant trend towards more stiffness for the anterior <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> compared to the anterior non-locking plate. Conclusion In conclusion, a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> construct of the anterior column provides less stability than a traditional both column construct with posterior plate and anterior column lag screw. However, the locking construct offers greater strength than a non-locking, bicortical construct, which in addition often requires extensive contouring and its application is oftentimes accompanied by the risk of neurovascular damage. </p...|$|R
