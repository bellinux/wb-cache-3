40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present {{information}} about new display technologies that are competing with <b>print.</b> <b>Display</b> technology continues to mature, as in the case of full-color OLED, which has been incorporated into its first consumer product, The Kodak EasyShare LS 633 digital camera. Digital ink pioneer E Ink, through its partnership with Philips Electronics, will introduce its first commercial product in early 2004. Gyricon Media, the inventor of the electronic paper category, has opened its first manufacturing plant. In addition, new flexible display technologies have been introduced, such as SiPix Microcup, and the electronic display form-factor has been scaled up considerably by companies such as Magink and NOVUS. These companies are poised to produce large-format electronic displays that rival the size of traditional 30 -sheet billboards. Developments continue to evolve in displays of all sizes, from those the size of cell phone to those on the sides of buildings...|$|E
40|$|Reading on the World Wide Web {{has become}} a daily habit nowadays. This {{can be seen from}} the {{perspective}} of changes on readers’ tendency to be more interested in materials from the internet, than the printed media. Taking these developments into account, it is important for web-based instructional designers to choose the appropriate font, especially for long blocks of text, in order to enhance the level of students’ readability. Accordingly, this study aims to evaluate the effects of serif and san serif font in the category of screen fonts and print fonts, in terms of Malay text readability on websites. For this purpose, four fonts were selected, namely Georgia (serif) and Verdana (san serif) for the first respondents and Times New Roman (serif) and Arial (san serif) for the second respondents. Georgia and Verdana were designed for computer screens display. Meanwhile, Times New Roman and Arial were originally designed for print media. Readability test on a computer screen was conducted on 48 undergraduates. Overall, the results showed that there was no significant difference between the redability of serif and san serif font of both screen display category and <b>print</b> <b>display</b> category. Accordingly, the research findings and the literature overview, suggest that Verdana and followed by Georgia as the better choice in displaying long text on websites. Likewise, as anticipated, Times New Roman and Arial fonts provide good readability for print media, which reinfoces their status as the printing font category. However, with the current computer screen capability, it can still be an alternative option for instructional web developers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Macroaggregated albumin {{labeled with}} {{radioactive}} tracers {{was selected for}} diagnostic purposes because of the rapid metabolism of the material once it had been introduced into the vascular system. A number of reports are now available which evaluate the clinical usefulness of this procedure [1 - 9]. Several investiga tions of the toxicity, distribution, physiological response and metabolism of the aggregated albumin have been published [1 - 3, 5 - 8, 10]. Further studies of {{the fate of the}} injected particle are reported in this paper. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two groups of subjects were selected for this study. The first group was composed of twenty adults admitted to the hospital for a variety of reasons. There were eleven females and nine males ranging in age from 33 to 78 years. [Eighteen of these patients had pulmonary lesions including carcinoma, in. fiam matory processes, and emphysema]. Two of these received 150 microcuries of 1311 macro aggregated albumin 2 and the remainder 300 microcuries. Six different lots of material were used. The aggregate was not examined microscopically for size; however, three of these were from the same batches reported by Taplin, et at [11] who found that about 70 - 75 %were in the 10 - 20 mC range. At 8 : 00 a. m. {{on the morning of the}} procedure the patient received the MAA intravenously in a supine position.
