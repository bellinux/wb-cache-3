40|$|China and Inner Asia Session 277 : Reconceptualizing Virtue and Beauty in Unconventional Genres: The Exemplary Women in Late Imperial and Early Republican ChinaThis {{paper is}} an attempt to {{illuminate}} a facet of the process of “becoming ‘new women’” among the guixiu (gentry women) of the eighteenth-and-nineteenth-century China, namely, women as guardians of family health. Through an examination of the genres of family letters and medical treatises employed by two women - the “exemplary wife” Chen Ershi (1785 - 1821), and the woman doctor and hygiene advocate Zeng Yi (1852 - 1927) - I argue that the late Qing hygiene drive, with its logic of building a strong national body by building healthy bodies of the Chinese people, in fact found one of its allies in the guixiu who took on themselves the duties of <b>preventing</b> <b>illnesses</b> and of caring for the sick in their households. The family letters of Chen Ershi demarcate a space apart from that represented by the poetry of women in that they reveal the everyday challenges that a gentry wife needed to face. Among them, guarding the health of the old and the young was pivotal. It was precisely from this wifely duty that Zeng Yi, herself also a guixiu, proceeded to prescribe remedies for the “illness” of the nation. Her treatises on medicine and hygiene signaled her participation in a male-dominated genre to address the crises of her time. What Chen looked up to as female exemplariness in fact carried over to Zeng’s redefinition of womanhood in a time of radical changes, and expanded into prescription after prescription for the “sick bodies” of China. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of {{disabling}} deficits is neurological affections. Many times, {{the evolution of the}} condition leads to a diminution of the patient’s life quality. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is part of the neurological rehabilitation process that comprises all the actions one can take in order to increase a patient’s integration and autonomy degree from a social and financial point of view. FES is a method based on substituting the commands that are usually transmitted by the nervous system with an electric impulse. The use of such a method on different body areas required the development of some adequate devices, starting with the stimulator itself and finishing with {{the way in which the}} stimulus is conveyed to the effectors. Textile materials that incorporate sensors and, mainly, the clothing products that have such components in their structure, have a high applicability potential; they can be used for <b>preventing</b> <b>illnesses</b> and for the rehabilitation of seniors, of people who are confined to bed, sportsmen, people who suffer from long-term illnesses, disabled people, thus diminishing the time one spends in the hospital. A possible solution for manufacturing incorporated textile electrodes consists in the insertion of some electro-conductive yarns onto textile surfaces by using a variety of technologies. The project approaches the use of knitting, a widespread textile technology. The incorporated knitted electrodes were accomplished by applying the knitting technology on single circular small diameter machines. Thus, we were able to obtain a variety of knitted articles as two-dimensional or three-dimensional tubular knitted fabric. Their dimensions, structures, and parameters correspond to the typo-dimensions of the human body and to the purpose for which the clothing product was designed.

40|$|Annual {{influenza}} epidemics are {{a significant}} contributor to morbidity and mortality in the United States and around the world. Older adults, individuals 65 {{years of age and}} older, are disproportionately affected by influenza. In 2009 a high-dose influenza vaccine was licensed for use in older adults. The efficacy and effectiveness of this influenza vaccine have been and continue to be studied today, in 2015. However, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the body primarily responsible for developing recommendations on how to use vaccines to control disease in the United States, recommends that older adults receive an influenza vaccine and does not distinguish between the standard-dose and high-dose vaccines. Given the growing body of research around the high-dose influenza vaccine, this literature review seeks to identify the efficacy of the high-dose influenza vaccine in older adults as well as facilitators and barriers to influenza vaccination among older adults. The author conducted {{a review of the literature}} published between January 1, 2004 and March 1, 2015 on these topics. Only 12 peer-reviewed articles were selected for inclusion from the 714 articles identified by the review. Four were randomized controlled trials, two were systematic literature reviews, four were retrospective data analyses, and two were cross-sectional studies. The studies regarding the efficacy of the high-dose influenza vaccine were of high quality, however the articles assessing factors associated with influenza vaccine uptake among older adults were limited in scope and generalizability. This review identified a considerable gap in the literature related to the facilitators and barriers to influenza vaccination among older adults at the individual, interpersonal, and community levels. Qualitative and mixed-methods research is needed to move from understanding who is and is not receiving an annual influenza vaccine to why and how individuals and communities are receiving annual influenza vaccines. This review is of public health significance because understanding and preventing influenza through the use of the high-dose influenza vaccine has the potential to significantly improve public health through <b>preventing</b> <b>illnesses</b> and hospitalizations, reducing influenza mortality, and reducing expenditures related to influenza morbidity...|$|E

Our understanding about how age and sex affect the immune system is limited, and basic and translational research aimed at improving vaccines and immune responses of older persons is needed. In the meantime, fully implementing current vaccine recommendations, particularly those for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, can save thousands of lives and prevent illnesses in persons> 50 years of age. In the United States, the elderly are more likely to die of a vaccine-preventable disease. Adult deaths from influenza (≈ 36, 000 /y) (1, 2), invasive pneumococcal disease (≈ 9, 000 /y) (3), and hepatitis B (≈ 5, 000 /y) (4) exceed vaccine-preventable deaths among children (≈ 50 /y) by a ratio of ≈ 1, 000 : 1. For each of these diseases, case-fatality rates rise with increasing age. This disparity can be addressed through adult vaccination programs, which are cost-effective and life-saving. Women constitute most of the adult U. S. population> 50 years of age (60 % of those 75 years of age and 70 % of those 85 years of age). The immune system does not function as well with advancing age (5). For example, T-cell functions diminish with age, as evidenced by the increased prevalence of anergy to mycobacterial and fungal skin-test antigens and the increased frequency and severity of herpes zoster infection with age. B-cell function diminishes, as seen with the lessened humoral response (immunoglobulin [Ig] M, IgG, and IgA) to certain vaccines (e. g., hepatitis B, influenza, pneumococcal vaccine), and the protective efficacy of these vaccines also decreases as recipients age (6, 7). Differences in Immunologic Response by Sex Very little is known about differences in the immunologic response to vaccines or their protective efficacy, according to sex and age. Higher antibody responses have been noted in women after hepatitis B vaccination (8, 9) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} thesis presents a programme entitled Health in Kindergarten, which aims at teaching pre-school children how to live healthy. This programme is primarily focused on <b>preventing</b> <b>illnesses,</b> since a healthy life-style can often help us avoid diseases before they develop. The programme affects the following areas: chronic non-contagious diseases (diet, physical activity), chronic contagious diseases (hygiene, infection prevention, vaccination), injuries and poisoning (safe physical environment and behaviour), mental and emotional health (interpersonal relations, self-image, violence, bad habits, stress). The thesis also explains reasons why the programme was developed, what its main goals and purposes are, areas which it influences, how the programme is performed in kindergarten, the work methods within the programme, what the conditions are for a kindergarten to be accepted in the programme, the connection between kindergarten curriculum and the Health in Kindergarten programme {{and in the end}} the thesis presents the promotion of health in Germany. In the empirical part we have carried out a research by using a questionnaire to establish whether there are any differences related to healthy life-style between a kindergarten included in the Health in Kindergarten programme and a kindergarten that is not included in such a programme.

We have also tried to establish what the teachers’ and teacher assistants’ attitudes towards health are and what their activities within the process of permanent education in the field of healthy life-style are. We used a descriptive method and a non-coincidental chance pattern of kindergarten teachers and teacher assistants from a kindergarten included in the Health in Kindergarten programme and from a kindergarten not included in such a programme. Results showed that there are differences between both kindergartens and that the kindergarten included in the Health in Kindergarten programme follows more principles of healthy life-style...|$|E
40|$|Evidenciar a 'dimensão gestionária' na atividade de teleatendimento é o {{principal}} objetivo deste artigo. A perspectiva ergológica entende o trabalho como encontro singular com uma tarefa a ser realizada, que com suas variabilidades sempre possui uma gestão a ser feita pelos trabalhadores(as). Essa gestão está intimamente relacionada à capacidade de definir e produzir a saúde e a doença. Para apreender a complexidade e a singularidade do trabalho em teleatendimento, para além do visível e quantificável das prescrições, buscou-se a utilização da técnica de Instruções ao Sósia e dos Encontros sobre o Trabalho, na perspectiva de propiciar uma reflexão e um discurso sobre o trabalho pelos(as) trabalhadores(as). As renormatizações foram observadas em outro uso das prescrições: pausas, script e voz, através dos quais os(as) operadores(as) imprimem sua marca. O valor do emprego se contrapõe às repercussões negativas para a saúde, o adoecimento e o sofrimento, com controle rigoroso do espaço, do tempo e do comportamento. Conclui-se que a consideração da 'dimensão gestionária', vista na sua singularidade, deve ser reconhecida pelos(as) próprios(as) trabalhadores(as), profissionais da saúde e pesquisadores, como elemento fundamental para a prevenção dos adoecimentos e para a promoção da saúde. The {{principal objective}} {{of this study is}} to highlight the 'managerial dimension' in telemarketing activity. The ergological perspective understands work as a unique encounter with a task to be performed, which, within its variability, always requires management by the workers. This management is intimately related to the capacity to define and produce illness and health. In order to grasp the complexity and singularity of working in telemarketing, beyond that which is visible and quantifiable in the prescriptions, the use of the Instructions for the Double technique and Meetings about Work was tried, with a view to providing the workers with a reflection upon and a discourse about the work. Restandardizations were observed in another use of the prescriptions: pauses, script and voice, by means of which telemarketers make their mark. The value of the jobin contrasts to the negative repercussions on health, falling ill and suffering, with close monitoring of behavior, time and space. The conclusion is that health professionals, researchers and the workers themselves must acknowledge the considering of the 'managerial dimension', in its singularity, as a fundamental element for <b>preventing</b> <b>illnesses</b> and promoting health...|$|E

40|$|This study maps {{research}} concerning person environment interrelationships {{with health}} and wellbeing outcomes. The {{purpose of this}} study is to provide insights into the inter-relationship between the built environment (BE) and human health and wellbeing as it is conveyed in research literature. It particularly focuses on literature that connects built environment, emotions, feelings, mind and body. This thesis therefore provides a review of relevant literature on the physical environment, with a focus on person environment (PE) relationship that may influence the person's psychological and physiological systems consequently affecting health and wellbeing. Specifically, psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is used to identify dimensions of the BE which are significant for this study. The understanding of PE interrelationships to health outcomes is achieved by undertaking a transdisciplinary outlook. To conceptualise the 'person' as a whole and the workings of the mind and human system PNI has been recognised as a main platform. PNI is the study of mind-body relationships (Evans, et al, 2000), providing a scientific framework which captures the understanding of the inter-relationship of the mind to the neuroendocrine systems and the immune systems with the aim of understanding the influence of the mind on eliciting as well as <b>preventing</b> <b>illnesses.</b> The work was motivated by the need for better understanding of the human interaction/transaction in an interior environment and their consequences on health. An exploration of literature from both the environmental and health fields provided a knowledge base upon which to develop an understanding of the interrelationship. Research has demonstrated a link between the BE and wellbeing, however, this is limited in its application and/or scope. For example, over the past years there has been an increasing amount of research showing the possible influence of the environment in reducing stress (Sommer & Oslen, 1980; Kaplan, 1983; O'Neill, 1991; Wapner & Demick, 2000; Parsons & Tassinary, 2002, Frumkin, 2006). In addition, there is growing evidence that indicates there is a relationship between BE and health including the psychological and physiological systems, in healthcare environments (Ulrich & Zimring, 2004). However, while there is ample research in the areas of environmental stressors and other determinants of the environment in contributing to health, less research has been undertaken in studying the impact of the environment on health (Evans& McCoy, 1998). The potential of the environment in contributing to the mental wellbeing of a person and how this could affect the physical health therefore needs further investigation (Solomon, 1996). The methodology followed was Coopers (1998) 'research synthesis' and the tool to sort the domains and PE interrelationships was adapted from White's (1989) 'space adjacency analysis'. The scope of this study was limited to explorations of literature that inquired into PE relationships that fit into the primarily established 'integrative systems model'; a parameter that enabled categorisation of the literature into the areas that related to the PNI framework. The findings illustrate that the person is interrelated to the environment in several ways and can be interpreted and explained in terms of various dimensions such as the psychological, physical, social, and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, empirical research indicates that the environment impacts on a person's health and wellbeing through psychological and physiological systems. PNI acknowledges the interrelationship of the mind and body systems contributing to an integrative systems model of human health and wellbeing. As an outcome, the study has produced an analysis method and a navigation map of the various literature domains related to PE interrelationships in terms of health and wellbeing. This has been facilitated by the development of, a 'PE integrative systems model'. Apart from demonstrating the need for transdisciplinary research and contributing to research methodology, the study also adds to the current design knowledge base providing BE professionals and creators with a better understanding of the health outcomes from PE interrelationships...|$|E
