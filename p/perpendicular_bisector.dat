5|$|Some {{of these}} special cases are {{much easier to}} solve than the general case of three given circles. The two {{simplest}} cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points (PPP) or tangent to three lines (LLL), which were solved first by Euclid in his Elements. For example, the PPP problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must lie on the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>bisector</b> line of any two. Hence, the center {{is the point of}} intersection of any two perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the LLL case, the center must lie on a line bisecting the angle at the three intersection points between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the intersection point of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every intersection point of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general LLL problem.|$|E
25|$|Apollonius of Perga {{showed that}} a circle may also {{be defined as the}} set of points in a plane having a {{constant}} ratio (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, A and B. (The set of points where the distances are equal is the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>bisector</b> of segment AB, a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn about two points.|$|E
25|$|A <b>perpendicular</b> <b>bisector</b> of {{a side of}} a {{triangle}} is a straight line passing through {{the midpoint of the}} side and being perpendicular to it, i.e. forming a right angle with it. The three perpendicular bisectors meet in a single point, the triangle's circumcenter, usually denoted by O; this point is the center of the circumcircle, the circle passing through all three vertices. The diameter of this circle, called the circumdiameter, can be found from the law of sines stated above. The circumcircle's radius is called the circumradius.|$|E

2500|$|As shown {{first by}} Apollonius of Perga, a {{hyperbola}} {{can be used}} to trisect any angle, a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex O, which intersects the sides of the angle at points A and B. Next draw the line segment with endpoints [...] A and B and its <b>perpendicular</b> <b>bisector</b> [...] Construct a hyperbola of eccentricity e=2 with [...] as directrix and B as a focus. Let P be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle POB trisects angle AOB.|$|E
2500|$|Proof. An {{isometry}} {{is completely}} determined by {{its effect on}} three independent (not collinear) points. So suppose p1, p2, p3 map to q1, q2, q3; we can generate a sequence of mirrors to achieve this as follows. If p1 and q1 are distinct, choose their <b>perpendicular</b> <b>bisector</b> as mirror. Now p1 maps to q1; and we will pass all further mirrors through q1, leaving it fixed. Call the images of p2 and p3 under this reflection p2 and p3. If q2 is distinct from p2, bisect the angle at q1 with a new mirror. With p1 and p2 now in place, p3 is at p3; {{and if it is}} not in place, a final mirror through q1 and q2 will flip it to q3. Thus at most three reflections suffice to reproduce any plane isometry. âˆŽ ...|$|E
