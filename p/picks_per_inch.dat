50|$|Balanced {{plain weaves}} are fabrics {{in which the}} warp and weft are made of threads of the same weight (size) and {{the same number of}} ends per inch as <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Picks per inch/Inch (or p.p.i.) is {{the number}} of weft threads per inch of woven fabric. A pick is a single weft thread, hence the term. In general, the higher the <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> the finer the fabric is.|$|E
5000|$|Fabric, cloth {{typically}} {{produced by}} weaving, knitting or knotting textile fibers, yarns or threads, {{is measured in}} units such as the momme, thread count (a measure of the coarseness or fineness of fabric), ends per inch (e.p.i) and <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (p.p.i).|$|E
25|$|Ends and Picks: Picks {{refer to}} the weft, ends {{refer to the}} warp. The {{coarseness}} of the cloth can be expressed {{as the number of}} <b>picks</b> and ends <b>per</b> quarter <b>inch</b> square, or <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> square. Ends is always written first. For example: Heavy domestics are made from coarse yarns, such as 10's to 14's warp and weft, and about 48 ends and 52 picks.|$|R
50|$|Ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is very {{commonly}} used by weavers who must use {{the number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> in order to pick the right reed to weave with. The number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> varies on the pattern to be woven and {{the thickness of the}} thread. Plain weaves generally use half the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> for the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> whereas denser weaves like a twill weave will use a higher ratio like two thirds of the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Finer threads require more threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than thick ones, and thus result in a higher number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R

50|$|Golden threads are {{obtained}} from Surat, the quality being 1200 yard (1080 meters) per tola (11.664 grams). Gold threads {{are used in}} double {{and one of the}} finest varieties {{so much so that the}} closely woven surface looks like a mirror. The texture of the fabric is fairly compact with about 160 ends and 170 <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (2.6 cm).|$|E
50|$|Osnaburg fabric {{may have}} been first {{imported}} into English-speaking countries from Osnaburg. Originally made from flax yarns, {{it has also been}} made from tow or jute yarns, and from flax or tow warp with a mixed or jute weft. The finer and better qualities form a kind of common sheeting, and the various kinds may contain from 20 to 36 threads per inch and 10 to 15 <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{prepare to}} weave, the warp must be made. By hand {{this is done}} {{with the help of}} a warping board. The length the warp is made is about a quarter to half yard more than the amount of cloth needed. Warping boards come in a variety of shapes, from the two nearest door handles to a board with pegs on it, or a device called a warping mill that looks similar to a swift. Warping the loom, mean {{threading}} each end through an eye in a heddle, and then sleying it through the reed. The warp is set (verb) at X ends per inch. It then has a sett (noun) of X ends per inch. The weft is measured in <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (25 mm): The {{most common}} {{measurement}} of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade. It is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler, and then {{counting the number of}} points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark, inclusive (that is, including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark). There is always one more point <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than there are teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (e.g., a saw with 14 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 13 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and a saw with 10 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 9 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Some saws {{do not have the same}} number of teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> throughout their entire length, but the vast majority do. Those with more teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> at the toe are described as having incremental teeth, in order to make starting the saw cut easier.|$|R
5000|$|Ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (EPI or e.p.i.) is {{the number}} of warp threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> of woven fabric. In general, the higher the ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> the finer the fabric is. The current fashion is to wear T-shirts with a higher thread count, such as soft and {{comfortable}} [...] "30 single" [...] tee shirt that has 30 threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> as contrasted to the standard T-shirt with an 18 thread count <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The model 001 was {{announced}} on April 15, 1975 and first shipped July 1976. It had a print resolution of 144 pels <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (or dots <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> pels are print elements) vertically and 180 pels <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> horizontally. It could print at 10,020 to 20,040 {{lines per minute}} depending on line density (which could range from 6 to 12 lines <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} ends per inch {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the stage of manufacture. Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number of ends per inch, which {{is directly related to the}} size reed being used. After weaving the number of ends per inch will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends per inch (and <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven. Tightly woven fabric shrinks more (and thus the number of ends per inch increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more elastic yarns and fibers.|$|E

50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Threads {{per inch}} and yarn count {{are some of}} the most {{important}} parameters that affect both weaving performance and fabric property. Experimental studies were conducted by weaving fabrics with three different <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (PPI) and weft counts. The study shows that weaving performance is affected by the too high cover factor. Cover factor was calculated by dividing the threads/inch by the square root of the English cotton count and end breakage was taken as an indication of weaving performance. It was observed that when the count as well as threads/inch of one series of yarn changes the crimp % i. e. the consumption of both series of yarns are affected. It was also observed that, as expected, when the threads/inch increases the fabric strength also increases but at higher threads/inch the gain in strength is relatively more...|$|E

40|$|Flexible {{printed circuit}} boards {{continue}} to be a high-growth technology in the area of electrical interconnectivity. Over traditional rigid {{printed circuit boards}} (PCB’s), wire and wire harnesses, flexible circuit boards provide considerable weight, space, and cost savings This study investigates using conductive inks for printing circuits onto flexible nonwoven substrates as a low-cost alternative to traditional PCB manufacturing, because the emerging generation of nonwovens can offer wearability, printability, lightweight, durability and washability. In this study, instead of incorporating conductive paths by weaving or knitting conductive yarns into the structure of the fabrics, conductive inks are used to print directly onto nonwovens by using polymer thick film technology. There are challenges in printing on fabrics such as achieving printing resolution and durability. Spatial geometry of structure is a critical property for print resolution. The traditional woven fabrics exhibit poor digital printability because the ink disperses mostly through the inter-yarn interstices. The spatial resolution is primarily a function of yarn diameter and thread spacing (e. g., end and <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> in woven fabrics).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{statistical}} models for predicting the air permeability and light transmission properties of woven cotton fabrics and determine the level of correlation between the two parameters. Plain woven fabrics were developed with different warp and weft linear densities, ends per inch and <b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> After desizing, scouring, bleaching, drying and conditioning, the air permeability and light transmission properties of the fabric samples were determined. Regression analysis results showed statistically significant effect of the fabric ends, picks and warp linear density on both the fabric air permeability and light transmission. Correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relation between the fabric air permeability and light transmission. A linear equation was also formulated to find the fabric air permeability through transmission of light intensity.

40|$|Control of {{the warp}} and weft yarn tension is an {{important}} factor. In this research, effect of warp yarn tension variations {{on the quality of}} greige and dyed woven fabrics was investigated. Six fabric samples (three Plain and three Twill weaves) were woven on shuttle loom at varied warp yarn tension. The fabric samples were then pre-treated and dyed (Drimarene Red Cl 5 B, 3 % owf) using laboratory singeing machine and HT dyeing machine. Greige fabric quality such as fabric inspection, fabric length, fabric width, GSM (Gram per Square Meter), EPI (Ends per Inch), PPI (<b>Picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>Inch),</b> and dyed fabric quality such as L*, a*, b*, C, h o, (K/S) ?max and fastness properties were assessed according to the standard.

30|$|It {{can also}} be seen from Table  1 that {{cellulase}} treatment by washing of the denim garments with cellulase at 0.5 % concentration caused increase in GSM (fabric weight) of the garments, whereas weight loss (GSM decreased) results have previously been obtained with direct and reactive dyed cotton fabric substrate. During weaving, cotton fabrics are subjected to considerable tensions, particularly in the warp direction. In subsequent finishing processes, such as calendaring this stretch is increased and temporarily set in the fabric. The fabric is then in a state of dimensional instability (Cookson 1992). Subsequently when the denim garment was thoroughly wetted in enzyme washing, it tended to revert its more stable dimensions which results in the contraction of the yarns. This effect is usually greater in the warp direction than in the weft direction. This is known as relaxation shrinkage. Due to relaxation shrinkage, PPI (<b>picks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> is higher in treated, compared to untreated denim garments. As a result, fabric GSM is increased at different cellulase concentrations and 2 % cellulase concentration is optimum result (Table  1). Although hydrolysis occurred in cellulase washing, at the same time relaxation shrinkage occurred, and the GSM (fabric weight) of denim garments increased slightly. But the use of higher concentrations of cellulase (3.5 %) brought losses in fabric weight due to more hydrolysis of cellulose. It was observed that 2 % concentration of cellulase results in the maximum increase in fabric weight, compared to the other concentrations.|$|E
