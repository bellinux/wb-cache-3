25|$|Also {{at about}} this time, the {{attention}} of the world community (as manifested in the UN) began to focus on the same theme, similarly re-calibrating its concern for minorities into concern for the rights of indigenous peoples. In 1982 the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (then called Sub-Commission on <b>Prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>Discrimination</b> and Protection of Minorities) was established by a decision of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and in 1985 work began on drafting a declaration of rights (a process which lasted 22 years). In due course, 1993 was proclaimed the International Year of the World's Indigenous People.

2500|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In Pakistan 1967 was a year of multiplying activities. The Bahá'í youth of Karachi sponsored a youth symposium on world peace, {{the community at large}} elected a woman to the national assembly, for the first time elected a local assembly in Rahim Yar Khan, and held a reception for a Bahá'í from the Sokoine University of Agriculture in Morogoro with guests including executive engineers, attorneys, businessmen and industrialists, doctors, press representatives, bankers and university students. In 1972 the assembly of Karachi held an observance of United Nations Day which over one hundred people attended. Talks presented dealt with the elimination of racial discrimination. Also in 1972 the government of Pakistan invited the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís to send a delegate to participate in a Conference of the Religious Minorities. By 1974 there were Bahá'ís that were members of the Bhil tribe in Thatta. In 1975 Bahá'ís held meetings for the International Women's Year and a seminar on [...] "Education in Pakistan." [...] In 1976 Bahá'ís were invited to participate in a week long celebration of minorities. Later Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'ís gathered to commemorate Letter of the Living Táhirih and a Bahá'í was acknowledged as part of the delegation from Pakistan to an Asian conference on religion and peace by the chief Muslim delegate late in the conference. In 1977 membership of the Bahá'ís reached the state of Kalat and Tharparkar. The 1977 winter school gathered 250 Bahá'ís while 1978's gathered 350. In 1978 conditions in Afghanistan, including the Soviet invasion, lead to many Afghan Bahá'ís being arrested in that country and many fled to Pakistan. Iranian Bahá'ís also fled to Pakistan from Iran in 1979 due to the Iranian Revolution. In 1979 the New Day Montessori School was established with ten students but would grow in time to three hundred and most of the students were not Bahá'ís. At this time Bahá'ís report there were 83 assemblies amongst many hundreds of places Bahá'ís lived which included three district centers and there were 47 delegates to the national convention. In winter 1979–80 Zahida Hina gave a speech on the life and works of Táhirih at a women's conference. In spring 1980 for the International Year of the Child the local assembly of Hyderabad organized an event that showcased children's art, essays, singing and quiz competitions, and the topic of the elimination of racial prejudice was a theme in Bahá'í gatherings in several cities. In the summer an institute and a seminar were held for children and youth covering a variety of topics including [...] "The Role of Baha'i Youth during Political Upheavals." [...] That fall and winter further gatherings were held, this time commemorating the United Nations Day (which highlighted the Commission for <b>Prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>Discrimination</b> and Protection of Minorities) and a talk by a professor of Superior Science College (see Government Colleges affiliated with the University of Karachi) which encouraged discussion on the elimination of prejudices. Before spring 1981 the youth of Karachi organized a conference recapitulating many of the same themes of games, quizzes, a poster contest and round of prayers. Come April and May there was a broad attempt at engaging several interest groups from primary and secondary schools, universities and colleges, professional publishers and the general public through a radio broadcast. Still that spring, president of Pakistan, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, wrote an executive order categorizing the Bahá'í Faith as a non-Muslim religion. That December the Bahá'ís again held an observance of United Nations Day in several cities that received press coverage from print and radio. Representatives of the Muslim, Christian, Hindu, Zoroastrian and Bahá'í communities gathered for a symposium in the fall of 1982 with the theme, [...] "The Increasing Social Unrest in the World Today and its Solution" [...] while presentations were made to judges and lawyers about the Persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran. Still in the fall a women's conference brought together sixty non-Baha'i women who were wives of judges, university professors, headmistresses and teachers to hear talks. And in January 1983 a multi-faith presentation covered [...] "the need of religion" [...] on World Religion Day held in Karachi. In February and April Bahá'ís gathered for regional school sessions in Karachi, Quetta, Rawalpindi and Sibi. In August assemblies were formed {{for the first time in}} Sialkot, near Lahore, and Multan, the birthplace of Letter of the Living, Sa'id-i-Hindi. In September a symposium on Táhirih was held with presentations including Sahar Ansari, a professor of Urdu at the University of Karachi and Zahida Hina with the attendance of noted Pakistani poet, Jon Elia. Also in September a Bahá'í women's group decided to provide treats to students at a government school for physically and mentally handicapped children which evolved into the first set of volunteers helping in the school ever had. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. From December 1984 through July 1985 more than ten vocational or tutorial schools had been set up in several cities and run by Bahá'ís or Bahá'í assemblies. Also in the early 1980s, Bahá'ís in Pakistan started social and economic development projects like small-scale medical camps. In the middle 1980s Iranian Bahá'í refugees who had come to Pakistan began to arrive in other countries. The office attending to the refugees attracted visitors from governments and institutions including members of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (LSHCR) in Islamabad and Lahore; an official from the Ministry of Justice of the Nelherlands; a delegation from Finland that included the Ambassador from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ambassador of the Embassy of Finland in Tehran, and three senior officials of the Finnish government; and the Australian Immigration Officer from Canberra. In 1985 the Universal House of Justice published The Promise of World Peace and in 1986 and the assembly of Hyderabad used the occasion of the International Year of Peace to sponsor a symposium on world peace and present the document to attendees. In 1989 Bahá'ís from Karachi moved to and elected the first local assembly in Muzaffarabad while Bahá'ís from Quetta sponsored a week long series of student competitions that were run in 11 schools in Baluchistan – each day different activities were run; The Elimination of Prejudice, national songs, a quiz game, and a drama contest were among the events held. In 1998, when the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan arrested many Bahá'ís, many fled to Pakistan but many were able to return by 2002.|$|E
