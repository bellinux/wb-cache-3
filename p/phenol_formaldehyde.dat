25|$|Formaldehyde is {{a common}} {{precursor}} to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include urea formaldehyde resin, melamine resin, <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> resin, polyoxymethylene plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics crease-resistant. Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and brake shoes. The value of sales of formaldehyde and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP) of the United States and Canada. Including indirect employment, over 4 million people work in the formaldehyde industry across approximately 11,900 plants in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
500|$|In 1932, van Meegeren {{moved to}} the village of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin with his wife. There he rented a {{furnished}} mansion called [...] "Primavera" [...] and set out to define the chemical and technical procedures that would be necessary to create his perfect forgeries. He bought authentic 17th century canvases and mixed his own paints from raw materials (such as lapis lazuli, white lead, indigo, and cinnabar) using old formulas to ensure that they were authentic. In addition, he created his own badger-hair paintbrushes similar to those that Vermeer was known to have used. He came up with a scheme of using <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> (Bakelite) to cause the paints to harden after application, making the paintings appear as if they were 300 years old. After completing a painting, van Meegeren would bake it at [...] to [...] to harden the paint, and then roll it over a cylinder to increase the cracks. Later, he would wash the painting in black India ink to fill in the cracks.|$|E

50|$|Baekeland {{continued}} to explore possible combinations of <b>phenol</b> and <b>formaldehyde,</b> {{intrigued by the}} possibility that such materials {{could be used in}} molding. By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to <b>phenol</b> and <b>formaldehyde,</b> he produced his dreamed-of hard moldable plastic: Bakelite. Bakelite was made from phenol, then known as carbolic acid, and formaldehyde. The chemical name of Bakelite is polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride. In compression molding, the resin is generally combined with fillers such as wood or asbestos, before pressing it directly into the final shape of the product. Baekeland's process patent for making insoluble products of <b>phenol</b> and <b>formaldehyde</b> was filed in July 1907, and granted on December 7, 1909.

500|$|There {{are three}} mills in Bintulu that process wood-waste products.

MDF plants utilise wood waste purchased from sawmills and plywood mills in the Bintulu area and occasionally from the Tanjung Manis timber processing zone located {{at the mouth of the}} Rajang River. Synthetic resins, which are required to hold wood dust together, constituted 20% of the total production cost of the wood panel products. MDF plants in Bintulu are operated by Daiken Sarawak Sdn Bhd, which was founded on 15 February 1994. The briquette plant is operated by Cipta Briquette Sdn Bhd. A glue/adhesive factory in Bintulu is owned by Bintulu Adhesive & Chemicals Sdn Bhd.

30|$|The {{possibility}} of using liquid tar {{as the new}} precursor for the preparation of carbon fiber has been explored by Qiao et al. [10].

2500|$|The {{adhesives}} used in plywood {{have become}} a point of concern. Both urea formaldehyde and <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> are carcinogenic in very high concentrations.

Plywood produced to [...] "E0" [...] has effectively zero formaldehyde emissions.|$|E
2500|$|When {{treated with}} phenol, urea, or melamine, {{formaldehyde}} produces, respectively, hard thermoset <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> resin, urea formaldehyde resin, and melamine resin.

2500|$|Awaiting {{the arrival}} of a scanner, in the autumn of 1940 the AMRE had ordered the {{delivery}} of an aircraft with some sort of radio-transparent nose.

The Perspex solution was chosen, and in December 1940 Bristol Blenheim N3522, a night fighter adaptation of the Blenheim V, arrived at RAF Christchurch, the nearest suitable airfield. A number of attempts had to be made to successfully mount the nose to their test aircraft. It was not until the spring of 1941 that Indestructo delivered suitable radomes and the mounting issues were wholly solved.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prototype}} of the LaGG-3, I-301, was designed by Semyon A. Lavochkin, Vladimir P. Gorbunov and Mikhail I. Gudkov. It was designated LaGG-3 in serial production. Its airframe was partially made of wood delta-veneer (a resin-wood multi-ply veneer composed of very thin, 0.35 to 0.55mm, wood veneer and <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> resin, baked at high temperature and pressure) used for the crucial parts. This novel construction material had tensile strength {{comparable to that of}} non-hardened aluminum alloys and only 30% lower than that of precipitation hardened D-1A grade [...] duralumin. It was also incombustible and completely invulnerable to rot, with service life measured in decades in adverse conditions. The full wooden wing (with plywood surfaces) was analogous to that of the Yak-1. The only difference was that the LaGG's wings were built in two sections. The fuselage was of similar construction to the MiG-3's. The LaGG-3's armament consisted of a 20mm ShVAK cannon, with 150 rounds, which was installed in the motornaya pushka in the cylinder block split- between the [...] "V" [...] of the engine cylinders and firing through a hollow propeller shaft, and two synchronized 12.7mm Berezin UBS machine guns with 170 rpg. Consequently, the combined weight of rounds fired per second was 2.65kg/s, making the LaGG-3 superior in burst mass to all contemporary Russian fighters, particularly to the MiG-3. Most other Russian fighters of that era were considered under-gunned in relation to western contemporary fighters. This is somewhat true even for the Yak-1, which had a 20mm cannon and two 7.62mm machine guns, but not the later versions of the Polikarpov I-16, which had two cannons and two machine guns.|$|E
