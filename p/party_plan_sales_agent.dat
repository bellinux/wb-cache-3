40|$|Abstract:- The paper discuses {{the main}} {{problems}} which appear when traditional business, based in <b>sales</b> <b>agents,</b> moves to new e-commerce models. Customers, {{used to describe}} to <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> their needs using natural language, are suffering {{from the lack of}} expressiveness using product query forms, which are too rigid. Replacing <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> for automatic systems implies a loss of flexibility interpreting the customer query, narrowing the result set, which could imply a loss of business opportunities. The paper proposes solutions to these problems, using fuzzy logic to model customer requirements, process queries flexibly and ranking results...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a three-layer supply chain with a manufacturer, a reseller, and a <b>sales</b> <b>agent.</b> The demand is stochastically {{determined by the}} random market condition and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent's</b> private effort level. Although the manufacturer is uninformed about the market condition, the reseller and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent</b> conduct demand forecasting and generate private demand signals. Under this framework with two levels of adverse selection intertwined with moral hazard, we study {{the impact of the}} reseller's and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent's</b> forecasting accuracy on the profitability of each member. We show that the manufacturer's profitability is convex on the reseller's forecasting accuracy. From the manufacturer's perspective, typically improving the reseller's accuracy is detrimental when the accuracy is low but is beneficial when it is high. We identify the concrete interrelation among the manufacturer-optimal reseller's accuracy, the volatility of the market condition, and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent's</b> accuracy. Finally, the manufacturer's interest may be aligned with the reseller's when only the reseller can choose her accuracy; this alignment is never possible when both downstream players have the discretion to choose their accuracy. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

5000|$|Both {{of these}} methods cost much less than making calls with live <b>sales</b> <b>agents.</b> Making a voice {{broadcast}} call in the U.S. costs one or two cents. The voice broadcast call {{does not have a}} significant labor cost (a $20/hour <b>sales</b> <b>agent</b> consumes $0.33 per minute). Live <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> are expensive, so telemarketers using live agents will purchase marketing lists that identify good demographic targets. Voice broadcast marketing is cheap enough that marketers may not bother purchasing marketing lists. Voice broadcast marketing only needs live agents for those prospects who express interest in the product by pressing [...] "1" [...] or calling back.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{literature}} on management control {{in the context of}} front-line service work, including sales work. Given the nature of front-line work, service recipients – customers and clients – {{play an important role in}} management control and in the social relations in the workplace. Moreover, the triangle relationship has become a research focus for decades. However, most of the research has been done in western countries. In addition, little attention has been paid to sales work mixed with service elements. Furthermore, the complexity of the triangle relationship between three parties has not been sufficiently evaluated. This thesis investigates management control in a Chinese life insurance company and the effects of management on individual <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and the triangle relationship between management, <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and clients. In order to address the research target, this study employs a qualitative approach and chooses a single-case study research design. The qualitative data has been collected from a documentary analysis, observations and semi-structured interviews. The empirical findings suggest that: a. 	The management controls in the studied case can be categorised into two main types: formally coercive control that consists of output control, bureaucratic control, direct control and attendant control; and informally normative control that consists of concertive control in the sales teams and normative control in morning meetings. b. 	The controls for contradictory logic that interact with one another to have an impact on individual <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and the triangle relationship. c. 	<b>Sales</b> <b>agents</b> who have a greater family responsibility and the capability of meeting sales targets set by the company are more motivated by financial incentives, identified with organisational and occupational value and self-disciplined. d. 	<b>Sales</b> <b>agents</b> who have a poor performance and lack the capability to improve their performance are more likely to resist management control. e. 	The relationship between management and the <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> is not always conflictual. f. 	Co-worker assistance and informal coping are found in the relationships among <b>sales</b> <b>agents,</b> although their <b>sales</b> work is highly individualised and competitive. g. 	The relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and clients is instrumental in its nature, but when there is an ongoing relationship and a high level of trust between <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and clients, this relationship appears to be less instrumental. h. 	Improving the quality of service and enhancing the myth of customer sovereignty may sacrifice efficiency in the short term, but it can potentially increase sales efficiency in the long run. ...|$|R
