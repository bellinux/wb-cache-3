5|$|While DNA {{contains}} deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose (in deoxyribose {{there is}} no hydroxyl group attached to the <b>pentose</b> ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA {{because it is more}} prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the <b>pentose</b> phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces <b>pentose</b> sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are usually}} {{continuously}} regenerated and their concentrations maintained {{at a steady}} level inside the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated through the <b>pentose</b> phosphate pathway and S-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. For example, the human body turns over its own weight in ATP each day.|$|E
50|$|HMF is an {{intermediate}} in the titration of hexoses in the Molisch's test. In the related Bial's test for <b>pentoses,</b> the hydroxymethylfurfural from hexoses may give a muddy-brown or gray solution, {{but this is}} easily distinguishable from the green color of <b>pentoses.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{backbone}} of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a <b>pentose</b> (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative <b>pentose</b> sugar ribose in RNA.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} <b>pentose</b> residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the <b>pentose</b> phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.|$|E

For this purpose, the experimental results of two sets of batch bioconversions carried out alternatively varying the starting xylose concentration in the hydrolyzate or the initial biomass level were used to fit a metabolic model consisting of carbon material and ATP balances based on five main activities, namely fermentative assimilation of <b>pentoses,</b> semi-aerobic pentose-to-pentitol bioconversion, biomass growth on <b>pentoses,</b> catabolic oxidation of <b>pentoses,</b> and acetic acid and NADH regeneration by the electron transport system...|$|R

30|$|Fuel ethanol is {{the most}} studied product from deconstructed biomass. Hydrolysis of {{cellulose}} generates glucose that is readily fermentable. However, hydrolysis of hemicellulose mainly provides <b>pentoses</b> (xylose and arabinose), carbohydrates that cannot be directly fermentable by wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The bioconversion of these <b>pentoses</b> into ethanol {{is one of the}} most important challenges to enable the lignocellulosic ethanol production.

The most complete data are available in yeast, where metabolic reconstructions indicate that the majority of both metabolic processes and metabolites occur in the cytosol. Major metabolic pathways that occur in the cytosol in animals are protein biosynthesis, the <b>pentose</b> phosphate pathway, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

25|$|Carbon {{transfer}} from plant to fungi may occur through the arbuscules or intraradical hyphae. Secondary synthesis from the hexoses by AM {{occurs in the}} intraradical mycelium. Inside the mycelium, hexose is converted to trehalose and glycogen. Trehalose and glycogen are carbon storage forms that can be rapidly synthesized and degraded and may buffer the intracellular sugar concentrations.

40|$|To {{obtain an}} {{efficient}} ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain, we reduced the functional {{space of the}} central metabolic network, with eight gene knockout mutations, from over 15, 000 pathway possibilities to 6 pathway options that support cell function. The remaining pathways, identified by elementary mode analysis, consist of four pathways with non-growth-associated conversion of <b>pentoses</b> and hexoses into ethanol at theoretical yields and two pathways with tight coupling of anaerobic cell growth with ethanol formation at high yields. Elimination of three additional genes resulted in a strain that selectively grows only on <b>pentoses,</b> even {{in the presence of}} glucose, with a high ethanol yield. We showed that the ethanol yields of strains with minimized metabolic functionality closely matched the theoretical predictions. Remarkably, catabolite repression was completely absent during anaerobic growth, resulting in the simultaneous utilization of <b>pentoses</b> and hexoses for ethanol production...|$|R

25|$|GAPDH acts as {{reversible}} metabolic switch under oxidative stress. When {{cells are}} exposed to oxidants, they need excessive amounts of the antioxidant cofactor NADPH. In the cytosol, NADPH is reduced from NADP+ by several enzymes, three of them catalyze the first steps of the <b>Pentose</b> phosphate pathway. Oxidant-treatments cause an inactivation of GAPDH. This inactivation re-routes temporally the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the <b>Pentose</b> Phosphate Pathway, allowing the cell to generate more NADPH. Under stress conditions, NADPH is needed by some antioxidant-systems including glutaredoxin and thioredoxin {{as well as being}} essential for the recycling of gluthathione.|$|E

40|$|The {{permeability}} {{characteristics of}} D- and L-xylose and D- and L-arabinose have been compared in isolated intact rat diaphragm muscle preparations, {{in the absence}} and presence of exogenous insulin. In the absence of added insulin, these <b>pentoses</b> distribute {{in less than a}} third of the total cell water. In the presence of added insulin, intracellular distribution of all these <b>pentoses</b> is increased. L-Xylose and D-arabinose distribute in 50 per cent of the intracellular water, whereas D-xylose and L-arabinose distribute in 80 per cent of the cell water. A significant lag period was observed before the insulin effect upon the penetration of L-xylose and D-arabinose was evident whereas the effect upon D-xylose and L-arabinose was rapid. The lag period with L-xylose could be abolished by pretreating the tissues with insulin for 1 hour, but such pretreatment had little effect on D-xylose. These results indicate that insulin has a biphasic effect upon the monosaccharide exclusion system in diaphragm muscle. In dinitrophenol-treated tissues, in which all permeability processes are irreversibly damaged and in which sucrose and <b>pentoses</b> penetrate into most of the cell water, the entry rate of <b>pentoses</b> and sucrose is initially similar but subsequently D-xylose and L-arabinose penetrate more rapidly than their corresponding optical isomers...|$|R

25|$|Transketolase is {{an enzyme}} {{of both the}} <b>pentose</b> {{phosphate}} pathway in all organisms and the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. It catalyzes two important reactions, which operate in opposite directions in these two pathways. In the first reaction of the non-oxidative <b>pentose</b> phosphate pathway, the cofactor thiamine diphosphate accepts a 2-carbon fragment from a 5-carbon ketose (D-xylulose-5-P), then transfers this fragment to a 5-carbon aldose (D-ribose-5-P) to form a 7-carbon ketose (sedoheptulose-7-P). The abstraction of two carbons from D-xylulose-5-P yields the 3-carbon aldose glyceraldehyde-3-P. In the Calvin cycle, transketolase catalyzes the reverse reaction, the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, the aldose D-ribose-5-P and the ketose D-xylulose-5-P.|$|E
25|$|The enzymes transketolase, {{pyruvate}} dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are {{all important}} in carbohydrate metabolism. The cytosolic enzyme transketolase {{is a key}} player in the <b>pentose</b> phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the <b>pentose</b> sugars deoxyribose and ribose. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is a major form of energy for the cell. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, while the reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and for myelin synthesis.|$|E
25|$|In Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, {{while no}} {{mutations}} could be demonstrated, {{there is an}} indication that thiamine deficiency leads to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome only in those whose transketolase has a reduced affinity for thiamine. In this way, the activity of transketolase is greatly hindered, and, as a consequence, the entire <b>pentose</b> phosphate pathway is inhibited.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid dual-wavelength spectroscopic method {{is used for}} {{simultaneous}} determination of <b>pentoses</b> and hexoses in the prehydrolyzate from lignocellulosic biomass. The method {{is based on the}} following reaction mechanism: in the solution of hydrochloric acid, phloroglucinol gives color reaction with sugars or their degradation products, showing maximum absorbance at 553 nm and 410 nm. Based on dual-wavelength spectrophotometric measurement, the <b>pentoses</b> and hexoses can separately be quantified. It was found that the derivatives from these two different sugars have an isosbestic point at 425 nm. According to the validation results, high accuracy and reasonable recovery rate is shown with the present method (<b>pentoses</b> recovery 97. 1 to 100. 0 %, hexoses recovery 97. 2 to 102. 0 %). Additionally, the interferences from substances including lignin, furfural, 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), glucuronic acid, and galacturonic acid are insignificant. All of the above results illustrate the suitability of this method for analyzing sugars in the lignocelluloses prehydrolyzate, especially hardwoods or herbaceous plants, based on forest-related biorefinery research...|$|R
