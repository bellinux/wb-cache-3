Weighting factor for <b>paths</b> <b>selection</b> {{is defined as}} an exponential variable in adaptive ACA.

This approach can dynamically adjust <b>paths</b> <b>selection</b> and improve global search ability by optimizing global policy. Adaptive ACA consumes the least time {{in the process of}} searching the most optimized paths and searches the shortest paths under the same of iterative loops.

40|$|In recent years, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{technologies}} have received significant attentions. WMNs not only accede to {{the advantages of}} ad hoc networks but also provide hierarchical multi-interface architecture. Transmission power control and routing <b>path</b> <b>selections</b> are critical issues in the past researches of multihop networks. Variable transmission power levels lead to different network connectivity and interference. Further, routing <b>path</b> <b>selections</b> among different radio interfaces will also produce different intra-/interflow interference. These features tightly affect the network performance. Most of the related works on the routing protocol design do not consider transmission power control and multi-interface environment simultaneously. In this paper, we proposed a cross-layer routing protocol called M 2 iRi 2 which coordinates transmission power control and intra-/interflow interference considerations as routing metrics. Each radio interface calculates the potential tolerable-added transmission interference in the physical layer. When the route discovery starts, the M 2 iRi 2 will adopt the appropriate power level to evaluate each interface quality along paths. The simulation results demonstrate that our design can enhance both network throughput and end-to-end delay...|$|R

50|$|Throughout North America (and in {{many other}} regions) the {{recommended}} path for mobiles or portable stations is now WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1. Fixed Stations (homes, etc.) should not normally use a path routing if they don't need to be digipeated outside of their local area, otherwise a path of WIDE2-2 or less should be used as requirements dictate. This path reflects the routing of packets via the radio component of APRS, and fixed stations should carefully consider their choice of path routing. Any <b>path</b> <b>selection</b> for stations {{that do not require}} it contributes to congestion of the APRS frequency and may hinder other stations' reporting. Aircraft and balloon APRS stations should avoid beaconing with any path at altitude since digipeating may not be necessary due to their antenna height and likelihood of reaching multiple wide-ranging digipeaters and IGates. Mobile stations in congested areas or more populated areas may consider using only 1 hop (WIDE1-1), as there are usually enough Internet gateways nearby that no path routing is needed.
