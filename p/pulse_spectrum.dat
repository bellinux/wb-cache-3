40|$|Multimodal {{nonlinear}} microscopy allows imaging {{of highly}} ordered biological tissue due to spectral separation of nonlinear signals.

In contrast to several publications we demonstrate a factor of 1 / 2 root 2 relating the full width at half maximum of a gaussian laser <b>pulse</b> <b>spectrum</b> to the corresponding second harmonic <b>pulse</b> <b>spectrum</b> in the spatial domain by using a simple theoretical model. Experiments on monopotassium phosphate crystals (KDP-crystals) and on porcine corneal tissue support our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, no differences in spectral width were found for epi- and trans-detection of the second harmonic signal. Overall, these results may help to build an optimized multiphoton setup for spectral separation of nonlinear signals. (C) 2015 Author(s).
