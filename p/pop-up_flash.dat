5000|$|Holga 135AFX - 38 mm f/3.8 lens with {{infrared}} autofocus, automatic film load, built-in <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> and interlock {{shutter release}} ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{much larger}} and {{brighter}} pentaprism viewfinder with approx. 96% coverage. This arrangement, {{borrowed from the}} 1D range, omits the <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> of the consumer range.|$|E
5000|$|The Nikon F-601, {{otherwise}} known as the Nikon N6006, is a 35mm single-lens reflex (SLR) film camera that was produced by Nikon starting in 1991. The F601 featured an improved second-generation autofocus system, motor drive for automatic film advance, a built-in <b>pop-up</b> electronic <b>flash,</b> a top shutter speed of 1/2000 of a second, and a new [...] "Matrix" [...] evaluative multi-zone metering program.|$|R
50|$|On the ILCE-QX1 itself {{there are}} buttons for on/off, <b>flash</b> <b>pop-up,</b> lens release and shutter. The camera module can be {{remote-controlled}} through an iOS or Android device, {{to which it}} connects through Wi-Fi. The ILCE-QX1 allows capture in RAW format, but RAW files can only be directly wirelessly transferred to Android devices, not, as of September 2014, to iOS.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, he {{made his}} first long film with Uliisses. In 1986, Nekes filmed what would be {{considered}} his most famous film ever, the <b>pop-up</b> parody Johnny <b>Flash</b> with Helge Schneider as a rising hit star in the leading role. Christoph Schlingensief was a recording director, camera assistant and actor. They had met in 1982. Both taught at the Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main(1982-1984). In the early 1970s, Nekes had a professorship for experimental film at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg (1970-1972).|$|R
50|$|The EOS M10 also {{includes}} a 180-degree flip-up LCD viewscreen, a built-in <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash,</b> and integrated Wi-Fi and NFC enabling control of the camera via a smartphone app.|$|E
50|$|The camera has a {{built-in}} manual <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash.</b> The flash operates in automatic, red-eye, forced and slow synchronization modes. A 5-pin jack for an external flash cable is provided, {{but there is no}} hot shoe flash connector.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} hotshoe flash mount sits {{above the}} viewfinder, with which a flash may {{be attached to}} the camera. The Nikon F-301 does not feature a built-in <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> (the F-401 was the first Nikon SLR to have this feature).|$|E
50|$|The camera will {{interpret}} {{the presence of}} a hot shoe protector as {{the presence of a}}n auxiliary flash attachment thereby disabling the built-in <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash.</b> Removing the hot shoe protector will re-enable the built-in flash. A micro-switch in the hot-shoe senses the presence of the flash.|$|E
50|$|The Sigma DP1s is a {{high-end}} compact digital camera {{introduced by the}} Sigma Corporation as an improvement of the Sigma DP1. It features a 14-megapixel Foveon X3 sensor (2652 × 1768 × 3 layers), a fixed 16.6 mm F4.0 lens (28mm equivalent), a 2.5” LCD and a <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Sony ILCE-QX1 is {{a mobile}} device mountable, Wi-Fi-controlled camera module {{announced}} by Sony on 3 September 2014. Part of the Sony α family, {{it has a}} 20.1 MP sensor, requires an exchangeable E-mount lens, supports power zoom, and has a <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash,</b> but no in-body image stabilisation.|$|E
5000|$|Capable of {{automatic}} focus, the Maxxum 4 has through-the-lens metering, a built-in <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> {{and a hot}} shoe for flash. The shutter is an [...] "electronically-controlled, vertical-traverse, focal-plane type." [...] It uses infrared sensors to focus, so for this reason the camera's manual advises against using it for infrared photography.|$|E
50|$|The Genesis camera family {{consisted}} of 4 models (see table below), each new model replacing the previous one. All models had a fixed zoom, motorized stepless autofocus, autoexposure, a built-in <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash,</b> motorized film transport, and automatic (DX) film sensing. The first two releases had fairly boxy designs; {{the latter two}} were given a sleeker, more rounded look.|$|E
50|$|The Sigma DP2 is a {{high-end}} compact digital camera {{introduced by the}} Sigma Corporation. It features a 14-megapixel Foveon X3 sensor (2652 × 1768 × 3 layers), the same sensor used in its predecessor, the Sigma DP1 and in the Sigma SD14 DSLR, a fixed 24.2mm 2.8 lens (41mm equivalent), a 2.5” LCD and a <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 40D {{has many}} similar {{characteristics}} to its predecessors the 20D and 30D, but also many differences. This includes various shooting modes, {{ability to change}} ISO and white balance, a <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> unit, an LCD screen of 3.0 inches (an upgrade from the previous model, the Canon EOS 30D with a screen of only 2.5 inches), and a rugged magnesium alloy protective inner-shell, which both the Canon 30D and 40D have.|$|E
50|$|Like its predecessor, the Canon EOS M2, {{the camera}} uses the Canon EF-M lens mount. However, the EOS M3 adds {{a number of}} new features, {{including}} a contoured grip, tilting LCD touchscreen, built-in <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> and dedicated mode dial. Internally, the EOS M3 sports a DIGIC 6 image processor, 24.2 megapixel APS-C sensor, Hybrid CMOS AF III 49-point autofocus system, and integrated Wi-Fi and NFC enabling control of the camera via a smartphone app.|$|E
50|$|It is autofocusing {{and has an}} {{electronically}} controlled {{focal plane}} shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/4000 sec. with x-flash synchronization at shutter speeds up to 1/180 sec. It has built-in exposure metering with spot, center weighted and evaluative modes and also features a <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash.</b> Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 through 125, 160, 200, 400, 800 and 1600. The camera is discontinued and no longer in production.|$|E
5000|$|The Sigma DP1 was a {{high-end}} compact digital camera {{introduced by the}} Sigma Corporation. It featured a 14-megapixel Foveon X3 sensor (2652 × 1768 × 3 layers), a fixed 16.6 mm F4.0 lens (28mm equivalent), a 2.5” LCD and a <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash.</b> It was the first [...] "compact" [...] camera that featured an APS-C sized sensor, a feature that Sigma claimed would result in DSLR quality images from a small, pocketable camera.|$|E
50|$|Several camera {{equipment}} manufacturers have support for remote flash triggering built into {{at least some}} of their camera and flash models. This eliminates the issue of slave flashes triggering upon seeing a pre-flash, as the master flash unit (whether a shoemount flash or the camera's <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash)</b> sends predefined signals to the slave units to control them. However, the user is restricted to using flash units from that camera manufacturer, or a limited selection of third-party units which are compatible with it.|$|E
50|$|The α77 II {{features}} a BIONZ X image processor {{similar to the}} Sony α7 series. It comes with Wi-Fi, NFC and also has 79 AF points with 15 crossing sensor, 12 fps burst speed up to 60 frames in full resolution, continuous AF video Full HD at 60p and 24p. One of the major features is the new sensor with less noise. GPS has been removed, as has the LED AF illuminator—the <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> is now used for focus assist.|$|E
50|$|The 50D {{has many}} similar {{characteristics}} to its predecessor, the 40D. This includes various shooting modes, {{the ability to}} change ISO and white balance, a <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> unit, and an LCD screen. The LCD screen is the same size (3.0") as the 40D but has a higher resolution (640 × 480 pixel or 307,200 pixels) than any previous model. It is also the final Canon xxD to use a CompactFlash or Microdrive for memory storage, along with the BP-511 series battery.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the essential modes P, A, S and M, the Maxxum 4 has all the usual quick-modes for the beginner: portrait, landscape, close-up, sports and night portrait. As with comparable film cameras of the period, the Maxxum 4 has multiple-frame drive mode, and self-timer; the maximum speed for continuous shooting is just short of two frames per second. Also, like other similar cameras, the Maxxum 4 has a built-in <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> {{as well as a}} shoe for a dedicated flash with TTL flash control.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon Coolpix 995 was {{announced}} on April 25, 2001 to supersede the Coolpix 990 in the Nikon Coolpix series. Similar in appearance to the 990, changes include a {{switch to a}} high-impact plastic case for the lens half of the swivel body, a <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> to reduce red-eye by moving the bulb away from the lens, an increase in zoom capability to 4x, CompactFlash Type II compatibility {{and use of the}} EN-EL1 rechargeable Li-Ion battery in place of the previous four AA batteries.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{improvements}} {{over the}} previous design include a built-in, <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash,</b> FAT32 support for larger-capacity CompactFlash storage cards, a higher continuous shooting speed of 3 frames per second, an upgraded auto focus system with 5 sensors, an AF assist lamp, an improved viewfinder with a 0.9 &times; magnification, an almost silent and more durable shutter rated at 100,000 actuations, a larger 2.5" [...] LCD monitor, a USB 2.0 interface (but no firewire interface anymore), and a proprietary rechargeable (Minolta NP-400 compatible) lithium ion battery system with a claimed 500 shot capacity (user experience puts it closer to 150-200).|$|E
50|$|The α700 {{had a lower}} pixel {{resolution}} {{than the}} later α350 (12.4 vs. 14.2), and the α350 included additional features (Live preview mode, automatic <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash)</b> at a lower price. However, the α700 used a pentaprism viewfinder instead of a pentamirror, had a higher burst speed (5 frames per second vs 2.5), had a higher resolution LCD screen, magnesium alloy body, twin control dials, better environmental seals, dual flash media slots (CF and MS-DUO), a PC Sync socket, more autofocus points, a stronger autofocus motor, and HDMI output. The α350's sensor was also a CCD sensor, {{as opposed to the}} α700's Exmor CMOS sensor which granted the α700 superior low-light performance.|$|E
50|$|The body holds a {{built-in}} <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> {{as well as}} a hot shoe on top for an external flash unit. Alternatively, Ricoh's 'VF-2', an external electronic viewfinder, can be attached to the hot shoe which, offers 920,000 pixels and 100% field of view. The separate units slide onto the body via a stainless steel rail and lock into place. They can then be released by a lever on the camera's body. Both the body and lens unit use magnesium alloy exterior. Each lens unit has its own unique specifications relating to its sensor and optics, meaning that different lens units will change the features, behavior and performance of the camera body to varying degrees when attached.|$|E
5000|$|The Minolta 800si, {{released}} in 1997, was the flagship of the si series cameras before the 5th generation single digit series. It {{can be seen}} as a stop-gap measure to fill the [...] "semi-pro" [...] niche between the 1993 700si and the 2000 Dynax 7. This camera has a very high powered <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash,</b> one of the most powerful built-in flashes ever made. The 800si added a lot more features over its predecessor the 700si, at the expense of the 700si's card system, which most consumers at this time considered of little use due to the widespread integration of features into camera bodies. The 700si's vertical control grip, the VC-700, can also fit the 800si.|$|E
50|$|The Fujifilm FinePix S1 Pro was an {{interchangeable}} lens digital single-lens reflex camera introduced in January 2000. It {{was based on}} a Nikon F60 (Nikon N60 in the U.S.) film camera body that was modified by Fujifilm to include its own proprietary image sensor and electronics. Because of the Nikon body, it had a Nikon F lens mount and so could use most lenses made for Nikon 35 mm cameras. It was autofocusing, had an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/2000 sec. and built-in exposure metering and <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash.</b> Its ISO film speed equivalents ranged from 320-1600. The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S2 Pro in January 2002.|$|E
50|$|The Fujifilm FinePix S2 Pro is an {{interchangeable}} lens digital single-lens reflex camera introduced in January 2002. It {{is based on}} a Nikon F80 (N80 in the U.S.) film camera body that was modified by Fujifilm to include its own proprietary image sensor and electronics. Because of the Nikon body, it has a Nikon AF lens mount and so can use most lenses made for Nikon 35 mm cameras. It is autofocus ing, with an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/4000 sec., built-in exposure metering and <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash.</b> Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 - 1600. The S2 Pro also has sound recording capability. The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro in February 2004.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003 Pentax {{introduced}} {{their first}} Digital SLR under Digital *ist series and released the first flagship model, the Pentax *ist D {{which uses a}} Sony 6 megapixel CCD. Since 2003, the *ist D is the only digital SLR that can control HS wireless P-TTL from its <b>pop-up</b> <b>flash</b> and has many advanced features for professional applications. In 2004 Pentax released the second member in the digital *ist line, the Pentax *ist DS {{which is the first}} real consumer model (retailing under $1,000 USD). What set Pentax D and DS DSLRs apart from the competition was the clarity and high magnification provided by their pentaprism viewfinders, a very useful feature considering the support for legacy manual focus lenses. In 2005 Pentax released the Pentax *ist DL, a model with fewer features than the D and DS with a lower price. All Pentax's digital SLRs are compatible with K-mount lenses, and M42 (42 mm screw mount) lenses (with adaptor). Due to the smaller size of the CCD, lenses have an effective field of view of 1.5 × times the same lens in 35 mm format. So, where a 50 mm lens was considered a [...] "normal" [...] lens on 35 mm film, that same lens on a 1.5× [...] "crop factor" [...] camera has the field of view of a 75 mm lens on film. This only uses the center of the lens' projected image. To address this [...] "crop factor," [...] Pentax created a new series of lenses that were designed only to cover the smaller sensor. These are the DA series for their digital SLRs, which still feature the K-mount but have a smaller back-focus element designed specifically for use with the Digital SLR lineup. The DA series lenses do not have a mechanical aperture ring and so are not backward compatible with some earlier film bodies. The later D-FA lens series re-introduces a mechanical aperture ring in some lenses and these are fully compatible with both film and digital SLRs.|$|E
