40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a semantic web search engine on conversation styled transcripts. Our choice of data is Hansard, a publicly available conversation style transcript of parliamentary debates. The current search engine implementation <b>on</b> <b>Hansard</b> is limited to running search queries based on keywords or phrases hence lacks the ability to make semantic inferences from user queries. By making use of knowledge such as the relationship between members of parliament, constituencies, terms of office, as well as topics of debates the search results can be improved in terms of both relevance and coverage. Our contribution is not algorithmic instead we describe how we exploit a collection of external data sources, ontologies, semantic web vocabularies and named entity extraction in the analysis of underlying semantics of user queries as well as the semantic enrichment of the search index thereby improving the quality of results...|$|R

40|$|For many years, {{statistical}} {{machine translation}} relied on generative models to provide bilingual word alignments. In 2005, several independent efforts showed that discriminative models {{could be used to}} enhance or replace the standard generative approach. Building on this work, we demonstrate substantial improvement in word-alignment accuracy, partly though improved training methods, but predominantly through selection of more and better features. Our best model produces the lowest alignment error rate yet reported <b>on</b> Canadian <b>Hansards</b> bilingual data. ...|$|R

In contrary to beamsearch or greedy approaches {{it is possible}} to guarantee the avoidance of search errors with A*. We develop various sophisticated admissible and almost admissible heuristic functions.
