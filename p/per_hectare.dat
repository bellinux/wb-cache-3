5|$|A multi-year {{field study}} {{of the growth of}} R.emetica {{production}} in a scots pine plantation in Scotland found that total productivity was 0.24–0.49 million mushrooms <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> per year (roughly 0.1–0.2 million mushrooms/acre/year), corresponding to a fresh weight of 265–460kg <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> per year (49–85 lb/acre/year). Productivity was highest from August to October. The longevity of the mushrooms was estimated to be 4–7 days. In a {{study of the}} fungal diversity of ectomycorrhizal species in a Sitka spruce forest, R.emetica was one of the top five dominant fungi. Comparing the frequency of fruit body production between 10-, 20-, 30-, or 40-year-old forest stands, R.emetica was most prolific in the latter.|$|E

5|$|The work paid well, and {{attracted}} many navvies to the area. Initial wages were 3.20 kroner per day, though this later was reduced. Two {{and a half}} thousand men were employed, with fewer jobs being offered than there were applicants. Land owners were compensated 50–200 kroner <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> (NOK 20–80 per acre) for cultivated land, and 10 kroner <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> (NOK 4 per acre) for forest. Many local farmers made good money offering transport of cargo for the construction, as well as renting out annexes for navvies; others made money as traders. As with all such construction areas, many legal and illegal pubs and brothels were established. After construction was completed, some moved on, while others settled in the area; many of these received jobs with the railway company.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> per crop because it can provide food, feed and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in Wales {{is heavily}} subsidised by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy with farmers getting annual {{payments}} {{for the area}} they farm.

5|$|Many beetle species {{undertake}} annual mass movements {{which are}} termed as migrations. These include the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus and {{many species of}} coccinellids. These mass movements may also be opportunistic, in search of food, rather than seasonal. A 2008 study of an unusually large outbreak of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in British Columbia found that beetles were capable of flying 30–110km per day in densities of up to 18, 600 beetles <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b>|$|E

50|$|For 3,500 years {{residents}} of Santorini and neighbouring islands have been cultivating the legume species Lathyrus clymenum, known elsewhere {{only as a}} wild plant. The peculiar ecosystem that {{was created by the}} volcanic explosions on Santorini island, the volcanic ash, the cellular soil, and the combination of humidity created by the sea and the drought, make the bean a unique resource. When weather conditions are good farmers on the island can reap about 800 kilos of beans <b>per</b> <b>hectares.</b> A vulnerable crop, it can be destroyed by strong winds that blow away its flowers before they can yield the pea, by drought or by a sudden heat wave almost instantly. Its production is thus limited making it an expensive crop that costs €700 per acre. The cost for consumers is about €9-10 per kilo.|$|R
