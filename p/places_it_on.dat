5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{takes one}} of the dragon eggs and <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a glowing-hot brazier. She reaches in {{and picks up the}} blisteringly hot egg. Her handmaiden rushes in to take the hot egg from her hands, burning herself in the process, but Daenerys's hands are {{completely}} unscathed.|$|E
5|$|They {{reach the}} {{dilapidated}} bridge where Snow sold Charming's goods {{to a group}} of trolls. When she asks the trolls if she can buy back the ring, the trolls become suspicious and discover the wanted poster of Snow, leading to a fight. Snow comes to Charming's rescue by using fairy dust to turn the trolls into bugs. Charming is surprised that Snow saved him, but she wants to repay him for saving her life. As she hands him back the items, including the wedding ring, Snow looks at the ring, then <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> her finger before handing it back to him as they go their separate ways.|$|E
60|$|The game of boule demands {{undivided}} attention from its devotees. To {{play with a}} mind full of other matters is a mistake. This mistake George made. Hardly conscious {{of what he was}} doing, he flung the coin on the board. She had asked him to <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> eight, and he thought that he had <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> eight. That, in reality, blinded by emotion, he had <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> three was a fact which came home to him neither then nor later.|$|R

5|$|Two other swords are used. The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678, symbolises the monarch's royal authority. It is {{also carried}} before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament. Its wooden sheath is bound in crimson velvet {{decorated}} with silver-gilt emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, fleurs-de-lis and portcullises. In the centre is the royal badge of joint-sovereigns WilliamIII and MaryII, for whose coronation the sheath {{was made in}} 1689. The lion of England and unicorn of Scotland form the cross-piece to the sword's handle. At coronations, a peer gives the Sword of State to the Lord Great Chamberlain who <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a table in StEdward's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama {{tries to}} track her down using her résumé, but as Yoshikawa warned, {{all of the}} {{contacts}} are dead ends. At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his new wife.|$|E

5|$|To {{reach the}} cathedral, Garrett ventures through Old Quarter, a haunted, {{abandoned}} district of the City. Through {{an opening in}} the cathedral, The Eye informs Garrett of a nearby Keeper sanctuary, where he may learn how to unseal the cathedral. There, Garrett discovers that the cathedral was sealed to prevent the City's destruction by the Trickster. He learns that there are four talismans needed to remove the seal: two hidden in ancient ruins beneath the City, and two inside a Hammerite temple (in Thief Gold, one talisman is in possession of the mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from the caves below, while the other two are in the Lost City and the Hammerite Temple as in the original game). Garrett recovers the talismans and returns to the cathedral. After unsealing the cathedral, he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by The Eye. He returns The Eye to Constantine, who reveals himself to be the Trickster. Viktoria says that The Eye requires a flesh eye to function; she binds Garrett with vines and removes his right eye. The Trickster <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the gemstone, and the two disappear through a portal. Garrett, left for dead, is found and freed by two Keepers. During his escape from the Trickster's mansion, he learns that the Trickster plans to use The Eye to revert the world to a wild state.|$|E
25|$|Panspermia {{is often}} criticized {{because it does}} not answer the {{question}} of the origin of life but merely <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> another celestial body. It was also criticized because it was thought it could not be tested experimentally.|$|E
25|$|On a member's death, the sword, helm, mantling, crest, coronet or crown, and banner are removed. A {{ceremony}} {{marking the}} death of the late member must be held before the stall can be assigned to anyone else. This ceremony takes place in the chapel, during which the Military Knights of Windsor carry the banner of the deceased member and offer it to the Dean of Windsor, who <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the altar.|$|E

25|$|The {{contestant}} {{in control}} chooses between two stacks of letter tiles, one containing vowels {{and the other}} consonants, and Riley reveals the top tile from that stack and <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the board. This is done nine times, and the final grouping must contain at least three vowels and four consonants. The contestants then have 30 seconds to form the longest single word they can, using the nine revealed letters; no letter may be used more often than it appears in the selection. The frequencies of the letters within each stack are weighted according to their frequency in natural English, {{in the same manner}} as Scrabble. For example, there are many Ns and Rs in the consonant stack, but only one Q. The letter frequencies are altered by the producers from time to time, so any published list does not necessarily reflect the letters used in any particular programme.|$|E
500|$|The poet Lu Bi recalls another trick shot {{performed}} by Xue: [...] "When the servant girl takes {{a ball in}} her hand and <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> top of her head / She [...] turns around, hits it with another ball, and both balls fall to the ground." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{identity}} {{and location of}} the Gate of Atalos ( [...] , Porta Atalou) are unclear. Cyril Mango identifies it with the Old Golden Gate; van Millingen <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the Seventh Hill, at a height probably corresponding {{to one of the}} later gates of the Theodosian Wall in that area; and Raymond Janin places it further north, across the Lycus and near the point where the river passed under the wall. In earlier centuries, it was decorated with many statues, including one of Constantine, which fell down in an earthquake in 740.|$|E

At this moment, the king or queen is crowned, and the guests in the abbey cry in unison three times, [...] "God Save the King/Queen". Peers of the realm and officers of arms put on their coronets, the trumpeters sound a fanfare and church bells ring out across the kingdom, as gun salutes echo from the Tower of London and Hyde Park.|$|E
500|$|In a key {{episode in}} the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's {{violation}} is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful and indiscriminate sexuality. In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks {{to have sex with}} Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in [...] "Contendings", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result [...] "gives birth" [...] to the disk. In [...] "Contendings", Thoth takes the disk and <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.|$|E
500|$|Just before Dwight {{starts his}} fire simulation, {{he said his}} {{co-workers}} previously failed to listen because he made a presentation on the computer program Microsoft PowerPoint, of which he said, [...] "PowerPoint is boring". Michael refers to Barack Obama, the first African American president of the United States, to Stanley while he is suffering a heart attack by shouting, [...] "Stanley! Barack is president! You are black! Stanley!" [...] A deleted scene further addresses Obama's election, with Michael praising the choice and Darryl, with Darryl half-jokingly telling the Caucasian office workers what will change for them (they {{no longer have to}} pretend to like jazz, and Morgan Freeman won't get any more acting work because [...] "he's more for you guys"). Michael calls an employee from the Red Cross, an international humanitarian movement, to conduct a lesson about CPR. The instructor suggests they pump the heart to the tune of [...] "Stayin' Alive", a disco song by the pop band, the Bee Gees, but Michael mixes the song up with [...] "I Will Survive" [...] by Gloria Gaynor. At the end of the lesson, Dwight cuts the face off the CPR dummy and <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his face in the manner of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut the face off a man and wore it as a mask in the 1991 thriller film, The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Mrs. Albert Hannaday, Andy says the Cloris Leachman character was originally supposed to be played by the much younger actress, Nicole Kidman, and the last-minute replacement prompted a minor overhaul in the film's script. The songs [...] "You Make My Dreams Come True" [...] by Hall and Oates, [...] "All Out of Love" [...] by the soft rock duo Air Supply, [...] "Have a Little Faith in Me" [...] by singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and [...] "Lady" [...] by Little River Band play during scenes in Mrs. Albert Hannaday.|$|E
