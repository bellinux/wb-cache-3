In Denmark, which had power market <b>penetration</b> of 30% in 2013, over 90hours, wind power generated 100% of the country's power, peaking at 122% of the country's demand at 2am on 28 October.|$|E

40|$|<b>Penetrations</b> {{through the}} LCLS {{injector}} shield wall {{are needed for}} the alignment of the accelerator, a diagnostic laser beam and utilities, and {{are shown in figure}} 1. The 1 -inch diameter LCLS injector beam tube is blocked by the PPS stopper when the injector side of the wall is occupied. The two 3 -inch diameter <b>penetrations</b> above and {{to the left of the}} beam tube are used by Precision Alignment and will be open only during installation of the injector beamline. Additional 3 -inch diameter <b>penetrations</b> are for laser beams which will be used for electron beam diagnostics. These will not be plugged when the injector occupied. Other <b>penetrations</b> for the RF waveguide and other utilities are approximately 13 -inch from the floor and as such are far from the line-of-sight of any radiation sources. The waveguide and utility <b>penetrations</b> pass only through the thicker wall as shown in the figure. The principal issue is with the two laser <b>penetrations,</b> since these will be open when the linac is operating and people are in the LCLS injector area. A principal concern is radiation streaming through the <b>penetrations</b> due to direct line-of sight of the PEP- 2 lines. To answer this, fans of rays were traced through the 3 -inch diameter laser <b>penetrations</b> as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 gives the top view of the shield walls, the main linac and PEP- 2 lines, and the ray-fans. The fans appear to originate between the walls since their angular envelope is defined by the greatest angle possible when rays are just on the 3 -inch diameter at the inner most and outermost wall surfaces. The crossovers of all possible rays lie half way between these two surfaces. As the end-on view of Figure 3 clearly shows, there is no direct line-of-sight through the laser <b>penetrations</b> of the PEP- 2 or linac beamlines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Multi-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWCNT) are new manufactured nanomaterials with a {{wide spectrum}} of commercial applications. The durability and fiber-like dimensions (mean length 3. 9 μm long × 49 nm diameter) of MWCNT suggest that these fibers may migrate to and have toxicity within the pleural region. To address whether the pleura received a significant and persistent exposure, C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were exposed by pharyngeal aspiration to 10, 20, 40 and 80 μg MWCNT or vehicle and the distribution of MWCNT <b>penetrations</b> determined at 1, 7, 28 and 56 days after exposure. Following lung fixation and sectioning, morphometric methods were used to determine the distribution of MWCNT and the number of MWCNT fiber <b>penetrations</b> of three barriers: alveolar epithelium (alveolar <b>penetrations),</b> the alveolar epithelium immediately adjacent to the pleura (subpleural tissue), and visceral pleural surface (intrapleural space). Results At 1 day 18 %, 81. 6 % and 0. 6 % of the MWCNT lung burden was in the airway, the alveolar, and the subpleural regions, respectively. There was an initial, high density of <b>penetrations</b> into the subpleural tissue and the intrapleural space one day following aspiration which appeared to decrease due to clearance by alveolar macrophages and/or lymphatics by day 7. However, the density of <b>penetrations</b> increased to steady state levels in the subpleural tissue and intrapleural from day 28 - 56. At day 56 approximately 1 in every 400 fiber <b>penetrations</b> was in either the subpleural tissue or intrapleural space. Numerous <b>penetrations</b> into macrophages in the alveolar airspaces throughout the lungs were demonstrated at all times but are not included in the counts presented. Conclusions The results document that MWCNT <b>penetrations</b> of alveolar macrophages, the alveolar wall, and visceral pleura are both frequent and sustained. In addition, the findings demonstrate the need to investigate the chronic toxicity of MWCNT at these sites. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily {{upon the}} electrode being {{used and the}} desired properties of the weld. Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) causes heat to build up on the electrode, increasing the electrode melting rate and decreasing {{the depth of the}} weld. Reversing the polarity so that the electrode is positively charged (DCEP) and the workpiece is negatively charged increases the weld <b>penetration.</b> With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between electrode melting rate and <b>penetration.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{installed}} capacity of photovoltaic (PV) systems has recently increased {{at a much}} faster rate than the development of grid codes to effectively and efficiently manage high <b>penetrations</b> of PV within the distribution system. In a number of countries, PV <b>penetrations</b> in some regions are now raising growing concerns regarding integration. Management strategies vary considerably by country-some still have an approach that PV systems should behave as passive as possible, whereas others demand an active participation in grid control. This variety of grid codes also causes challenges in learning from "best practice. " This paper provides a review of current grid codes in some countries with high PV <b>penetrations.</b> In addition, the paper presents a number of country-specific case studies on different approaches for improved integration of PV systems in the distribution grid. In particular, we consider integration approaches using active and reactive power control that can reduce or defer expensive grid reinforcement while supporting higher PV <b>penetrations...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigates the}} {{synoptic}} variability of the monsoon flux during {{the establishment of}} the West African monsoon using observations and ECMWF analyses. It highlights variability at a 3 - 5 -day time scale, characterized by successive northward excursions of the monsoon flux. Their characteristics and climatology prior to the monsoon onset are presented. These <b>penetrations</b> follow a maximum of intensity of the heat-low (extension and minimum of pressure) and are concomitant with an acceleration of the low-level meridional wind. Some <b>penetrations</b> are stationary whereas others propagate westward simultaneously with African easterly waves. Both types are investigated in more detail by case-studies. This enables us to distinguish the boundary-layer mechanisms involved in such <b>penetrations.</b> A similar conceptual model holds for both. It is argued that the heat-low dynamics is a major driver of these synoptic <b>penetrations,</b> pointing to the predominantly continental nature of this phenomenon. In turn, the heat-low can be partitioned by the <b>penetrations.</b> Horizontal advection is the main process that eventually accounts for these surges; nevertheless, turbulent mixing also plays a significant role by vertically redistributing moisture, and in more subtle ways by its contribution to the shaping of the low-level synoptic environment within which the surges take plac...|$|R
