40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with <b>patch</b> {{angioplasty}} produces greater results {{than with}} primary closure; however, there remains uncertainty on the optimal <b>patch</b> material in CEA. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) {{was performed to}} evaluate the effect of angioplasty using venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch</b> material, and Dacron <b>patch</b> versus polytetrafluoroethelene (PTFE) <b>patch</b> material during CEA. METHODS: A multiple electronic health database screening was performed including the Cochrane library, Pubmed, Ovid, EMBASE and Google Scholar on all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before November 2012 that compared the outcomes of patients undergoing CEA with venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch.</b> RCTs were included if they compared carotid <b>patch</b> angioplasty with autologus venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch</b> material, or compared one type of synthetic <b>patch</b> with another. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs were identified. Ten trials, involving 1946 CEAs, compared venous <b>patch</b> with synthetic <b>patch</b> materials. Two trials, involving 400 CEAs in 380 patients, compared Dacron <b>patch</b> with PTFE <b>patch.</b> The hemostasis time in CEA with PTFE <b>patch</b> was significantly longer than with venous <b>patch</b> (P 0. 05). One RCT of 95 CEAs in 92 patients compared bovine pericardium with Dacron <b>patch,</b> and demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in intraoperative suture line bleeding with bovine pericardium compared with Dacron <b>patch</b> (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The hemostasis time in CEA with PTFE <b>patch</b> was longer than with venous <b>patch</b> or Dacron <b>patch.</b> The overall perioperative and long-term mortality rate, stroke rate, restenosis, and operative time were similar when using venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch</b> material or Dacron <b>patch</b> versus PTFE <b>patch</b> material during CEA.

40|$|<b>Patch</b> {{dynamics}} of the Mediterranean slow-growing seagrass Posidonia oceanica was studied in two shallow sites (3 - 10 m) of the Balearic Archipelago (Spain) through repeated censuses (1 - 2 year- 1). In the sheltered site of Es Port Bay (Cabrera Island), initial <b>patch</b> density (October 2001) was low: 0. 05 <b>patches</b> m- 2, and the <b>patch</b> size (number of shoots) distribution was bimodal: most of the <b>patches</b> had less than 6 shoots or between 20 and 50 shoots. Mean <b>patch</b> recruitment in Es Port Bay (0. 006 ± 0. 002 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1) exceeded mean <b>patch</b> loss (0. 001 ± 0. 001 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1), yielding positive net <b>patch</b> recruitment (0. 004 ± 0. 003 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1) and a slightly increased <b>patch</b> density 3 years later (July 2004, 0. 06 <b>patches</b> m- 2). In the exposed site of S'Estanyol, the initial <b>patch</b> density was higher (1. 38 <b>patches</b> m- 2, August 2003), and <b>patch</b> size frequency decreased exponentially with size. <b>Patch</b> recruitment (0. 26 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1) and loss (0. 24 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1) were high, yielding a slightly increased <b>patch</b> density in the area 1 year later (October 2004, 1. 40 <b>patches</b> m- 2). Most recruited <b>patches</b> consisted of rooting vegetative fragments of 1 - 2 shoots. Seedling recruitment was observed in Summer 2004 at both sites. Episodic, seedling recruitment comprised 30 % and 25 % of total <b>patch</b> recruitment in Es Port Bay and S'Estanyol, respectively. <b>Patch</b> survival increased with <b>patch</b> size and no direct removal was observed among <b>patches</b> of 5 shoots or more. Most <b>patches</b> grew along the study, shifting <b>patch</b> distribution towards larger sizes. Within the size range studied (1 - 150 shoots), absolute shoot recruitment (shoots year- 1) increased linearly with <b>patch</b> size (R 2 = 0. 64, p < 4 × 10 - 5, N = 125), while specific shoot recruitment was constant (about 0. 25 ± 0. 05 year- 1), although its variance was large for small <b>patches.</b> Given the slow growth rate and the high survival of <b>patches</b> with 5 or more shoots, even the low <b>patch</b> recruitment rates reported here could {{play a significant role}} in the colonisation process of P. oceanica. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{investigated}} <b>patch</b> assessment by northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in {{an experimental}} arena where {{the distribution of}} resources in <b>patches,</b> preharvest information about these <b>patches,</b> and spacing of <b>patches</b> varied.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel and efficient examplar-based inpainting algorithm through investigating the sparsity of natural image <b>patches.</b> Two novel concepts of sparsity at the <b>patch</b> level are proposed for modeling the <b>patch</b> priority and <b>patch</b> representation, which are two crucial steps for <b>patch</b> propagation in the examplar-based inpainting approach. First, <b>patch</b> structure sparsity {{is designed to}} measure the confidence of a <b>patch</b> located at the image structure (e. g., the edge or corner) by the sparseness of its nonzero similarities to the neighboring <b>patches.</b> The <b>patch</b> with larger structure sparsity will be assigned higher priority for further inpainting. Second, {{it is assumed that}} the <b>patch</b> to be filled can be represented by the sparse linear combination of candidate <b>patches</b> under the local <b>patch</b> consistency constraint in a framework of sparse representation. Compared with the traditional examplar-based inpainting approach, structure sparsity enables better discrimination of structure and texture, and the <b>patch</b> sparse representation forces the newly inpainted regions to be sharp and consistent with the surrounding textures.

For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and <b>patching</b> their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} of conservation planning is often to prioritize <b>patches</b> {{based on their}} estimated contribution to metapopulation or metacommunity viability. The contribution that an individual <b>patch</b> makes will depend on its intrinsic characteristics, such as habitat quality, {{as well as its}} location relative to other <b>patches,</b> its connectivity. Here we systematically evaluate five <b>patch</b> value metrics to determine the importance of including an estimate of habitat quality into the metrics. Location: We tested the metrics in landscapes designed to represent different degrees of variability in <b>patch</b> quality and different levels of <b>patch</b> aggregation. Methods: In each landscape, we simulated population dynamics using a spatially explicit, continuous time metapopulation model linked to within <b>patch</b> logistic growth models. We tested five metrics that are used to estimate the contribution that a <b>patch</b> makes to metapopulation viability: two versions of the probability of connectivity index, two versions of <b>patch</b> centrality (a graph theory metric) and the metapopulation capacity metric. Results: All metrics performed best in environments where <b>patch</b> quality was very variable and high quality <b>patches</b> were aggregated. Metrics that incorporated some measure of <b>patch</b> quality did better in all environments, but did particularly well in environments with high variance of <b>patch</b> quality and spatial aggregation of good quality <b>patches.</b> Main conclusions: Including an estimate of <b>patch</b> quality significantly increased the ability of a given connectivity metric to rank correctly habitat <b>patches</b> according to their contribution to metapopulation viability. Incorporating <b>patch</b> quality is particularly important in landscapes where habitat quality is highly variable and good quality <b>patches</b> are spatially aggregated. However, caution should be used when applying <b>patch</b> metrics to homogeneous landscapes, even if good estimates of <b>patch</b> quality are available. Our results demonstrate that landscape structure and the degree of variability in <b>patch</b> quality need to be assessed prior to selecting a suitable method for estimating <b>patch</b> value...|$|R
