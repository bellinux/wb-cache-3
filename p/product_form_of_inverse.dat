40|$|Trigeneration is {{a booming}} {{technology}} for efficient and clean provision of energy. It has potential for reducing pollution emissions dramatically. Similar to {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) production, cost-efficient {{operation of a}} trigeneration system can be planned using an optimization model based on hourly load forecasts. A long-term planning model decomposes into thousands of hourly models, which can be solved separately. In this paper, we model the hourly trigeneration problem as a linear programming (LP) model with a joint characteristic for three energy components to minimize simultaneously the production and purchase costs of three energy components, as well as CO 2 emissions costs. Then we explore the structure of the problem and propose the specialized Tri-Commodity Simplex (TCS) algorithm that employs this structure efficiently. The speed of TCS is based on extremely fast basis inverse operations and reuse of old basic solutions from previously solved hourly models. We compare the performance of TCS with realistic models against an efficient sparse Simplex code using the <b>product</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>inverse.</b> In test runs, TCS is from 36 to 58 times faster when starting from the initial basis and from 43 to 179 times faster when reusing the old basis.

40|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) {{production}} is {{an increasingly important}} energy production technology. CHP production is usually applied in back pressure plants, where the heat and power generation follows a joint characteristic. A CHP system may also comprise separate heat and power production facilities. Cost-efficient operation of a CHP system can be planned using an optimisation model based on hourly load forecasts. A long-term optimisation model decomposes into thousands of hourly models, which can be formulated as linear programming (LP) problems. We model the hourly CHP operation as an LP problem with a special structure and present the specialised Power Simplex algorithm that utilises this structure efficiently. The basis can be organised as an identity matrix and a small block of non-zero coefficients. There {{are only a few}} different types of non-zero blocks, and extremely fast inversion procedures have been designed for each type.

The method, a primal-dual scheme, normally {{begins with a}} problem solution that is neither primal nor dual feasible, and generates an optimal feasible solution in {{a finite number of}} iterations. Convergence of the method is proved and flow charts of the method are presented. The method has been programmed in FORTRAN and has been run on a number of computers including the IBM 1620, the IBM 7044, the CDC G- 20, and the CDC 6400. A number of problems have been solved using the Criss-Cross method, and some comparisons between the Criss-Cross method and the Simplex method have been made. The results, though scanty, are favorable for the Criss-Cross method. A means <b>of</b> using the <b>product</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inverse</b> with the Criss-Cross method is also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a parametric method for solving semi-definite quadratic programs {{which seems to}} be well suited for problems with a large number of constraints. All computations are performed by pivotal operations on a tableau, or more efficiently on an inverse, whose size may be considerably smaller when compared to other methods of solution. Updating <b>of</b> this <b>inverse</b> is accomplished by elementary row and column operations. Programming of the proposed algorithm for a computer is facilitated by the ability to make efficient use <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inverse</b> mechanism <b>of</b> most commercially available linear programming systems. An existing solution to a slightly perturbed problem, if available, may be used as a starting solution for a new problem, with a possible substantial reduction of the required computational effort. Finally, an obvious but rather important advantage of the method is its use in post-optimality studies involving the requirements vector and/or the linear part of the objective function...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{simplex method}} (SM) {{is one of}} the most {{effective}} ways of solving large scale real life linear optimization problems. The efficiency of the solver is crucial. The SM is an iterative procedure, where each iteration is defined by a basis of the constraint set. In order to speed up iterations, proper basis handling procedures must be applied. Two methodologies exist in the state-of-the-art literature, the <b>product</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inverse</b> (PFI) and lower-upper triangular (LU) factorization. Nowadays the LU method is widely used because 120 - 150 iterations can be done without the need of refactorization while the PFI can make only about 30 - 60 iterations without reinversion in order to maintain acceptable numerical accuracy. In this paper we revisit the PFI and present a new version that can make hundreds or sometimes even few thousands of iterations without losing accuracy. The novelty of our approach is in the processing of the non-triangular part of the basis, based on block-triangularization algorithms. The new PFI performs much better than those found in the literature. The results can shed new light on the usefulness of the PFI...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that virtually every decision making problem involves several key criteria since the decision maker works in a multi-criteria environment. Mathematical programming techniques based on a single objective criterion are restricted in application to real-world problems. Among the various techniques which {{have been developed to}} handle multicriteria decision making problems, goal programming is perhaps the most promising approach as it is an appropriate, powerful, flexible, and pragmatic tool. ^ The two principal areas of this research are: (1) development of efficient algorithms for large-scale linear goal programming problems: RSMGP and RSMPGP, and (2) a comparison of their computational efficiency with existing algorithms. ^ RSMGP is based on a combination of the revised simplex method with <b>product</b> <b>form</b> and the modified simplex method while RSMPGP is a combination of the product representation <b>of</b> the <b>inverse</b> and some features of the goal partitioning algorithm. ^ The explicit <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inverse</b> over the regular simplex method and the product representation over the explicit form have various advantages in terms of speed, storage savings, and accuracy. The <b>product</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inverse</b> matrix method has been widely used for commercial computer codes for solving large-scale linear programming problems. ^ The new algorithms have been tested, using ten different models of various sizes, structures, and complexities, against existing algorithms. Computational experience indicates that the degree of sparsity of the model has a negative correlation with computer time. The new algorithms have shown consistently greater relative efficiency over the existing goal programming algorithms when the size of the model becomes larger. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 This thesis {{presents}} a linear programming package that uses an algorithm and data storage method efficient enough {{to solve a}} medium sized linear programming problem (250 variables and 100 constraints) on a minicomputer with small core memory space (4000 bytes). In this routine the problem is formulated {{by the use of}} Thompson's method and the numbers are stored using the condensed tableau formulation. The <b>product</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inverse</b> is used within the computational algorithm. Another objective of the thesis is to desigb an input-output system which presents the linear programming model in a form that is compatible with Resource Planning and Management System networks. The minicomputer that is used to validate these objectives is a Wang 2200 with 4 k-bytes of CPU memory and a microprogrammed BASIC language. The features of Wang 2200 that are utilized in this study include variable word size, BIT manipulation, and packing of information. The linear programming package presented in this thesis proved that a BASIC program can be written for a 4 k-bytes minicomputer to solve RPM problems with as many as 250 process and 100 resource nodes. Though the computational speed was found to be greatly hindered by the physical speed of data transfer to and from the auxiliary memory (cassette tapes) device, the cost of computation was found to be comparable to the other mathematical programming software packages on CDC 3300 and CDC CYBER- 73...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{artificial}} basis for the simplex method was suggested in an early paper by Dantzig. The idea {{is based on an}} observation that certain bases, which differ only in a relatively few columns from the true basis, may be easily inverted. Such artificial bases can then be exploited when carrying out simplex iterations. This idea was originally suggested for solving structured linear programming problems, and several approaches, such as Beale's method of pseudo-basic variables, have indeed been presented in the literature. In this paper, we shall not consider the structure explicitly; rather its exploitation in our case is expected to result directly from the choice of {{an artificial}} basis. We shall consider this basis to remain unchanged over a number of simplex iterations. In particular, this basis may be chosen as the true basis which has been most recently reinverted. In such a case our approach yields an interpretation for a basis representation recently proposed by Bisschop and Meeraus who point out very favorable properties regarding the build-up of nonzero elements in the basis representation. Our approach utilizes an auxiliary basis, which is small relative to the true basis, and whose dimension may change from one iteration to another. We shall finally develop an updating scheme for a <b>product</b> <b>form</b> representation <b>of</b> the <b>inverse</b> <b>of</b> such an auxiliary basis...|$|R

To avoid the problem of spurious results due to non-stationarity the variables have been written in first difference form.
