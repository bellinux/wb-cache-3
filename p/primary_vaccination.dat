If anamnestic response is high after receiving a primary vaccine many years ago, there is most likely little to no need for a booster dose.

40|$|Abstract Background The United States (US) has re-instituted {{smallpox}} vaccinations {{to prepare}} for an intentional release of the smallpox virus into the civilian population. In an outbreak, {{people of all ages}} will be vaccinated. To prepare for the impact of large-scale ring and mass vaccinations, we conducted a systematic review of the complication and mortality risks of smallpox vaccination. We summarized these risks for post-vaccinial encephalitis, vaccinia necrosum (progressive vaccinia), eczema vaccinatum, generalized vaccinia, and accidental infection (inadvertant autoinoculation). Methods Using a MEDLINE search strategy, we identified 348 articles, of which seven studies met our inclusion criteria (the number of <b>primary</b> <b>vaccinations</b> and re-vaccinations were reported, sufficient data were provided to calculate complication or case-fatality risks, and comparable case definitions were used). For each complication, we estimated of the complication, death, and case-fatality risks. Results The life-threatening complications of post-vaccinial encephalitis and vaccinia necrosum were at least 3 and 1 per million <b>primary</b> <b>vaccinations,</b> respectively. Twenty-nine percent of vaccinees with post-vaccinial encephalitis died and 15 % with vaccinia necrosum died. There were no deaths among vaccinees that developed eczema vaccinatum; however, 2. 3 % of non-vaccinated contacts with eczema vaccinatum died. Among re-vaccinees, the risk of post-vaccinial encephalitis was reduced 26 -fold, the risk of generalized vaccinia was reduced 29 -fold, and the risk of eczema vaccinatum was reduced 12 -fold.

We evaluated the expected cost-effectiveness of using mailed reminders from family physicians to increase <b>primary</b> tetanus <b>vaccination</b> coverage among elderly Canadians. We estimated that over 10 years the program would prevent five cases of tetanus and one death from tetanus, resulting in a gain of 13 life-years. There would be 16, 700 adverse reactions to tetanus toxoid, 17 % in people already immune to tetanus. The net cost of the program (in 1984 Canadian dollars) would be $ 1. 9 million per case of tetanus prevented, $ 7. 1 million per death prevented and $ 810, 000 per life-year gained. These high cost-effectiveness ratios are largely attributable to the very low risk of tetanus, even among nonimmune elderly people. Tetanus toxoid and physicians' services for vaccination would account for 86 % of the program costs. Because the mailed reminders {{would be responsible for}} only 13 % of the program costs, other possible programs to increase <b>primary</b> tetanus <b>vaccination</b> coverage could not be expected to have substantially lower cost-effectiveness ratios.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the reported rate of local reactions after administration of acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa) according to dose number and type of pertussis vaccine (whole-cell or acellular) used for the primary course, and to document the severity and outcome of fourth-dose local reactions. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review. Reports of adverse events after vaccination in South Australia between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2000 were reviewed, and a questionnaire administered to all parents who reported a local reaction after the fourth dose of DTPa. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number, and rate per 100 000 administered doses, of local reactions following the primary and booster doses of DTPa, and of local reactions after the fourth-dose in cohorts of children whose <b>primary</b> <b>vaccinations</b> were with either DTPw or DTPa. Redness and/or swelling at the injection site as reported by parents. RESULTS: Of 581 reported adverse events after vaccination, 138 were local reactions after a pertussis-containing vaccine. <b>Primary</b> <b>vaccinations</b> with DTPa was a significant risk factor for a fourth-dose local reaction (relative risk, 6. 7; 95 % CI, 2. 4 - 18. 5). Parental questionnaires were completed for 45 of the 71 children (63 %) with reported local reactions after the fourth dose of DTPa; extensive limb swelling was reported in 8 children (18 %) and all except one child had recovered by the time of review. CONCLUSIONS: Parents should be informed that children receiving booster doses of DTPa vaccine, after primary doses with DTPa, are at increased risk of local reactions (which tend to resolve spontaneously) but not of systemic effects. Studies should be initiated to investigate the pathogenesis and the risk of recurrence of local reactions to further improve vaccination schedules.

Recent study finds {{that they may}} also decrease the antibody responses to several vaccine antigens. This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence for a relationship between prophylactic antipyretic administration, post-vaccination adverse events, and antibody response in children. A systematic search of major databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE was carried out till March 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prophylactic antipyretic treatment versus placebo post-vaccination in children ≤ 6 years of age were included. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed the studies for methodological quality, and extracted data [PROSPERO registration: CRD 42014009717]. Of 2579 citations retrieved, a total of 13 RCTs including 5077 children {{were included in the}} review. Prophylactic antipyretic administration significantly reduced the febrile reactions (≥ 38. 0 °C) after <b>primary</b> and booster <b>vaccinations.</b> Though there were statistically significant differences in the antibody responses between the two groups, the prophylactic PCM group had what would be considered protective levels of antibodies to all of the antigens given after the <b>primary</b> and booster <b>vaccinations.</b> No significant difference in the nasopharyngeal carriage rates (short-term and long-term) of H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae serotypes was found between the prophylactic and no prophylactic PCM group.

A longer persistence after the pre-school boost of IgG-Pertussis Toxin (PT) and IgG-pertactin levels was observed in Infanrix primed children, but it was not statistically significant. More than 80 % of children presented a positive ASC B memory response. Around 50 % of children still presented protective IgG-PT levels which are reduced to 36 % in no-boosted children.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the {{potential}} for bioterrorism has led to discussions on the durability of vaccine-induced immunity, the actual duration of protection against smallpox is still unknown. It has previously been suggested that at least partial protection against severe and fatal smallpox may persist throughout life. METHODS: In this article, we analyzed 6 major smallpox outbreaks that occurred before and after 1900 in the United Kingdom. These analyses {{are based on the}} age-dependent incidence of smallpox and the fraction of severe manifestations among individuals with or without prior vaccination. We used a likelihood-based approach to estimate the duration of immunity from the age-specific frequencies. RESULTS: The expected median duration of protection from disease ranged from 11. 7 to 28. 4 years after <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination,</b> and the qualitative pattern of duration could be described using Gompertz's Law. Vaccinated individuals appear to have been protected from severe disease with more than 50 % probability even 50 years after successful <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that successful <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> offered full protection for a few decades, with partial protection from severe smallpox possibly lasting a lifetime, for a substantial fraction of the population.

40|$|A {{total of}} 256 sera {{collected}} from three species of domesticated equidae in four different Spanish provinces were examined 1 - 4 {{months after the}} administration of attenuated monovalent African horse sickness virus (AHSV) serotype 4 vaccine. Approximately 10 % of the sera were negative by ELISA, virus neutralization, agar gel immuno-diffusion and complement fixation tests. Similar negative reactions were recorded with sera from two ponies after experimental <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination.</b> The rapid rise in antibodies in sera from these two ponies, after a second dose of vaccine, suggested they {{would probably have been}} immune to challenge. It is therefore suggested that the apparent absence of antibodies against AHSV in some animals after <b>primary</b> <b>vaccination</b> may not necessarily indicate a total lack of protection...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{vaccination}} against intracellular pathogens, including liver-stage Plasmodium falciparum, {{will require}} induction of strong antigen-specific T lymphocyte responses. The multiple epitope (ME) -thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) construct includes CD 8 (+) and CD 4 (+) T cell epitopes from pre-erythrocytic P. falciparum antigens fused in-frame {{to the entire}} pre-erythrocytic antigen TRAP. Three carriers for this construct [...] plasmid DNA and 2 recombinant nonreplicating poxviruses (modified vaccinia virus Ankara [MVA] and fowlpox strain 9 [FP 9]) [...] were administered at 3 -week intervals in a heterologous prime-boost combination to 29 Gambian men aged 18 - 45 years. Doses of DNA ME-TRAP, MVA ME-TRAP, and FP 9 ME-TRAP were 2 mg and 1. 5 x 10 (8) and 1 x 10 (8) plaque-forming units, respectively. DNA ME-TRAP was injected intramuscularly; MVA ME-TRAP and FP 9 ME-TRAP were injected intradermally. There were no clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities and no severe or serious adverse events related to vaccination. DNA/MVA and FP 9 /MVA regimens were the most potent inducers of circulating effector T cells seen to date in sub-Saharan Africa. Twelve months after the final vaccination, a single booster vaccination expanded the effector T cell pool to a similar or higher magnitude than that after the <b>primary</b> <b>vaccinations.</b> These results highlight optimized combination regimens with general relevance {{to the development of}} vaccines targeting intracellular pathogens...|$|R
