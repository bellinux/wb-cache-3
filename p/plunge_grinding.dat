50|$|Cylindrical {{grinding}} (also called center-type grinding) is used {{to grind}} the cylindrical surfaces and shoulders of the workpiece. The workpiece is mounted on centers and rotated by a device known as a drive dog or center driver. The abrasive wheel and the workpiece are rotated by separate motors and at different speeds. The table can be adjusted to produce tapers. The wheel head can be swiveled.The five types of cylindrical grinding are: outside diameter (OD) grinding, inside diameter (ID) grinding, <b>plunge</b> <b>grinding,</b> creep feed grinding, and centerless grinding.|$|E
50|$|In grinding, {{the wheel}} follows a simple path. For example, in <b>plunge</b> <b>grinding</b> a shaft, the wheel moves in towards {{the axis of}} the part, grinds it, and then moves back out. Since each slice of the wheel {{repeatedly}} contacts the same slice of the workpiece, any inaccuracies in the geometric shape of the grinding wheel will be transferred onto the part. Therefore, {{the accuracy of the}} finished workpiece geometry is limited to the accuracy of the truing dresser. The accuracy becomes even worse as the grind wheel wears, so truing must occur periodically to reshape it.|$|E

The machining accuracy of CNC is greatly depending on online detecting, prediction and control ability of abnormal phenomena in machining such as chatter. Based on the mechanism of regenerative chatter, the dynamic models of cylindrical plunging are established by considering both the rotate speed of workpiece and grinding wheel. The traverse grinding can be assumed as the sum of several stepwise <b>plunging</b> <b>grinding</b> with respect to the grinding contact area.

40|$|Grinding - {{the final}} {{machining}} process of a workpiece - requires {{large amounts of}} cutting fluids for the lubrication, cooling and removal of chips.

40|$|Through-feed {{centerless}} grinding is a precision finishing process used to manufacture circular components. This dissertation investigates the workpiece shape generating mechanism in the through-feed {{centerless grinding}} process. Specifically, the workpiece lobing mechanism and axial guidance through the grinding gap were studied. ^ To study the workpiece lobing mechanism, a computer simulation of the <b>plunge</b> centerless <b>grinding</b> process was developed. This simulation was experimentally verified {{by comparing the}} harmonic spectra of simulated workpieces with the spectra of workpieces ground with similar set-up parameters. The simulation correctly predicted which frequencies on the workpiece surface were more susceptible to roundness errors than others. These results were found to also be compatible with a previous linear lobing model (ZHOU 94). The plunge lobing analysis was then extended to the through-feed case {{by means of an}} average growth rate chart. This chart characterizes the workpiece lobing stability for a given through-feed set-up. Again, experimental studies were conducted to verify the accuracy of this model and it was determined that the average growth rate chart was effective in assessing the workpiece lobing stability for the case of short workpieces like bearing rings. ^ To address the problem of controlling the workpiece cylindrical form, a simulation of the workpiece supporting system was developed.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{centreless grinding}} machine was modified extensively to operate satisfactorily at high grinding wheel speeds and in the high rate centreless grinding regime. The principal modifications included the provision of a 75 k. W. d. c., variable speed, main drive motor which enables grinding wheel speeds up to 120 m/s to be employed and a coolant supply manifold was designed and manufactured-which was capable of delivering a high velocity coolant stream to the grinding zone. In addition, a measurement system was developed-which-allowed the grinding forces to be monitored and recorded in process. Two solutions for the accepted kinematic model of <b>plunge</b> feed cylindrical <b>grinding</b> are proposed. The general and more accurate solution takes account of the variable grit height and separation of the grinding wheel, whilst the particular and approximate analytical solution makes provision for variable grit separation only. The particular solution enabled parametric studies to be undertaken and allowed comparisons with the solutions proposed by other workers. The trends of theoretical grinding forces were predicted from analysis of the undeformed chip dimensions. The trends indicated two methods of achieving high stock removal rates, firstly, for a constant force value, higher stock removal rates are possible by increasing the grinding wheel speed and infeed-rate. Secondly, at a constant grinding wheel speed, and force level, reducing the workpiece speed and increasing the infeed-rate will yield higher stock removal rates. Experimental results were in agreement with these predictions. An extensive experimental programme investigating <b>plunge</b> feed centreless <b>grinding</b> of ferrous components was undertaken. Results from approximately 300 grinding experiments were used to establish a data bank of grinding parameters {{for a range of}} grinding conditions. High-rate centreless grinding {{has been shown to be}} a feasible first machining process. It has also been shown that the choice of kinematic conditions is important in achieving high stock removal rate grinding. Incorrect choice of kinematic conditions can cause problems of, workpiece burn, grinding vibrations and excessive power demands. Limit charts have been constructed which outline the boundaries to the process in terms of burn, grinding vibration and power limit. Operation between the boundaries is best achieved if the ratio of grinding wheel to workpiece speeds is in the range 90 - 200.

40|$|Abstract The coolant {{delivery}} technique {{known as}} Minimal Quantity Lubrication (MQL) has been employed in machining {{since the end}} of the 20 th Century and has gained considerable evidence in the last years as a viable alternative to the use of the conventional coolant technique (flood). Due to the low oil flow rate delivered by the MQL technique in grinding operations, that generally varies from 20 to 240 ml / h in relation to near 600, 000 ml / h flow rate of the conventional coolant technique, the MQL technique provides a reduced risk for human health and environmental damage associated with the use, maintenance and disposal of cutting fluids. In this context, this study was carried out to evaluate the application viability of the minimum quantity lubrication coolant technique under different flow rates in the <b>plunge</b> cylindrical <b>grinding</b> of ABNT 4340 steel with an aluminum oxide wheel. Three flow rates were tested: 30, 60 and 120 ml/h. Grinding trials with the conventional coolant delivery method were also tested for comparative purposes. The output variables used to assess the efficiency of the MQL technique in this work are: roughness, roundness and hardness of the workpiece. Grinding wheel wear and power consumption were also monitored. The results showed that, despite the higher values of roughness and roundness of the workpiece, as well as the grinding wheel wear, the values of these same parameters obtained after machining with the MQL technique were close to those obtained after machining with the conventional technique. No thermal damages and cracks on the machined surface, or even below the machined surface, were observed after grinding ABNT 4340 steel irrespective of the coolant-lubrication condition investigated. The results showed that the MQL with 120 ml/h can be an alternative coolant technique due to cleaner environment and lower consumption of fluid in grinding under the conditions investigated in this work...|$|R

40|$|Grinding is an {{abrasive}} {{machining process}} {{used for the}} final shaping of components that require very smooth surfaces and a high dimensional accuracy. In recent years, the costs of industrial grinding operations have increased with a greater demand for high-strength, low-weight superalloy components. Titanium and nickel-based alloys are desirable for their high creep-rupture strength and corrosion and oxidation resistance in high-temperature environments. However, they {{are very difficult to}} grinding due to a combination of poor thermal properties, rapid work-hardening, and a high level of chemical reactivity. In this thesis, two methods are investigated to improve process performance in <b>plunge</b> centerless <b>grinding</b> of Inconel 718 and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V superalloy fasteners: (i) economic optimization of grinding process parameters and (ii) reduced quantity lubrication using a graphite nanoplatelet-enhanced grinding fluid. In the first part, a systematic methodology is presented for finding the optimum parameters in two stages: (i) modeling of process and part quality constraints, and (ii) determination of optimum grinding conditions in the feasible operating region. In the second part, the performance of a graphite nanoplatelet-enhanced grinding fluid in reduced quantity lubrication centerless grinding is evaluated to assess its potential as a cost-effective alternative to the traditional flood cooling method. The results of the study indicate that an appreciable reduction in the cost of the superalloy grinding operation can be achieved by operating at the optimum parameters. In addition, it is shown that the application of a graphite-enhanced fluid at a reduced flow rate is more effective than high-volume flood cooling in reducing specific grinding energy levels and wheel wear rates, thus offering the potential to increase process productivity.

60|$|That {{was about}} 1849. Tom Nash {{was a boy}} of my own age--the postmaster's son. The Mississippi was frozen across, and he and I went skating one night, {{probably}} without permission. I cannot see why we should go skating in the night unless without permission, for {{there could be no}} considerable amusement to be gotten out of skating at night if nobody was going to object to it. About midnight, when we were more than half a mile out toward the Illinois shore, we heard some ominous rumbling and grinding and crashing going on between us and the home side of the river, and we knew what it meant--the ice was breaking up. We started for home, pretty badly scared. We flew along at full speed whenever the moonlight sifting down between the clouds enabled us to tell which was ice and which was water. In the pauses we waited; started again whenever there was a good bridge of ice; paused again when we came to naked water and waited in distress until a floating vast cake should bridge that place. It took us an hour to make the trip--a trip which we made in a misery of apprehension all the time. But at last we arrived within a very brief distance of the shore. We waited again; there was another place that needed bridging. All about us the ice was <b>plunging</b> and <b>grinding</b> along and piling itself up in mountains on the shore, and the dangers were increasing, not diminishing. We grew very impatient to get to solid ground, so we started too early and went springing from cake to cake. Tom made a miscalculation, and fell short. He got a bitter bath, but he was so close to shore that he only had to swim a stroke or two--then his feet struck hard bottom and he crawled out. I arrived a little later, without accident. We had been in a drenching perspiration, and Tom's bath was a disaster for him. He took to his bed sick, and had a procession of diseases. The closing one was scarlet-fever, and he came out of it stone deaf. Within a year or two speech departed, of course. But some years later he was taught to talk, after a fashion--one couldn't always make out what it was he was trying to say. Of course he could not modulate his voice, since he couldn't hear himself talk. When he supposed he was talking low and confidentially, you could hear him in Illinois.|$|R
