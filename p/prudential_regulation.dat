25|$|In the mid-1960s, {{monetary}} authorities accepted Coombs' conclusions and allowed a flexible interest rate, {{making it easier}} for the bank to rely on open market operations. The Exchange Control was abolished after the float of the Australian dollar occurred in 1983. In the five years after the Campbell Committee probe, 1979–1984, the financial system in Australia became deregulated. Another probe was the Wallis Committee in 1996, which took effect in 1998. The effects were the transfer of overseeing the banks from the RBA to the Australian <b>Prudential</b> <b>Regulation</b> Authority (APRA) and the creation of the Payments System Board (PSB), which would attempt to maintain the safety and performance of the payments system. The bank was given powers within the PSB through additional legislation in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Members of the Payment Systems Board {{are defined}} by Section 25A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959, with three of the members being ex officio or representatives of another organisation.

In addition, there are up to five {{other members of the}} board that are appointed by the Treasurer for a term up to five years in length. They meet once per quarter, with five members forming a quorum, and one meeting per year is generally held in Melbourne, while the rest are held in Sydney.

40|$|This paper explores how <b>prudential</b> <b>regulations</b> {{can support}} {{monetary}} policy in reducing output fluctuations while maintaining financial stability. It uses a new framework that blends a standard model for monetary policy analysis with a contingent claims model of financial sector vulnerabilities. The {{results suggest that}} binding countercyclical <b>prudential</b> <b>regulations</b> can help reduce output fluctuations and lessen the risk of financial instability. More specifically, countercyclical rules such as countercyclical capital adequacy rules, can allow monetary authorities {{to achieve the same}} output and inflation objectives but with smaller adjustments in interest rates. The countercyclical rules can help stem swings in asset prices, lean against a financial accelerator process, and thereby help to lower risks of macroeconomic and financial instability. In economies with fixed exchange rates, where countercyclical monetary policy is not possible, <b>prudential</b> <b>regulations</b> can provide a useful mechanism for mitigating a run-up in asset prices and for promoting output stability.

2500|$|At {{the time}} of {{acquisition}} BankWest was reporting to the Australian <b>Prudential</b> <b>Regulation</b> Authority (APRA) under to Basel I requirements, and under CBA ownership began reporting under Basel II Pillar 3 standardised approach requirements on 1 January 2009.(Refer the CBA 2009 Profit Announcement). At the time both HBOS and the CBA reported provisions for remaining consideration of circa $300 million. The acquisition was completed on 19 December 2008. (refer note 14 of the CBA 11 February 2009 half year profit announcement). The BankWest performing loan book as at 18 December 2008, had a value of approximately $57 billion, $18 billion of which were S (Standard and Poors) rated B+ or worse.(Refer the BankWest Credit Policy, the BankWest 2008A financial statements and the CBA Answers to Questions on Notice to the Parliamentary Inquiry(PJC)). As at 18 December 2008 BankWest owed its Parent HBOS a net figure of $21,076 million, and HBOS had secured a further $3,767 million loan from the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) to support the funding of the BankWest loan book. The BankWest Parent Company Funding therefore can be calculated as $17.3 billion being ($21,076 million minus $3,767 million). On completion, the CBA paid $14.513 to HBOS and $3,767 million to the RBA [...] leaving a loan from HBOS to the CBA of $2,797 million called the Excess Facility Amount loan.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} side, {{courts and tribunals}} are {{theoretically}} under a duty to refer questions. In the UK, for example, Lord Denning MR considered it appropriate to refer if {{the outcome of a}} case depended on a correct answer, and the Civil Procedure Rules entitle the High Court to refer at any stage of proceedings. The view of the Court of Justice in the leading case, CILFIT v Ministry of Health is that a national court has no duty to refer if the law is acte clair (a clear rule), or [...] "so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt as to {{the manner in which the}} question raised is to be resolved". In Kenny Roland Lyckeskog the Court of Justice held that the duty to refer existed for the Swedish Court of Appeal, the hovrätt, since Sweden's Supreme Court (Högsta domstol) had to give permission for appeals to continue. The practical difficulty is that judges differ on their views of whether or not the law is clear. In a significant case, Three Rivers DC v Governor of the Bank of England the UK House of Lords felt confident that it was clear under the First Banking Directive that depositors did not have direct rights to sue the Bank of England for alleged failure to carry out adequate <b>prudential</b> <b>regulation.</b> Their Lordships highlighted that while some uncertainty might exist, the costs of delay in making a reference outweighed the benefits from total certainty. By contrast, in ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis, a majority of the Supreme Court apparently felt able to declare that the law under Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive was acte clair, and decline to make a reference, even though a senior Law Lord delivered a powerfully reasoned dissent. However, in addition to a reluctance to make references, a general scepticism has grown among senior member state judiciaries of the mode of reasoning used by the Court of Justice. The UK Supreme Court in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport devoted large parts of its judgment to criticism, in its view, an unpredictable 'teleological' mode of reasoning which, could decrease confidence in maintaining a dialogue within a plural and transnational judicial system. It added that it might not interpret the European Communities Act 1972 to abridge basic principles and understanding of constitutional functioning – in effect implying that it might decline to follow unreasonable Court of Justice judgments on important issues. Similarly, the German Constitutional Court in the Outright Monetary Transactions case referred a question for preliminary ruling on whether the European Central Bank's plan to buy Greek and other government bonds on secondary markets, despite the Treaty prohibition on buying them directly, was unlawful. In a highly unusual move, the two most senior judges dissented that the ECB's plan could be lawful, while the majority closely guided the Court of Justice on the appropriate mode of reasoning.|$|E
