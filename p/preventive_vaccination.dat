In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a decision analysis that evaluated direct costs (program costs such as vaccine cost, administrative burden, negative vaccine-linked reactions, and transportation time lost to parents to seek health providers for vaccination). The study focused on diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenza type b conjugate, poliovirus, measles/mumps/rubella (MMR), hepatitis B, varicella, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate, hepatitis A, and rotavirus vaccines, but excluded influenza.

40|$|Introduction : Infectious {{diseases}} {{are still a}} significant medical and social problem in the contemporary world. The most effective {{and at the same}} time the least expensive way to become protected against infectious diseases is vaccinations. Appropriate education of the society referring to the prevention of infectious diseases such as measles, diphtheria, or pertussis can contribute to changing the attitudes of many parents to mandatory and recommended vaccinations. Aim of the research: The analysis of the impact of the level of knowledge on making decisions about administering <b>preventive</b> <b>vaccinations.</b> Material and methods : The study included 370 participants (308 women and 62 men). They were students of Lublin universities and young parents living in the Lublin voivodeship. The research tool was an author-made questionnaire consisting of 20 closed questions. For the statistical analysis of research results the methods of descriptive statistics, the χc 2 test, and Cramer’s V correlation coefficient were used. Results : As many as 98 % of the respondents exhibiting a higher level of knowledge declared future regular vaccinations of their children in accordance with the official recommendations. Among people with a low level of knowledge, only 45 % declared such regularity in their children’s vaccination. As many as 62 % of the respondents who lacked knowledge on vaccinations failed to have voluntary vaccinations administered. In comparison, among those with high level of knowledge, 50 % never had recommended vaccinations administered. Conclusions : The level of knowledge has a significant impact on the decisions on administering <b>preventive</b> <b>vaccinations</b> in the studied population.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} twenty years, oral {{vaccination}} implementing a live attenuated vaccine has been experimented in Europe {{in order to control}} classical swine fever (CSF) in Wild Boar (). This has generally led to an enhanced seroprevalence and a decreased viroprevalence at the scale of the whole vaccinated populations, but no quantitative analysis has demonstrated the protective effect of <b>preventive</b> <b>vaccination</b> or intensive baiting. In the present paper we conducted an retrospective analysis at the scale of the municipality, taking into account the local dynamics and possible covariates of infection to test the effect of <b>preventive</b> <b>vaccination</b> and of the baiting effort. To be efficient, vaccination was expected to increase seroprevalence above the level considered as suitable for preventing disease invasion (40 - 60 %) independently of infection, to protect free areas from disease invasion or contribute to control subsequent disease intensity and duration. We also hypothesized that a better baiting effort would be correlated with an improvement of immunisation and disease control. In uninfected municipalities, seroprevalence increased up to 40 % after one year, i. e. three vaccination campaigns. We observed a significant protective effect of <b>preventive</b> <b>vaccination,</b> especially within municipalities that had been vaccinated at least one year before disease emergence and where virus detection did not last more than one quarter. On the other hand, we did not detect a significant effect of the baiting effort on local seroprevalence or disease dynamics, suggesting that the baiting system could be improved. We discuss these results regarding the improvement of management measures and further research perspective...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an economic analysis of Q fever control strategies in dairy goat herds in The Netherlands. Evaluated control strategies involved vaccination strategies (being either preventive or reactive) and reactive non-vaccination strategies (i. e., culling or breeding prohibition). Reactive strategies were initiated after PCR positive bulk tank milk or after an abortion storm (abortion percentage in the herd of 5 % or more). <b>Preventive</b> <b>vaccination</b> eradicates Q fever in a herd on average within 2 and 7 years (depending on breeding style and vaccination strategy). Economic outcomes reveal that <b>preventive</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{is always the}} preferred Q fever control strategy on infected farms and this even holds for a partial analysis if only on-farm costs and benefits are accounted for and human health costs are ignored. Averted human health costs depend to a large extend {{on the number of}} infected human cases per infected farm or animal. Much is yet unknown with respect to goat-human transmission rates. When the pathogen is absent in both livestock and farm environment then the "freedom of Q fever disease" is achieved. This would enable a return to non-vaccinated herds but more insight is required with respect to the mechanisms and probability of re-infection. </p...|$|E
