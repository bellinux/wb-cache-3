40|$|Blending fullerenes with a donor polymer for the {{fabrication}} of organic solar cells {{often leads to}} at least <b>partial</b> <b>vitrification</b> of one, if not both, components. For prototypical poly(3 -hexylthiophene) :fullerene blend, we show that {{the addition of a}} commercial nucleating agent, di(3, 4 -dimethyl benzylidene) sorbitol, to such binary blends accelerates the crystallization of the donor, resulting in an increase in its degree of crystallinity in as-cast structures. This allows manipulation of the extent of intermixing/ phase separation of the donor and acceptor directly from solution, offering a tool to improve device characteristics such as power conversion efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Interaction of CO 2, Nd:YAG, excimer {{and high}} power diode laser (HPDL) {{radiation}} with {{the surface of}} an Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 based ceramic was found to affect {{significant changes in the}} wettability characteristics of the material. It was observed that interaction with CO 2, Nd:YAG and HPDL radiation reduced the enamel contact angle from 1180 to 310, 340 and 330 respectively. In contrast, interaction with excimer laser radiation resulted an increase in the contact angle to 1210. Such changes were identified as being due to: (i) the melting and <b>partial</b> <b>vitrification</b> of the Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 based ceramic surface as a result of interaction with CO 2, Nd:YAG HPDL radiation. (ii) the surface roughness of the Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 based ceramic increasing after interaction with excimer laser radiation. (iii) the relative surface oxygen content of the Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 based ceramic increasing after interaction with CO 2, Nd:YAG and HPDL radiation. The work has shown that the wettability characteristics of the Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 based ceramic could be controlled and/or modified with laser surface treatment. Moreover, it was found that changes in the wettability characteristics of the Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 based ceramic are related to the effects of laser wavelength, that is whether the wavelength of the laser radiation has the propensity to cause surface melting...|$|E
40|$|Four {{case studies}} {{are used to}} examine the {{relationships}} of water, ice nucleators and desiccation in the cold survival of invertebrates and the viability of frozen plant material: the freeze intolerant Antarctic springtail Cryptopygus antarcticus (Willem) (Collembola, Isotomidae), the freeze tolerant larvae of the fly Heleomyza borealis Boh. (Diptera: Heleomyzidae), the freeze intolerant Arctic springtail Onychiurus arcticus (Tullberg) (Collembola, Onychiuridae) and meristems of the currant Ribes ciliatum Humb. & Bonpl. (Grossulariaceae) from Mexico. Prevention of ice nucleation, lowering the water content by removal of osmotically active (freezable) water are critical features of the different cold survival strategies of the three species of invertebrates. In C. antarcticus, which desiccates rapidly by losing water via the cuticle to the atmosphere, the number of ice nucleators (and their activity) increases with lowered ambient temperature. During prolonged cold exposure ice nucleators are masked, but re-activated rapidly by water uptake in this species. Larval H. borealis do not readily desiccate and conserve their body water, 20 - 25 % of it being bound (osmotically inactive). Experiments showed that a high proportion (c. 80 %) of slowly cooled larvae survived exposure to - 60 degreesC. By comparison O. arcticus is able to sustain up to 40 % loss of its body water and desiccation lowers its supercooling point to promote over winter survival. Dehydration leading to <b>partial</b> <b>vitrification</b> of currant (R. ciliatum) meristems improves their viability after cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen. From this comparison of four biological systems, it is concluded that the role of water and its activity at sub-zero temperatures are fundamental to the survival of freezing conditions by all the species studied. Although similar features exist in the four systems, no common basic mechanism was found...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{approach to}} melting process improving leads to melting modeling either by complex models working under real conditions or by simplified partial models which are well adjustable {{and may be}} completed into more complex models according to actual need. The second way is more promising when trying to find non-traditional arrangements of the melting process or when solving <b>partial</b> melting or <b>vitrification</b> problems. The system of models involves models of glass melt behavior, particle behavior and particle or component distribution in the melt. The modular system of models allows to realize the tailored model. The examples of model completing and using are presented...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{conserve}} biodiversity of cocoa has become paramount {{due to the}} action {{of a range of}} diseases, pests and environmental hazards. In 1983 bushfire destroyed 60, 000 ha of cocoa plantation in Ghana and as of 1982 185. 5 million trees have been cut down in Eastern region of Ghana alone due to Cacao Swollen Shoot Virus (CSSV) infection. In order to safeguard germplasm of cocoa there is the need to use in vitro-based techniques to support in situ conservation. Successful cryopreservation of cocoa has already been demonstrated using an encapsulation-dehydration method but this is a labour intensive protocol requiring a relatively high level of technical skill and the objective of the current work is to explore the efficacy of a vitrification-based approach. Floral-derived secondary somatic embryos (SSE) of cocoa genotype AMAZ 15 were utilised. In order to optimise the vitrification procedure the effect of preculturing SSEs on sucrose and dehydration with plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS 2) was studied. SSEs were precultured on embryo development (ED) medium supplemented with either 0. 5 or 0. 75 M sucrose for 3 or 5 d and dehydrated with cold PVS 2 for 45 - 105 rin before storage in liquid nitrogen (LN). Preculturing the embryos on 0. 5 M sucrose for 5 d and dehydrating them in PVS 2 for 60 min led to significantly higher post-cryo survival than any other treatment (74. 5 Â± 6. 4 %). So as to minimise cryo-injury due to cation- induced free radical formation, nutrient cation sources were removed from the ED solution and/or the recovery medium (ED), the former treatment resulting in a significant benefit. The influence of size of cotyledonary stage SSEs on postcryo' survival was studied for two size ranges. SSEs between 2 - 3 mm survived better than those between 4 - 5 mm. The protocol was effective across five other genotypes so far tested without further procedural variation. In order to accelerate bulking up of clones, embryos regenerated following cryopreservation were used as explant sources and the freezing process was not found to have any inhibitory effect on their embryogenic potential. In order to optimise the dehydration process Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to examine SSEs during cooling and warming. <b>Partial</b> <b>vitrification,</b> as evidenced by glass transition and ice melting, was achieved when embryos were exposed to PVS 2 for 45 and 60 min which correlated with higher post- cryo survival. Application of somatic embryogenesis and cryopreservation to eradicate Cacao Swollen Shoot Virus (CSSV) was also studied. While somatic embryogenesis was able to reduce CSSV transmission in genotypes studied the assessment of any 'cryotherapy' effect was limited by the availability of post-cryo regenerants.
