40|$|The equity <b>premium</b> (also called {{market risk}} <b>premium,</b> equity risk <b>premium,</b> market <b>premium</b> and risk <b>premium),</b> {{is one of}} the most important, {{discussed}} but elusive parameters in finance. The term equity <b>premium</b> is used to designate four different concepts (although many times they are mixed) : Historical Equity <b>Premium</b> (HEP), Expected Equity <b>Premium</b> (EEP); Required Equity <b>Premium</b> (REP) and Implied Equity <b>Premium</b> (IEP). It has been argued that, from an economic standpoint, we need to establish the primacy of the EEP, since it is what guides investors' decisions. However, the REP is more important for many important decisions, among others, valuations of projects and companies, acquisitions, and corporate investment decisions. The EEP is important only for the investors that hold the market portfolio. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} <b>premium</b> is the <b>premium</b> that {{is derived}} from not knowing the sure outcome (risk <b>premium)</b> and from not knowing the precise odds of outcomes (ambiguity <b>premium).</b> A recent paper by Klibanoff, Marinacci and Mukerji (KMM, 2005) generalizes a smooth version of the max-min expected utility model with multiple priors. We construct the uncertainty <b>premium</b> based on the KMM model (generalizing Pratt’s risk <b>premium).</b> We show that when consumer preferences are characterized by constant relative risk and ambiguity aversion, the uncertainty <b>premium</b> can decrease {{with an increase in}} agent risk aversion. This happens because increasing risk aversion always results in a lower ambiguity <b>premium.</b> Similar qualitative results hold for the case of constant absolute ambiguity aversion. The positive ambiguity <b>premium</b> might give an additional explanation to the equity <b>premium</b> puzzle...|$|R

5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of <b>premiums,</b> replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based <b>premiums</b> and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through <b>premiums</b> to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
