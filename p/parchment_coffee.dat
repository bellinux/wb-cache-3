40|$|ABSTRACT The wood panel {{industry}} is constantly growing, being necessary the innovation in technologies {{and raw materials}} {{to improve the quality}} of the final product. Considering the shortage and pressure to decrease the dependence of wood, there is an interest in other renewable materials such as agricultural wastes. Among these wastes, <b>coffee</b> <b>parchment</b> is one which deserves notoriety. An alternative use for <b>coffee</b> <b>parchment</b> could be for production of particleboard in association with wood particles. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using <b>coffee</b> <b>parchment</b> for production of particleboard. The following percentages of wastes were used: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 % in association to eucalyptus wood. The panels were produced with 8 % of urea formaldehyde (based on dry weight of particles). The pressing cycle consisted by: pre-pressing of 0. 5 MPa for 10 minutes followed by pressing of 4. 0 MPa, and temperature of 160 ° C for 15 minutes. The compaction ratio of particleboards produced using higher quantities of parchment improved the physical properties. The properties of Water Absorption (2 and 24 h) and Thickness Swelling (2 h) decreased with increasing percentage of <b>coffee</b> <b>parchment.</b> The Thickness Swelling (24 h) showed not significant effect with an increase of coffee waste. The Modulus of Elasticity for <b>coffee</b> <b>parchment</b> particleboards was in the range 646. 49 ± 112. 65 to 402. 03 ± 66. 24 MPa, while the Modulus of Rupture ranged from 8. 18 ± 1. 39 to 4. 45 ± 0. 75 MPa.

30|$|Coffee husk {{characteristics}} {{vary with}} the method of coffee processing. When the coffee is processed by the “wet” method, the coffee fruits are separated into three different groups: cherry coffee, green coffee, and buoy coffee. Cherry coffee is the newly mature coffee fruit, while buoy coffee is coffee fruit that has dried on the coffee tree before harvest and floats during the wet processing method. Green coffee is non-ripened coffee fruit. Further processing of cherry coffee produces residues known as <b>coffee</b> hull (<b>parchment)</b> and <b>coffee</b> pulp. For green and buoy coffee, the residue produced is known as “green coffee husk” and “buoy coffee husk,” respectively. When a combination of cherry, buoy, and green coffee fruits are processed by the “dry” method, the residue is known as “common” coffee husk (Matiello 1991; Bartholo et al. 1989).|$|R

40|$|Mandheling coffee {{has been}} a well known {{specialty}} coffees for decades {{and the demand for}} this coffee is currently increasing. This coffee is characterised by low acidity, heavy-complex body, spicy-little earthy and fruity flavor. Mandheling coffee is produced by smallholder farmers in the highland surrounding Lake TobaNorth Sumatra in an unique way i. e. following de-pulping and 1 – 2 days sundrying, wet parchment is stored for varying periods up to a few weeks, the parchments are then de-hulled when still wet (40 – 45 % moisture content) then the beans sundried. The handling procedure presumably contributes to the unique cup character of Mandheling coffee. On the other hand the storage of wet pachments may cause mould growth and mycotoxin contamination. This trial was designed to study the influence of storage of wet parchments prior to wet hulling on mould development, OTA contamination and cup Mandheling characteristic of the coffee product. The normal wet process, drying of parchment thoroughly to 12 % moisture content was used as the control. <b>Parchment</b> <b>coffees</b> (6 lots) used for this trial were drawn from farmers and collectors in the region. The wet parchments (41. 74 – 53. 96 % moisture content) were stored for 1 (D 1), 7 (D 7) and 14 (D 14) days in PE sacks in a warehouse in the region. During the storage period, when there was visible mould growth, the parchments were spread on a plastic sheet inside the warehouse, as per common practice to suppress the mould growth. Following storage, the wet parchment was de-hulled and then sun-dried to a moisture content of 12 % (MC 12 %) or dried to a moisture content of 17 %, and held in storage for 3 weeks prior to final drying to 12 % mc. The ‘normal wet process’ i. e. fresh-non stored parchments dried thoroughly to 12 %, were used as the control. Parameters measured were visual evaluation, mould infestation, a w, moisture content (MC) on the stored parchment; while for dried beans mould infestation, OTA content and the Mandheling cup character evaluation (done by 4 panelists who were familiar to the coffee) were determined. Some mould species grew during the storage course, with black Aspergillus was the dominant species found in the beans, while A. ochraceusan OTA producer, was found in some samples with low infection rate (0 – 15. 3 %). Spreading of coffee inside the warehouse during the day could suppress moulds growth. OTA was found in only 5 samples out of 42 samples with range of 0. 17 – 2. 24 ppb, very less than European Union limit. There was no clear trend of storage period on the mould infection rates, OTA content, and the Mandheling cup characters. The high variability of the outcome was likely due to the inhomogenity of parchments used for this trial. The best Mandheling was found in the sample of D 1 -MC 12 %-coffee source of lot 1.

This research aimed to analyze different residues from plant biomass, characterizing them as potential sources for energy production. For the accomplishment of this study, the following residues were used: wood processing residue (sawdust and planer shavings); <b>coffee</b> bean <b>parchment</b> and <b>coffee</b> plant stem; bean stem and pod; soybean stem and pod; rice husk; corn leaf, stem, straw and cob; and sugar cane straw and bagasse. For residue characterization the following analyses were done: chemical analysis, immediate chemical analysis, calorifi c value and elemental analysis. All procedures were conducted at the Laboratory of Forest Biomass Energy of the Federal University of Lavras. In general, all residues showed potential for energetic use. Rice husk was found to have higher lignin content, which is an interesting attribute as far as energy production is concerned. Its high ash content, however, led to a reduction in calorifi c value and fi xed carbon. The remaining residues were found to have similar energetic characteristics, with corn cob showing greater calorifi c value, followed by coffee plant stem, both also containing higher levels of carbon and fi xed carbon.

40|$|Low {{prices in}} the {{international}} coffee markets have worsened the economic well-being among coffee farmers. In {{the face of this}} situation, the Government of Rwanda has introduced coffee sector reforms that aimed to transform the sector in a way that targets the high quality market and moves away from the bulk coffee market. The high quality coffee market has shown consistent growth over time and exhibits price premiums in international market. If these high prices are passed on to farmers who take advantage of the benefits of the new high quality market by selling coffee cherries, access to this new market could help alleviate poverty brought on by low {{prices in the}} conventional sector. However, the majority of coffee farmers in Rwanda rely on the conventional market by selling <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee.</b> The present study analyzes the effects of coffee sector reforms in terms of household expenditures, a proxy of income, on farmers selling coffee to two supply chains: <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> channel and coffee cherry channel. Results from the random effects model on the two year panel data indicate that farmers benefited from coffee reforms by increasing their consumption over time.

First, do small holders in the FT chains receive higher returns than the smallholders {{in the conventional}} chains? Secondly, if smallholders in the FT coffee chains receive higher returns from their coffee than the smallholders in the conventional chains, what are the sources of these higher returns? Finally, if smallholders in the FT chains don't receive higher returns than in the conventional chains, what are the constraints to smallholders receiving higher returns from the FT coffee chains than the conventional chains? A conceptual framework for agribusiness supply chain was developed {{that was used to}} guide the field work. A comparative case study methodology was selcted as an appropriate method for eliciting the required information. Four case study chains were selected. A paired FT and conventional coffee chains from Okapa and another paired FT and conventional chains from Kainantu districts, Eastern Highlands Province were selected for the study. The research found that smallholders in the FT chains and vonventional chains receive very similar prices for their <b>coffee</b> (<b>parchment</b> price equivalent). Hence, {{there was no evidence that}} smallholders in the FT chains received higher prices or returns from their coffee production than smallholders in conventional chains. This study also found that there was no evidence of FLO certification improving returns to smallholders in the FT chains over those returns received in the conventional chains, but the community that the FT smallholder producers come from did benefit. The sources of these community benefits lies in the shorter FT chains and the distributions of the margin that would have been otherwise made by processors to producers, exporters and the community. In addition, this study found that constraints associated with value creation are similar in all the four chains studies. However, there are some added hurdles for the FT chains in adhering to FT and organic coffee standards. Moreover, FT co-oeratives lacked capacity to trade and their only functions were to help with FLO certification and distribute the FT premium to the community. The findings of this research support some aspects of the literature, but not others. The research contribution is the finding that in this period of high conventional coffee prices, returns to smallholders from FT chains were no bettter than the returns gained in conventional chains, which leads to oppotunism and lack of loyalty by smallholders in the FT chains. The other contribution of this research is in identifying a particular type of free rider who is not a member of the FT co-operative but has right to the community benefits generated by the FT chain...|$|R

As análises físicas, químicas e sensoriais realizadas nos grãos de café demostraram que a maioria dos cafés descascados apresenta teor de água abaixo do valor recomendado; os valores médios de acidez titulável total e açúcares totais em todas as amostras analisadas encontram-se dentro dos valores característicos de bebidas finas; os cafés sem a presença dos defeitos, produzidos na faixa de altitude de 920 a 1120 metros, apresentam corpo e acidez mais fracos e doçura mais alta do que os produzidos na faixa de 720 a 920 metros; e que maiores altitudes possibilitam a produção de cafés de melhor qualidade. The <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> {{has been}} conquering {{more and more}} space in the several coffee growing regions. By {{taking into account the}} several questionings upon the quality of the berries resulting from this sort of processing, the few studies on the subject and the contradictions observed in the results obtained up to now, the present study aimed to characterize the quality of the <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> produced in the Southern region of Minas Gerais state as well as to assess the influence of the altitude on the quality of these coffees by means of physical, chemical and sensorial analyses of the samples in their original state and after removal of defective beans. Crops of coffee enterprises situated in ranges of altitude varying from 720 to 920 meters and from 920 to 1120 meters were randomly selected. The coffee samples of the 2001 / 2202 crop were duly collected on 32 farms distributed in 10 towns. At the "Polo de Tecnologia em Qualidade do Café" of the "Universidade Federal de Lavras" (UFLA), the following analyses were performed: water content, total titrable acidity, total sugars and sensorial analyses. The physical, chemical and sensorial analyses accomplished on coffee beans showed that: most parchment coffees present water content bellow the value recommended; the average values of total titrable acidity and total sugars in all the samples analyzed lie within the values characteristic of fine beverages; hard beverage occurs in 75 % of the <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> samples with the presence of the defects; the coffees without the presence of the defects produced in the range of altitude of 920 to 1120 meters present body and acidity weaker and sweetness higher than the ones produced in the range of 720 to 920 meters; higher altitudes enable the production of better quality coffees...|$|E
40|$|Hawaii is {{the only}} state in the USA that grows, processes, and roasts coffee. Coffee {{processing}}, however, poses some challenges. One is the processing water, which must be treated, and should be re-used. We surveyed and collected several coffee processing water samples, both influent and effluent, from four small-scale (2 - 5 ha) coffee farms in Kona on Hawaii (Big Island), and from a large (1200 ha) coffee farm on Kauai. The samples were kept refrigerated during transport and storage. Subsamples were filtered and analyzed for biological oxygen demand (BOD), pH, and plant nutrient content. Aeration and lime (CaCO 3) were applied in an attempt to lower BOD and phosphorus (P). Our findings showed that the Kauai coffee effluent and its reuse (irrigation) is more environmentally friendly in terms of BOD and plant nutrients than those in Kona. This is perhaps because the Kauai processing uses the hydropulping technique, which does not involve fermentation. Farms in Kona use the wet fermentation technique to remove the mucilage from the <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee.</b> Aeration for 7 days with 1 % lime helped reduced BOD to about 300 mg L- 1 and P by several fold...|$|E
40|$|Pulping is one {{important}} step in wet coffee processing method. Pulping process usually uses a machine which constructed by wood or metal materials. A horizontal single cylinder type of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine {{is the most popular}} machine in coffee processing. One of the weaknesses of a horizontal single cylinder type of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine is higher in broken beans. Broken bean is one of mayor aspects in defect system that contribute to low quality. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed and tested a horizontal double cylinder type of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine which resulted in 12. 6 — 21. 4 % of broken beans. To reduce percentage of broken beans, Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has developed and tested a horizontal triple cylinder type of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine. Material tested was fresh mature Robusta coffee cherries, 60 — 65 % (wet basis) moisture content; has classified on 3 levels i. e. unsorted, small and medium, and clean from metal and foreign materials. The result showed that the machine produced 6, 340 kg/h in optimal capacity for operational conditions, 1400 rpm rotor rotation speed for unsorted coffee cherries with composition 55. 5 % whole <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee,</b> 3. 66 % broken beans, and 1 % beans in wet skin.

40|$|Reported yields in most coffee farms of the Barahona {{province}} in the Dominican Republic are relatively low (< 290 kg ha- 1 <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee).</b> In general, coffee producers {{do not use}} diagnostic techniques such as soil testing. This fact prevents them from identifying the limiting factors (especially nutrients), complicates the work of coffee cultural management practices, and potentially reduces productivity and coffee quality. This {{study was designed to}} diagnose the fertility level of soils in coffee farms in the area of Barahona in 96 farms within an area of 637 hectares and design a nutrient management strategy. Soils from each farm were sampled and analyzed for soil fertility parameters. A survey was provided to farmers that permitted the collection of information regarding yields, management practices, and landscape features. Soils in the area were predominantly clayey. Soil pH varied between 4. 61 and 7. 69 and soil organic matter ranged between 3. 29 and 10. 9 %. Exchangeable potassium levels were classified as deficient in all areas. The clustering of results identified two main components, which accounted for 76 % of the variability of the data and the grouping into five communities by similarity of features. The results show that soil testing of this coffee coffee-growing region {{can be used as a}} tool to diagnose the soil fertility status and guide them in implementing management and fertilization recommendations...|$|E

The {{following}} thesis meticulously {{explains what}} the steps are for measuring product level. This {{is through the}} speed of light in a silo that contains dry <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> during days, weeks or months. The best form to embrace the majority of points and to get precision was analyzed through three fundamental pieces of equipment: the first one was a level measurement, the second one was a device that ejects bidirectional movement and the third one was a controller. The aim of this study and the general objective of this project is to obtain the volume of the content and the net weight of the coffee in the silo. The goal of measuring the weight of the coffee is to establish an inventory control in product sales at the Beneficio CoopeVictoria, because {{there is a lack of}} an appropriate inventory performance. Consequently, this leads to bad organization of assets, generating discontent with customers, the imbalance of the relationship between farmers and the Beneficio, and additionally, a deficit in business economics. Taking as a starting point the above stated problems, a solution was developed which presented to the managers of CoopeVictoria, a viable and robust way that allows them to have control of the quantity of product in the silo by means of an electronic control system.

40|$|International audienceCoffee {{production}} is impacting the climate by emitting greenhouse gasses. Coffee {{production is}} also vulnerable to climate change. As a consequence, the coffee sector {{is interested in}} climate-friendly forms of coffee production, {{but there is no}} consensus of what exactly this implies. Therefore, we studied two aspects of the climate impact of coffee production: the standing carbon stocks in the production systems and the product carbon footprint, which measures the greenhouse gas emissions per unit weight of coffee produced. We collected data from 116 coffee farms in five Latin American countries, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Colombia, for four coffee production systems: (1) traditional polycultures, (2) commercial polycultures, (3) shaded monocultures, and (4) unshaded monocultures. We found that polycultures have a lower mean carbon footprint, of 6. 2 – 7. 3  kg CO 2 -equivalent kg− 1 of <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee,</b> than monocultures, of 9. 0 – 10. 8  kg. We also found that traditional polycultures have much higher carbon stocks in the vegetation, of 42. 5  Mg per ha, than unshaded monocultures, of 10. 5  Mg. We designed a graphic system to classify production systems according to their climate friendliness. We identified several strategies to increase positive and reduce negative climate impacts of coffee production. Strategies include diversification of coffee farms with trees, the use of their wood to substitute for fossil fuel and energy-intensive building materials, the targeted use of fertilizer, and the use of dry or ecological processing methods for coffee instead of the traditional fully washed process...|$|E
40|$|A dryer in {{deep bed}} without airflow {{reversal}} was adapted to work simultaneously with thermal intermittence and pulsed airflow in the drying of <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> bean. The dryer was operated by cycles of thermal intermittence for a heating temperature of 55 °C and cooling of 40 and 25 °C. The {{results showed that}} the increase of temperature in the cycle of cooling tends to increase the water removal and that the increase of the number of air pulses without reversal of the direction of air flow causes an excessive moisture gradient within the batch. Moreover, the specific energy requirement of the dryer was from 15 to 25 MJ/kg, showing the best thermal performance for the condition in which the dryer was operate without pulsed airflow. Un secador de lecho fijo fue adaptado para trabajar de forma simultánea con intermitencia térmica y flujo de aire pulsado sin inversión de flujo de aire, en el secado de granos de café. El secador fue operado con ciclos de intermitencia térmica para una temperatura de calentamiento de 55 °C y enfriamiento de 40 y 25 °C. Los resultados mostraron que el aumento de temperatura en el ciclo de enfriamiento, tiende a incrementar la remoción de agua y que el aumento del número de pulsos de aire sin inversión del flujo de dirección del aire, ocasiona un secado deficiente debido al excesivo gradiente de humedad ocasionado en la capa de producto. Adicionalmente, se encontró que el consumo de energía específica del secador varió entre 15 y 25 MJ/kg de agua evaporada, siendo el mejor rendimiento termo energético para la condición en la cual el secador fue operado sin flujo de aire pulsado...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} work, as an {{extension}} to SAFERNAC model, was to establish economically optimum combinations of N, P and K application to Arabica coffee in the Northern coffee zone of Tanzania. The {{study was conducted in}} Hai and Lushoto districts between 2010 and 2012. Prices of nutrient inputs and those of <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> were introduced into the original SAFERNAC model, which was used to obtain yields from a soil of known properties receiving different levels of input N, P and K from both organic and inorganic sources (ISFM). The costs of these were derived from experience in Northern Tanzania, while coffee prices were estimated to range between 1250 and 2500 TZS kg- 1. The result was economically optimum N:P:K ratios that give highest net returns and value : cost ratios in situations of low, medium and high soil fertility. It was also shown that farmers’ decision to deviate from the optimum and the allowable level of such deviation, depend much upon the prices of nutrient inputs in equivalent terms. In the medium-fertility situation (which applies in the study districts), the highest yield increment was noted with the maximum amount of N and P. The optimum application rate was 310 kg N and 200 kg P per ha, where the profit margin (the gap between gross returns and costs) is highest. This is an indication that soil-available K is likely to suffice the needs of the crop for optimum productivity, but this is largely dependent on the K fluxes in different soil types. The optimum rates were tested with actual soil data in the two study districts, against 5 tons of farmyard manure and a combination of the two. At both the coffee prices of 1250 and 2500 TZS kg- 1, ISFM intervention (combination of organic and inorganic inputs) was more profitable than the other options, while coffee production showed to be more profitable in Hai than Lushoto...|$|E
40|$|Coffee is {{considered}} the primary host of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). The infestation of C. capitata in the State of São Paulo has reached economic importance in coffee plantations. Although little information about changes caused by the fly on the coffee beverage, {{it is known that}} the fruit fly infestation causes rapid change from "cherry" to "raisin" stage, causing qualitative damage on the <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> production. The objective of this work was to study the population dynamics and diversity of Tephritidae and Lonchaeidae in coffee cultivars of Icatu Vermelho IAC 4045, Vermelho IAC 99, Novo Mundo 388 - 17 - 1, Obatã IAC 1669 - 20, Icatu Amarelo IAC 2944, grafted on Apoatã (IAC 2258) (Coffea canephora) and Icatu Vermelho IAC 4045 ungrafted and Apoatã (IAC 2258) -grafted with approximately 3 years. The experiment was conducted in Presidente Prudente, São Paulo State, Brazil, from June 2006 to July 2008. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications in a factorial design (3 years X 6 cultivars). From each plot of 100 plants we randomly collected 250 mature fruits. The samples were taken at 15 day intervals. The population dynamics were evaluated by using one plastic McPhail trap per cultivar. After 26 months a total of 36, 932 specimens of C. capitata were trapped in all cultivars, corresponding to 49. 27 % males and 50. 73 % females. Approximately 83. 3 % of the specimens were collected from January to December 2007. The population fluctuation showed population peaks in May, June and July, relative to fruit ripening period. We trapped 21 specimens of A. montei Lima and A. fraterculus (Wied.). The coffee fruits of Presidente Prudente, SP, are infested by the following species of Lonchaeidae: Neosilba pendula (Bezzi), N. zadolicha McAlpine & Steyskal, N. inesperata Strikis & Prado and Neosilba pradoi Strikis & Lerena. Neosilba pendula occurred in all evaluated cultivars and N. inesperata was recoverd only from Icatu Amarelo IAC 2944 and IAC Icatu Vermelho 4045 /un-grafted.

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of intermittent drying {{on the quality of}} the coffee, after twelve months of storage. The <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> was submitted to two days of pre-drying on the ground, and soon afterwards, mechanically dried until reaching a moisture of 16 %, 20 % and 24 % (wb); later, the coffee remained under tempering for two, six and twelve days in wooden boxes. After each tempering period, the drying was completed until the coffee reached a moisture of 11 % (wb). The control consisted of continuous drying up to 11 % (wb). After the drying until an 11 % (wb) moisture, the coffee was stored for twelve months. After that period electric conductivity, potassium leaching, total reducing and non-reducing sugars, total titratable acidity analyses and sensorial analysis of the coffee were conducted. The values of electric conductivity indicated that the coffees submitted to two and six days of tempering until the restart of the drying, independent of the moisture when the drying was interrupted, presented lower degradation levels of the cellular membrane system, when compared with the coffees submitted to the continuous and intermittent drying, with twelve days of tempering until the resumption of drying. It was verified that, for the other analysis there was no significant difference among the treatments. Objetivou-se, no presente trabalho, avaliar os efeitos do parcelamento da secagem na qualidade do café, após doze meses de armazenamento. O café cereja desmucilado foi submetido a dois dias de pré-secagem em terreiro, e em seguida, secado mecanicamente até atingir os teores de água de 16 %, 20 % e 24 % (bu); posteriormente, o café permaneceu em repouso durante dois, seis e doze dias em caixas de madeira e após cada período de repouso, secado até o teor de água de 11 % (bu). A testemunha constituiu-se na secagem contínua até 11 % (bu). Após a secagem completa o café foi armazenado por doze meses; e então submetido às análises de condutividade elétrica, lixiviação de potássio, açúcares totais, redutores e não redutores, acidez titulável total e análise sensorial. Os valores de condutividade elétrica indicaram que os cafés submetidos a dois e seis dias de repouso até o reinício da secagem, independente do teor de água quando a secagem foi interrompida, apresentaram menores níveis de degradação ao sistema de membranas celulares, quando comparados com os cafés submetidos à secagem contínua e ao parcelamento da secagem, com doze dias de repouso até a retomada da secagem.

40|$|New {{forms of}} {{packaging}} are studied {{to increase the}} storage time of the coffee beans without loss of quality occurs. The objective was to assess, chemical, enzymatic, physical and sensory quality of coffee beans (Coffea arabica L.) undergoing different types of packaging (silo-bag and jute bag) and processing (coconut and parchment) two different storage environments (higrotémico under normal and stress). The coffee beans were stored in adverse conditions of relative humidity of 80 % and alternating temperature (30 oC to 25 oC for 16 hours and 8 hours) for 150 days. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial triple + 2 (two packs, two runs and two controls to each processing) with three replications. The study was conducted at the Department of Rural Engineering, Universidade Estadual Paulista, School of Agronomic Sciences, Botucatu. To assess the quality sensory analyzes, water content, fat acidity, electrical conductivity, color assessment, total sugars, density and polyphenol oxidase enzyme activity were made. After data acquisition, they were subjected to analysis of variance and means were compared by Tukey test at 5 % probability. It can be concluded that the silo-bag in modified atmosphere, after five months of storage, managed to avoid rewetting of grain and possible minor loss of quality of the beverage in relation to jute bag for both the <b>parchment</b> <b>coffee</b> as for coffee coconut, but favored the bleaching process of the grains in all storage environments. The analysis of free fatty acids, conductivity and PPO enzyme activity corroborated the results of sensory analysis, indicating the best protection offered by the silo-bag, after five months of storage at ambient conditions with stress. Novas formas de acondicionamento são estudadas a fim de aumentar o tempo de armazenamento dos grãos de café sem ocorrer perda da qualidade.
