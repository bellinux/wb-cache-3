25|$|Unlike the {{denominations}} of Rabbinical Judaism, Karaite Judaism {{maintains that}} {{it is the responsibility of}} each Jew to study the Tanakh for themselves. The Talmud and Oral Law are not considered canonical, and rabbinical opinions are not considered authoritative either, but every interpretation is held up to the same scrutiny, regardless of its source. Karaite Judaism relies on the Tanakh to indicate that Jewishness is passed down through the paternal line, not the maternal line as is maintained by Orthodox Judaism (though a minority hold that both <b>parents</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be Jewish). Karaite Jews are eligible for Aliyah under the Law of Return. The eligibility of converts to Judaism through the Karaite movement to make Aliyah under the Law of Return has not yet been addressed in Israeli courts.|$|E
25|$|By law, {{children}} born as Hungarian citizens may bear {{no more than}} two surnames (most people have only one; those who have two may hyphenate them). They can also have only one or two given names (religious names not included since they are not official, see above). Given names can be chosen by the parents from an official list of several thousand names (technically, one list for each gender). If the intended name is not on the list, the <b>parents</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> apply for approval. Applications are considered by the Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences following a set of principles. Thus, names are approved if they are not derogatory or overly diminutive, can be written and pronounced easily, can be recognised as either male or female, etc. Approved names expand the official list, the newest edition of which is regularly published. A lot of recent additions are foreign names, which, however, must be spelled following Hungarian phonetics, e.g. Jennifer becomes Dzsenifer or Joe becomes Dzsó.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are four}} {{recessive}} defects {{that can affect}} calves worldwide. A recessive defect occurs when both parents carry a recessive gene that will affect the calf. One in four calves will show the defect even when both parents carry the defective gene. The four recessive defects in the Black Angus breed that are currently managed with DNA tests are arthrogryposis multiplex (AM), referred to as curly calf, which lowers the mobility of joints; neuropathic hydrocephalus (NH), sometimes known as water head, which causes an enlarged malformed skull; contractural arachnodactyly (CA), formerly referred to {{by the name of}} [...] "fawn calf syndrome", which reduces mobility in the hips; and dwarfism, which affects the size of calves. Both <b>parents</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> carry the genes for a calf to be affected with one of these disorders.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996, Marshall University {{sociology}} professor Dr. William Westbrook was {{having a conversation with}} a recent Master's graduate. [...] The graduate inquired about Marshall's traditional admissions policy, which had a lower SAT/ACT apparent requirement than his undergraduate school, Shepherd University, with a [...] "selective" [...] admissions policy and higher SAT/ACT apparent requirement. The graduate made an incorrect inference from the averages and thought Shepherd was arbitrarily turning new students away below a higher fixed ACT or SAT score. Dr. Westbrook clarified the situation first by explaining that every university or college is going to meet its enrollment quota with the best students available, and asked where both Marshall University and Shepherd University got their students. Marshall typically recruited from Cabell, Logan, Wayne, and Putnam Counties, WV, and Lawrence County, OH. Shepherd typically recruited both from West Virginia, both locally in the Eastern Panhandle and in the interior of and elsewhere in the state, and from the comparatively wealthy Maryland and Virginia suburbs surrounding Washington D.C. Dr. Westbrook made the point that SAT and ACT scores are an indirect measure of socioeconomic status. [...] County kindergarten to twelfth-grade school boards are funded by property taxes assessed on home values. [...] At nearly the end of grade school, a college-bound student takes the SAT or ACT. The difference between Shepherd University and Marshall University is that Shepherd recruited more from areas whose home values were higher, whose homeowners paid more in property taxes, whose school systems were better funded, and whose students benefitted as a result, took the SAT or ACT, some of whom applied to Shepherd University and were accepted, and attended. Colleges and universities, then, have less control over setting their ACT and SAT requirements than the graduate assumed and than most parents might imagine. [...] <b>Parents</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> understand that large scale political and economic forces such as the level of Federal employment and commensurate income around Washington, or other regional differences in living standards, have more to do setting ACT and SAT requirements than the decisions of college committees trying to enroll the best students they can under the circumstances over which they have no control.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} how adolescents compare monitoring efforts {{by their parents}} to those of a "good parent" standard and assessed {{the impact of these}} comparisons on adolescent self-disclosure and risk behavior and their perceptions of their parents' monitoring knowledge. Survey responses from 519 adolescents (12 - 17 years) at baseline of a larger, longitudinal study examining parental monitoring and adolescent risk were examined. Adolescents' "good parent comparisons" differed greatly by monitoring areas (e. g., telephone use, health, money); however, between 5. 5 % and 25. 8 % of adolescents believed their <b>parents</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> monitor their activities more than they currently were monitoring. Alternatively, between 8. 5 % and 23. 8 % of adolescents believed their <b>parents</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> monitor their activities less often. These perceptions significantly distinguished adolescents in terms of their level of disclosure, perceived monitoring knowledge, and risk involvement. Adolescents who viewed their <b>parents</b> as <b>needing</b> <b>to</b> monitor more were less likely to disclose information to their parents (p<. 001), less likely to perceive their parents as having greater monitoring knowledge (p<. 001), and more likely to be involved in a risk behaviors (p<. 001) than adolescents who perceived their <b>parents</b> <b>needed</b> no change. Adolescent disclosure to a parent is a powerful predictor of adolescent risk and poor health outcomes. These findings demonstrate that adolescents' comparisons of their parents' monitoring efforts can predict differences in adolescent disclosure and future risk. Obtaining adolescent "good parent" comparisons may successfully identify intervention opportunities with the adolescent and parent by noting the areas of need and direction of monitoring improvement...|$|R

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{explosion}} {{of interest in}} mindfulness has come {{an interest in the}} application of mindfulness to parenting. The current literature, reviewed in detail in this chapter, indicates that mindfulness is highly relevant to parents and that mindfulness-based interventions may improve antenatal and postnatal outcomes, decrease parental stress, improve parental well-being and foster better parent–child interactions to the benefit of both parents and children. Mindful <b>parenting</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be linked, at a theoretical level, to basic science and to wider theoretical frames and concepts. Within this chapter the links between mindful parenting, parental responsiveness and attachment theory as well as the links between mindful parenting, psychological flexibility and relational frame theory are explored. Mindful parenting offers us the opportunity to better understand the practice of relational or interpersonal mindfulness, as well as the practice of mindfulness within a diversity of embodied experiences, such as the interconnected embodiment of pregnancy. A rich diversity of mindful parenting practices, specifically tailored to the transformative possibilities within life as a committed <b>parent,</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be fully developed and tested empirically. Parenting is a near-universal life experience with inbuilt transformative potential. Further, parenting has vast impacts upon the next generation.
