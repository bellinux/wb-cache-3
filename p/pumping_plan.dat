She {{considers}} it being marked by the desert, and sees it as a growing process, or a transformation, similar to ancient cultures participating in scarification rituals to denote change. Perhaps this could be a point in Terry’s life where things begin to change for her. Alas, we soon hear that her grandmother, Mimi, has been diagnosed with cancer by the same Dr. Smith in the same hospital. Mimi takes the stance that she won’t fight the cancer, having learned from Diane, she will just go with it. Meanwhile, the Utah government is busy doing the opposite: instead of letting the Great Salt Lake rise on its own, they have “succeeded” in harnessing the lake through an intricate <b>pumping</b> <b>plan</b> costing a billion dollars. Visiting Oregon, Terry comes upon many of the birds that were displaced by the projects around the Great Salt Lake. Wetlands like the one in Oregon are refuges for these birds, just like the Great Salt Lake and her mother had been Terry’s refuges.|$|E

It needs around 15. 000 liter each day for the need of its staffs and its students which is totally around I 500 person. The water which is used is taken from the well, and it is circulated by using water pumps. In politeknik Pratama Mulia Surakarta, Water Pump installation is installated in a series by using -I pumps. Actually this system is not effective, and the pumps often get trouble because the pumps should operate continually. The other disadvantages of this system are that the electric change is higher, the automatic system of the pumps are worn out fast, the maintenance cost increases. For that reason, ft must be created on electric pump installation which is efficient and reliable, i. I : <b>pumping</b> <b>plan</b> by using a pump and a reservoir. The advantages of this system are that the pump only operates in a certain time when {{the water in the}} reservoir is up, electric change is lower, maintenance cost is lower, and the pump is double.

40|$|At Kuwana {{illegal dumping}} site in Japan, where {{hazardous}} waste was illegally dumped, groundwater was severely contaminated by Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Groundwater was already remedied by conducting Pump-and-Treat (P&T) after containment {{of all the}} waste by vertical slurry walls from 2002 to 2007. However, 1, 4 -dioxane was detected in both waste and groundwater outside of slurry walls after it was newly added into Japan environmental standards in late 2009, which suggested that the walls did not contain 1, 4 -dioxane completely. Our previous study developed a model to predict the 1, 4 -dioxane distribution in groundwater after the previous remediation at the site. In this study, numerical simulation was applied for remediation planning at the site based {{on the concept of}} Verified Follow Up (VF-UP) that had been proposed as a new approach to complete remediation effectively with consideration of future risks. The amount of waste to be removed and <b>pumping</b> <b>plans</b> were discussed by numerical simulation to achieve the remedial objective in which 1, 4 -dioxane in groundwater outside of walls is remedied within 10 years and 1, 4 -dioxane spreading throughout the walls is prevented in the case where a portion of waste is remained. Firstly, the amount of waste to be removed considering <b>pumping</b> <b>plans</b> for P&T was determined by scenario analysis. As a result, at least two-third of waste should be removed by combining with P&T. However, if the waste is remained, future risks of 1, 4 -dioxane spreading through the slurry walls may occur.

40|$|The {{saltwater}} intrusion in a coastal aquifer {{is a highly}} complex and nonlinear process. The management of coastal aquifers requires careful planning of withdrawal strategies for control and remediation of {{saltwater intrusion}}.

Groundwater <b>pumping</b> is <b>planned</b> by the Southern Nevada Water Authority from valleys adjacent to Great Basin National Park (GRBA). This pumping could reduce or eliminate stream flows in areas susceptible to groundwater withdrawal. I sampled small mammal communities near two susceptible streams and contrasted these with a non-susceptible community. Susceptible small mammal communities were distinct from non-susceptible communities in evenness, similarity indices, and species composition. Small mammal diversity in susceptible areas is a unique park resource maintained by the contrast between xeric uplands and mesic riparian habitats. Increases in xeric adapted small mammals and decreases in riparian dependent species may indicate changes in community structure due to groundwater withdrawal. These results suggest that groundwater pumping may reduce small mammal diversity in park ecosystems through changes in riparian areas...|$|R
