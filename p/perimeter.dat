5|$|By this time, the US 2nd Infantry Division {{suffered}} 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 {{captured and}} 69 missing during its time at Pusan <b>Perimeter.</b> This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but {{able to prevent}} the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan <b>Perimeter.</b> The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan <b>Perimeter,</b> most of which probably occurred at Yongsan.|$|E
5|$|IX Corps {{arrived at}} the Pusan <b>Perimeter</b> in Korea on 22 September 1950, and became {{operational}} {{the next day when}} it took command of the 2nd Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Division. It took charge of the western flank of the <b>perimeter,</b> defending the Naktong River area against attacking North Korean units.|$|E

30|$|<b>Perimeters</b> in {{fire atlas}} data simplify reality. Unfortunately, {{unburned}} islands within fire <b>perimeters</b> are not mapped (Kolden and Weisberg 2007), and atlases {{like the one}} from the northern Rockies contain fire <b>perimeters,</b> but not burn severity. Because atlas <b>perimeters</b> do not discern unburned islands, they likely overestimate the area burned by any single fire, although {{the degree to which}} this is true is generally unknown (Kolden et al. 2012). The <b>perimeters</b> are approximate and ground truthing is necessary before relying on them for many applications. Accuracy of most <b>perimeters</b> is unknown and likely varies through time and among management units. For example, Shapiro-Miller et al. (2007) found that the fire <b>perimeters</b> in the northern Rockies fire atlas agreed with fire scar records, and Farris et al. (2010) similarly found that fire atlas and fire scar records were in strong agreement. Yet Kolden and Weisberg (2007) found poor agreement between manually mapped fire <b>perimeters</b> (created through a number of different undocumented methods) and Landsat-derived <b>perimeters,</b> especially in areas of complex topography. Fire atlas data should be regarded with healthy skepticism and supplemented with other sources of information whenever possible.|$|R
30|$|The {{method of}} {{recording}} fire <b>perimeters</b> also changed during {{the twentieth century}} and could have influenced records of pyrogeography. Early fire atlas records were derived from hand-drawn maps of fire <b>perimeters</b> and fire incident reports, whereas recent <b>perimeters</b> are derived from field mapping with GPS receivers, remote sensing, or, during some large fires, infrared mapping.|$|R
5|$|The Inchon {{landings}} were {{a crushing}} blow for the North Korean Army, catching it completely unprepared and breaking the already weak forces along the <b>perimeter.</b> With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the North Koreans {{were at a}} severe disadvantage and {{were not able to}} continue to pressure on the Pusan <b>Perimeter</b> while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the North Koreans were in full retreat from the Pusan <b>Perimeter,</b> with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E
5|$|The Marines ashore on Guadalcanal {{initially}} {{concentrated on}} forming a defense <b>perimeter</b> around the airfield, moving the landed supplies within the <b>perimeter,</b> and finishing the airfield. Vandegrift placed his 11,000 troops on Guadalcanal {{in a loose}} <b>perimeter</b> around the Lunga Point area. In four days of intense effort, the supplies were moved from the landing beach into dispersed dumps within the <b>perimeter.</b> Work began on the airfield immediately, mainly using captured Japanese equipment. On August 12, the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major Lofton Henderson, a Marine aviator {{who had been killed}} at the Battle of Midway. Captured Japanese stock increased the total supply of food to 14 days worth. To conserve the limited food supplies, the Allied troops were limited to two meals per day.|$|E
5|$|The UN {{units were}} able to defeat and repel the North Koreans repeatedly, {{including}} through a coordinated offensive across the entire <b>perimeter.</b> In delaying and pushing back the North Koreans, the 25th Infantry Division {{was able to buy}} time for UN forces to counterattack at Inchon, effectively defeating the North Korean Army at the Pusan <b>Perimeter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Karl Haller, of FOGRA in Munich, {{proposed}} a different model, {{one in which}} dots with larger <b>perimeters</b> tended to exhibit greater dot gain than those with smaller <b>perimeters.</b>|$|R
30|$|Inconsistent {{methods of}} mapping fire <b>perimeters</b> in the {{northern}} Rockies fire atlas are another source of uncertainty. Prior to the mid 1930 s, fires in the atlas were primarily mapped from stand ages interpreted from aerial photographs (J.H. Logsdon, USDA Forest Service Idaho Panhandle National Forests, personal communication; Rollins et al. 2001), but fire reports and maps, newspaper accounts, journals, and interviews were also used (Gibson 2006). Mapping has improved through the century and <b>perimeters</b> are now often interpreted from satellite imagery. However, even today, mapping methods vary widely and range from satellite-derived data and airborne imagery (including infrared mapping of <b>perimeters</b> of actively burning fires) to hand-drawn <b>perimeters.</b> Depending on the method and the person employing it, simple or complex <b>perimeters</b> could result. We did not find a systematic bias {{in the northern}} Rockies atlas in shape complexity of the fire polygons through time. Other atlases may differ in this respect; this could be revealed with simple analyses of the complexity in mapped fire <b>perimeters.</b>|$|R
50|$|He also {{provided}} the bounds 3 + 10/71 < Ï€ < 3 + 10/70, (giving {{a range of}} 1/497) by comparing the <b>perimeters</b> of the circle with the <b>perimeters</b> of the inscribed and circumscribed 96-sided regular polygons.|$|R
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Inchon landings were {{a crushing}} blow for the North Korean army, catching them completely unprepared and breaking the already-weak forces along the <b>perimeter.</b> With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the North Koreans {{were at a}} severe disadvantage {{and would not be}} able to continue pressure on the Pusan <b>Perimeter</b> while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the North Koreans were in full retreat from Pusan <b>Perimeter,</b> with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga <b>Perimeter,</b> engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga <b>Perimeter</b> from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they could}} not hold the city, the 24th Infantry Division {{achieved}} a strategic victory by delaying the North Koreans, providing time for other American divisions to establish a defensive <b>perimeter</b> around Pusan further south. The delay imposed at Taejon probably prevented an American rout during the subsequent Battle of Pusan <b>Perimeter.</b> During the action, the KPA captured Major General William F. Dean, {{the commander of the}} 24th Infantry Division, and highest ranking American prisoner during the Korean War.|$|E
30|$|The {{quality of}} incident-derived fire <b>perimeters</b> is variable, {{depending}} on methods and source data, {{but they may}} serve as starting points for post-fire assessment. Aside from general precision, several situations influence whether incident <b>perimeters</b> delineate the actual extent of burning. First, <b>perimeters</b> may outline the containment area out to defensible fire lines, while fire may not have actually reached some of those lines. Second, <b>perimeters</b> may be intentionally generalized and not closely follow very convoluted or complex fire boundaries. This may be done to better represent the area actually managed, or to legitimately justify management costs. Third, incident <b>perimeters</b> are only current {{up to the last}} observation, or until the incident teams demobilize, which can be before the actual end of burning, especially in remote areas or where societal values are no longer threatened. Finally, incident <b>perimeters</b> may be extended to include small spot smokes, e.g. from one log, that represented a potential fire hazard at the time, but never developed into a sizeable burn patch detectable at the resolution of post-fire sampling. Outlying spots may be retained for interest in fire behavior, or simply ignored if they are insignificant at the scale of assessment. In any case, adjustments to incident <b>perimeters</b> are usually warranted when the intent is to accurately record the outermost extent of burning using the most up-to-date information.|$|R
40|$|Although {{spatially}} isolating {{genetically modified}} (GM) maize fields from non-GM maize fields is a robust on-farm strategy {{to keep the}} adventitious presence of GM material in the harvests of neighboring non-GM maize fields due to cross-fertilizations below established labeling thresholds (and thus to ensure the spatial co-existence between maize cropping systems), the practical implementation of isolation <b>perimeters</b> attracted little research efforts. In this study, the feasibility of implementing isolation <b>perimeters</b> around GM maize fields is investigated. Using Geographic Information System datasets and Monte Carlo simulations, various scenarios differing in shares and spatial distributions of GM maize were tested for various isolation <b>perimeters</b> in six agricultural areas in Flanders. Factors that affect the feasibility of implementing isolation <b>perimeters</b> are discussed...|$|R

5|$|American {{forces were}} {{repeatedly}} defeated before finally halting the North Korean advance {{in a series}} of engagements in the southern section of the country. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, opening a pass into the Pusan <b>Perimeter.</b> Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju to the west, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the <b>perimeter</b> open for more North Korean attacks. US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force in the west withdrew for several days to reequip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan <b>Perimeter.</b>|$|E

5|$|By this time, the US 1st Cavalry Division {{suffered}} 770 killed, 2,613 wounded, 62 captured {{during its}} time at Pusan <b>Perimeter.</b> This included about 600 casualties, with around 200 {{killed in action}} it had already suffered during the Battle of Taegu the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan <b>Perimeter.</b> The division had numbered 14,703 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties.|$|E
30|$|The {{differences}} observed here {{show that}} fire size information gathered from various {{fire detection systems}} may vary considerably. Selecting the optimal fire size and location information is easier for a single large fire, such as the Tripod Fire Complex, where good field-based observations were available and fire <b>perimeters</b> are maintained within publicly available databases such as GeoMac and MTBS. In the fire community, NIFC fire <b>perimeters</b> are considered the most accurate fire size information available (R. Harrod, personal communication). For smaller fires, precise fire <b>perimeters</b> may not be available.|$|R

50|$|Another factor {{upon which}} dot gain depends is the dot's area fraction. Dots with {{relatively}} large <b>perimeters</b> {{will tend to}} have greater dot gain than dots with smaller <b>perimeters.</b> This makes it useful to have {{a model for the}} amount of dot gain as a function of prepress dot area fraction.|$|R
5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm <b>perimeter,</b> and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm <b>perimeter</b> length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E

A US plane attempted the drop, but the <b>perimeter</b> was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands. The men in the <b>perimeter</b> did, however, recover from a drop made later at 19:00 some supplies and ammunition. Private First Class Joseph R. Ouellette, of H Company, left the <b>perimeter</b> to gather weapons, ammunition, and grenades from the North Korean dead. On several occasions he was attacked, and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Ouellette, who killed the North Korean in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not long}} before the PVA 173rd Regiment {{attacked}} the western and the southern <b>perimeter,</b> while the 172nd Regiment struck the hills on the northern <b>perimeter.</b> Despite the preparations, the understrength garrison was overwhelmed, with the Chinese opening several gaps in the defenses and reaching the rear areas. The resulting chaos, however, caused a breakdown in discipline among the Chinese soldiers, who began looting food and clothing instead of exploiting the situation. The defending Americans managed to destroy the Chinese forces in counterattacks, while a breakdown of communications between the Chinese regiments allowed the gaps to close. When the fighting stopped, the Chinese had only gained the East Hill on the northern <b>perimeter.</b> Another attack was planned for the night of 29 November, but air raids by VMF-542 broke up the Chinese formations before it could be carried out.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{forces had}} four {{possible}} routes in the perimeter: to the south, the {{pass through the}} city of Masan around {{the confluence of the}} Nam and Naktong rivers; another southerly route through the Naktong Bulge and into the railroad lines at Miryang; through the route into Taegu in the north; and through Kyongju in the eastern corridor. North Korea mounted a large offensive in August, simultaneously attacking all four entries into the <b>perimeter.</b> As a result, the Battle of Pusan <b>Perimeter</b> was not one single engagement but a series of large battles fought between the UN and North Korean divisions all along the <b>perimeter.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 23 February, KSCB {{received}} its worst bombardment {{of the entire}} battle. During one eight-hour period the base was rocked by 1,307 North Vietnamese rounds, most of which came from 130mm (used {{for the first time}} on the battlefield) and 152mm artillery pieces located in Laos. Casualties from the bombardment were ten killed and 51 wounded. Two days later US troops detected NVA trenches running due north to within 25 meters of the base <b>perimeter.</b> The majority of these were around the southern and southeastern corners of the <b>perimeter,</b> and formed part of a system that would be developed throughout the end of February and into March until they were ready to be used to launch an attack, providing cover for troops to advance to jumping off points close to the <b>perimeter.</b> These tactics were reminiscent of those employed against the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, particularly in relation to entrenching tactics and artillery placement, and the realization assisted US planners in their targeting decisions.|$|E
