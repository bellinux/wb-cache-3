40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} multidimensional scaling (MDS) and {{parametric}} similarity indices (PSI) {{in the analysis}} of complex systems (CS). Each CS is viewed as a dynamical system, exhibiting an output time-series to be interpreted as a manifestation of its behavior. We start by adopting a sliding window to sample the original data into several consecutive time periods. Second, we define a given PSI for tracking pieces of data. We then compare the windows for different values of the parameter, and we generate the corresponding MDS maps of ‘points’. Third, we use Procrustes analysis to linearly transform the MDS charts for maximum superposition and to build a global MDS map of “shapes”. This final plot captures the time evolution of the phenomena and is sensitive to the PSI adopted. The generalized correlation, the Minkowski distance and four entropy-based indices are tested. The proposed approach is applied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index and the Europe Brent Spot <b>Price</b> <b>FOB</b> time-series...|$|E

The excess production has {{allowed for the}} expansion of the export sector, converting Chile in a net exporter in 2001. A relevant question in this new market scenario is how this Structural change can affect milk prices paid to producer,; in Chile. the consequences of this Structural change were explored in this study using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model and cointegration analysis. The results indicated that the domestic, CIF (Cost. Insurance, Freight) and FOB (Free Oil Board) prices were cointegrated, implying that changes in the import and export prices are transmitted to the domestic market affecting the milk price paid to producers. Prior to 200 1, the import price (CIF) was the relevant reference dictating the movements of the domestic price. After 2001, the export <b>price</b> (<b>FOB)</b> became the reference, whereas the CIF price was no longer significant. the parameters of the VEC model SLIcroest that the conitegrating relation between CIF and domestic prices for the first period Under analysis (1990 - 2000) was clearer than that between FOB and domestic prices for the second period (2001 - 2007 / 3). the price elasticity for the FOB-domestic price vector had a large confidence interval, which is Why it IS difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the impact Of future FOB fluctuations Oil the milk price paid to producers in Chile after 2001...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} corn pricing {{in the vicinity}} of processing plants.

The price-distance functions describing spatial prices near processing plants all depend on local transport costs. But the pricing system (CIF or FOB) and the extent of local competition define the level and spatial rate of change in prices. Estimations of an empirical price-location function for Iowa during the spring of 2003 suggest that prices near the plants of four conventional businesses conform to the CIF pricing model. But prices near producer-owned firms or farmer cooperatives failed to show any statistically significant effect on nearby prices.

A mail survey of US consumers was used. The statistically significant results indicate that both males and females are generally receptive to most of the creation, communication, delivery, and exchange of product and service offerings of <b>FOBs.</b> However, the <b>price</b> of <b>FOB</b> offerings is not perceived as reasonable. In addition, customer perceptions did not vary by gender for most items. One activity where differential views resulted pertained to sales promotion. Specifically, “coupon redemption” is significantly perceived more favorably by females than males. The results suggest that while managers of FOBs should emphasis their “family business” status in their marketing presentations, they should not expect different responses to their activities based on gender.   Keywords:   marketing stimuli, gender, family businesses, consumer perceptions   </p...|$|R
