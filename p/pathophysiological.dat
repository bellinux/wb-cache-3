5|$|An {{important}} <b>pathophysiological</b> {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} <b>pathophysiological</b> mechanisms {{involved in the}} development and maintenance of obesity. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman's laboratory. While leptin and ghrelin are produced peripherally, they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system. In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the melanocortin pathway being the most well understood. The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation in the ileal {{diverticulum}} has {{symptoms that}} mimic appendicitis, therefore its diagnosis is of clinical importance. Detailed {{knowledge of the}} <b>pathophysiological</b> properties is essential {{in dealing with the}} life-threatening complications of Meckel's diverticulum.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{advances}} in psychiatry, immunology, neurology, and other integrated disciplines of medicine has fostered enormous growth for PNI. The mechanisms underlying behaviorally induced alterations of immune function, and immune alterations inducing behavioral changes, {{are likely to}} have clinical and therapeutic implications that will not be fully appreciated until more is known about the extent of these interrelationships in normal and <b>pathophysiological</b> states.|$|E
25|$|The {{processes}} {{which lead}} to hangovers are still poorly understood. Several <b>pathophysiological</b> changes may give rise to the alcohol hangover including increased levels of acetaldehyde, hormonal alterations of the cytokine pathways and decrease {{of the availability of}} glucose. Additional associated phenomena are dehydration, metabolic acidosis, disturbed prostaglandin synthesis, increased cardiac output, vasodilation, sleep deprivation and insufficient eating. Some complex organic molecules found in alcoholic beverages known as congeners may {{play an important role in}} producing hangover effects because some, such as methanol, are metabolized to the notably toxic substances formaldehyde and formic acid.|$|E
25|$|This is characterised by a {{physical}} obstruction of the intestine, {{which can be}} due to impacted food material, stricture formation, or foreign bodies. The primary <b>pathophysiological</b> abnormality caused by this obstruction {{is related to the}} trapping of fluid within the intestine oral to the obstruction. This is due to the large amount of fluid produced in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and {{the fact that this is}} primarily re-absorbed in parts of the intestine downstream from the obstruction. The first problem with this degree of fluid loss from circulation is one of decreased plasma volume, leading to a reduced cardiac output, and acid-base disturbances.|$|E
25|$|The glymphatic {{system may}} also be {{impaired}} after acute brain injuries such as ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 2014, a group of researchers from the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) demonstrated by MRI that the glymphatic system was impaired after subarachnoid hemorrhage, {{because of the presence}} of coagulated blood in the paravascular spaces. Interestingly, injection of tissue plasminogen activator (a fibrinolytic drug) in the CSF improved glymphatic functioning. In a parallel study, they also demonstrated that the glymphatic system was impaired after ischemic stroke in the ischemic hemisphere, although the <b>pathophysiological</b> basis of this phenomenon remains unclear. Notably, recanalization of the occluded artery also reestablished the glymphatic flow.|$|E
25|$|To further sketch psychiatry's {{history shows}} a {{departure}} from structural neuropathology, relying more upon ideology (Sabshin, 1990). A {{good example of this}} is Tourette syndrome, which Ferenczi (1921), although never having seen a patient with Tourette syndrome, suggested was the symbolic expression of masturbation caused by sexual repression. However, starting with the efficacy of neuroleptic drugs in attenuating symptoms (Shapiro, Shapiro and Wayne, 1973) the syndrome has gained <b>pathophysiological</b> support (e.g. Singer, 1997) and is hypothesized to have a genetic basis too, based on its high inheritability (Robertson, 2000). This trend can be seen for many hitherto traditionally psychiatric disorders (see table) and is argued to support reuniting neurology and psychiatry because both are dealing with disorders of the same system.|$|E
25|$|The three cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are potent bronchoconstrictors, increasers of {{vascular}} permeability in postcapillary venules, and stimulators of mucus secretion {{that are}} {{released from the}} lung tissue of asthmatic subjects exposed to specific allergens. They play a <b>pathophysiological</b> role in diverse types of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Drugs that block their activation of the CYSLTR1 receptor viz., montelukast, zafirlukast, and pranlukast, are used clinically as maintenance treatment for allergen-induced asthma and rhinitis; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma and rhinitis (see Aspirin-induced asthma); exercise- and cold-air induced asthma (see Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction); and childhood sleep apnea due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy (see Acquired non-inflammatory myopathy#Diet and Trauma Induced Myopathy). When combined with antihistamine drug therapy, they also appear useful for treating urticarial diseases such as hives.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{examined}} other roles of complex I activity in the brain. Andreazza et al. (2010) found {{that the level of}} complex I activity was significantly decreased in patients with bipolar disorder, but not in patients with depression or schizophrenia. They found that patients with bipolar disorder showed increased protein oxidation and nitration in their prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that future studies should target complex I for potential therapeutic studies for bipolar disorder. Similarly, Moran et al. (2010) found that patients with severe complex I deficiency showed decreased oxygen consumption rates and slower growth rates. However, they found that mutations in different genes in complex I lead to different phenotypes, thereby explaining the variations of <b>pathophysiological</b> manifestations of complex I deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel {{exhibits}} cytotoxic {{activity on}} breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, gastric, renal and prostate cancer cells. Docetaxel does not block disassembly of interphase microtubules {{and so does}} not prevent entry into the mitotic cycle, but does block mitosis by inhibiting mitotic spindle assembly. Resistance to paclitaxel or anthracycline doxorubicin does not necessarily indicate resistance to docetaxel. Microtubules formed {{in the presence of}} docetaxel are of a larger size than those formed in the presence of paclitaxel, which may result in improved cytotoxic efficacy. Abundant formation of microtubules and the prevention to replicate caused by the presence of docetaxel leads to apoptosis of tumour cells and is the basis of docetaxel use as a cancer treatment. It is unknown if <b>pathophysiological</b> interactions with docetaxel exist at this stage, however tumour type has been shown to have efficacy on cellular activity. Docetaxel activity is significantly greater in ovarian and breast tumours than for lung tumours.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{discovery}} of SSRI drugs the treatment for mood disorders were relatively limited. Now, however {{there are dozens of}} antidepressants on the market for the treatment of depression. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were the first drugs to be developed for the treatment of depression, dating back to the early 1950s. Because of their undesirable adverse-effect profile and high potential for toxicity, due to their non-selective pharmacological effects, strict regiments were for taking the drugs which limited their use. Because of this, researchers looked for other alternative with similar effectiveness but fewer adverse effects e.g. drugs that did not cause cardiac conduction abnormalities in overdoses or had the tendency to cause seizures, which led to {{the discovery}} of the SSRI drugs. The SSRIs are the most significant class of antidepressants marketed in recent years and make one of the major medicinal discoveries of the last few decades. SSRIs were the first drugs to establish beyond doubt a <b>pathophysiological</b> role for 5-HT in affective illnesses and in the broad spectrum of anxiety disorders. Likewise, they were the first to confirm the inhibition of neurotransmitter re-uptake as an important therapeutic principle.|$|E
25|$|Since ONJ {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} in many patients {{who did not}} take bisphosphonates, it is thus logical to assume that bisphosphonates {{are not the only}} factor in ONJ. While the oversuppression of bone turnover seems {{to play a major role}} in aggravating the disease process, other factors can and do initiate the <b>pathophysiological</b> mechanisms responsible for ONJ. In non-bisphosphonate cases of ONJ, it is mainly the cancellous portion of the bone and its marrow content that are involved in the disease process. The first stage is an oedema of the bone marrow initiated by a bone infarct, which is itself modulated by numerous causes, leading to myelofibrosis as a result of hypoxia and gradual loss of mineral bone density characteristic of ischaemic osteoporosis. Further deterioration can be triggered by additional bone infarcts leading to anoxia and a localized areas of osteonecrosis within the osteoporotic cancellous bone. Secondary events such as dental infection, injection of local anaesthetics with vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, and trauma can add further complications to the disease process and chronic non-pus forming bone infection osteomyelitis can also be associated with ONJ.|$|E
500|$|No single {{definition}} of concussion, minor head injury, or mild {{traumatic brain injury}} is universally accepted. [...] In 2001, the expert Concussion in Sport Group of the first International Symposium on Concussion in Sport defined concussion as [...] "a complex <b>pathophysiological</b> process affecting the brain, induced by traumatic biomechanical forces." [...] It was agreed that concussion typically involves temporary impairment of neurological function that heals by itself within time, and that neuroimaging normally shows no gross structural changes to the brain {{as the result of}} the condition.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate over}} whether {{concussion}} is a functional or structural phenomenon is ongoing. Structural damage {{has been found in}} the mildly traumatically injured brains of animals, {{but it is not clear}} whether these findings would apply to humans. Such changes in brain structure could be responsible for certain symptoms such as visual disturbances, but other sets of symptoms, especially those of a psychological nature, are more likely to be caused by reversible <b>pathophysiological</b> changes in cellular function that occur after concussion, such as alterations in neurons' biochemistry. These reversible changes could also explain why dysfunction is frequently temporary. A task force of head injury experts called the Concussion In Sport Group met in 2001 and decided that [...] "concussion may result in neuropathological changes but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than structural injury." ...|$|E
500|$|Concussion {{falls under}} the {{classification}} of mild TBI, {{but it is not}} clear whether concussion is implied in mild brain injury or mild head injury. [...] "MTBI" [...] and [...] "concussion" [...] are often treated as synonyms in medical literature [...] but other injuries such as intracranial hemorrhages (e.g. intra-axial hematoma, epidural hematoma, and subdural hematoma) are not necessarily precluded in MTBI or mild head injury, as they are in concussion. MTBI associated with abnormal neuroimaging may be considered [...] "complicated MTBI". [...] "Concussion" [...] can be considered to imply a state in which brain function is temporarily impaired and [...] "MTBI" [...] to imply a <b>pathophysiological</b> state, but in practice few researchers and clinicians distinguish between the terms. [...] Descriptions of the condition, including the severity and the area of the brain affected, are now used more often than [...] "concussion" [...] in clinical neurology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the sensors adopting environmentally sensitive dyes have utilized [...] , transport protein that binds to D-glucose and D-galactose and transports them to the membrane-bound Trg receptor triggering the chemotaxis of the bacterium towards that glucose source. It belongs to the malG family in Escherichia coli, which includes the maltose-binding protein, which, depending {{on the presence of}} glucose, can adopt two distinct conformations or possibly three generating a 31° hinge movement between the two globular domains connected by a hindge, which is the glucose-binding pocket. Its affinity for glucose is K= 0.2 µM, which is much lower than the <b>pathophysiological</b> range of glucose found in diabetes (1.7-33 mM). As a consequence, several studies have been done to lower the affinity of [...] , which otherwise would result in near-saturation of [...] throughout the <b>pathophysiological</b> glucose concentrations. The binding affinity of [...] changes when it is labelled endosterically or peristerically, so several mutants that work at range close to <b>pathophysiological</b> glucose have been created.|$|E

2500|$|By design, the DSM is {{primarily}} concerned with the {{signs and symptoms of}} mental disorders, rather than the underlying causes. It claims to collect them together based on statistical or clinical patterns. As such, it has been compared to a naturalist's field guide to birds, with similar advantages and disadvantages. The lack of a causative or explanatory basis, however, is not specific to the DSM, but rather reflects a general lack of <b>pathophysiological</b> understanding of psychiatric disorders. As DSM-III chief architect Robert Spitzer and DSM-IV editor Michael First outlined in 2005, [...] "little progress has been made toward understanding the <b>pathophysiological</b> processes and cause of mental disorders. If anything, the research has shown the situation is even more complex than initially imagined, and we believe not enough is known to structure the classification of psychiatric disorders according to etiology." ...|$|E
2500|$|Drowning {{experts have}} {{recognized}} that the end result pathophysiology of hypoxemia, acidemia, and eventual death is the same whether water entered the lung or not. As this distinction does not change management or prognosis, but causes significant confusion due to alternate definitions and misunderstandings, it is generally established that <b>pathophysiological</b> discussions of [...] "dry" [...] versus [...] "wet" [...] drowning are not relevant to drowning care.|$|E
2500|$|Personalized care {{solutions}} {{are a key}} aim of the VPH, with new modelling environments for predictive, individualized healthcare to result in better patient safety and drug efficacy. It is anticipated that the VPH {{could also result in}} healthcare improvement through greater understanding of <b>pathophysiological</b> processes. The use of biomedical data from a patient to simulate potential treatments and outcomes could prevent the patient from experiencing unnecessary or ineffective treatments. [...] The use of in silico (by computer simulation) modelling and testing of drugs could also reduce the need for experiments on animals.|$|E
2500|$|While {{shortness}} of breath is generally caused by disorders of the cardiac or respiratory system, other systems such as [...] neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, hematologic, and psychiatric may be the cause. DiagnosisPro, an online medical expert system, listed 497 distinct causes in October 2010. The most common cardiovascular causes are acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure while common pulmonary causes include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema and pneumonia. On a <b>pathophysiological</b> basis the causes can be divided into: (1) an increased awareness of normal breathing such as during an anxiety attack, (2) {{an increase in the}} work of breathing and (3) an abnormality in the ventilatory system.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, bruxism can {{be divided}} into primary bruxism (also termed [...] "idiopathic bruxism"), where the {{disorder}} is not related to any other medical condition, or secondary bruxism, where the disorder is associated with other medical conditions. Secondary bruxism includes iatrogenic causes, such as the side effect of prescribed medications. Another source divides the causes of bruxism into three groups, namely central or <b>pathophysiological</b> factors, psychosocial factors and peripheral factors. The World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases 10th revision does not have an entry called bruxism, instead listing [...] "tooth grinding" [...] under somatoform disorders. To describe bruxism as a purely somatoform disorder does not reflect the mainstream, modern view of this condition (see causes).|$|E
2500|$|The {{direct cause}} and <b>pathophysiological</b> basis of RMD is still unknown and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults of perfect or non-perfect health. Rare cases of adult RMD have developed due to head trauma, stress, and herpes encephalitis. Familial cases have been reported suggesting {{there may be some}} genetic aspect to the disorder; however, to date, this explanation has not been directly tested. As familial incidence rate is still relatively low, it is believed that behavioral aspects may play a larger role in RMD than family history and genetics. Many sufferers report no family history of the disorder. Another theory suggests that RMD is a learned, self-stimulating behavior to alleviate tension and induce relaxation, similar to tic movements.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{based on}} genetically {{engineered}} mouse models of EPAC1 have provided valuable insights into understanding the in vivo functions of EPAC1 under both physiological and <b>pathophysiological</b> conditions. Overall, mice deficient of EPAC1 or both EPAC1 and EPAC2 appear relatively normal without major phenotypic defects. These observations {{are consistent with}} the fact that cAMP is a major stress response signal not essential for survival. This makes EPAC1 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention as the on-target toxicity of EPAC-based therapeutics will likely be low. Up to data, genetic and pharmacological analyses of EPAC1 in mice have revealed that EPAC1 plays important roles in cardiac stresses and heart failure, leptin resistance and energy homeostasis, [...] chronic pain, infection, cancer metastasis and metabolism.|$|E

Despite the change in [...] of only 35% across the <b>pathophysiological</b> range (possibly 40% maximum change form no glucose to saturation), the sensor has been shown to decrease in functionality by only 20% [...] after 450 days incubation at 37°C and to monitor glucose as well as the Medtronic/Minimed CGMS sensor in animal models (mouse, pig, and dog), however their stated aim is to create a smart tattoo.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that abnormalities occur in the gut flora of individuals who have IBS, such as reduced diversity, a decrease in bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes, {{and an increase in}} those belonging to the phylum Firmicutes.
