5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures {{to make them more}} pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner's colourisation facilities {{as a member of the}} Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising The Haunting. Wise was able to prevent the colourisation by <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> contract, which stated the picture could only be in black-and-white.|$|E

With the clans destroyed and the village safe, the blacksmith vows {{to keep it that}} way and destroys the sign <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> weapon shop. During the credits, Zen-Yi's pregnant fiancee is kidnapped by a bird clan, prompting Zen-Yi to seek the blacksmith's aid.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} Popular Contemporary Writers, Michael D. Sharp {{describes}} Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational. Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter {{in a way}} that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations. Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in Slaughterhouse-Five and Slapstick.|$|E

5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the time when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|During his {{campaigns of}} {{clamping}} down on groups {{that helped the}} British, Tipu Sultan targeted several Muslim groups, including the Mappila Muslims of Malabar, the Mahadevi Muslims, and the Nawabs of Sawanur and Nizam. He is not known to have treated them any better or differently to the several Hindu or Christian minority groups that helped the British, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> policy being politically motivated, rather than religiously motivated.|$|E
25|$|Around 1850, Ye Mingchen and {{his father}} {{established}} an association in the western suburbs of Guangzhou to worship Lü Dongbin, one of the Daoist Eight Immortals known for helping the common people, and to provide medical prescriptions. Ye {{is said to have}} commanded troops in battle on the basis of communications with Lü. Some unsympathetic observers account for his inadequate preparations, misplaced confidence, and the ease with which the British captured him by <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> belief in occult Daoism and oracular divination.|$|E

25|$|The {{incident}} was criticised in Dáil Éireann, {{the lower house}} of the Irish Parliament. The Irish Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern called on FIFA {{to act in the}} interests of fair play. The French Prime Minister François Fillon stated that the 'Irish government should not interfere in footballing decisions'. Rama Yade, French Secretary of State for Sports, and FFF vice-president Noël Le Graët both defended Henry from accusations of intentional cheating, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> playing record, and stating that he should be presumed innocent unless he stated he deliberately set out to cheat.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons why}} {{a small circle}} of mostly senior Aum members {{committed}} atrocities {{and the extent of}} personal involvement by Asahara remain unclear, although several theories have attempted to explain these events. In response to the prosecution's charge that Asahara ordered the subway attacks to distract authorities, the defense maintained that Asahara was not aware of events, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> deteriorating health. Shortly after his arrest, Asahara abandoned his post as the organization's leader, and since then has maintained silence, refusing to communicate even with lawyers and family members.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} {{concerns}} expressed by local residents and historic preservationists by the successful Trump bid. Preservationists believed Trump would not respect the historic {{nature of the}} building and had almost no experience renovating historic properties but government officials said any redesign would need to be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts (whose secretary signaled heavy scrutiny for any changes). Trump dismissed concerns that he lacked experience with historic buildings, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> redevelopment of Grand Central Terminal in New York City and the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Some city residents worried that Trump would block access to the clock tower. However, the National Park Service said it will retain control over the clock tower and observation deck and it will keep them open for tours. Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein questioned the financial wisdom of selecting Trump/Colony Capital, given Trump's extensive problems with bankruptcy and Colony Capital's current problems keeping its hotel properties out of receivership. Pearlstein and local hoteliers argued that the market would not support the room rates Trump wished to charge, and therefore {{would not be able to}} support the excessive amount of redevelopment money and rent Trump was paying for the property. Robert Peck, Commissioner of the General Services Administration, defended the selection, arguing that the Trump/Colony Capital bid was by far the best in terms of financial commitment, experience in renovating and managing properties, and quality of design. Peck dismissed criticism about Trump's numerous past bankruptcies, noting that these mostly concerned casinos rather than hotels.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Agnew {{played the}} centrist, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> civil rights record in Maryland. As the {{campaign}} developed, he quickly adopted a more belligerent approach, with strong law-and-order rhetoric, a style which alarmed the party's Northern liberals but played {{well in the}} South. John Mitchell, Nixon's campaign manager, was impressed, some other party leaders less so; Senator Thruston Morton described Agnew as an [...] "asshole".|$|E
500|$|Thorpe {{left school}} {{at the end of}} the year after {{completing}} Year 10. His decision caused concerns that concentrating on swimming alone could lead to burn out. Thorpe disagreed, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> informal search for knowledge, stating that [...] "Swimming is a small part of my life". His impact in the swimming community was acknowledged when he became the youngest male swimmer to be named as the Swimming World Swimmer of the Year.|$|E

It’s more than just making music, and it always has been. We’ve been friends a long time. We’ve been more of a family than most, and it had to be okay from here", Cantrell said <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> heart.|$|E

They have cut off contact with [...] "former associates" [...] and venture outside only at night. [...] "We existed within ourselves alone", the narrator explains. When a bank clerk named Adolphe Le Bon is arrested {{even though no}} evidence exists <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> guilt (other than his delivering the gold coins to the two ladies the day before), Dupin becomes intrigued and remembers a service that Le Bon once performed for him.

500|$|Blunt {{left the}} British Army in 2002 {{so that he}} could pursue his musical career. He started using the stage name [...] "Blunt" [...] in part {{to make it easier for}} others to spell; [...] "Blount" [...] is {{pronounced}} the same way, and remains his legal last name. Shortly after leaving the army he was signed to EMI music publishers and to Twenty-First Artists management. A record contract remained elusive, with recording label executives <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> [...] speaking voice as a barrier in class-divided Britain. Linda Perry, who was just launching her own Custard Records label in early 2003, heard Blunt's promotional tape when visiting London, and soon after heard him perform live at the South by Southwest Music Festival. She made an offer to him the same night, and within a few days he signed a recording contract with her. A month later, he travelled to Los Angeles to meet producer Tom Rothrock.|$|E
500|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement regarded Beadle {{as a white}} supremacist, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> 1959 preventive detention ruling as evidence. Wilson and other British figures saw him as two-faced for first supporting Gibbs, then declaring Smith's post-UDI government legal, {{and concluded that the}} judge must have always been a furtive UDI supporter, a theory that many have accepted. Wilson's private assistant Marcia Falkender identified Beadle as [...] "the villain of the piece", while Bottomley dubbed him UDI's [...] "evil genius". Others, including Palley, Wood and Facchini, contend that Beadle was determined to avert UDI and afterwards sincere in his search for an accommodation until he came to believe this was not possible. [...] "Beadle accepted the rebellion when he realised that he was identifying himself with 'the code of an Empire that had ceased to exist'," [...] Facchini concludes. [...] "Thus, he retained his Privy Counsellorship as a vestige of the Rhodesia he had known all his life." ...|$|E

[...] However, Palazzo attacked Taylor for supporting Pelosi as Speaker and claimed Taylor voted with his party's leadership 82 percent of the time. Taylor was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee.|$|E

The Webb campaign criticized Allen for holding stock in a company that makes a product that many of his supporters oppose. Allen responded by saying that he holds the stock because Barr Labs has created jobs in Virginia, and by <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> consistently pro-life voting record. Allen has no plans to sell the stock.|$|E
