Packet telephony is probably the first important real-time service that must be supported well over an IP network. The use of IP presents a tremendous opportunity for service providers to exploit endpoint intelligence to offer creative new services going far beyond the current telephony service model. However, to support <b>telephony,</b> <b>signaling</b> protocols are needed that allow the service provider to offer network-layer service differentiation and, at the same time, to control access to both the enhanced network-layer quality of service {{as well as other}} services. This paper describes the Distributed Open Signaling Architecture (DOSA), which incorporates protocols that meet these needs. A key contribution of our work is a recognition of the need for coordination between call signaling, which controls access to telephony specific services, and resource management, which controls access to networklayer resources.
