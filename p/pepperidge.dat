5|$|Animal House was {{the first}} film {{produced}} by National Lampoon, the most popular humor magazine on college campuses in the mid-1970s. The periodical specialized in satirizing politics and popular culture. Many of the magazine’s writers were recent college graduates, hence their appeal to students all over the country. Doug Kenney was a Lampoon writer and the magazine’s first editor-in-chief. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the Omegas in the film (he had been president of the university's elite Spee Club). Kenney {{was responsible for the}} first appearances of three characters that would appear in the film, Larry Kroger, Mandy <b>Pepperidge,</b> and Vernon Wormer. They made their debut in 1973's National Lampoon’s High School Yearbook, a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger's and Pepperidge's characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon Wormer was a P. E. and civics teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook.|$|E

500|$|After being {{reminded}} {{to pick up}} Meg at {{the local}} roller rink, Peter and his friends decide to go skating. At the roller rink scene, the 1976 disco song [...] "A Fifth of Beethoven" [...] is featured, performed by Walter Murphy. This is a tongue-in-cheek gag, as Murphy {{is also one of}} the composers for Family Guy. After returning home without Meg, the Griffin family are shown watching a <b>Pepperidge</b> Farm commercial on their television. Immediately afterwards, Meg enters her home, and begs her parents to get buy her a new vehicle. Reluctant to do so, Peter informs Meg that plenty of people are able to get around without a car, including the fictional Marvel Comics superhero Iceman. Finally deciding to give in and purchase a vehicle for Meg, the Griffin family head to the local car dealership. While there, Brian notices a large amount of Hummers, and questions who would ever want to drive one. A cutaway then shows a loud, obnoxious man driving a yellow Hummer, who goes on to brag about being able to watch the 2005 film Madagascar while driving, and proceeds to destroy two vehicles in the process while yelling the name of former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E

2500|$|Lincoln Park – Lincoln Avenue at South Union. [...] What is now Lincoln Park was the Cranford Golf Club in 1899, now {{moved to}} Westfield {{and called the}} Echo Lake Country Club. The Lincoln Avenue grounds were {{designed}} by Willie Dunn. [...] Lincoln Park was also originally a former estate said to have supplied lumber to build the USS Constitution ("Old Ironsides") in the 1700s. [...] The grounds, {{at the corner of}} the Old York Road and Benjamin Street, also included the largest sour gum ever recorded in the Northeastern states, known as the Cranford <b>Pepperidge</b> Tree or [...] "Old Peppy." [...] The park has hosted bocce ball tournaments since the mid-1960s.|$|E
2500|$|While {{these trees}} are often known as simply [...] "tupelo", the fuller name black tupelo helps {{distinguish}} it from the other species of the tupelo genus (Nyssa), {{some of which have}} overlapping ranges, such as water tupelo (N. aquatica) and swamp tupelo (N. biflora). The name [...] "tupelo" [...] is used primarily in the American South; northward and in Appalachia, the tree is more commonly called the black gum or the sour gum, although no part of the plant is particularly gummy. Both of these names contrast it with a different tree species with a broadly overlapping range, the sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), which does produce an aromatic resin. [...] Another common name used occasionally in the Northeast is <b>pepperidge.</b>|$|E

60|$|The repast, {{which was}} greatly {{aided by the}} {{addition}} of a few delicacies that Heyward had the precaution to bring with him when they left their horses, was exceedingly refreshing to the wearied party. Uncas acted as attendant to the females, performing all the little offices within his power, with a mixture of dignity and anxious grace, that served to amuse Heyward, who well knew that it was an utter innovation on the Indian customs, which forbid their warriors to descend to any menial employment, especially in favor of their women. As the rites of hospitality were, however, considered sacred among them, this little departure from the dignity of manhood excited no audible comment. Had there been one there sufficiently disengaged to become a close observer, he might have fancied that the services of the young chief were not entirely impartial. That while he tendered to Alice the gourd of sweet water and the venison in a trencher, neatly carved from the knot of the <b>pepperidge,</b> with sufficient courtesy, in performing the same offices to her sister, his dark eye lingered on her rich, speaking countenance. Once or twice he was compelled to speak, to command the attention of those he served. In such cases, he made use of English, broken and imperfect, but sufficiently intelligible, and which he rendered so mild and musical, by his deep,[14] guttural voice, that it never failed to cause both ladies to look up in admiration and astonishment. In the course of these civilities, a few sentences were exchanged, that served to establish the appearance of an amicable intercourse between the parties.|$|E
