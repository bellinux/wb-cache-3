25|$|Performance {{appraisal}} {{or performance}} evaluation {{is the process}} in which an individual's or a group's work behaviors and outcomes are assessed against managers' and others' expectations for the job. Performance appraisal is frequently used in promotion and compensation decisions, to help design and validate personnel selection procedures, and for performance management. Performance management {{is the process of}} providing <b>performance</b> <b>feedback</b> relative to expectations, and information relevant to improvement (e.g., coaching, mentoring). Performance management may also include documenting and tracking performance information for organizational evaluation purposes.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} model, the job demands-resources (JD-R) model, {{grew out}} of the DCS model. In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains {{more or less the same}} as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen job demands, or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, <b>performance</b> <b>feedback</b> from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.|$|E

The {{bilateral}} PD {{control method}} for teleoperation robot has some defects, such as poor tracking <b>performance</b> and force <b>feedback</b> <b>performance.</b> This paper, based on traditional bilateral PD control method, adds an impedance controller {{to the master}} and the slave, and deduces the stability condition according to the absolute stability criterion. The simulation shows that this method can assure the system stability and improve tracking <b>performance</b> and force <b>feedback</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of {{feedback}} types (i. e., outcome, process, and task feedback), feedback propensities, and their interactions on task performance in an attempt to determine, first, which types of feedback produced better task performance and, second, how feedback propensities influenced relationships between <b>feedback</b> type and <b>performance.</b> Process <b>feedback</b> and task feedback were expected to interact in their effects on task performance. In addition, I predicted that external feedback propensity would moderate the effects of process <b>feedback</b> on <b>performance</b> and initial task performance would moderate the effects of internal feedback propensity on task performance. However, none of the hypotheses were directly supported. Overall, the current study demonstrated support for the proposition that feedback does not consistently improve performance. Instead, findings showed that feedback has highly variable effects on <b>performance.</b> Task <b>feedback</b> improved <b>performance,</b> process <b>feedback</b> did not affect <b>performance,</b> and outcome <b>feedback</b> seemed to debilitate performance over time...|$|R

30|$|It is {{possible}} to categorize the feature reduction algorithms into two categories: filter methods and wrapper methods. Filter methods focus on the general characteristics of the data to evaluate and to select the feature subsets without involving the chosen learning algorithm or the classifier. But wrapper methods use the <b>performance</b> <b>feedbacks</b> of the chosen learning algorithm or the classifier to evaluate each candidate feature subset. Wrapper methods search for a subset of features which has better fit for the chosen learning algorithm or the classifier, {{but they can be}} significantly slower than filter methods if the learning algorithm {{takes a long time to}} learn.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>feedback</b> has an {{important}} influence on employee affect.

[...] Employees tend to rate a leader's effectiveness as low when leaders provide failure feedback with negative affect in feedback sessions. Similarly, team members tend to provide lower quality performance ratings on their collective tasks when negative affect accompanies failure feedback by leaders.|$|E

30|$|The {{reported}} {{relationships in}} this study may also be linked to recognition, rewards, and successes. Recognition and rewards include strong positive <b>performance</b> <b>feedbacks</b> and are experienced as subjective success. Previous research showed subjective occupational success including four success-subdimensions (i.e., positive feedback, goal attainment, pro-social success, and career success) to buffer the stressor-strain relationship (Grebner et al. 2010). Meanwhile, experiences of success, especially through goal attainment is also known to result in setting of higher goals and acquisition of complex tasks and resources to reach those goals as predicted by the high performance circle (Latham et al. 2005). Hence, future studies should test whether recognition, rewards, and subjective occupational success functions as an enhancing moderator between CSE and job resources or CSE and job satisfaction.|$|R

Thus, different types of job demands and job resources may interact in predicting job strain. Good examples of job resources that have the potential of buffering job demands are <b>performance</b> <b>feedback</b> and social support (e.g.,).|$|E
