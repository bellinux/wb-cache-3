50|$|Following oral administration, {{leptophos}} is excreted in {{urine and}} faeces as several components. Several components found in urine included: O-methyl phenyl phosphonate (a major component in raturine), O-methyl phenyl <b>phosphonothioic</b> <b>acid</b> (a major component in miceurine), leptophos phenol, and phenyl phosphonic acid.

40|$|Racemic {{as well as}} enantiomerically pure trans- 1, 10 -(cyclohexane- 1, 2 -diyl) bis(imidazole N-oxides) were {{prepared}} from trans-cyclohexane- 1, 2 -bis(methylidenamine) and 1, 2 -dione monooximes (a-hydroxyiminoketones). The enantiomeric purity of selected products was determined by means of 1 H NMR spectroscopy {{in the presence of}} (+) -(R) -(tert butyl) (phenyl) <b>phosphonothioic</b> <b>acid</b> as a chiral solvating agent. Deoxygenation by treatment with Raney-nickel led to the corresponding chiral bis-imidazoles...|$|E
