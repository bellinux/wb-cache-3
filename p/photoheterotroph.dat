[...] Though it does contain a complete photosynthesis superoperon, KT71 cannot grow autotrophically. [...] Instead, KT71 uses light for light-dependent cyclic electron transport through its photosystem to generate a proton gradient. [...] To determine the metabolism of KT71, the organism was grown in mineral medium containing: 35.0 g of sea salts, 0.1 g of NH4Cl, 0.05 g of K2HPO4, and 10 ml of a vitamin solution. The mineral medium was then supplemented with various carbon compounds to determine the ability for KT71 to use in its metabolism. From this {{it was determined that}} KT71 can grow well with carbon sources such as glutamate, pyruvate, and fatty acids as well as more complex substrates like yeast extract and trypticase peptone. Within its genome, genes, determined from genome annotation, involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, trichloroacetic acid cycle (TCA), citric acid cycle were found which correlated to the metabolism observed in culture. Further, KT71 is unable to use glucose as a sole carbon source, which was supported by genome analysis that showed a lack of glucose metabolism genes. Although the supplementation of inorganic sulfur to media did not promote growth, KT71 does contain sulfur-oxidizing (sox) genes that are uniquely arranged in its genome.

Bacterial production (leucine incorporation at a 20 nM final concentration) was on average 30 % higher in light than in dark-incubated samples, but the effect varied greatly (3 % to 60 %). To further characterize this light effect, we {{examined the}} abundance of potential <b>photoheterotrophs</b> and measured their contribution to bacterial production and amino acid assimilation (0. 5 nM addition) using flow cytometry. Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were abundant in surface waters where light-dependent leucine incorporation was observed, whereas aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria were abundant but did not correlate with the light effect. The per-cell assimilation rates of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were comparable to or {{higher than those of}} other prokaryotes, especially in the light. Picoeukaryotes also took up leucine (20 nM) and other amino acids (0. 5 nM), but rates normalized to biovolume were much lower than those of prokaryotes.

However, nearly 40 % of the light-stimulated leucine assimilation was not accounted for by these groups, suggesting that assimilation by other microbes is also affected by light.

40|$|Many Proteobacteria possess LuxI-LuxR-type quorum-sensing {{systems that}} produce and detect fatty acyl-homoserine lactone (HSL) signals. The <b>photoheterotroph</b> Rhodopseudomonas palustris {{is unusual in}} that it {{produces}} and detects an aryl-HSL, p-coumaroyl-HSL, and signal production requires an exogenous source of p-coumarate. A photosynthetic stem-nodulating member of the genus Bradyrhizobium produces a small molecule signal that elicits an R. palustris quorum-sensing response. Here, we show that this signal is cinnamoyl-HSL and that cinnamoyl-HSL is produced by the LuxI homolog BraI and detected by BraR. Cinnamoyl-HSL reaches concentrations {{on the order of}} 50 nM in cultures of stem-nodulating bradyrhizobia grown in {{the presence or absence of}} cinnamate.

Our stem-nodulating Bradyrhizobium strain responds to picomolar concentrations of cinnamoyl-HSL and thus, produces cinnamoyl-HSL in excess of the levels required for a signal response without an exogenous source of cinnamate. The ability of Bradyrhizobium to produce and respond to cinnamoyl-HSL shows that aryl-HSL production is not unique to R. palustris, that the aromatic acid substrate for aryl-HSL synthesis does not have to be supplied exogenously, and that some acyl-HSL quorum-sensing systems may function at very low signal production and response levels...|$|E
40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the order Rhodobacterales {{is the presence of}} a large number of photoautotrophic and photo-heterotrophic species containing bacteriochlorophyll. Interestingly, these phototrophic species are phylogenetically mixed with chemotrophs. To better understand the origin of such variability, we sequenced the genomes of three closely related haloalkaliphilic species, differing in their phototrophic capacity and oxygen preference: the photoheterotrophic and facultatively anaerobic bacterium Rhodobaca barguzinensis, aerobic <b>photoheterotroph</b> Roseinatronobacter thiooxidans, and aerobic heterotrophic bacterium Natronohydrobacter thiooxidans. These three haloalcaliphilic species are phylogenetically related and share many common characteristics with the Rhodobacter species, forming together the Rhodobacter-Rhodobaca (RR) group. A comparative genomic analysis showed close homology of photosynthetic proteins and similarity in photosynthesis gene organization among the investigated phototrophic RR species. On the other hand, Rhodobaca barguzinensis and Roseinatronobacter thiooxidans lack an inorganic carbon fixation pathway and outer light-harvesting genes. This documents the reduction of their photosynthetic machinery towards a mostly photoheterotrophic lifestyle. Moreover, both phototrophic species contain 5 -aminolevulinate synthase (encoded by the hemA gene) incorporated into their photosynthesis gene clusters, which seems to be a common feature of all aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic Alphaproteobacteria. Interestingly, the chrR-rpoE (sigma 24) operon, which is part of singlet oxygen defense in phototrophic species, was found in the heterotrophic strain Natronohydrobacter thiooxidans. This suggests that this organism evolved from a photoheterotrophic ancestor through the loss of its photosynthesis genes.

Fusions giving rise to APase expression, as judged by blue-colony pigmentation when exconjugants were plated on growth medium containing the chromogenic indicator 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl phosphate, were observed in about 1 % of the exconjugants.

The growth and spectral characteristics of several of these mutants, as well as the localization and quantitation of subcellular APase activity under different physiological conditions, have been examined. The presence of TnphoA in the host genome has been confirmed for each mutant analyzed, and specifically tagged DNA fragments containing TnphoA have been identified and localized; cosmids containing R. sphaeroides genomic DNA capable of complementing individual mutants have also been isolated.

50|$|<b>Photoheterotrophs</b> {{generate}} ATP using light, {{in one of}} two ways: {{they use}} a bacteriochlorophyll-based reaction center, or they use a bacteriorhodopsin. The chlorophyll-based mechanism is similar to that used in photosynthesis, where light excites the molecules in a reaction center and causes a flow of electrons through an electron transport chain (ETS). This flow of electrons through the proteins causes hydrogen ions to be pumped across a membrane. The energy stored in this proton gradient is used to drive ATP synthesis. Unlike in photoautotrophs, the electrons flow only in a cyclic pathway: electrons released from the reaction center flow through the ETS and return to the reaction center.

The abundance of AAP bacteria and PR-containing bacteria decreased from summer to winter, in parallel with a threefold decrease in the total prokaryotic community. In contrast, the abundance of Synechococcus organisms did not decrease in winter, suggesting that their growth was supported by organic substrates. Results from QPCR assays revealed no substantial shifts in the community structure of AAP bacteria and PR-containing bacteria.

In the present study, a proteomic approach was employed to analyze the status of R. litoralis OCh 149 in carbon starvation during the stationary phase and its responses to a dark/light regimen (12 h: 12 h) in both exponential and stationary phases. LC-MS/MS-based analysis of highly abundant proteins under carbon starvation revealed that proteins involved in transport, the transcription/translation process and carbohydrate metabolism were the major functional categories, while poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA), previously accumulated in cells, was remobilized after stress. Glucose, as the sole carbon source in the defined medium, was broken down by Entner-Doudoroff and reductive pentose phosphate (PP) pathways. Carbohydrate catabolism-related proteins were down-regulated under light regardless of the growth phase, probably due to inhibition of respiration by light. In contrast, responses of amino acid metabolisms to light regimen varied among different proteins during growth phases depending on cellular requirements for proliferation, growth or survival. Fluorescence induction and relaxation measurements suggested that functional absorption cross-sections of the photosynthetic complexes decreased during the dark period and always recovered to about the previous level during the light period.

We report the identification and characterization of two loci involved in high-level tellurite resistance. The first locus contains four genes, two of which, trgAB, confer increased tellurite resistance when introduced into the related bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans. The trgAB-derived products display no significant homology to known proteins, but both {{are likely to be}} membrane-associated proteins. Immediately downstream of trgB, the cysK (cysteine synthase) and orf 323 genes were identified. Disruption of the cysK gene resulted in decreased tellurite resistance in R. sphaeroides, confirming earlier observations on the importance of cysteine metabolism for high-level tellurite resistance. The second locus identified is represented by the telA gene, which is separated from trgAB by 115 kb. The telA gene product is 65 % similar to the product of the klaB (telA) gene from the tellurite-resistance-encoding kilA operon from plasmid RK 2. The genes immediately linked to the R. sphaeroides telA gene have no similarity to other components of the kilA operon. R. sphaeroides telA could not functionally substitute for the plasmid RK 2 telA gene, indicating substantial functional divergence between the two gene products. However, inactivation of R. sphaeroides telA resulted in a significant decrease in tellurite resistance compared to the wild-type strain.

The cells were starved over six months under three conditions: continuous darkness (DD), continuous light (LL), and light/dark cycle (LD, 12 h/ 12 h, 12 µmol photons m(- 2) s(- 1)). LD starvation at low light intensity resulted in 10 -fold higher total cell and viable counts, and higher bacteriochlorophyll a and polyhydroxyalkanoate contents. This coincided with better physiological fitness as determined by respiration rates, proton translocation and ATP concentrations. In contrast, LD starvation at high light intensity (> 22 µmol photons m(- 2) s(- 1), LD conditions) resulted in decreasing cell survival rates but increasing carotenoid concentrations, indicating a photo-protective response. Cells grown in complex medium survived longer starvation (more than 20 weeks) than those grown in minimal medium. Our experiments show that D. shibae benefits from the light and dark cycle, particularly during starvation...|$|R

Organisms that can use sunlight for phototrophy fall into two categories: photoautotrophs and <b>photoheterotrophs.</b> Photoautotrophs are organisms that use light to carry out photosynthesis, utilizing carbon dioxide as their principal carbon source. <b>Photoheterotrophs</b> use light energy to break down organic carbon compounds from the environment to drive ATP synthesis. In particular, rhodopsin-based photoheterotrophic bacteria use a rhodopsin-retinal protein complex to capture light and potentially establish a transmembrane ion gradient, which could drive ATP synthesis. In addition, {{there are other ways}} for organisms to use sunlight. Some phototrophic organisms can utilize accessory molecules, such as carotenoids, as light-harvesting antennae for photosynthesis. Here, we discuss two ways bacteria can use light through rhodopsins and carotenoids. Microbial rhodopsins are a family of transmembrane proteins, with photosensitive retinal cofactors, found in every domain of life. Rhodopsins respond to light by transporting ions across the cell membrane or by initiating a signaling cascade that leads to altered gene expression. Rhodopsins are abundant in nature, and recent estimates indicate that up to 70 % of microbial cells in some aquatic environments possess rhodopsin genes, suggesting that more bacteria utilize sunlight than previously thought. However, these estimates are based on gene abundances, not direct observation. In order to determine the abundance of functional rhodopsins, visualization of these low-fluorescing proteins is essential. We recently developed a method that uses total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to identify rhodopsin-containing cells in environmental samples. Here, we use TIRF microscopy to quantify the total number of rhodopsin-containing cells in water samples collected along the Chesapeake Bay, demonstrating that rhodopsin production is correlated with daylight and salinity. Approximately up to 60 percent of cells produce functional rhodopsins; therefore, microbial capture and utilization of sunlight by rhodopsin-type photosystems is likely common throughout this estuary. Carotenoids are pigmented, organic compounds that have been used in industry for years as food colorants, with up to 750 different carotenoids known today. The most abundant form of carotenoids are 40 -carbon molecules (C 40), but 50 carbon molecules (C 50) exist as well. While most C 40 carotenoid biosynthetic pathways have been well characterized, C 50 pathways have not. Using genomic and phylogenetic analyses, we have identified two potential genes involved in the biosynthesis of a C 50 carotenoid, bacterioruberin, in Rhodoluna lacicola. When the pathway is expressed in Escherichia coli, bacterioruberin is produced. Overall, these insights into two different methods by which bacteria use sunlight can enhance our ability to produce alternative energy source technologies focused on biological organisms and their ability to generate power in the form of electron gradients.
