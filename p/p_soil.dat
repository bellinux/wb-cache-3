40|$|The {{influence}} of two vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and phosphorus (P) nutrition on penetration, development, and reproduction by Meloidogyne incognita on Walter tomato was {{studied in the}} greenhouse. Inoculation with either Gigaspora margarita or Glomus mosseae 2 wk prior to nematode inoculation did not alter infection by M. incognita compared with nonmycorrhizal plants, regardless of soil P level (either 3 μg [low P] or 30 μg [high P] available P/g soil). At a given soil P level, nematode penetration and reproduction {{did not differ in}} mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants. However, plants grown in high <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> had greater root weights, increased nematode penetration and egg production per plant, and decreased colonization by mycorrhizal fungi, compared with plants grown in low <b>P</b> <b>soil.</b> The number of eggs per female nematode on mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants was not influenced by P treatment. Tomato plants with split root systems grown in double-compartment containers which had either low <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> in both sides or high P in one side and low P in the other, were inoculated at transplanting with G. margarita and 2 wk later one-half of the split root system of each plant was inoculated with M. incognita larvae. Although the mycoorhizal fungus increased the inorganic P content of the root to a level comparable to that in plants grown in high <b>P</b> <b>soil,</b> nematode penetration and reproduction were not altered. In a third series of experiments, the rate of nematode development was not influenced by either the presence of G. margarita or high soil P, compared with control plants grown in low <b>P</b> <b>soil.</b> These data indicate that supplemental P (30 μ/g soil) alters root-knot nematode infection of tomato more than G. mosseae and G. margarita...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} on P leaf analysis for detecting deficiencies in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) has not considered temperature as a determining factor. This is despite correlations between leaf P content and temperature being observed in other crops. As part of research {{into a new}} cotton farming system for the semi-arid tropics of Australia, we conducted two P fertiliser rate experiments on recently cleared un-cropped (bicarbonate P < 5 mg kg- 1) and previously cropped (bicarbonate P 26 mg kg- 1) soil. They aimed to develop P requirements and more importantly to determine if temperature affects the leaf P concentrations used to diagnose P deficiencies. In 2002, optimal yield on un-cropped, low <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> was achieved with a 60 kg P ha- 1 rate. In 2003, residual P from the 40 kg P ha- 1 treatment produced optimal yield. On cropped, high <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> there was no yield response to treatments up to 100 kg P ha- 1. On low <b>P</b> <b>soil,</b> a positive correlation was observed between P concentration in the youngest fully-unfurled leaf (YFUL), fertiliser rate, and mean diurnal temperature in the seven days prior to sampling.

Our sites represent a broad range in rainfall, soil type, management strategies, and total <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> (45. 2 - 1228. 0 microng <b>P</b> / g <b>soil),</b> yet we found some unexpected and at times strikingly similar changes in <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> in all sites. In the Brazilian sites, where rainfall is relatively low and pasture management is more intense than in the Costa Rican sites, significant losses in total <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> and <b>soil</b> organic carbon (SOC) were seen with pasture age on both fine-textured oxisol and highly sandy entisol <b>soils.</b> However, <b>P</b> losses were largely from occluded, inorganic <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> fractions, while organic forms of <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> remained constant or increased with pasture age, despite the declines in SOC. In Costa Rica, SOC remained constant across the oxisol sites and increased from forest to pasture on the mollisols, while total <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> increased with pasture age in both sequences. The increases in total <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> were largely due to changes in organic P; occluded <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> increased only slightly in the mollisols, and remained unchanged in the older oxisols. We suggest that changes in the composition and/or the primary limiting resources of the soil microbial community may drive the changes in organic P.

40|$|A {{measure of}} <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> status in {{agricultural}} soils is generally required for assisting with prediction of potential P loss from agricultural catchments and assessing risk for water quality. The objectives {{of this paper}} are twofold: (i) investigating the <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> status, distribution, and variability, both spatially and with soil depth, of two different first-order catchments; and (ii) determining variation in <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> concentration in relation to catchment topography (quantified as the "topographic index") and critical source areas (CSAs). The <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> measurements showed large spatial variability, not only between fields and land uses, but also within individual fields and in part {{was thought to be}} strongly influenced by areas where cattle tended to congregate and areas where manure was most commonly spread. Topographic index alone was not related to the distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>P,</b> and does not seem to provide an adequate indicator for CSAs in the study catchments.

The difficulties in defining CSAs a priori, particularly for modeling and prediction purposes, however, suggest that other more "integrated" measures of catchment <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> status, such as baseflow P concentrations or streambed sediment P concentrations, might be more useful. Since observed <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> distribution is variable and is also difficult to relate to nationally available <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> data, any assessment of <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> status for determining risk of P loss is uncertain and problematic, given other catchment physicochemical characteristics and the sampling strategy employed...|$|R

The REY (REE+Y) concentrations in the HCl extracts from the two soils have also been determined. The NH 4 -acetate extracts display the highest Sr and Ca concentrations (38 – 292 mg/kg, and 2. 31 – 49. 12 g/kg respectively), while the water extracts provide the lowest ones (0. 5 – 6. 1 mg/kg and 0. 08 – 0. 33 g/kg, respectively). The REY concentrations range narrowly in the <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> (24. 3 – 31. 4 mg/kg),while they distinguish along with Sr and Ca between {{the upper and lower}} horizons in the F soil (51. 5 – 63. 3 and 19. 8 – 27. 1 mg/kg respectively). In particular, as the lower horizons display concentrations {{similar to those of the}} <b>P</b> <b>soil,</b> this suggests a common origin of those sediments. The PAAS-normalized patterns in the HCl extracts of both the soils show either a middle REE enrichment, suggestive of phosphate dissolution and/or REY complexation with organicmatter, and a small positive Gd anomaly, referred to as the contribution from marine carbonates and phosphates. The range of δ 87 Sr (12. 4 – 13) of the insoluble residue of the <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> indicates that Sr is is derived fromcrust silicates, that also provided the Sr of the insoluble residue of the F soil (δ 87 Sr= 9. 3 – 17. 1), but the larger range and the vertical decrease of values through the latter profile support the distinction in the upper and lower horizons. As these latter horizons display close δ 87 Sr to the values of the <b>P</b> <b>soil,</b> the common origin of these sediments is confirmed. The overlapping ranges of εNd of the insoluble residue from both the soils (from − 8. 4 to − 6. 85 and from − 7. 8 to − 7, respectively) suggest that Nd is also derived from crust silicates. The range of δ 87 Sr of the NH 4 -acetate extracts of the <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> (from− 0. 8 to− 0. 41) is close to the corresponding range of the lower horizons (from− 0. 31 to− 0. 27) of the F soil suggest Sr origin fromLate Cenozoic carbonates. In contrast, the higher δ 87 Sr (from 0. 09 to 0. 25) of the upper horizons of the F soil, suggest some input of radiogenic Sr from crust silicates. The ranges of δ 87 Sr of the HCl extracts of the two soils largely overlap (the <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> from − 0. 9 to 0. 3, the F soil from− 0. 72 to− 0. 34), suggesting a broadly common source, likely dolomite and phosphates of the Late Cenozoic. The narrow and overlapping ranges of εNd of the HCl extracts from the two soils (the <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> from− 8. 9 to − 7. 1, the F soil from − 8. 1 to − 7. 8) indicate that labile Nd is also provided by the same source, likely marine phosphates.

40|$|The {{vesicular}} arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi are root symbionts {{associated with}} many vesicular plant species. The contribution of VAM fungi on uptake of herbicides by plant root systems and degradation of herbicides in the rhizosphere {{and the consequent}} effects on herbicide tolerance by crop plants were investigated. The results of the different studies conducted on herbicide uptake have demonstrated that colonization of corn and soybean by the VAM fungus, Glomus epigaeus enhanced the efficiency of root uptake of atrazine and trifluralin. The hyphae of G. epigaeus were able to absorb 14 C-atrazine from soil and translocate to corn plants. Experiments conducted {{on the effect of}} mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal rhizosphere on atrazine degradation in soil showed that degradation of atrazine in soil was not affected by corn and G. epigaeus.

The amount of P, to 50 cm soil depth, in soil labile, organic, occluded, and secondary pools is 3. 6 ± 3, 8. 6 ± 6, 12. 2 ± 8, and 3. 2 ± 2 Pg P (Petagrams of P, 1 Pg = 1 × 10 15 g) respectively. The amount in soil mineral particles to the same depth is estimated at 13. 0 ± 8 Pg P for a global soil total of 40. 6 ± 18 Pg P. The large uncertainty in our estimates reflects our limited understanding of the processes controlling <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> transformations during pedogenesis and a deficiency in the number of <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> measurements. In spite of the large uncertainty, the estimated global spatial variation and distribution of different <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> forms presented in this study will be useful for global biogeochemistry models that include P as a limiting element in biological production by providing initial estimates of the available <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> for plant uptake and microbial utilization...|$|R

For the Np soil sample, 70 sequences were analyzed and only two protein groups could be defined and confirmed. Rarefaction analysis performed for the SDIMO gene library from both samples yielded plateau-shaped curves, indicating that the saturation of the gene diversity in the environment was complete and the sampling effort was satisfactory, in particular for the Np soil sample (Figure 7 C).|$|E

30|$|The low C, N, and P {{contents}} in {{the organic}} layer in the 8 yr old stands {{suggest that the}} high-severity fire eliminated most of the organic layer mass, and that its accumulation is slower {{in the first years}} following the disturbance. Several studies have reported that organic layer combustion during high-severity fires causes substantial losses of C, N, and <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> contents (for instance, see Baird et al. 1999, Murphy et al. 2006, Neary and Overby 2006). While our study did not evaluate the organic layer loss during fire events, preliminary observations indicate that high-severity fires in LJRS have drastic effects on the organic layer mass, reducing it by 80 % to 100 % (E.J. Jardel, Universidad de Guadalajara, Autlán de Navarro, Mexico, unpublished data).|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were: (1) to evaluate the influence of three initial P levels created artificially and of four annual P applications on the yields and P content of the corn-soybean rotation, (2) to measure {{the evolution of the}} available <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> content {{as a consequence of the}} initial P levels and annual P applications, and (3) to assess in economic terms the influence of the initial P levels and annual P applications on corn and soybean yields and on the <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> content;Experimental data used in this study came from a field experiment conducted in central Iowa during the period 1974 - 1982. In the spring of 1974, applications of 0, 147, and 294 kg P per ha were applied to the whole plots to create three initial levels of <b>soil</b> <b>P.</b> After the first year, annual applications of 0, 11, 22, and 33 kg per ha were applied to split plots. Corn and soybeans were grown each year in rotation;The initial P levels and annual P applications did not consistently affect crop yields, but year-to-year variability in yield resulted from differences in moisture stress. Phosphorus content in corn leaves, P content in the grain, P removed by the grain, and available <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> were affected positively by <b>P</b> applications;Available <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> generally decreased over time. The rate of decrease was increased by an increase in the level of P initially applied, decreased by the rate of annual P application, and decreased over years;Because the treatments had inconsistent effects on yields, it was impossible to obtain a good economic analysis. To maintain a desired <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> level, the annual application of P had to increase as the desired available <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> level increased and/or the initial P application decreased. An inexpensive way to obtain any level of available <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> was to apply enough P to raise the <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> level and then maintain that level by annual P applications...|$|R
40|$|The Netherlands {{has a high}} {{cumulative}} mean phosphorus (P) balance. In the 20 th century, cumulative mean P surpluses were ca. 4500 kg P 2 O 5 /ha. The annual surpluses have levelled {{off because}} of manure application limits from 1984 onwards. We report the effect of soil type, land use, and manure policy on changes in <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> of fields in the Netherlands during the 20 th century. We used data (> 5 million <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> tests) from the soil analysis laboratory BLGG AgroXpertus. Our results show that <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> has increased on average to fairly high and high ratings. Differences between regions and between land use have remained high from the first records in the 1930 s; on arable land the increase continued {{until the end of}} our study period while on grassland no changes are evident in the last decades. In general regions with high livestock density have high <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> status. <b>Soil</b> <b>P</b> increased in the order bulbfields <grassland <arable land <maize land <horticulture, and in the order loess <clay <peat <sand soils. Spatial variations in P values reflect more the market value of the crops and regional availability of animal manure than (fertilizer) recommendations.

The acerola plants were harvested after 120 days of the experiment.

40|$|Site-specific {{forestry}} requires detailed {{characterization of}} the spatial distribution of forest soil properties and the magnitude of harvesting impacts in order to prescribe appropriate management schemes. Furthermore, evaluation {{of the effects of}} timber harvesting on soil properties conducted on a landscape scale improves the interpretive value of soil survey data. Questions exist regarding the extent and spatial distribution of the effects of timber harvesting on eroded soils of the Alabama Piedmont. We evaluated the impacts of clear-cut harvesting on the temporal and spatial variability of bulk density (<b>p,),</b> <b>soil</b> strength, and water content (0,) at three sites in the Alabama Piedmont where timber was predominantly mature plantation stands of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Preharvest spatial variability of texture, surface horizon thickness, and soil organic carbon (SOC) within single soi: mapping delineations was also evaluated. Soils were moderately to severely eroded aud classified in fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic and Rhcdic Kanhapludult and Kandiudult families. Although significant increases (P < 0. 05) in p,, were observed after timber harvesting for some of the trafficking class-depth interval ccmbinations at all sites, the largest increases were observed at the moderately eroded site. Harvesting timber increased soil strength by 25. 1 % on the moderately eroded site, with increases occurring to a 40 -cm depth in skid trails. Results suggested the degree of harvesting impacts were erosion phase dependent, with greater impacts on moderately versus severely eroded soils. Geostatistical analyses indicated that pre-harvest % clay and surface thickness were more highly spatially correlated than preharvest SOC, which may be related to erosion processes. Analyses also suggested harvesting slightly increased the overall spatial variablity of <b>p,.,,</b> <b>soil</b> strength, and 0,. These results suggest that the establishment of site-specific forest tillage zones to ameliorate compaction may be impractical to implement because of the increases in spatial variability of these properties...|$|E
30|$|The {{calculation}} of the Shannon index reinforced the observation that the <b>P</b> <b>soil</b> sample harbors a highly diverse bacterial community. Shannon values {{found in the literature}} for bacterial communities ranged from 2.96 to 3.83 in libraries from water column [Dimitriu et al. 2008]; 2.7 to 3.5 in coral samples [Bourne et al. 2008], 3.6 to 4.0 for refinery WWTP sludge [Silva et al. 2010] and a diversity index of 2.9 was obtained for a petroliferous reservoir sample [Li et al. 2007]. According to ecological theories more diverse communities may offer a more significant contribution to the ecosystem functions, keeping in mind that ecological studies on soil microbial communities have revealed that this type of habitat generally presents extreme diversity, with species richness estimates ranging from values of 2000 to 52000 [Youssef & Elshahed. 2009].|$|E
30|$|The {{adsorption}} and precipitation of <b>P</b> in <b>soil</b> {{are directly}} linked to the texture and soil pH (Lee and Oa 2013) and especially the levels of Fe and Al (Pinto 2012). The results of amorphous Fe and Al, extracted with ammonium oxalate, increased with depth (Table  3) and are positively correlated with clay content (r 2  =  0.90 and 0.96, respectively). Kang et al. (2011) using a sandy soil (Feox =  0.20; Alox =  0.29; and clay =  21  mg g− 1), {{similar to the one}} in our study, found adsorption of <b>P</b> in the <b>soil,</b> especially when observing the data from the treatment with the inorganic fertilizer. Tarkalson and Leytem (2009) also noted adsorption of <b>P</b> in a <b>soil</b> with clay content of 62  mg g− 1. Therefore, the movement of <b>P</b> in <b>soil</b> profile may be reduced by small amounts of clay and/or Fe and Al oxides (Sims et al. 1998).|$|R
40|$|Due {{to the low}} <b>P</b> {{nature of}} <b>soils</b> within the fynbos biome of the Cape Floristic Region, plants have {{developed}} numerous mechanisms which enable them to better acquire phosphorous. A number of species {{have been reported to}} have specialised root morphologies (root clusters, mycorrhizae) that enhance P uptake. Plants may also down-regulate the uptake of P by decreasing the expression of genes that encode P transporters. Two Fabaceae species, Podalyria calyptrata and Aspa/athus linearis, were grown in hydroponics for 5 months at a low P supply of 4 μM and P-depletion studies were conducted thereafter at 5 levels of external P (4, 10, 20, 50 and lOOμM). Growth rates (biomass accumulation) were also calculated as were root to shoot ratios for both species. A. linearis had a higher uptake rate than P. calyptrata. While the fresh biomass growth rate was similar in both species, P. calyptrata had a higher dry weight root to shoot ratio than A. linearis. The results showed that both species exhibited a lack of response to increasing P concentrations and had similar RGRs. Their uptake rates differed significantly (p< 0. 05) and this was likely due to their different root:shoot ratios. This indicates that both species would effectively grow in low <b>P</b> <b>soils</b> {{and in the case of}} P. calyptrata, in high <b>P</b> <b>soils</b> as well...|$|R
40|$|Scant {{information}} is available on how <b>soil</b> phosphorus (<b>P)</b> availability responds to atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, especially in the tropical zones. This study examined the effect of N addition on <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> availability, and compared this effect between forest sites of contrasting land-use history. Effects of N addition on soil properties, litterfall production, P release from decomposing litter, and <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> availability were studied in a disturbed (reforested pine forest with previous understory vegetation and litter harvesting) and a rehabilitated (reforested mixed pine/broadleaf forest with no understory vegetation and litter harvesting) tropical forest in southern China. Experimental N-treatments (above ambient) were the following: Control (no N addition), N 50 (50 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1), and N 100 (100 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1). Results indicated that N addition significantly decreased <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> availability in the disturbed forest. In the rehabilitated forest, however, <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> availability was significantly increased by N addition. Decreases in <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> availability may be correlated with decreases in rates of P release from decomposing litter in the N-treated plots, whereas the increase in <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> availability was correlated {{with an increase in}} litterfall production. Our results suggest that response of <b>soil</b> <b>P</b> availability to N deposition in the reforested tropical forests in southern China may vary greatly with temporal changes in tree species composition and soil nutrient status, caused by different land-use practices...|$|R
