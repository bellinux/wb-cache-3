Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk <b>past</b> <b>me</b> and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E

"Right Round" [...] {{was written}} by Flo Rida, Dr. Luke, Kool Kojak, DJ Frank E, Philip Lawrence, Bruno Mars, Aaron Bay-Schuck, and Dead or Alive, the band whose 1984 song, [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" [...] is sampled in the chorus. The track was {{produced}} by Dr. Luke and Kool Kojak and features guest vocals from American pop singer Kesha, (who was not credited on the American release of the single). At the end of 2008, Luke {{was working on a}} track with Flo Rida called [...] "Right Round" [...] and the two decided they needed a female hook. Luke pulled Kesha into the studio to record the vocals. According to Flo Rida, the song is about [...] "a young lady, she might be in the strip club and she's got my head spinning round, [...] Or any young lady that I might see walking <b>past</b> <b>me</b> that's getting my attention. She got it going on! I'm going crazy over her." ...|$|E

The following morning, Friday, October 13th, Stevens said the incident occurred in 1991, stating on her Facebook account “I was only 22 years old. Oliver walked <b>past</b> <b>me</b> and grabbed my boob as he waltzed out the front door of a party.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Faldo had a {{reputation}} for being an insular character who did not engage in any of the usual social courtesies. He generally kept other players at arm's length. Faldo was described as having [...] "an intense focus that peers found less than endearing." [...] In 2002, Faldo's former Ryder Cup colleague Sandy Lyle said: [...] "I've never known Nick.

2500|$|Ladies of the Canyon was {{an instant}} smash on FM radio and sold briskly, {{eventually}} becoming Mitchell's first gold album (selling over a half million copies). She {{made a decision to}} stop touring for a year and just write and paint, yet she was still voted [...] "Top Female Performer" [...] for 1970 by Melody Maker, a leading UK pop music magazine. On the April 1971 release of James Taylor's Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon album, Mitchell is credited with backup vocals – along with Carole King – on the track [...] "You've Got a Friend". The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience appeared on her next album, Blue, released in June 1971. Comparing Joni Mitchell's talent to his own, David Crosby said, [...] "By the time she did Blue, she was <b>past</b> <b>me</b> and rushing toward the horizon".|$|E

2500|$|As {{a revolutionary}} peasant leader Makhno {{has been called}} a [...] "colourful personality" [...] and his career [...] "legendary". [...] However, the German and Mennonite {{communities}} in Ukraine considered him to be an instigator of paramilitary banditry against innocent farmers, and an [...] "inhuman monster whose path is literally drenched with blood." [...] He is consistently referred to as a terrorist or bandit in Mennonite literature. At the age of 11 Makhno began working as an ox driver on the Janzen estate in Silberfeld. Here he began to develop a hatred for the ruling classes. In his memoirs he writes: [...] "At this time I began to experience anger, envy and even hatred towards the landowner [...] and especially towards his children – those young slackers who often strolled <b>past</b> <b>me</b> sleek and healthy, well-dressed, well-groomed and scented; while I was filthy, dressed in rags, barefoot, and reeked of manure from cleaning the calves' barn." [...] Makhno also worked at the Mennonite owned Kroeger plant in Gulyai-Polye.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking <b>past</b> <b>me,</b> as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
