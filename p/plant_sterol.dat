40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols {{are added}} to foods such as margarine, milk and bread, because of their {{cholesterol-lowering}} effect. Most foods with such additives are novel foods which must accordingly be assessed and approved {{in terms of their}} potential health risks. <b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> are found in low quantities in all fatty plant-based foods such as oils, nuts, seeds and cereals. For humans, they are not essential and are hardly used in the human metabolism. Plant stanols are hydrolysed <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> which are not naturally present in plant-based foods. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) below assesses a study from the Netherlands which provides valuable information on the unwanted effects of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> on human retinal microvessels.

The findings of the study indicate that intake of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> may entail cardiovascular risks for healthy persons who consume foods containing <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in relatively large quantities and {{over a long period of}} time. Due to the amount of data available, the extent of this potential risk cannot currently be quantified. The BfR has already pointed out in earlier opinions that foods to which <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> or stanols are added are largely consumed by persons who do not have increased cholesterol levels as well as by children. The European Food Safety Agency currently recommends that daily consumption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols be limited to three grams.

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>sterols,</b> or phytosterols, {{are very}} similar in {{structure}} to cholesterol and are abundant in typical diets. The reason for poor absorption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> by the body is still unknown. Mutations in the ABC transporters G 5 and G 8 are known to cause an accumulation of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in blood and tissues (sitosterolemia). To determine the significance of phytosterol exclusion from the body, we fed wild-type and ABCG 5 /G 8 knockout mice a diet enriched with <b>plant</b> <b>sterols.</b> The high-phytosterol diet was extremely toxic to the ABCG 5 /G 8 knockout mice but had no adverse effects on wild-type mice. ABCG 5 /G 8 knockout mice died prematurely and developed a phenotype that included high levels of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in many tissues, liver abnormalities, and severe cardiac lesions.

40|$|The ABC {{transporters}} ABCG 5 and ABCG 8 limit absorption {{and promote}} excretion of dietary <b>plant</b> <b>sterols.</b> It {{is not known}} why <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> are so assiduously excluded from the body. Here we show that accumulation of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in mice lacking ABCG 5 and ABCG 8 (G 5 G 8 –/– mice) profoundly perturbs cholesterol homeostasis in the adrenal gland. The adrenal glands of the G 5 G 8 –/– mice were grossly abnormal in appearance (brown, not white) due to a 91 % reduction in cholesterol content. Despite the very low cholesterol levels, there was no compensatory increase in cholesterol synthesis or in lipoprotein receptor expression. Moreover, levels of ABCA 1, which mediates sterol efflux, were increased 10 -fold in the G 5 G 8 –/– adrenals. Adrenal cholesterol levels returned to near-normal levels in mice treated with ezetimibe, which blocks phytosterol absorption.

40|$|Background: Risk {{factors of}} {{cardiovascular}} disease such as lipid aberrations, hypertension, abdominal adiposity and elevations in systemic inflammation, are prominent aetiologies in hyperlipidemia. Supplementation with n- 3 PUFA {{is associated with a}} reduction in cardiovascular events through its hypotriglyceridemic, anti-aggregatory and anti-inflammatory properties. <b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> have potent hypocholesterolemic properties, although their effect on the inflammatory cascade is uncertain. This study investigated the effect of combined supplementation with n- 3 PUFA and <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> on cardiovascular risk factors, blood pressure, body composition, markers of systemic inflammation and overall risk, in hyperlipidemic individuals. Methods: The study was a 3 -week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial design, in four parallel groups. Sixty hyperlipidemic participants were randomised to recieve either sunola oil or 1. 4 g/d n- 3 PUFA capsules with or without 2 g <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> per day. Results: The combination of n- 3 PUFA and <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> reduced several inflammatory markers. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was reduced by 39 % (P = 0. 009), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by 10 % (P = 0. 02), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) by 10. 7 % (P = 0. 009), leukotriene B₄ (LTB₄) by 29. 5 % (P = 0. 01) and adiponectin was increased by 29. 5 % (P = 0. 05).
