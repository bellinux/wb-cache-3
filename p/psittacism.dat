Ben Stoltzfus wrote in The French Review:Thus, Loulou is a parrot, {{and at the same time}} a symbol of <b>psittacism,</b> thatmalady of so many of Flaubert's characters who either parrot banalitieswithout thought or meaning, or are the victims of this <b>psittacism.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The book is {{the story}} of the efforts of a French Sergeant, Henri Pollak, and his friends to rescue a fellow soldier from being sent {{overseas}} to fight in the Algerian War of Independence. It is written in a rambunctiously comic style, with an exaggerated use of rhetorical devices and a mix of registers, a style inspired by Raymond Queneau and popularized in Zazie in the Metro, and by rhetoric lessons Perec was taking from Roland Barthes. Common rules of grammar and spelling are frequently broken, and even basic conventions such as the consistency of character's names are flouted for humorous effect. The book includes an index of [...] "ornamentations and flowers of rhetoric" [...] used in the text, from abstract (pg 20) to <b>psittacism</b> ("assuredly"), and including anadiplosis, epistrophe, and metalepsis. Many of the characters and scenes, including the moped-riding protagonist, were based on real-life friends of Perec.|$|E

To do so, a Gramsci’s newspaper article published in 1915; some notes from the Prison Notebooks; and a letter to his brother Carlo, written in 1930, are used as references. It is intended to demonstrate that the author argues in favour of a friendly relationship between teacher and student, which would exclude pedagogic spontaneity as much as authoritarianism, <b>psittacism</b> and dilettantism. In short, to Gramsci, the nature of the teacher-student relationship is dialectic, in such a way that “every teacher is always a student and every student is a teacher” (Gramsci, 2001, p. 399). This conception is articulated with the author’s ideas on the relationship between intellectuals and the masses and about the question of hegemony...|$|E

Founded upon a notion of the symbolic derived {{from the work of}} Lévy-Strauss, the theoretical key to this perspective is the equivocal notion of « Law ». In the terms of the Lacanian doctrine, « Law » functions as the necessary precondition for the existence and intelligibility of effective social rules and regulations which are inevitably perceived in terms of a metonymy. The normative consequences and deformations occasioned by this conceptual strategy mystify the historical processes productive of social forms.
