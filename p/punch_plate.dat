40|$|Purpose: The present paper {{describes}} a knowledge-based system (KBS) developed for selection of progressivedie components to automate {{the design process}} of progressive dies in stamping industries. Design/methodology/approach: The production rule based KBS approach of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hasbeen utilized for constructing the proposed system. The system has been structured into seven KBS modules. Modules are user interactive and designed to be loaded in to the prompt area of AutoCAD. Findings: The output of system modules includes the type and proper dimensions of progressive die componentsnamely die block, die gages (front spacer and back gage), stripper, punches, <b>punch</b> <b>plate,</b> back plate, die-set andfasteners. The system has been designed {{in such a way}} that the expert advices imparted by its modules areautomatically stored in different output data files. These data files can be further utilized for automatic modelingof die components and die assembly. Research limitations/implications: Although the system is limited to the design of progressive dies only, yet itcan be extended further for the design of other types of dies also. Practical implications: The proposed system is ready for use in sheet metal industries for quick selection ofprogressive die components. The system can be implemented on a PC having AutoCAD software and thereforeits low cost of implementation makes it affordable by small and medium sized stamping industries. Originality/value: The proposed system is capable of accomplishing the time-consuming task of selection ofprogressive die components in a very short time period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Die itself needs a {{well-defined}} process while being {{transformed from a}} stock of material or while it is being assembled {{with the help of}} standard components. The varied elements of a die ranging from the standard Die set, the dieblock, the <b>punch</b> <b>plate</b> with the punch holder, compression springs and the other elements necessary for assembling the die calls for a make-or-buy decision. While standard parts are preferred to be bought out, the components to be manufactured in-house necessitates an elaborate `Process Plan ’ for yielding the most economic die with the prescribed specs for quality Sheet-metal die is an inseparable constituent of the development process of any given automotive or consumer appliance. In most of the cases, this accounts for a high proportion in the tooling needs of the large size and structural member in any automotive like the chassis and the BIW. Many other brackets and gussets along with peripheral clips etc are invariably made of Sheet-metal due to the strength characteristics complimented by this material and the process of stamping. Process planning is responsible for the conversion of design data to work instructions through the specification of the process parameters to be used as well as those machines capable of performing these processes in order to convert the piece part from its initial state to final form. The output of the planning includes the specification of machine and tooling to be used, the sequence of operations, machining parameters, and time estimates. Doing all this with computer-aided assistance is called computer-aided process planning (CAPP). CAPP uses computer software to determine how a part is t...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to design a tool for moderate cross section reduction of bars that are deformed within a channel slider tool that is used for equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE). The bars that are deformed via ECAE have an initial square cross section with a nominal value of 1. 00 in 2 and aspect ratios (length/width) ranging between 4 and 6. A systems engineering design methodology is used to generate a topbottom approach {{in the development of}} the tool's design. This includes defining a need statement, which is the "Need for an area reduction extrusion tool to replace the current practices of machining ECAE processed billets". The system functions and requirements are defined next and used to generate three concepts that are compared to select the winning concept for further refinement. Major components of the selected tool are: a container, ram, base plate, <b>punch</b> <b>plate,</b> four die-inserts, four wedges and four flange locks. For materials, such as copper (C 10100) and aluminum (Al 6061 -T 6), that can be processed by this tool, the upper bound extrusion pressure, which is derived by limit analysis, is set at 192 ksi. The upper bound extrusion pressure is constrained by the buckling limit of the ram, which is 202 ksi. The maximum wall stress experienced by the container is 113 ksi. For materials with the same cross section and dimensions, fixed end conditions of the Ram support larger bucking loads when compared to other end conditions such as rounded ends or rounded-fixed ends. With the application of the upper bound method, an increase in the extrusion ratio of the tool causes a corresponding rise in the optimal cone angle of the die further translating to a rise in the extrusion pressure...|$|E

40|$|A new shear {{connection}} {{system was}} tested {{in order to}} be used in off-site manufactured cassette floor elements made with glulam beams and Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) panels. The shear connection proposed is made with double-sided <b>punched</b> metal <b>plate</b> fasteners, connecting CLT and glulam members to form a T-cross-section. Due to the lack of withdrawal capacity of <b>punched</b> metal <b>plate</b> fasteners, the shear connection must be secured with screws to resist separations forces which may occur between the members in the floor element. Shear tests were performed on glulam-CLT joints made with double-sided <b>punched</b> metal <b>plate</b> fasteners and with inclined self-tapping screws as reference cases to compare to joints with both fastener types combined. Each fastener type is characterised by a specific load-slip curve and different values for the yield slip, slip at maximum load and failure slip. These parameters can be used to evaluate the compatibility of the different fasteners and their combined effect in a joint. The test results show that there is a significant contribution from both the double-sided <b>punched</b> metal <b>plate</b> and inclined screw fasteners to the strength and stiffness of the combined joints. Due {{to the fact that the}} individual fasteners reach their maximum load for different slip values, the load-carrying capacity of joints with combined fasteners is somewhat lower than the sum of the individual fasteners load-carrying capacities. The slip modulus of the combined fasteners may be estimated as the sum of the respective slip modulus of each fastener due to the compatible behaviour of the fasteners in the serviceability limit state.

40|$|Timber {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{building}} materials of today, both in Sweden and in Europe, its uses range from single-family homes to apartment buildings and large arenas. The key reasons why timber construction continues to grow is the environmental aspects combined with the economically advantageous industrialised prefabrication process. One of the most commonly used connections in timber structures is the <b>punched</b> metal <b>plate</b> fastener, which {{is a perfect example of}} an effective connection that only can be used in a prefabrication process. It can be found in almost all kinds of buildings; from a rafter connection in small to middle sized houses up to reinforcement in heavier connections in arenas and warehouses. It is well known that the connections are the most critical parts of a structure and it is therefore crucial that these are designed for all eventualities. This project is a pilot study that seeks to evaluate the existing design methods for <b>punched</b> metal <b>plate</b> fasteners subjected to fire in Eurocode and in practice. The first conclusion is that such a method hardly exists, neither in codes nor in scientific theory, despite the fact that this is and has for decades been a very common structural detail. The theoretical analysis shows that it is very unlikely that a joint made with <b>punched</b> metal <b>plate</b> fasteners can withstand a standard fire scenario for even 15 minutes and the small-scale testing confirms this. But the project also shows that it is possible to protect the <b>punched</b> metal <b>plate</b> fasteners from fire and that it is possible to achieve up to 30 minutes resistance by installing gypsum fireboards, stone wool wood covering.

There was a large amount of downtime associated with the printer. The scheduled downtime was the main cause, however the interest was in reducing the unscheduled downtime. The main causes of the unscheduled downtime were materials, unscheduled maintenance and not staffed. The problem associated with materials was not having mylar to run the printer. The unscheduled maintenance was mainly due to problems with the <b>punches,</b> <b>plates,</b> blankets and knives. Finally, there were occurrences in which the machine was not staffed due to operator absenteeism or the operator helping on another machine.

40|$|Fluidized bed dryers (FBDs) {{are used}} in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry to remove excess moisture from granule prior to tablet formation. As granule moisture content is reduced from its initial to final state, the velocity required to fully fluidize the granule decreases and the bed voidage decreases. The change in these fluidization properties are attributed to the decrease in the interparticle force load created by a reduction in liquid bridging as moisture is removed. During constant velocity drying, these fluidization properties result in a bubbling fluidization state, which evolves into a bubble coalescing regime as drying proceeds. This behaviour was identifiable using pressure fluctuation time-series analysis techniques. Distributor design studies using dry and wet granule in a conical fluidized bed suggest that the <b>punched</b> <b>plate</b> design limits bubble coalescence when compared to the perforated plate and Dutch weave mesh designs. Furthermore, the Dutch weave results in extensive segregation, which is undesirable from a fluidization perspective. Local drying hydrodynamic measurements using x-ray densitometry found that the <b>punched</b> and perforated <b>plates</b> generate a centralized bubbling core region during drying with a defluidized bed periphery. This fluidized core region grows as drying proceeds until the defluidized region disappears. Under the same operating conditions, a porous plate distributor creates extensive channelling and defluidization across the entire bed cross-section during the constant rate period of drying. These poor fluidization characteristics are a result of the porous plate introducing the gas into the bed as a fine dispersion. Lastly, the hydrodynamics associated with the conical vessel geometry improves the circulation and mixing patterns in fluidized bed dryers. This is especially the case in the entry region of the conical bed where the high inlet gas velocity prevents defluidization around the periphery of the bed. The straight walled geometry of the cylindrical bed resulted in defluidization in this area. As a result, the hydrodynamics associated with bubbling differ significantly between the geometries over the course of drying...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A high {{resolution}} Digital Elevation Model (DEM) {{is used to}} simulate and quantify the consequence of lithospheric-plate confrontation. The algorithm {{takes into account the}} calculated mountainous chain and the reconstitutions of the original formation steps. The procedure consists in applying to the DEM a mask composed of two different limits, namely i) a fixed and ii) a moving limit (see figure). The moving limit is displaced in an iterative way, until reaching the initial position of the <b>punching</b> <b>plate.</b> The extrapolation of the altitude values on a given transect takes into account i) the initial distance Din between the limits before moving, ii) the distance Dout between the fixed limit and the new position of the moving limit, and iii) the original altitude of the points encountered in the transect. On the other hand, two regions are located outside of the mask. The region located upstream on the transect remains unchanged, as the downstream region is moved according the moving limit motion, but without any modification of their altitude values. The DEM can be rotated {{in such a way that}} transects follow the columns, from the fixed to the moving limit. For this case, the algorithm inside the mask can be simplified, where i is the unique variable employed.

40|$|The Pennsylvania Dutch Kirchenleute (Lutheran and Reformed "Church People"), {{who spoke}} a dialect of German ("Pennsylvania Dutch"), were the largest ethnic group in early America {{outside of the}} English-speaking population. Like all ethnic minorities, they went {{through a process of}} change in {{relationship}} to the dominant English-speaking society in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This sequential process (i. e., full ethnic retention, adaptation, acculturation, and amalgamation) is reflected in the Pennsylvania Dutch tune and chorale books that supported various stages of this evolution, depending on location and editor. Details of each music publication between the 1790 s and 1850 contributed to this change linguistically, theologically, and musicologically through their content and appearance. Books that supported and promoted full ethnic retention retained the German language entirely, had a simple preface outlining the purpose of the book, employed a pure European repertoire, utilized unrealized figured bass or a harmonization on three staves, were printed from engraved or <b>punched</b> <b>plates,</b> and sought to retain German theology from the Reformation era. Some later examples of retention were not produced for ethnic reasons, but for theological reasons that resulted in the retention of traits of European chorale books. Tune books participating in ethnic change moved away from the use of the German language and European repertoire. They employed singing-school introductions and were resultant of the type-set printing process. Assimilating publications embraced revivalist theology and a type of consumerism that made the books and their users look more like their English-language equivalents than their European predecessors. All the while, Pennsylvania Dutch culture and all of its peculiarities were disappearing.
