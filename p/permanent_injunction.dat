25|$|The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) {{had asked}} on September 17, 2012 the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{to place an}} {{emergency}} stay on the <b>permanent</b> <b>injunction</b> made by Judge Forrest on September 12, 2012 The Justice Department wanted the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals to put the judge's ruling on hold while they challenge her decision on appeal. This request by the DOJ was granted on September 17, 2012 when a single federal appeals court judge put a temporary hold on the district court judge's <b>permanent</b> <b>injunction</b> ruling made by judge Katherine Forrest on September 12, 2012. U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier issued a one-page order by which he granted the Justice Department's request for an interim stay of the <b>permanent</b> <b>injunction</b> in Hedges, pending the Second Circuit's consideration of the government's motion to stay the injunction throughout its appeal. Judge Lohier's order further said that a Second Circuit motions panel will take up the government's motion for stay pending appeal on September 28, 2012. Lohier offered no explanation or rationale for the interim stay. The Lohier order basically a.) temporarily stayed Judge Forrest's 2012-09-12 ruling b.) puts the whole matter i.e. the <b>permanent</b> <b>injunction</b> on hold c.) allows enforcement of the blocked NDAA section pending appeal and d.) means that the interim stay will remain in effect until at least September 28, 2012 when a three judge panel of the Second Circuit {{is expected to begin}} addressing the issue of a longer-term stay(The September 28, 2012 hearing won't go over the merits of the case, but only deal with the U.S. government's motion to stay the <b>permanent</b> <b>injunction</b> throughout its appeal of the <b>permanent</b> <b>injunction.).</b> The appeal of the <b>permanent</b> <b>injunction</b> date is not yet set.|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Courts {{decision}} in eBay v. MercExchange changed {{the playing field}} for patentees seeking <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions</b> against infringers, rejecting the Federal Circuits longstanding position that <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions</b> should be granted absent exceptional circumstances, and requiring instead that courts apply traditional principles of equity. This commentary, written by law professor Mary LaFrance, examines how this decision has affected the federal courts willingness to grant <b>permanent</b> and preliminary <b>injunctions</b> in patent, copyright, and trademark cases...|$|R

5000|$|... eBay {{approached}} MercExchange {{to purchase}} the Woolston patents. Negotiations broke down when Woolston discovered that eBay was already infringing the patents. He sued eBay for patent infringement. The patents {{were found to be}} valid and willfully infringed. Damages to MercExchange by eBay's infringement were initially assessed at $35 million (later reduced to $25 million). However, the case also resulted in the clarification of the rules regarding the application of <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions</b> in patent infringement cases. As a result, it is now much more difficult for non-practicing entities to obtain <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: As {{domestic}} violence becomes increasingly recognized a widespread social problem, judicial system has begun playing larger roles in providing legal protection to these victims. One {{way they are}} doing this in the Iran is {{through the use of}} protective restraining orders or injunctions. The purpose of this research was to determine if <b>permanent</b> <b>Injunctions</b> for Protection provide victims of Domestic Violence with a sense of security in alleviating fear of retaliation or on-going violence. Methods: A total of 196 <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions</b> for protection against {{domestic violence}} were obtained by victims residing within the City of Kermanshah.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the preliminary injunction standard in pharmaceutical patent infringement actions {{pursuant to the}} Hatch-Waxman Act. Prior to Supreme Court’s decision in eBay v.

While the eBay Court abrogated the presumption of irreparable harm in <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions,</b> courts have been unclear as to application of eBay on preliminary in-junctions. This Article will further examine preliminary injunctions in Hatch-Waxman actions in the District of New Jersey since eBay in 2006 and argue that courts still tacitly apply the irreparable harm presumption...|$|R

The second step was to compare the modified products to the patent claims to determine if the modified product infringes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998 Mavrodi created Stock Generation, {{allegedly}} {{a classic}} pyramid scheme {{presented as a}} [...] "virtual stock market game". The website ran from 1998 to early 2000.

5000|$|Both {{temporary}} and <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions</b> {{are available to}} prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright. An [...] "injunction" [...] is a court order directing the defendant to stop doing something (e.g., stop selling infringing copies). One form of equitable relief that is available in copyright cases is a seizure order. At {{any time during the}} lawsuit, the court may order the impoundment of any and all copies of the infringing products. The seizure order may include materials used to produce such copies, such as master tapes, film negatives, printing plates, etc. Items that are impounded {{during the course of the}} lawsuit can, if the plaintiff wins, be ordered destroyed as part of the final decree.|$|R
40|$|While countless studies {{demonstrate}} {{the complex and}} dangerous nature of intimate partner abuse, most jurisdictions permit only the entry of yearlong domestic violence protection orders. Judges may assume that danger ceases once the order takes effect, but evidence of the recurrent nature of violence demonstrates the importance of providing judicial protection over time. The brevity of domestic violence protection orders stands {{in stark contrast to}} the long duration of orders in other areas of the law, such as intellectual property, corporations, real property, and tax, where courts routinely enter <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions</b> to protect individuals and businesses against “irreparable harm. ” What explains this differential treatment? Why would the law deny courts the ability to protect those who experience physical and psychological harm at the hands of an intimate partner? This Article is the first scholarship to identify and attempt to explain the dichotomy between injunctive relief for domestic violence and other areas of the law and to explore the potential for indefinite domestic violence injunctions in normative depth. To establish the generally temporary nature of domestic violence protection orders, the Article reports the results of a fifty-state survey on protection order lengths and extension standards, a survey undertaken for this piece. To explain the differential treatment of domestic violence injunctions, the Article situates its analysis in the historic backdrop of the state condoning domestic violence through the husband’s right of chastisement and the family privacy theory, ideologies now considered untenable. Recent decades have seen the ensuing struggle to develop the civil protection order remedy in a continuing climate of family law exceptionalism. In conducting a comparative analysis among areas of the law in which <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions</b> are commonplace, the Article applies to domestic violence cases the equitable principles for <b>permanent</b> <b>injunctions</b> that the Supreme Court recently announced as a four-factor test in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C. The Article addresses potential due process concerns and draws heavily on social science to {{demonstrate the}} harm of domestic violence, physical and psychological dangers of returning to court, risk of reengaging with an abusive partner year after year, efficacy of protection orders, and inadequacy of other forms of relief. Abuse survivors come to court seeking protection, but current statutory durations often prove inadequate, and violence survivors merit the same protections readily available to property and business interests. To harmonize domestic violence law with other areas of the law, the Article proposes the nationwide availability of indefinite domestic violence protection orders and a presumption that orders be at least two years in duration...|$|R
