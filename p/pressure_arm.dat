A payload monitor measures and displays payload weight for a bulldozer vehicle by sensing the hydraulic <b>pressure.</b> <b>ARM</b> KL 25 Z {{is used to calculate}} the payload and Graphical LCD is used to display the calculated weight. The hydraulic pressure sensor is used to calculate the weight lifted by the bulldozer. It explores the payload calculation and the calculated value send to the PC or mobile [11] using GSM Module and stored using SD Card. Keywords- Hydraulic Pressure Sensor, GLCD display...|$|E
40|$|Miyamoto et al 1 {{show that}} intravitreal {{triamcinolone}} reduces macular edema {{as early as}} 1 hour after injection. They suggest that the time pattern demands that nongenomic mechanisms must {{be involved in the}} therapeutic effect of triamcinolone on retinal edema. Vasogenic edema in all tissues, including the retina, may be understood in terms of Starling’s law, 2, 3 by which the balance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure differences between vascular and tissue compartments determines the formation or disappearance of edema. Triamcinolone has generally been thought to influence capillary permeability and, thereby, the oncotic pressure gradient between vessel and tissue, and little {{attention has been paid to}} possible hemodynamic effects of the drug. However, Paques et al 4 have recently reported that retinal vessel tortuosity decreases after intravitreal triamcinolone injection. Retinal vessel length, tortuosity, and diameter change together, and a decrease in tortuosity (length) is associated with a reduction in vessel diameter. 4 – 6 The early nongenomic effect that Miyamoto et al predict may well be the hemodynamic effect, by which triamcinolone induces retinal vasoconstriction and thereby reduces the hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries and reduces edema according to the hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>arm</b> of Starling’s law. 2, 3 The genomic effects of the corticosteroid, which decreases the permeability of retinal capillaries, will later affect the oncotic arm of Starling’s law and further reduce edema. 2 Both hydrostatic and oncotic pressure changes need to be considered to understand the mechanism of edema treatment fully...|$|E
40|$|The myogenic response, the {{inherent}} ability {{of blood vessels}} to rapidly respond to changes in transmural pressure, is involved in local blood flow autoregulation. Animal studies suggest that both acute hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia may impair myogenic vasoconstriction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of an oral glucose load on brachial mean blood velocity (MBV) during increases in forearm transmural pressure in humans. Eight healthy men and women (38 ± 5 yr.) underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). MBV (cm/s; Doppler Ultrasound) responses to a rise in forearm transmural <b>pressure</b> (<b>arm</b> tank suction- 50 mmHg) were studied before and every 30 min for 120 min during the OGTT. Prior to the start of OGTT, MBV was lower than baseline values 30 and 60 s after the application of negative pressure. This suggests myogenic constriction was present. During the OGTT, blood glucose rose from 88 ± 2 to 120 ± 6 mg/dl (P<. 05) and insulin rose from 14 ± 1 to 101 ± 32 µU/ml (P< 0. 05). Glucose loading attenuated the reduction in MBV with arm suction (Δ- 0. 73 ±. 14 vs. Δ- 1. 67 ±. 43 cm/s and Δ- 1. 07 ±. 14 vs. Δ- 2. 38 ±. 54 cm/s, respectively during 30 and 60 s of suction post glucose compared to pre glucose values; all P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{objective}} was to quantify bit by bit the arterial hemodynamic response to the successive acceleration induced fluid shifts during re-entry and landing. Method: The astronaut instrumented himself with a flat Doppler probe fixed on the skin, a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>arm</b> cuff, and 3 ECG electrodes. The ICMS (integrated cardiovascular monitoring system, 15 x 15 x 25 cu cm, battery powered) designed to monitor Blood pressure, ECG, cerebral and femoral flows was fixed below the astronaut sit in the middeck. Recordings started 5 minutes before de-orbiting (TIG) and stopped 5 min after wheels stop. Results. During re-entry blood pressure increased by 20 % at TIG, and then by 25 to 30 % during the highest Gz accelerations (approx 1 S g). The cerebral flow remained decreased by 10 to 15 % below inflight value all during the Entry and landing phases. Conversely the femoral flow increased at TIG and entry (+ l 0 to 20 %), recovered at 0. lg, and then decreased in proportion with the Gz acceleration (- 10 % to - 40 % from 0. 5 g to 1. 5 g). The reduction in Femoral flow was associated with an opposite variation in lower limb vascular resistance. Consequently the cerebral flow/femoral flow ratio decreased at TIG and entry (- 20 %), and then increased according to the Gz acceleration level (+ l 0 to + 40 % from 0. 5 to 1. 5 g). Conclusion: During orthostatic tests (Stand LBNP tests) the cerebral to femoral flow ratio allowed to quantify {{the efficiency of the}} flow redistribution between these 2 areas and predicted orthostatic intolerance. In the present case the astronaut was found orthostatically tolerant at postflight tilt tests, but we suggest that during re-entry this parameter could predict the occurrence of syncope in severely disadapted astronauts...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} explores octopod ecoloy, morphology and evolution. Using {{an artificial}} shelter trap technique (Voight, 1988 a), parameters {{of a wild}} population of Octopus digueti are monitored for one year. Octopus movement correlates with sea temperature but is reduced under full moonlight. Enlarged suckers reliably indicate male maturity in this species. This first definition of an age class in octopuses allows field growth rates to be compared to those from laboratory studies. Octopus digueti growth in the wild equals that in the lab; average life span may be only 6 months during which time individuals may grow from a hatching weight of 40 mg to over 40 g. Individuals show the uniparous life history documented in lab studies. Cohorts appear not due to reproductive synchrony, but to seasonal temperature fluctuations. Genetic differences probably control individual growth rate and life span. To test the reliability of morphology of preserved octopus specimens, ln-transformed measurements are plotted versus ln mantle length. Body measurements are strongly correlated with size; preservation does not therefore eliminate information contained in specimens. Principal component analysis reveals shallow water tropical octopuses vary primarily in arm length, mantle length and sucker diameter. Trans-Atlantic conspecific populations are morphologically indistinguishable. Hypothesized species relationships (Voight, 1988 b) are supported, despite considerable overlap among species. No secondary sexual dimorphism except enlarged suckers is present in these species. Octopuses from rocky habitats have longer arms and smaller mantles than do those from sandy habitats. In the Octopodidae, arm length, head width and sucker diameter contribute most size-free morphological variation. Sucker size correlates inversely with depth due to hydrostatic <b>pressure.</b> <b>Arm</b> length and head width variation correlate inversely with latitudinal distribution, and {{are associated with the}} number of sucker rows. Subfamilies defined by the number of sucker rows (Voss, 1988 a), may represent overtly similar, paraphyletic groups. Cladistic analysis of the suborder Incirrata show that Voss' subfamilies are paraphyletic groups; Robson's (1932) subfamilies are supported. The Argonautida are the most primitive incirrate group, the Ctenoglossa and Octopodidae are sister taxa. The incirrate octopods may have evolved from a deep sea, rather than a shallow-water, ancestor...|$|E

This commentary compares and contrasts these studies with two equally important outcome trials conducted using blood pressure lowering agents. A comparison with MICROHOPE (using ramipril) and ADVANCE (using perindopril + indapamide) blood <b>pressure</b> <b>arms</b> throws up interesting facts. The degree of blood pressure lowering, dissociation between cardiovascular and cerebrovascular benefits, and discordance between renal and retinal outcomes are surprisingly similar in these trials, conducted using disparate molecules. The time taken to achieve such benefits is similar for all drugs except empagliflozin. Such discussion helps inform rational and evidence-based choice of therapy and forms the framework for future research...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} a flame-radiation-powered trigger device to explosively activate suppression barriers to quench gas and coal dust explosions. The major component of the device is a silicon solar panel, which converts radiation from the developing explosion into electrical energy to initiate an electric detonator, which releases an extinguishing agent into the advancing flame front. Solar panels that are rated to produce 20 W of electrical power when exposed to the sunlight are producing about 200 W when exposed to a full-scale dust explosion. The solar panel is electrically isolated from the detonator by a pressure-sensitive switch until {{the arrival of the}} precursor pressure pulse, which always precedes a deflagration. This combination of <b>pressure</b> <b>arming</b> and flame-powered photogenerator prevents false barrier activation and requires no external power supply...|$|R
