Row spacing (60 and 75 cm) was the main plot and plant distance on the row (12, 14, 16, and 18 cm) was the sub-plot. Results revealed that number of seeds per head and 1000 -kernel weight was increased as row spacing increased. But this increase was not significant. Seed yield per plant was significantly increased, as row spacing increased. Seed yield per unit area was significantly decreased as row spacing increased. Increase in row spacing also increased oil percentage. Oil yield per unit area was decreased, as row spacing increased.

40|$|The {{traditional}} transplanted and flooded rice {{cropping system}} {{is threatened by}} water shortage and labor cost increase in many Asian countries and is currently evolving toward direct-seeded and water-saving systems. However, yield penalties generally accompany this evolution and ongoing research targets their mitigation. In a previous research, slower plant development rate was observed in aerobic crops, possibly caused by the increased plant density. This possible factor was tested in experiments conducted at IRRI's farm, Los Baños, Philippines, in 2012 and 2013. One elite variety was direct-seeded at three <b>plant</b> <b>distances</b> (6, 10, and 20 cm × 20 cm) and sprinkler-irrigated to keep the soil water potential above − 10 kPa. Weekly measurements were made to dissect crop and plant physiological differences. Data from previous experiments on tillering in the greenhouse of four varieties and in fields in aerobic and flooded conditions were added to strengthen {{the results from the}} current experiment. The last upper leaves of the main stem appeared faster at higher plant density, thus increase plant density was not the cause for the slower leaf appearance in aerobic than in flooded crops. Plants at higher plant density also had earlier panicle initiation, earlier earing, and 0. 8 leaf less than plants at low density. The number of outgrowing tillers was linked to the number of leaves on the main stem by a variety-specific relationship that is independent from plant density and water management. Tiller density was regulated by the cessation of the outgrowth of tillers triggered by the onset of stem elongation at 20 -cm <b>plant</b> <b>distance</b> and occurred earlier at shorter distances probably in response to the high root density. Grain yields were significantly higher at higher plant density (6 -cm and 10 -cm <b>plant</b> <b>distances)</b> and correlated with a higher tiller density. Thus for aerobic crops, seedling density higher than 50 plants m− 2 remains the way to get high yields for the type of variety used in this study. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The {{experiment was}} {{laid out in a}} 3 x 4 factorial arranged in a Randomised Complete Block Design with four replications and consisted of twelve treatment combinations (3 rates of N-K 2 O and 4 planting distances). The results showed that an increase in N-K 2 O rates significantly increased most growth parameters of the sorghum plants. Whilst an increase in planting distances significantly increased stem and leaf dry weight/plant but decreased Leaf Area Index (LAI). Dry weight/plant of lower dead leaves was not affected by either N-K 2 O rates or planting distances. The highest LAI value only reached 5. An increase in N-K 2 O rates did not affect crop growth rate (CGR), whilst an increase in planting distances significantly decreased CGR. Leaf area duration (D) significantly increased with an increase in N-K 2 O rates. Brix value significantly increased, but only at the highest rate of N-K 2 O. Seed head and seed yield significantly increased with an increase in N-K 2 O rate, but the reverse was found with an increase in planting distances.

However, the results of {{intercropping}} can be pest- and crop-species specific, with varying effects on crop yield, and pest suppression success. In Cameroon, okra vegetable is often grown in intercropped fields and sown with large <b>distances</b> between <b>planting</b> rows (∼ 2 [*]m). Dominant okra pests include cotton aphids, leaf beetles and whiteflies. In a field experiment, we intercropped okra with maize and bean in different combinations (okra monoculture, okra–bean, okra–maize and okra–bean–maize) and altered plant densities (high and low) to test {{for the effects of}} diversity, crop identity and <b>planting</b> <b>distances</b> on okra pests, their predators and yield. RESULTS We found crop identity and plant density, but not crop diversity to influence okra pests, their predators and okra yield. Only leaf beetles decreased okra yield and their abundance reduced at high plant density. Overall, okra grown with bean at high density was the most economically profitable combination. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that when okra is grown at higher densities, legumes (e. g. beans) should be included as an additional crop. Intercropping with a leguminous crop can enhance nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other crops, while also being harvested and sold at market for additional profit.

The implication of the results is that the conventional manual weed control in maize twice before harvest could be reduced to one weeding by intercropping with Canavalia ensiformis and Mucuna pruriens var. cochinchinensis at <b>planting</b> <b>distances</b> of 40 x 40 cm and 60 x 40 cm, respectively. Weeding twice probably provided a more disturbed environment reducing the establishment of the cover crops and increased weed growth...|$|R

The conversion strategies primarily focus on open cycle, closed cycle and hybrid plants. The efficiency studies mainly skew towards the effect of <b>plant</b> <b>distance</b> and thermal gradient towards plant efficiency. The economic analysis {{is based upon the}} effect of per unit cost for OTEC plant together with other important considerations such as Plant Factor (PF) and offshore distance, which determine the cost of power generation. Some illustrative examples are also provided using the derived equations under efficiency and economic studies...|$|R
