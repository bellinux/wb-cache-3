25|$|According to the 11th century hagiography, Vita Sancti Rumwoldi, {{he was the}} {{grandson}} of Penda of Mercia (a pagan, but incorrectly described in Rumwold's hagiography as having converted to Christianity) {{and the son of}} a king of Northumbria. His <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> actually named; Alhfrith, son of Oswiu of Northumbria, did marry a daughter of Penda, Cyneburh, but Alhfrith was never king of Northumbria himself, although his father was (Alhfrith did rule the subkingdom of Deira for a time). There have, however, been doubts about whether these were his parents: for instance, the Northumbrian king is described as a pagan, but Alhfrith was a Christian (at least according to Bede, who says Alhfrith convinced Penda's son Peada to convert to Christianity). Although it has been stated that Cyneburh is not known to have had any children, Northumbrian genealogy states she and Alhfrith had a further son, Osric, who subsequently became King of Northumbria himself (source: Stenton).|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has 36 Approved Private Schools {{including}} the Charter Schools for the Blind and Deaf. The private schools are {{licensed by the}} State Board of Private Academic Schools. They provide a free appropriate special education for students with severe disabilities. The cost of tuition for these schools is paid 60% {{by the state and}} 40% by the local school district where the student is a resident. Pennsylvania currently has four PA chartered and 30 non-charter APSs for which the Department approves funding. These schools provide a program of special education for over 4,000 day and residential students. <b>Parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> charged for the services at the school. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Education budgeted $98 million for tuition of children in approved private schools and $36.8 million for students attending the charter schools for the deaf and blind. The majority of these schools are located in the southeastern region and southwestern region of Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|Episodes {{focusing}} on Howard and Harold were pulled from Nickelodeon's African channel. Other episodes {{in which the}} characters are featured or mentioned briefly are edited so that the McBride <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> included. This decision was criticized by fans from South Africa, where gay marriage has been legal since 2006. Viacom stated that, since the feed reaches other African markets where homosexuality is banned, they would risk losing their broadcasting license by showing Howard and Harold. Their introductory episode was made available on the South African DStv's video on demand service following the controversy. The Arabic dub of the series never aired episodes with the McBride parents, but, however, modifies dialogue so that Howard speaks with a female voice and {{is referred to as}} Clyde's mother. The McBrides are the second pair of children's characters whose same-sex relationship has been censored for foreign markets; the first was Ruby and Sapphire of Steven Universe.|$|E
25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E
25|$|Mexico's {{inability}} to obtain better results in locating children and taking parents is particularly troubling. Many Convention return applications forwarded by the U.S. Central Authority have languished for years; when children and taking <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> located, Mexican courts will not {{rule on the}} application. As a result, and despite persistent efforts by the U.S. Central Authority to prompt Mexican authorities to address these cases, numerous parents have waited for years with no contact or information about the whereabouts of their children. Of the return applications submitted to the Mexican Central Authority that remained unresolved after eighteen months or longer, approximately half remain in limbo because Mexican authorities have not located the children. As a practical matter, the left-behind parent or someone working on his/her behalf must develop most leads pertaining to the possible location of abducted children {{without the help of}} Mexican authorities. In some cases, Mexican authorities profess an {{inability to}} find children even when the family or the U.S. Embassy has shared concrete information with the Mexican Central Authority on the child's whereabouts.|$|E

500|$|Countering this view, Garrett Epps—a {{professor}} of law at the University of Baltimore—has stated that [...] "In the case of United States v.

[...] Epps further notes that [...] "as a practical matter, the American-born children receive recognition of their citizenship regardless of the immigration status of their parents." [...] In Epps' opinion, the sponsors of the Fourteenth Amendment [...] "were unwavering in their insistence that the Citizenship Clause was to cover" [...] the children of such undesirable immigrants as Chinese and Gypsies, and he views the Wong Kim Ark ruling as an [...] "unexceptionable" [...] matter of reading the drafters' intent.|$|E
500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E
