40|$|We {{consider}} <b>parallel</b> algorithms {{working in}} sequential global time, for example circuits or <b>parallel</b> random access machines (PRAMs). <b>Parallel</b> abstract state machines (<b>parallel</b> ASMs) are such <b>parallel</b> algorithms, and the <b>parallel</b> ASM thesis asserts that every <b>parallel</b> algorithm is behaviorally {{equivalent to a}} <b>parallel</b> ASM. In an earlier paper, we axiomatized <b>parallel</b> algorithms, proved the ASM thesis and proved that every <b>parallel</b> ASM satisfies the axioms. It turned out that we were too timid in formulating the axioms; they did not allow a <b>parallel</b> algorithm to create components on the fly. This restriction did not hinder us from proving that the usual <b>parallel</b> models, like circuits or PRAMs or even alternating Turing machines, satisfy the postulates. But it resulted in an error in our attempt to prove that <b>parallel</b> ASMs always satisfy the postulates. To correct the error, we liberalize our axioms and allow on-the-fly creation of new <b>parallel</b> components. We believe that the improved axioms accurately express what <b>parallel</b> algorithms ought to be.
