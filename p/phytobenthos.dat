Benthic chlorophyll a concentrations (8 – 261 mg m- 2) greatly exceeded those of the phytoplankton (0. 008 – 1. 4 mg m- 2) in all sites. Cyanobacteria dominated the <b>phytobenthos,</b> while green algae and fucoxanthin-groups characterized the plankton. Both communities had higher photoprotection in cold, UV-transparent, high lati-tude waters. Phytoplankton had higher concentrations of photoprotective carotenoids per unit chlorophyll a than the <b>phytobenthos.</b> The planktonic photoprotective pigments were positively correlated with UV-penetration, and inversely correlated with temperature and coloured dis-solved organic matter. A partial redundancy analysis showed that the benthic pigments were related to latitude, area and temperature. The UV-screening compound scy-tonemin occurred in high concentrations in the phytoben-thos and was inversely related to temperature, while benthic carotenoids per unit chlorophyll a showed much lower variability among sites. These differing pigment strategies imply divergent responses to environmental change between the <b>phytobenthos</b> and phytoplankton in high latitude lakes...|$|E

40|$|Phytoplankton and <b>phytobenthos</b> {{communities}} play {{an important}} role in lotic systems as primary producers providing essential biomolecules to higher trophic oganisms and are important indicators for environmental or ecological change. In this thesis, field studies (observational and experimental) along a river–estuary continuum were conducted to assess the spatio-temporal variation and development of <b>phytobenthos</b> and phytoplankton communities using a combination of stable isotope and community analyses in a temperate southern African system across four study periods: September (early spring) and November/December (late spring) 2012, and February (summer) and May/June (winter) 2013. Additionally, the sources and composition of the particulate organic matter were also analysed using stable isotope (δ 15 N and δ 13 C) analysis. The effects of substrate type and flood occurrence were assessed through experimental studies at an up- and downstream site of the river after a major flood event that occurred between October and November 2012. Common household tiles were used as artificial substrates to study the development/succession of <b>phytobenthos</b> communities after the flood disturbance. Distinct diatom communities were observed between upstream and downstream sites and at each site, community structure changed with time indicating succession. In addition to recording diatom characteristics on three natural substrates, namely; macrophytes, rocks and sediment, artificial substrates observations were also made on three different types of artificial substrates, namely; brick, brown clay and grey clay tiles. The natural (species richness 78) and artificial substrates (sp. richness 93) had different communities with the latter having greater species richness. Common <b>phytobenthos</b> taxa were not restricted to a single substrate but preference was generally high for the artificial substrates, especially brown tiles (mean sp. richness 47). Results of the redundancy analysis (RDA) analysis indicated that ammonium, conductivity, total dissolved solids, salinity, pH, oxygen reduction potential, phosphate and water depth were the major determinants of the <b>phytobenthos</b> composition at the two sites. The spatio–temporal variation of phytoplankton and <b>phytobenthos</b> communities and allochthonous organic matter along the river–estuary continuum was assessed at 8 sites using a combination of community and stable isotope analyses. A total of 178 species belonging to 78 genera were recorded with diatoms being predominant, accounting for 81. 9 % of the total abundance. The total chl-a concentration along the river-estuary continuum increased from spring to a high in summer before decreasing to a low in winter. Periphyton communities were observed to be significantly different across sites (p 50 %) in the upper to middle reaches (river), but low (< 20 %) in the lower reaches (estuary). The current investigation represents the first attempt to assess the validity of the River Continuum Concept (RCC) in a southern African temperate river. The phytoplankton and <b>phytobenthos</b> communities, and chl-a concentration followed a trend similar to that proposed for the river continuum concept (RCC). The middle reaches based on the <b>phytobenthos</b> or phytoplankton communities and chl-a concentrations which were employed as proxies for primary production, were the most productive, while the upper reaches were the least primary productive. The evaluation of organic matter contributions to the SPM and detritus along the river–estuary continuum provided a baseline assessment of the nature and sources of potential food for consumers inhabiting different locations during different times of the year. Incorporating such spatio-temporal variations in SPM and detritus into food web studies will improve our understanding of the flow of carbon through aquatic systems...|$|E

40|$|According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{the status}} of European surface waters is {{assessed}} using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30 %), coastal waters (26 %), lakes (25 %) and transitional waters (19 %). More {{than half of the}} methods are based on macroscopic plants (28 %) or benthic invertebrates (26 %); in addition, phytoplankton (21 %), fish (15 %) and <b>phytobenthos</b> (10 %) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: Small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and <b>phytobenthos</b> that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other water categories abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton > <b>phytobenthos</b> > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytoplankton > <b>phytobenthos.</b> These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and transitional waters. The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for transitional waters being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and water categories. The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range (0. 8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > <b>phytobenthos</b> and fish fauna. In terms of water categories the following order resulted: coastal waters > lakes > transitional waters > rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches.

The use of primary producers (phytoplankton, <b>phytobenthos</b> and macrophytes) for water quality assessment has a long history, and several methods have been developed worldwide. In this study, we used these three communities to assess the ecological status of five natural lakes located in the Aquitaine region (southwest France). Several biological indices used in lakes from other European countries or in French rivers were employed and compared among the three communities. Each primary producer provided complementary information about the ecological status of the lakes, including the invasiveness of exotic taxa. Regardless of the producer community used, the response to the environment, as reflected by the indices (adequate for each community), was similar: Lakes Cazaux, Lacanau and Hourtin showed the best ecological status and Parentis and Soustons the worst. Phytoplankton diagnosis reflected and integrated unambiguously the water quality of the lakes, as demonstrated by the strong relationships between the phytoplankton index and the trophic status criteria. This community appeared as the best indicator, especially when macrophytes were absent. The methods applied here represent a potential tool for the assessment of the ecological status in the context of WFD, but they need to be refined.

Repeated surveys in five successive years provided evidence that D. geminata could be nearing a biogeographic equilibrium in the region. D. geminata databases from extensive biological and environmental surveys in 187 rivers, within ten catchments, south of 38 degrees S commenced in November 2010 and ran through May 2013. In addition, data from two other field surveys were used. The sites evenly distributed latitudinally were climatically characterized. The recent sampling program, following a published species distribution model, was designed to explore D. geminata distribution within thirteen catchments (34 degrees S- 48 degrees S). An extensive river survey in 2014 (spring-summer) and in 2015 (autumn) included the p/a, and relative abundance of D. geminata cells in <b>phytobenthos</b> and in the drift. These p/a {{results showed that the}} probability of re-encountering D. geminata cells at sites where the species was previously found was significantly high while the probability of finding D. geminata cells at sites previously without the species was significantly low. This suggests that the distribution of D. geminata cells among suitable habitats was nearing completion. The relative abundance of D. geminata cells in the <b>phytobenthos</b> versus in the drift indicates seasonality with higher proportion of cells in the <b>phytobenthos</b> during the spring-summer than during the autumn. During the final surveys, principal component analysis of chemical and physical characteristics of rivers showed significant differences between rivers with and without D. geminata. Based on our observations of the distribution of D. geminata cells among rivers with suitable habitat conditions and the fluctuating rate of spread between rivers, we conclude that D. geminata is probably in the ending stage of its spatial demographic expansion in Chile surmounting the different barriers of the invasive process.

Erosion shear stress shows clear dependencies both on fine-grain fraction < 63 #m and on the benthic diatom chlorophyll a concentration present in the uppermost 1 mm sediment layer. The strongest dependence of erosion shear stress on the benthic diatom chlorophyll a surface concentra-tion was found for muddy areas. This dependence vanishes for andy surface sediments. The reflectance spectra show two main classes. The first class contains information on the fine-grain fraction < 63 #m of areas not covered by <b>phytobenthos.</b> The second class corresponds to the <b>phytobenthos</b> which can be subdivided into benthic diatoms and other macrophytes.

40|$|This {{collaborative}} effort by many specialists across the Mediterranean presents an updated an-notated list of alien marine {{species in the}} Mediterranean Sea. Alien species have been grouped into six broad categories namely established, casual, questionable, cryptogenic, excluded and invasive, and presented in lists of major ecofunctional/taxonomic groups. The establishment success within each group is provided while the questionable and excluded records are commented in brief. A total of 963 alien species have been reported from the Mediterranean until December 2005, 218 {{of which have been}} classified as excluded (23 %) leaving 745 of the recorded species as valid aliens. Of these 385 (52 %) are already well established, 262 (35 %) are casual records, while 98 species (13 %) remain “questionable ” records. The species cited in this work belong mostly to zoobenthos and in par-ticular to Mollusca and Crustacea, while Fish and <b>Phytobenthos</b> are the next two groups which prevail among alien biota in the Mediterranean. The available information depends greatly on the taxonomic group examined. Thus, besides the three groups explicitly addressed in the CIESM atlas series (Fish, Decapoda/Crustacea and Mollusca), which are however updated in the present work, Polychaeta, <b>Phytobenthos,</b> Phytoplankton and Zoo-plankton are also addressed in this study. Among other zoobenthic taxa sufficiently covered in this study are Echinodermata, Sipuncula, Bryozoa and Ascidiacea. On the contrary, taxa such as Foraminifera, Amphipoda and Isopoda, that are not well studied in the Mediterranean, are insufficiently covered.

40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} {{phytoplankton}} cell numbers and species composition were studied in three coastal lagoons of the Ebro delta (Encanyissada, Tancada, Buda) from May, 1978 to May, 1979 {{in relation to}} salt concentration, nutrients and other environmental factors. Species composition, abundance and seasonal distribution of the phytoplankton during the year depend mainly on salinity changes produced by the balance between fresh and salt water inflows, and also on the nutrient concentration which {{is related to the}} freshwater inflows. If the water circulation between the lagoons and the sea is restricted, the lagoon changes to a high eutrophic state, with the gross development of the phytoplankton that takes the lead over the <b>phytobenthos...</b>|$|E
30|$|Llancanelo Lake and the {{surrounding}} springs constitute the main wetlands within this arid diagonal zone of the country. The large number of avian species that inhabit, nest, and have other uses for this portion of their migration routes within these aquatic ecosystems (Darrieu et al. 1989; Sosa 1995, 1999; Blendinger and Álvarez 2002) prompted {{the creation of the}} Provincial Natural Reserve and the declaration of a Ramsar-Site Conservation Wetland (Blanco 1999). To date, the studies in the Llancanelo area have been related to birds (Sosa 1995; Blendinger and Álvarez 2002), ostracods (D’Ambrosio et al. 2015), benthic macroinvertebrates (Ciocco and Scheibler 2008; Scheibler and Ciocco 2011, 2013), and plankton and <b>phytobenthos</b> (Peralta and Fuentes 2005), but the last of these was restricted to the Carilauquen Spring.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The paper {{presents}} {{some results}} of the 2006 Sava survey. The investigation was carried out at four locations along 188 km of the Serbian stretch of the Sava River (206 km of the river belongs to Serbia). Among other things (physical and chemical properties of water and sediment, phytoplankton, and <b>phytobenthos),</b> the study included investigation of aquatic macroinvertebrates. Sixty-two taxa were identified in this typical lowland river. Mollusks and oligochaetes were the most diverse groups of macroinvertebrates. Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} the Sava River is an important bio-invasion trajectory, a part of the Southern Invasive Corridor of Europe. Five alien macroinvertebrate taxa were identified, some of which (Corbicula fluminea, Branchyura sowerbyi, and Anodonta woodiana) were found to be important components of the community...|$|E
30|$|To {{compare the}} {{sensitivity}} of multivariate analysis on the overall data matrix and integrative single score indices, the ecological status according to the WFD and overall Shannon diversity (Shannon 1948) were calculated. The ecological status was determined applying the European/German evaluation systems for the biological quality elements fishes (European fish index EFI; Pont et al. 2007), macroinvertebrates (PERLODES; AQEM Consortium 2002) as well as diatoms, <b>phytobenthos</b> and macrophytes (PhyLib; Schaumburg et al. 2012) using pooled data from all replicates from each treatment (upstream and downstream sides of weirs in data set 1, pre- and post-restoration status in data sets 2 and 3). Pooled data were used to reach minimum abundances for index calculation and to fulfil the criteria of the multihabitat sampling technique of the WFD protocols. Since the calculation method for combining {{the results from the}} different biological quality elements can {{have a major impact on}} the results, we applied two different combination methods. First, the currently practiced “one-out-all-out” combination rule was used, where the overall Ecological Quality Class is determined by the biological quality element with the lowest value. Second, the arithmetic mean of the index values from all biological quality elements (periphyton (including diatoms and remaining <b>phytobenthos),</b> macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, fishes) was calculated. Additionally, overall Shannon diversity was calculated as further single score index from the normalized overall abundance data (integrating periphyton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fishes) using the DIVERSE procedure in PRIMER v 6. Ecological status scores where compared descriptively between treatments and the overall Shannon Indices were analysed by univariate statistics (Mann–Whitney-U test since all data were not normally distributed). Results from the two single numeric score indices were compared with those from multivariate analysis of overall community composition (Bray-Curtis Similiarity and PERMANOVA p-values).|$|E
30|$|Seston and sediments also {{differed}} in percentages of several FA markers, showing higher input of decomposed material in sediments {{and a significant}} part of active phytoplankton, zooplankton, and bacterioplankton in seston. Although dominating taxa of the phytoplankton and <b>phytobenthos</b> were diatoms and dinoflagellates, FA markers of these algae were not abundant in seston and especially in sediments. The relatively low proportion of algal biomass in the seston is a possible reason for this result. High percentages of SFAs (18 : 0 and 20 : 0 to 26 : 0) and bacterial FAs in sediments and seston indicated a high proportion of detrital particles that may have comprised vascular plant detritus and also pseudofeces, feces, and other excreta of mollusks. Thus, in general, the contributions of algae to seston and especially to sediments were not high.|$|E
