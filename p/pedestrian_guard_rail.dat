30|$|<b>Guard</b> <b>rails</b> were {{installed}} over {{the length of}} the trackÂ bridge to prevent wheel derailment. The addition of the <b>guard</b> <b>rails</b> also had the effect of stiffening the frame made up of the rails and bearer bars, thereby limiting lateral movement of the rails under train passage. The <b>guard</b> <b>rails</b> were continuous across the CESuRa system, connected to the bearer bars using machined pins, and connected to the <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> of the adjacent span through a sliding mechanism. These provisions were meant to limit the frame action contribution of the <b>guard</b> <b>rails</b> in order to promote distributed curvature of the track-rail frame under yaw movements while also accommodating surge movements.|$|R
40|$|A cradle-to-grave {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} is done to identify {{the environmental impacts of}} chromated copper arsenate (CCA) -treated timber used for highway <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> posts, to understand the processes that contribute to the total impacts, and to determine how the impacts compare to the primary alternative product, galvanized steel posts. <b>Guard</b> <b>rail</b> posts are the supporting structures for highway <b>guard</b> <b>rails.</b> Transportation engineers, as well as public and regulatory interests, have increasing need to understand the environmental implications of <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> post selection, in addition to factors such as costs and service performance. This study uses a life cycle inventory (LCI) to catalogue the input and output data from <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> post manufacture, service life, and disposition, and a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) to assess anthropogenic and net greenhouse gas (GHG), acidification, smog, ecotoxicity, and eutrophication potentially resulting from life cycle air emissions. Other indicators of interest also are tracked, such as fossil fuel and water use. Comparisons of <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> post products are made at a functional unit of one post per year of service. This {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) finds that the manufacture, use, and disposition of CCA-treated wood <b>guard</b> <b>rails</b> offers lower fossil fuel use and lower anthropogenic and net GHG emissions, acidification, smog potential, and ecotoxicity environmental impacts than impact indicator values for galvanized steel posts. Water use and eutrophication impact indicator values for CCA-treated <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> posts are greater than impact indicator values for galvanized steel <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> posts. </p...|$|R
50|$|Although {{there has}} always been some form of <b>guard</b> <b>rails</b> as long as there have been trains, the {{precursor}} of the <b>guard</b> <b>rails</b> we have today were invented in Laconia, New Hampshire by Gorham B. Ames in 1894.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Dane Allan Simonsen {{died after}} {{crashing}} into the barriers at Tertre Rouge. When the car collided with the <b>guard</b> <b>rail,</b> a mature tree had been touching the barrier, thereby preventing the <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> from performing its safety function.|$|R
50|$|Curb slope: Vertical curbs are prohibited. Sloping curbs {{are to be}} at {{the edge}} of the paved shoulder, with a maximum height of 100 mm. The {{combination}} of curbs and <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> is discouraged; in this case the <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> should be closer to the road than the curb.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Guard</b> <b>rails</b> in {{buildings}} are numerous, and {{are required by}} building codes in many circumstances. <b>Guard</b> <b>rails</b> along stairways are common, and catwalks and balconies are also lined with them. The most common residential <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> is usually a wood railing around the deck. This typically is built on-site from pressure treated lumber, featuring a simplistic design of vertical baluster spaced every 3.5" [...] to comply with building code. Other <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> construction options are available. Cable railings typically use stainless steel cables strung horizontally. Glass balusters and glass panels open the view while still providing safety, as at the Grand Canyon Skywalk. With the increasing popularity of composite lumber for decking, manufacturers, like TimberTech are providing composite railing components. Wrought iron is another choice that is traditional and sturdy.|$|R
50|$|Railway {{trackage}} has <b>guard</b> <b>rails</b> (aka check rails) {{to guide}} wheels through possible catch points on turnouts or diamonds. Similarly, <b>guard</b> <b>rails</b> may be installed inside the innermost running rails on very sharp curves. The other most common usage {{is to prevent}} damage to other structures, especially bridges, in a derailment.|$|R

50|$|<b>Guard</b> <b>rail</b> or guardrail, {{sometimes}} referred to as guide rail or railing, is a system designed to keep people or vehicles from (in most cases unintentionally) straying into dangerous or off-limits areas. A handrail is less restrictive than a <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> and provides both support and the protective limitation of a boundary.|$|R

40|$|This study studied {{an effect}} of a new <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> on the {{stability}} of curve tracks with CWR and revealed a mechanism of the new <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> for improving the stability of small radius curve tracks with CWR and also analyze the degree of the new <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> for enlarging the pave range of small radius curve tracks with CWR. In order to achieve these, an improved load-deformation method for calculating the stability of tracks with Continuous Welded Rails (CWR) is suggested and verified. The {{results indicate that the}} improved load-deformation method not only has the same accuracy as the improved unified formula in specification, but also has the same clear and simple characteristics as the original load-deformation method. The mechanism of the new <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> for improving the stability of small radius curve tracks with CWR is that the CWR stability can be greatly improved by increasing the stiffness of the track framework under conditions of maintaining the same cross-sectional area of the rails. The CWR with the new <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 230 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be relaxed 23. 3 %. If combined with the roadbed strengthening measures, the new <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 140 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be further relaxed 53. 3 %...|$|R

50|$|<b>Guard</b> <b>rail</b> is used {{to reduce}} the {{severity}} of run-off-road crashes by interposing a barrier that is more forgiving to vehicle occupants. It {{is important to note}} that <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> is itself a hazard and should only be used where it shields traffic from a hazard that is more dangerous than it is. It may not reduce the number of run-off-road crashes, since it is longer and closer to the road than the hazard behind it. Properly designed and installed, it will reduce the severity of crashes that do occur. One study found that installing <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> above an embankment would only reduce run-off-road crashes by only 7%. However, injury and fatal crashes were reduced by 45%.|$|R
