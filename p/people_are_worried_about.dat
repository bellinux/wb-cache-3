Kish further explained that the ubiquity of creative work can cause its devaluation, wherein artists question their worth when others fail to notice it in the immense amount of information that is shared and the speed by which culture is moving:"At a certain point we’re going to have to really evaluate what the responsibilities to artists are, as well of those of audiences. ... everyone is expected to be this completed, unwavering version of themselves all of the time, and that’s definitely not going to happen to artists. Artists are so fickle and all over the place and contradictory.

Their life begins when work is over (Goodboy 2007). They are mostly concerned with the paychecks that they will be receiving and are not interested in their job or the organization (McCroskey 1998). To them working is a necessity in life. Work is separated from the meanings of life and his/her relationship with the organization is strictly economic based (Presthus). These people make up {{a large portion of the}} employees in an organization. Indifferent's only work to satisfy the basic needs of their loved ones. These type of people do not like to participate in organizational routines that occur on a daily basis. They would also never volunteer to do more work than they have to, they come to work to do the job they were assigned to do, and then go home (McCroskey 2004). When communicating they often talk more about their family and life at home instead of organizational matters that are going on in the workplace. Other characteristics of indifferents are that they have a high level of job satisfaction and not many upward mobility aspirations. Highly indifferent <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> being accepted by their peers at work (organizational orientations and communication traits). All organizations needs these type of people in the workplace because they can be assigned to do routine tasks that require very little thought. They do the tasks that others would not enjoy doing (D. Russ). They don't mind doing these types of jobs because they get a paycheck out of it. It is easy to get along with these type of people as long as you don't push them to do extra work. A good way to get along with them is to talk to them about other things besides work. Talking to them about their family and their life outside of work is a good idea (organizational orientations and communication traits).|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the fire safety of textile and clothing materials. It also assesses the flammability for textiles in general. With the increase in big fires, accidental or non-accidental, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the fire behaviour of combustibles. The flammability of textile and clothing materials is a great concern. Appropriate tests should be developed to assess textile and clothing materials to ensure they are safe in a fire. In fact, textile products should satisfy some fire safety criteria depending on their uses. There are specified flammability requirements on selected products, though whether these are good enough for assessing modern textile materials should be watched. Typical textile materials with and without fire retardants protection were selected for assessing the fire behaviour with a cone calorimeter. High radiative heat flux up to 70 kWm‒ 2 was applied to assess those selected textile materials. A cone calorimeter is suggested to be the minimum requirement, though some full-scale burning tests are necessary for some purposes. Heat release rate and flame spreading measures are proposed in ranking the fire safety of textile materials. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|The book’s motto: “Only {{delusion}} {{is given}} to all” by Xenophanes provides {{the tone of the}} novel. The world is ruled by the delusion of the day. The Twin Towers of the WTC in New York City were destroyed by terrorists, Atjeh deals with a civil war, millions of animals were slaughtered because of avian flu, but in Monward, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the magical powers of a photo book. The romance novel covers many delusions. Abel is convinced his children aren’t his, Taeke believes Lotte to be an Indonesian witch. An innocent lizard gets the status of a dangerous snake and police officers hunt down geese with guns. In this romance novel, ’t Hart is able to blend reality with fantasy. To do so, he remains close to home. It is not difficult to see that Monward is an anagram of Warmond, ’t Hart’s current place of residence. Moreover, in 1991 he wrote the preface of a photo book “Portrets of Warmond” by photographer Els Hansen, who photographed 160 racy residents of Warmond. Naturally, the publication of Hansen’s novel did not lead to the death of 160 depicted inhabitants, this is where the fiction comes in. The author shows how humanity deals with truth and lies and that one is quickly unable to recognize the difference. It’s not without reason he cites Xenophanes. The quote is the motto from a fragment left by this philosopher: “And {{when it comes to the}} truth, there is and shall not be anyone who knows her in relation to the Gods and all those things I keep referring to. Because even if someone coincidentally would speak of the most perfect, then he would not be aware of this himself. Only delusion {{is given to}} all”. Moreover, the romance novel has a remarkable sexual overtone for this author. The nameless main character is surrounded by women, the painter Molly, the photographer Lotte, Leonora, the transsexual Sirena, and the female vicar Maria. They all represent the different aspects of the woman, the seductive siren, the motherly Maria, he mysterious witch Lotte, the martyr Leonora and the hateful Molly. Eventually no-one stays with the narrator except Lotte, but only to hide. But even in this case delusion rules, as she believes to be chased by the Indonesian secret service. During the entire romance novel, nightly planes to and from the airport Schiphol keep the residents awake, whose noise negatively affects the inhabitants peace of mind.|$|E
