After the repair of a DD-failure is completed, the maintenance team has two options: to perform an insert proof test for DU-failure or not.

40|$|Unreinforced masonry (URM) {{partition}} walls of William Weir House in Wellington {{were subjected to}} out-of-plane forces to investigate the as-built wall characteristic behaviour. The lateral load resisting system of the 1932 reinforced concrete building was scheduled to undergo seismic strengthening, and due {{to the absence of}} reliable wall out-of-plane assessment data, consulting engineers adopted an experimental <b>proof-testing</b> approach. A team of student researchers from the University of Auckland tested four URM {{partition walls}} by subjecting the walls to out-of-plane uniform pressure applied by means of a system of airbags. The testing included two mid-storey and two top-storey URM partitions, which had developed prior minor structural cracks. The full-scale in-situ testing confirmed that the precracked partitions had sufficient strength to resist the current New Zealand seismic demand, and the experimental programme resulted in substantial financial benefits for the client as none of the walls were identified as demolition or strengthening candidates. In addition to the as-built out-of-plane tests, two tests were conducted on partition walls retrofitted using near surface- mounted (NSM) fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) strips.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{procedure}} is presented that {{was applied for}} wheelset components during {{the development of a}} light-weight wheel from Schwäbische Hüttenwerke (SHW). The procedure requires knowledge of the actual wheel forces that occur in service with respect to magnitude, frequency of occurence and also their correlation in time. These forces were determined for an inter-city train and were used to derive characteristic cumulative frequency of occurence distributions for a service life of 5 mill. kilometers. The data were also used to determine a load programm for prooftests regarding adequate service life in the existing test facility for wheelsets. Based on the above mentioned test-load program, fatigue strength tests can be carried out under typical and important loading conditions such as: straight run, concerning, passage over switches and sinusoidal running for all component-parts of the wheelset, i. e. wheel, hub, bolted connection, and the axle. Also described in the paper are the development of a light-weight wheel and the results of the tests that led to the optimally shaped and dimensioned wheel design. Achieved was a reduction of 30 % in weight compared with standard wheel as well as improved dynamic vehicle behaviour.

40|$|Delamination in {{composite}} structure {{may be caused}} by imperfections introduced during the manufacturing process or by impact loads by foreign objects during the operational life. There are some nondestructive evaluation methods to detect delamination in {{composite structure}}s such as x-radiography, ultrasonic testing, and thermal/infrared inspection. These methods are expensive and hard to use for on line detection. Acoustic emission testing can monitor the material under test even under the presence of noise generated under load. It has been used extensively in <b>proof-testing</b> of fiberglass pressure vessels and beams. In the present work, experimental studies are conducted to investigate the use of broadband acoustic emission signatures to detect delaminations in composite beams. Glass/epoxy beam specimens with full width, prescribed delamination sizes of 2 inches and 4 inches are investigated. The prescribed delamination is produced by inserting Teflon film between laminae during the fabrication of composite laminate. The objectives of this research is to develop a method for predicting delamination size and location in laminated composite beams by combining smart materials concept and broadband AE analysis techniques. More specifically, a piezoceramic (PZT) patch is bonded on the surface of composite beams and used as a pulser. The piezoceramic patch simulates the AE wave source as a 3 cycles, 50 KHz, burst sine wave. One broadband AE sensor is fixed near the PZT patch to measure the AE wave near the AE source. A second broadband AE sensor, which is used as a receiver, is scanned along the composite beams at 0. 25 inch step to measure propagation of AE wave along the composite beams. The acquired AE waveform is digitized and processed. Signal strength, signal energy, cross-correlation of AE waveforms, and tracking of specific cycle of AE waveforms are used to detect delamination size and location...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{new developments}} {{on the different}} intrinsic failure mechanisms of silica optical fibres and fibre Bragg gratings with regard to applications {{in the fields of}} telecommunications and metrology. These failure mechanisms are mainly due to optical and mechanical degradations. Mechanical degradation is a combined effect of environmental corrosion, or ageing, and stress corrosion, or fatigue. Glass is subject to chemical attack by reagents in the environment, especially water. This ageing phenomenon can be satisfactorily accounted for by an Arrhenius model. High-temperature zero-stress ageing (up to 150 °C) at 85 %rh in air is proposed as a way of reducing the testing time of modern, acrylate-coated telecommunication fibres. Two types of research fibres were tested. The activation energies of 1. 3 eV obtained for both types of fibres correspond to the values reported in literature for silica dissolution. Coating degradation and handling problems impose an upper temperature limit of 125 °C for the ageing tests. Assuming a temperature of 20 °C and a fibre handleability limit of 2 GPa, necessary for stripping and splicing, the best time to failure estimate is over 100 years. Environmental corrosion of optical fibres should therefore not be a lifetime limiting factor, when compared to external causes such as accidental cable dig-up. Glass is a brittle material subject to stress corrosion: crack propagation under any applied stress in a non-inert environment results in strength reduction. This fatigue phenomenon can be successfully accounted for by a power-law model. An improved fitting method is proposed and implemented, with which Weibull strength distribution and stress corrosion parameters are obtained simultaneously. Investigations were made to validate the use of the power-law model in the case of sinusoidal cyclic loading. This is of special importance for lifetime estimation of systems experiencing vibrations. The experimental results perfectly agree with the predictions. Time to failure and reliability of commercially available stripped & polyimide (re) coated fibre Bragg gratings operating at high temperature in an inert gas were also investigated. The samples are characterised by bi-modal Weibull strength distributions that probably result from the manufacturing operations. A newly developed model considers that only a fraction p of these samples suffers from strength reduction. The mean obtained values of p = 27 ± 4 % and p = 16 ± 3 %, respectively, can be considered as a figure of merit of the manufacturing process. High-strength <b>proof-testing</b> is proposed as a way of ensuring a minimum strength. Lifetime of the surviving samples in excess of 5 years under 0. 5 % static strain are achievable. Optical fibre Bragg gratings are tuneable band-stop filters. Their optical degradation was investigated in terms of time- and temperature-dependent decay. This thermodynamic effect is due to the thermal depopulation of the excited defect sites responsible for refractive index modulation. A new step-wise temperature annealing method is proposed to model wavelength shift and reflectivity decrease with a master curve. This allows to obtain model parameters with one single grating. Proper pre-annealing of both types of grating tested (same as tested above) guarantees a wavelength stability of 1 pm during 5 years at a temperature of 230 °C, with a reflectivity decrease of less than 20 %. Therefore, error-free operation can be assured through wavelength drift reduction to levels compatible with industry requirements. These results demonstrate that optical fibres and fibre Bragg gratings have evolved from an experimental curiosity to a fully mature technique, suitable for long-term applications in both fields of telecommunications and metrology. Given sufficient time and population size to obtain accurate enough information on their mechanical and optical characteristics, their time to failure as strain and temperature sensors or telecommunication components can be predicted with satisfactory accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Propulsion {{systems that}} utilize hypergolic {{propellants}} {{have been used}} to power space vehicles {{since the beginning of the}} space program. Liquid methane and oxygen propulsion systems have emerged as an alternative and have proven to be more environmentally friendly. The incorporation of liquid methane/liquid oxygen (LOX) into the propulsion system has demonstrated an increase in engine performance, as well as a reduction in the volume, size and complexity of the system. Consequently, reducing the total mass of the vehicle which is a crucial aspect that is considered when planning space missions to both the Moon and Mars [1]. Project Morpheus has made significant advancements in liquid oxygen/liquid methane propulsion system technologies by incorporating a LOX/methane propulsion system to a vertical test bed. The vehicle consisted of a 5, 000 lb main engine and four 20 lb remote control system (RCS) engines that utilize liquid methane/LOX as its propellant [1]. The vehicle completed successful flight testing at Kennedy Space Center in 2014 which marked the completion of the Morpheus project. Subsequent projects utilizing Morpheus' vertical test bed have been developed to make further advancements. One of the subsequent projects consisted of the addition of a smaller 2, 000 lb main engine and a cold helium heat exchanger which would make it possible for a pressurant tank systems to be send to Mars or the Moon by significantly decreasing the overall mass and volume of the pressurant tank. The hot fire tests of the integrated system with the smaller main engine and cold helium heat exchanger were successful at sea level, but further studies are being conducted to better understand how the vertical test bed will behave under thermal-vacuum conditions. For this reason, the integrated vehicle will be taken to Plum Brook to be tested in a chamber capable of simulating these conditions. To ensure that the vehicle will function properly under vacuum conditions, testing will be first completed at the component level. During this process, the igniter of the main engine and the RCS thrusters will be tested under a vacuum. To complete the testing of the components, the test setup first needed to be finalized. The CryoCart is being used to feed the propellants to the test article. The CryoCart is a movable test set-up that was developed in 2009 to provide a mobile platform for testing oxygen/methane systems with hot-fire capability up to 100 lbf. The CryoCart consists of three different systems: Oxygen, Methane, and liquid Nitrogen. The Oxygen and Methane systems are placed into two different carts while the liquid nitrogen system is mainly located in the methane cart. Over the years, the CryoCart has been utilized for different projects and has undergone deterioration. For this reason, a new phase has been developed to rebuild it to working conditions once again. During my internship, I was aiding in the construction and restoration of the CryoCart. In the initial stages of the process, I updated the fluid and electrical schematics for the oxygen, methane, and test article systems. The original CryoCart consisted of an electrical panel that utilized electromechanical relays and a terminal to drive the igniter power and signal, as well as the main fuel and oxygen valves. This electrical panel connected to the CryoCart through various wire harnesses that could be found exiting from the CryoCart. First, it was determined how these harnesses connected to the electromechanical relays so that they worked correctly. Once the electrical system was understood, an alternative for the electromechanical relays and the Molex connectors used throughout the system was sought since these components can often prove to be unreliable. Solid State relays and MIL connectors were purchased to serve as replacements. Upon arrival of the parts, crimping and wiring was completed to install the new solid state relays and MIL connectors. During the replacement of the relays and connectors, system checks of the electrical system were ran to ensure that the system was working correctly. While completing system checks, the pressure transducers that were not functioning properly were also replaced and any issue with the wiring or signal was addressed. Once the electrical components were replaced, the restoration of the fluid system began. Parts of the tubing in the CryoCart had to be rebuild and often consisted of sizing, cutting, bending, filing, and sanding the tubing to prepare it to be flared. Many components had to be proof-tested to bring their certifications up to date, and several components had to be replaced. Various flex hoses, valves, and fittings were send to the Clean Lab because they were new, dirty, or had gone through <b>proof-testing.</b> Once they arrived from the cleaning lab they had to be put back to the system and leak checks and functional tests were conducted. In the Nitrogen system, the copper tubing located in the Oxygen cart was rebuild and Aerogel insulation was added to this section. A new gaseous nitrogen system was added to the CryoCart to purge the vacuum tube which will serve as the test chamber. Once the CryoCart was completed, construction of parts of the vacuum tube began. A flange was manufactured with welded fittings to hold the line of the vacuum pump as well as some extra fittings which will serve as extra inlets used to introduce fluid lines to the vacuum tube. Stress analysis was ran in this flange to ensure that it would not fail under vacuum conditions. The fluid lines leading from the air side of the vacuum to the test article were also constructed and added to the mount that had already been manufactured. Three different sets of tubing were constructed to accommodate the seven different RCS thruster and the main engine igniter that are going to be tested. Full electrical system checks were completed to ensure that all the wire harnesses and valves were functioning. Upon the completion of the CryoCart and the vacuum tube, hot fire testing for the RCS thrusters and the main engine igniter are going to begin. During this time any issues encountered with the engines or igniter will be addressed to ensure that the components function under vacuum conditions. After successful completion of testing, the vertical test bed, Morpheus, will be rebuilt and prepared to be sent to Plum Brook. In Plum Brook, the vehicle will be tested in the thermal-vacuum chamber to demonstrate that integrated lox-methane propulsion system operation in space-like conditions. This internship has allowed me the opportunity to gain valuable hands on experience and to develop skills that will aid in my education as well as in the workforce, while at the same time helping me determine that I would like to further pursue a career in propulsion engineering...|$|E
