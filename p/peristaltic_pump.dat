25|$|Fluid {{dynamics}} {{also plays}} an important role in vascular remodelling. The shear stress applied to vessel walls is proportional to the viscosity and flow patterns of the fluid. Disturbed flow patterns can promote the formation of valves and increasing pressure can affect the radial growth of vessels. The primitive heart within the first few days of contraction is best described as a <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pump,</b> however after three days the flow becomes pulsatile. Pulsatile flow {{plays an important}} role in vascular remodelling, as flow patterns can affect the mechanotransduction of stress to endothelial cells.|$|E
50|$|The ideal <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pump</b> {{should have}} an {{infinite}} diameter of the pump head and the largest possible diameter of the rollers.

50|$|<b>Peristaltic</b> <b>pumps</b> use {{motor-driven}} rollers to roll along flexible tubing, compressing it to {{push forward}} a liquid inside.

50|$|Once an {{automatic}} refractometer {{is equipped with}} a flow cell, the sample can either be filled by means of a syringe or by using a <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pump.</b> Modern refractometers have the option of a built-in <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pump.</b> This is controlled via the instrumentâ€˜s software menu.

30|$|The {{literature}} review showed {{that most of}} earlier studies dealt with electrokinetic or <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pumping</b> to drive fluid flow. The combined outcomes of peristalsis and electrokinetic phenomena can be critical for improving/controlling the mechanism of peristaltic transport. Inspired by the extensive uses of electroosmosis, peristalsis and nanofluids in current biomedical engineering/industry, some mathematical models of fully developed flows driven by the combined outcomes of electroosmotic and <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pumping</b> have been examined for the Newtonian fluid model and nanofluid. However, MHD nanofluids for electroosmotic peristaltic transport for Burgino model have not been taken into account. To fill this research gap, we present a new mathematical model to study the electroosmotic <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pumping</b> analysis of MHD nanofluid in an asymmetric microchannel. Joule heating, viscous dissipation effect and zeta potential of different values are likewise taken in this model. First, the relevant equations for EOF model along the axial electric field have been modeled and then solved for long wavelength and low Reynolds number. Afterwards, the resulting equations are solved numerically by utilizing the Mathematica software. Consequences of pertinent factors {{on the characteristics of}} flow, pumping, trapping, and heat transfer have been pointed out.|$|R
