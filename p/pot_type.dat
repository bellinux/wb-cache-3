5000|$|Globe valves are {{typically}} two-port valves, although three port valves are also produced mostly in straight-flow configuration. Ports are {{openings in the}} body for fluid flowing in or out. The two ports may be oriented straight {{across from each other}} or anywhere on the body, or oriented at an angle (such as a 90°). [...] Globe valves with ports at such an angle are called angle globe valves. Globe valves are mainly used for corrosive or high viscous fluids which solidify at room temperature. This is because straight valves are designed so that the outlet pipe is in line with the inlet pipe and the fluid has a good chance of staying there in the case of horizontal piping. In the case of angle valves, the outlet pipe is directed towards the bottom. This allows the fluid to drain off. In turn, this prevents clogging and/or corrosion of the valve components over a period of time.A globe valve can also have a body {{in the shape of a}} [...] "Y". This will allow the construction of the valve to be straight at the bottom as opposed to the conventional <b>pot</b> <b>type</b> construction (to arrange bottom seat) in case of other valves. This will again allow the fluid to pass through without difficulty and minimizes fluid clogging/corrosion in the long term.|$|E

40|$|The {{blue crab}} (Callinectes sapidus) {{supports}} North Carolina's most valuable commercial fishery; {{the value of}} hard blue crabs landed in 2000 was over $ 30 million dollars. This lucrative fishery may be adversely affected by loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Crabbers in Core Sound, North Carolina, report that sea turtle damage to crab pots has become an increasingly serious issue. Turtles damage crab pots by overturning them while {{trying to get the}} bait, tearing up the bottoms and sides of the pots; this damage results in higher gear replacement costs and losses in crab catch. Experimental fishing was conducted to test for differences in crab catch and pot damage using three types of crab pots: low-profile, square mesh, and hexagonal mesh. The hexagonal mesh pot is the most common <b>pot</b> <b>type</b> used by crabbers in Core Sound, and the low-profile pot was designed to reduce the sea turtles' ability to overturn the pots. The number and size of all crabs caught in the experimental pots were recorded. An analysis of variance (ANDVA) was used to analyze the relationship between number of crabs caught per pot and the effect of <b>pot</b> <b>type,</b> location, date, the interaction of date and location, and the interaction of <b>pot</b> <b>type</b> and location. Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests were used to determine significant differences among treatments. There {{was no significant difference in}} crab catch between the low-profile and the square mesh pots at any of the three experimental fishing locations. There was a significant difference in catch between the low-profile and hexagonal mesh pots at one location. The lowprofile pots sustained considerably less damage than both the square mesh and hexagonal mesh pot types. In interviews with 19 Core and Pamlico Sound crabbers, crabbers estimated that 62 % of all crab pot damage, and 37 % of lost crab catch, is due to sea turtle damage. The low-profile crab pot has the potential to improve this situation by allowing crabbers to maintain crab catch with a reduction in gear replacement costs...|$|E

40|$|The Common Octopus, Octopus vulgaris, is an r-selected mollusk found off {{the coast}} of North Carolina that {{interests}} commercial fishermen because of its market value and the cost-effectiveness of unbaited pots that can catch it. This study sought to: 1) determine those gear and environmental factors that influenced catch rates of octopi, and 2) evaluate the feasibility of small-scale commercial operations for this species. Pots were fished from August 2010 through September 2011 set in strings over hard and sandy bottom in waters from 18 to 30 m deep in Onslow Bay, N. C. Three pot types were fished in each string; octopus pots with- and without lids, and conch pots. Proportional catch was modeled as a function of gear design and environmental factors (location, soak time, bottom type, and sea surface water temperature) using binomially distributed generalized linear models (GLM’s); parsimony of each GLM was assessed with Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). A total of 229 octopi were caught throughout the study. Pots with lids, pots without lids, and conch pots caught an average of 0. 15, 0. 17, and 0. 11 octopi, respectively, with high variability in catch rates for each <b>pot</b> <b>type.</b> The GLM that best fit the data described proportional catch as a function of sea surface temperature, soak time, and station; greatest proportional catches occurred over short soak times, warmest temperatures, and less well known reef areas. Due to operating expenses (fuel, crew time, and maintenance), low catch rates of octopi, and high gear loss, a directed fishery for this species is not economically feasible at the catch rates found in this study. The model fitting to determine factors most influential on catch rates should help fishermen determine seasons and gear soak times that are likely to maximize catch rates. Potting for octopi may be commercially practical as a supplemental activity when targeting demersal fish species that are found in similar habitats and depth ranges in coastal waters off North Carolina...|$|E
40|$|This {{study had}} two objectives. Firstly to trial {{modifications}} to commercial western rock lobster pots, {{so as to}} sample as wide a size range of lobsters on the grounds as possible. Sampling took place over a 10 day period between 13 - 24 September 2009, with seven commercial fishermen being responsible for collection of the data at different sampling locations (Mandurah, Fremantle, Lancelin, Dongara, Geraldton, Abrolhos and Kalbarri). This arrangement proved {{to be successful in}} that a wide area of the coast was covered by the sampling regime and good quality catch composition data was achieved across the four depth zones (0 - 10 fm, 10 - 20 fm, 20 - 30 fm and > 30 fm) that were sampled. The different pot modifications that were trialled sampled a wide size range (25 - 144 mm CL), but mostly caught lobsters around the legal size limit (modal size, 80 mm CL). In three of the four areas where more than one <b>pot</b> <b>type</b> was used, there were significant differences (p< 0. 01) in the catch rates of one or more size classes between the various pot types. The second objective was to establish whether there has been a shift in post-puerulus settlement from shallow to deeper waters. Analysis showed that depth was highly significant (p< 0. 05) in determining the catch rates of most size classes (≤ 50 mm CL; 51 - 65 mm CL; 66 - 76 mm CL; 77 - 105 mm CL and ≥ 105 mm CL). Generally, small size classes were sampled in the shallow depth categories and larger lobsters were sampled in the deeper depth categories, which would suggest that as in the past, recent puerulus settlement has been in shallow depths. Accordingly, it would seem reasonable to conclude that it is unlikely {{that there has been a}} major shift in the depths at which pueruli are settling. However, small lobsters were sampled in low numbers in the deep water categories in this survey and this therefore does not exclude the possibility that deep water settlement may be becoming more common than in past. In terms of recommendations, more monitoring of post-puerulus/juvenile lobsters using modified commercial pots similar to those used in this study has the potential to provide inter-annual comparisons of the numbers of small size classes settling at different depths on the grounds. It is only with more data of this type over a longer time period, that it will be possible to show whether there is any indirect evidence of a shift in settlement to deeper water. Should this work continue into the future, it would be beneficial to standardize on a consistent type of modification to the commercial pots so that more reliable comparisons of the relative numbers of juvenile animals can be made between areas...|$|E
40|$|We analyze a {{self-assembly}} {{model of}} flexible DNA tiles {{and develop a}} theoretical description of possible assembly products. The model is based on flexible branched DNA junction molecules, which are designed in laboratories and could serve for performing computation. They are also building blocks for make of even more complex molecules or structures. The branched junction molecules are flexible with sticky ends on their arms. They are modeled with 2 ̆ 2 tiles 2 ̆ 2, which are star like graphs, and 2 ̆ 2 tile types 2 ̆ 2, which are functions that give information {{about the number of}} sticky ends. A complex is a structure that is obtained by gluing several tiles via their sticky ends. A complex without free sticky ends is called 2 ̆ 2 complete complex 2 ̆ 2. Complete complexes are our main interest. In most experiments, besides the desired end product, a lot of unwanted material also appears in the test tube (or pot). The idea is to use the proper proportions of tiles of different types. The set of vectors that represent these proper proportions is called the 2 ̆ 2 spectrum 2 ̆ 2 of the pot. We classify the types of pots according to the complexes they acan admit, and we can identify the class of each pot from the spectrum and affine spaces. We show that the spectrum is a convex polytope and give an algorithm (and a MAPLE code), which calculates it, and classify the pots in PTIME. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation, we approach molecular self-assembly from a graph theoretical point of view. We assign a star-like graph to each tile in a pot, which induces a 2 ̆ 2 pot-graph 2 ̆ 2. A pot-graph is a labeled multigraph corresponding to a given <b>pot</b> <b>type,</b> whose vertices represent tile types. The complexes can be represented by 2 ̆ 2 complex-graphs 2 ̆ 2, and each such graph is mapped homomorphically into a pot-graph. Therefore, the pot-graph can be used to distinguish between pot types according to the structure of the complexes that can be assembled. We begin the third part of the dissertation with a pot containing uniformly distributed DNA junction molecules capable of forming a cyclic graph structure, in which all possible Watson-Crick connections have already been established, and compute the expectation and the variance of the number of self-assembled cycles of any size. We also tested our theoretical results in wet lab experiments performed at Prof. Nadrian C. Seeman 2 ̆ 7 s laboratory at New York University.

40|$|North Carolina fishery {{managers}} are considering methods to offer greater protection {{to the blue}} crab, Callinectes sapidus, spawning stock while maintaining a viable commercial fishery for female blue crabs in high salinity estuaries. We tested how effectively wire rectangles, or excluders, of two internal sizes, 45 x 80 mm and 45 x 90 mm, would prevent entry of ovigerous female (sponge) crabs into pots relative to control pots (without excluders) while maintaining sizes and catch rates of male and nonsponged female hard crabs. Field sampling among three pot designs (two excluder sizes and control pots) was conducted in Core Sound, N. C., during 2004 – 06. Median sizes (carapace widths) of mature female crabs were not different among the three <b>pot</b> <b>types.</b> However, median sizes of male crabs and sponge crabs were greater in control pots than pots with either size of excluder. Catch rates of mature female crabs from control pots were greater than from pots with 45 x 85 mm excluders. Catch rates of legal male and sponge crabs from control pots were greater than from pots with either size of excluder. Results indicate that using excluders involves a tradeoff between reducing catches and sizes of sponge crabs while also reducing sizes and catches of legally harvestable nonsponge crabs; moreover, the reduction in total catch and sizes would be greater for legal male crabs than for legal nonsponged female crabs. In high salinity waters close to North Carolina’s existing no-harvest blue crab sanctuaries, where females typically dominate catches of hard crabs, the benefit of using excluders to prevent entry of sponge crabs may outweigh a potentially modest decrease in landings of nonsponged females...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{short-term}} evaluation of some commercially available FRP tendon-anchor systems for application in prestressed concrete structures. Ten FRP tendon-anchor systems were stressed and subjected to sustained load for a period of three days to determine ease of installation, mechanical performance and anchor seating losses. The FRP tendons used aramid, carbon, and glass fibres embedded in epoxy or vinyl ester resin (except for one case). Anchors were of the wedge (or spike) and <b>potted</b> <b>type.</b> A minimum of two tests were conducted for each system at a load level equal to 65 % of the manufacturer's specified ultimate tendon strength. Collected data included load, strain, and displacement readings during both initial stressing and three-day sustained load. In most cases, anchorage devices permitted the stressing of the FRP tendons at the desired load level. Among wedge-type anchors, plastic and aluminium wedges had questionable performance, whereas steel wedges (in direct contact with the tendon or using a metal sleeve between tendon and wedge) showed good performance. Regardless of wedge material (plastic, aluminium, or steel), grit application to the wedge internal surface was highly beneficial. The spike anchor presented some installation difficulties. Resin potted anchors worked well and were easy to install. For the one case considered (wedge anchor), it was determined that retensioning produces early failure and anchor-zone temperatures between - 40 degrees C and + 60 degrees C have no effect on system performance. Anchor seating losses during short-term use are in general small and could become insignificant depending on the length of the tendon. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|At the LHC, four Roman <b>Pot</b> (RP) <b>type</b> {{detectors}} will {{be installed}} {{on both sides}} of the ATLAS experiment with the aim of measuring elastic scattering at very small an-gles and determining the absolute luminosity at the interac-tion point. During dedicated LHC runs, the detectors will be positioned at about 1 mm from the nominal beam or-bit. Numerical simulations and laboratory measurements were carried out to characterize the RP impact on the to-tal LHC beam coupling impedance. The measurement re-sults assess the effectiveness of RF-absorbing ferrite plates that have been mounted in convenient locations in order to damp high Q resonances of the RP structure. In addition, we review the RP mechanics emphasizing the accuracy and reproducibility of the positioning system...|$|R
50|$|The lobster-tailed pot helmet, {{also known}} as the zischagge, horseman's pot and harquebusier's <b>pot,</b> was a <b>type</b> of post-Renaissance combat helmet. It became popular in Europe, {{especially}} for cavalry and officers, from c. 1600; it was derived from an Ottoman Turkish helmet type. The helmet gradually fell out of use in most of Europe in the late 17th century; however, the Austrian heavy cavalry retained it for some campaigns as late as the 1780s.|$|R
