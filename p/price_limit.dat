40|$|We {{examine the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> on Chinese A shares and investigate the characteristics of those stocks that hit their <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> more frequently. We find {{that the effect of}} <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> is asymmetric for the A shares in upward and downward price movements and different for bullish and bearish sample periods. During a bullish period <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> effectively reduce stock volatility for downward price movements, but not for upward price movements; while during a bearish period <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> effectively reduce stock volatility for upward price movements, but not for downward price movements. Second, <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> delay efficient <b>price</b> discovery for upward price movements, but not for downward price movements. However, we do not find evidence to suggest that <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> harmfully interfere with the stock trading processes in the Chinese A share markets. Finally, we find that actively traded stocks hit their <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> more often and tend to hit the lower limit more frequently when overall market conditions are bearish.

The {{aim of this}} paper is to investigate whether <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> achieve these goals without affecting market liquidity for a number of agricultural futures contracts. We employ models of changing volatility in order to show that <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> do not appear to significantly reduce market volatility. In addition, we find evidence confirming the hypothesis that <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> delay <b>price</b> discovery instead of facilitating it. Our results also suggest that the impact of <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> on volatility and price reversals, found in previous studies, are mainly due to the properties inherent to the futures returns, such as volatility clustering. Finally, although trading decreases significantly due to the <b>price</b> <b>limits,</b> traders do not seem to switch from the contracts affected by <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> to other maturities in order to minimize the impact of circuit breakers...|$|R

Starting with asset pricing, he {{wrote an article}} on the Taiwan stock market in which he developed a multifactor asset pricing model incorporating a <b>price</b> <b>limit</b> factor to explain the cross section of asset returns following closely the mimicking portfolio Fama-French methodology. The findings showed that the overall market factor, firm size and price limits capture a cross section of average stock returns in a meaningful manner. In an article on China he compared the performance of the traditional CAPM with the multifactor model of Fama and French for equities listed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. He also investigated the explanatory power of idiosyncratic volatility and responded to the claim that multifactor model findings {{can be explained by the}} turn of the year effect. He conducted further work on Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan to examine the proposition that the beta in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) was lacking in cross-sectional explanatory power. By incorporating the two most commonly used additional explanatory factors (size and book to market equity) he tested for evidence of multifactor risk premia. The results showed that the overall market factor was highly significant in all of the markets and that the magnitude of significance of the other two factors (size and book to market equity) varied across countries. He rejected the claim that the multifactor model findings could be explained by the turn of the year effect.|$|E
