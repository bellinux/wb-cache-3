Contrary to popular belief, the engine casing did not provide sufficient heat to cause Diesel-type ignition of the fuel, as there is insignificant compression within a pulsejet engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{augmented}} spark igniter (ASI) {{was mounted}} to the injector face {{and provided the}} flame to ignite the propellants in the combustion chamber.

Simultaneously, the control system started the initial flow of oxidizer and fuel to the spark igniter. As the oxidizer and fuel entered the combustion chamber of the ASI, they mixed and were ignited, with proper ignition being monitored by an ignition monitor mounted in the ASI. The ASI operated continuously during entire engine firing, was uncooled, and was capable of multiple reignitions under all environmental conditions.|$|R

The aim of the analysis was to determine the effect of the plug diameter, the plug advance, the feed angle and the diameter reduction on the piercing process. Nine cases of piercing with three different plugs used were analyzed. The effects of the basic process parameters on the tube shell diameter and the tool load were analyzed.

40|$|The {{operating}} {{characteristics of the}} semiconductor spark gap ignitor plug used to initiate the discharge in a pulsed plasma thruster are investigated. Current and voltage waveform measurements for the ignitor plug alone, and for the <b>plug</b> <b>mounted</b> in the thruster cathode indicate an average dynamic impedance of 0. 2 ohms {{for a wide range}} of operating conditions, and a trigger circuit energy transfer efficiency to the plug on the order of 25 %. Two modes of trigger ignition are found which are related to the rise time of the applied voltage pulse. Analysis of plasma characteristics reveals plug erosion to occur primarily in the semiconductor and anode regions, by mechanisms including plug metal embrittlement, plasma sputtering and vaporization caused by the discharge current pulse. Measurements also indicate a plume velocity on the order of 1580, 000 cm/sec which increases with trigger circuit stored energy. The results establish levels of performance for future applications of semiconductor spark gap ignitor plugs in plasma devices...|$|R

5000|$|The {{power system}} became {{operational}} on 19 June 1891 and was run continuously {{for the first}} 30 days. The entire plant required 15 to 20 attendants for its operation. The instruments and controls were rudimentary, solenoid type gravity balance Voltmeters and ammeters mounted on lacquered wooden boards. Workers had to take special care {{because of the high}} voltages used. Power was connected by closing simple knife switches and the system was shut down (the electrical circuit [...] "opened") by a worker garbing a connecting line at the power pole and pulling it out of the arc-light style <b>plug</b> <b>mounted</b> on the pole (a sometime dangerous maneuver that produced 6 to 8 foot (1.83-m to 2.44-m) long high voltage arcs). One continual problem was repairing damage from lightning strikes, a common occurrence at the mountainous location. The alternators were set on paraffin soaked oak platforms to add insulation and Westinghouse engineers tried various types of lightning arrestors. The alternators were designed with removable parts making the task of repairing them a little easier.|$|R

5000|$|Anzani {{was aware}} of the weight cost of the {{counterweight}} in the fan configuration and by December 1909 he had a symmetric 120° three-cylinder radial engine running. One example was a 3.1 litre (186 cu in) unit producing 22 kW (30 hp) at 1,300 rpm. [...] Although termed the Y engine after its symmetric cylinder arrangement, it ran in an inverted Y position so that the <b>plugs,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the upper in-plane side of the two lower cylinders were less than 30° below the horizontal and less prone to oiling than one serving a piston at 180° from upright. Radials are smoother running than the less symmetric fan engines as well as lower weight but with the low power available from their three cylinders they had limited applications. They led, however, to Anzani's two-row radial engines, beginning with the 6-cylinder radials, two Ys on a common crankshaft. In the 21st century a restored Bleriot XI bearing the French Blériot factory serial number 56 — said to be the oldest flyable aircraft in the Western Hemisphere, bearing the American registration N60094 — is still flown in the United States on summer and early autumn weekends with one of these 120° cylinder angle [...] "Y-type" [...] radial engines.|$|R
40|$|The charge {{structure}} of the surface of articular cartilage determines its interactions with the macromolecules and cells of synovial fluid. It may thereby be important to the physiological function and pathological degeneration of the tissue. To determine whether the electrokinetic properties of the surface {{differ from those of}} the bulk tissue, we measured the streaming potential generated by the flow of electrolyte over the surface of a cartilage <b>plug</b> <b>mounted</b> in a chamber built for that purpose. We then calculated the effective surface charge density. In nonfibrillated cartilage from the human femoral head, the surface charge density, 0. 037 +/- 0. 004 Cm(- 2) (mean+/-SD), was approximately half that measured at the surface of slices cut from the middle and deep zones. In addition, the surface charge density fell relatively little at low pH; this is consistent with a higher proportion of strongly acidic groups. The variations in surface charge density were found to be similar to those in total fixed charge density in the slices by the tracer cation method. Therefore, no evidence exists that the actual surface differs in composition from the immediately underlying matrix. The addition of synovial fluid (0. 0025 ml/ml) to the superfusing solution reduced the surface charge density by 25 +/- 9 % (n= 5), and we attributed this to the binding of synovial-fluid macromolecules...|$|R
40|$|A {{hot cell}} {{installation}} for {{the handling of}} highly radioactive material may comprise {{a dozen or more}} interconnected high density concrete vaults, the concrete vault walls having a thickness of approximately three feet. Typically, hot cells are constructed in rows so as to share as many shielding walls as possible. A typical overall length of a row of cells might be 70 yards. A secondary mechanism exists for placing certain objects into a cell. A typical hot cell has been constructed with 8 inch diameter holes through the exterior shielded walls in the vicinity of, and usually above, the viewing windows. It became evident that if the hot cell plugs could be removed and replaced conveniently significant savings in time and personnel exposure could be realized by using these 8 inch holes as entry ports. Fifteen inch cylindrical steel plugs with a diameter of eight inches weigh about two hundred pounds. The shield plug swing mechanism comprises a steel shielding <b>plug</b> <b>mounted</b> on a retraction device that enables the plug to be pulled out of the wall and supports the weight of the pulled out plug.

50|$|Tweed Volcano is a {{partially}} eroded Early Miocene shield volcano located in northeastern New South Wales, which formed when {{this region of}} Australia passed over the East Australia hotspot around 23 million years ago.

50|$|While a plug {{can be used}} in {{combination}} with most any harness, just by inserting the plugs before putting on the harness, all the harness tends to do is push the plugs in, and not move them as to provide stimulation when the wearer thrusts. Depending on the type of harness, different ways are used to properly attach plugs to the harness. A common type consists of an opening or rubber ring with a cloth or leather back, similar to what might be used to hold the main dildo {{to the front of the}} harness, but positioned over the anus, vagina, or ones for both. A dildo/plug with a wide base is inserted through the ring, then when the harness is put on, the material pulls tight against it, holding it firm. For vac-u-lock harnesses, one or two additional vac-u-lock <b>plugs</b> are <b>mounted</b> on the inside of the harness, allowing any vac-u-lock attachment to be used. Most vac-u-lock harnesses that have the connectors for internal plugs come with two plug-shaped vac-u-lock attachments, a smaller one for anal use and a larger one for vaginal use. Like other types of harnesses, both plugs may be used at once, and often are separately adjustable on the strap to fit the wearer's body.|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} stage of balloon deployment systems for missions, nichrome wire cable cutters were {{often used in}} place of pyro-actuated cutters. Typically, a nichrome wire is wrapped around a bundle of polymer cables with a low melting point and connected to a relay-actuated electric circuit. The heat from the nichrome reduces {{the strength of the}} cable bundle, which quickly breaks under a mechanical load and can thus be used as a release mechanism for a deployment system. However, the use of hand-made heated nichrome wire for cutters is not very reliable. Often, the wrapped nichrome wire does not cut through the cable because it either pulls away from its power source or does not stay in contact with the cable being cut. Because nichrome is not readily soldered to copper wire, unreliable mechanical crimps are often made to connect the nichrome to an electric circuit. A self-contained device that is reusable and reliable was developed to sever cables for device release or deployment. The nichrome wire in this new device is housed within an enclosure to prevent it from being damaged by handling. The electric power leads are internally connected within the unit to the nichrome wire using a screw terminal connection. A bayonet plug, a quick and secure method of connecting the cutter to the power source, is used to connect the cutter to the power leads similar to those used in pyro-cutter devices. A small ceramic tube [0. 25 -in. wide 0. 5 -in. long (. 6. 4 -mm wide 13 -mm long) ] houses a spiraled nichrome wire that is heated when a cable release action is required. The wire is formed into a spiral coil by wrapping it around a mandrel. It is then laid inside the ceramic tube so that it fits closely to the inner surface of the tube. The ceramic tube provides some thermal and electrical insulation so that most of the heat generated by the wire is directed toward the cable bundle {{in the center of the}} spiral. The ceramic tube is cemented into an aluminum block, which holds it in position. The leads of the nichrome wire are attached to screw terminals that connect them to power leads. A bayonet <b>plug</b> <b>mounted</b> at the bottom of the rectangular block connects the power leads to a relay circuit. A thin aluminum shell encloses the entire structure, leaving access points to attach to the bayonet plug and to feed a cable into the cylinder. The access holes for the deployment cable are a smaller diameter than the nichrome coil to prevent the cable from coming in direct contact with the nichrome when loaded. It uses the same general method of severing a cable with a heated wire as was used previously, but implements it in such a way that it is more reliable and less prone to failure. It creates a mechanism to create repeatability that was nonexistent in the previous method...|$|R
