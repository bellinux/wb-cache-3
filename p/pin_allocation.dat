5000|$|From 2000 and onwards, manufacturers, such as BMW, Citroen, Ford, Mercedes Benz, Peugeot, Volkswagen, Rover, Audi, Seat, Opel and Å koda have {{sometimes}} started using a 40 pin connector instead, called the Quadlock. The Quadlock connector {{consists of a}} block of 16 flat pins analogous to the two main ISO 10487 connectors. While the physical contact pins are the same, the <b>pin</b> <b>allocation</b> is not entirely the same, and the connector housing is not compatible. In addition to the 16 pins, like ISO 10487, there are minor connectors for optional equipment. They fit within {{the frame of the}} main connector, and has coding so that they cannot be interchanged. Minor connector B has 12 pins for audio output signals. Minor connector C has 12 pins for various audio sources such as CD-changers, MP3 players.|$|E
40|$|International audienceGrowth and {{morphogenesis}} {{in plants}} require controlled transport {{of the plant}} hormone auxin. An important participant is the auxin effluxing protein PIN, whose polarized subcellular localization allows it to effectively transport auxin large distances through tissues. The flux-based model, in which auxin flux through a wall stimulates <b>PIN</b> <b>allocation</b> to that wall, is a dominant contender among models determining where and in what quantity PIN is allocated to cell walls. In this paper we characterise the behaviour of flux-based <b>PIN</b> <b>allocation</b> models in various tissues of the shoot apical meristem. Arguing from both mathematical analysis and computer simulations, we describe the natural behaviours of this class of models under various circumstances. In particular, we demonstrate the important dichotomy between sink- and source- driven systems, and show that both diffuse and canalized PIN distributions can be generated simultaneously in the same tissue, without model hybridization or variation of PIN-related parameters. This work is performed {{in the context of}} the shoot apical and floral meristems and is applicable to the construction of a unified <b>PIN</b> <b>allocation</b> model...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a stand-alone TTC emulator system. This system simulates relevant TTC signals and their sequences needed for the ATLAS TGC electronics. Almost all functionalities are packed in an FPGA chip, which is mounted on the same board as one of TTCrx test board developed by CERN EP/mic group. The signal <b>pin</b> <b>allocation</b> is also {{the same as the}} TTCrx test board. Hence, instead of the test board, if the emulator board is mounted, TTC signals are generated and distributed consistently with this board without any modification of the mother board electronics system.

40|$|We have {{considered}} two representations of a longitudinal {{section of the}} shoot apex: a regular grid and a cellular template based on a real meristem section. Depending on the case, cells are represented as square or arbitrary polygons, which share with the neighboring cells the edges that represent the interface through which the cells communicate. Each edge thus corresponds {{to a pair of}} membranes with the associated wall. The model equations take into account the variation in cell and interface size present in the cellular template model. Our model treats cells as single compartments and does not explicitly simulate internal auxin gradients within a cell or the diffusion of auxin in the extracellular space. In the shoot meristem, where the cells are small and have thin walls, this is likely a reasonable approximation (Kramer 2006). In a review of computer models of auxin transport, Kramer (Kramer 2008) discusses {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} this and other approaches. Based on assumptions 1 - 5 in the main text, a set of coupled ordinary differential equations is used to model the production and decay of auxin (IAA) and PIN 1 proteins, as well as the diffusion and transport of IAA. Numerical integration is performed using the forward Euler method. At the beginning of each simulation time step, all PIN 1 proteins in each cell are allocated to cell membrane sections based on a combination of the flux across the interface and the concentration of auxin in the neighboring cells. It is assumed that relocalization of PIN 1 is fast compared to the length of the simulation step, and therefore the system operates in a quasi steady-state with respect to <b>PIN</b> 1 <b>allocation.</b> The change in the total amount of PIN contained in a cell is given by d PIN d...|$|R
40|$|The Computer Architecture {{literature}} is now replete with papers {{concerned with the}} change in architectural direction from ever more complex single cores to single chip multi-core designs. Along with this opportunity come major challenges. Among them is {{the sheer size of}} the space of possible designs. The investigation of this space is far from complete. What is needed to aid in this task is an integrated suite of tools that provides support throughout the design life-cycle, from early prototyping to final design. Here we present a floorplan tool targeted towards early prototyping of pre-RTL CMP design concepts. As such, it acts as a complement to traditional floorplan tools that are more appropriate later in the design process. Early phase CMP design investigations into the distribution of power and temperature, <b>pin</b> <b>allocation,</b> core/cache cluster size, and NoC design trade-offs are examples of experiments that can benefit from CMP layout information without many of the design details needed to drive a traditional floorplanner. We use two such studies to validate the benefit of the tool in rapid prototyping. The floorplan is specified using a model similar to that supported by GUI toolkits such as Java Swing or Windows Presentation Foundation. The floorplan design is comprised of a hierarchy o...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{continuously}} {{generate new}} organs {{through the activity}} of populations of stem cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem initiates leaves, flowers, and lateral meristems in highly ordered, spiralled, or whorled patterns via a process called phyllotaxis. It is commonly accepted that the active transport of the plant hormone auxin {{plays a major role}} in this process. Current hypotheses propose that cellular hormone transporters of the PIN family would create local auxin maxima at precise positions, which in turn would lead to organ initiation. To explain how auxin transporters could create hormone fluxes to distinct regions within the plant, different concepts have been proposed. A major hypothesis, canalization, proposes that the auxin transporters act by amplifying and stabilizing existing fluxes, which could be initiated, for example, by local diffusion. This convincingly explains the organised auxin fluxes during vein formation, but for the shoot apical meristem a second hypothesis was proposed, where the hormone would be systematically transported towards the areas with the highest concentrations. This implies the coexistence of two radically different mechanisms for <b>PIN</b> <b>allocation</b> in the membrane, one based on flux sensing and the other on local concentration sensing. Because these patterning processes require the interaction of hundreds of cells, it is impossible to estimate on a purely intuitive basis if a particular scenario is plausible or not. Therefore, computational modelling provides a powerful means to test this type of complex hypothesis. Here, using a dedicated computer simulation tool, we show that a flux-based polarization hypothesis is able to explain auxi...|$|E
