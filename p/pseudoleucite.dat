50|$|The {{area has}} {{volcanic}} origins and {{is rich in}} potash.

40|$|Summary. Leucite and pseudoleueitc {{invariably}} {{have lower}} K/Rb ratios and higher K/Sr and K/Ba ratios than the groundmasses {{of the rocks}} in which they occur. The distribution of Rb, Sr, and Ba between K-rich minerals (e. g. alkali feldspars) and the liquids from which they crystallize is generally such that Rb is impoverished and Sr and Ba enriched, relative t ~ K, in the crystallizing phase. Leucite shows the opposite relationship and this is attributed tothe leucite structure being sensitive to the size and valency of the ions rep]acing K. p SEUDOLEUCITE normally consists of a fine-grained intergrowth of nepheline and alkali feldspar and {{is believed to be}} formed by reaction of primary leucite with Na-rich magma (Bowen and Ellestad, 1937), subsolidus breakdown of primary Na-rieh leucite (Fudali, 1963), or breakdown of K-analcime (Larsen and Buie, 1938). During a recent geochemical nd mineralogical investigation of the Marangudzi igneous complex, Southern Rhodesia (Rees, 1960; Gifford, 1961) I found that <b>pseudoleucites</b> usually have larger concentrations of Rb and smaller concentrations of Sr and Ba than the rocks in which they are contained. This means that the groundmasses of these rocks have lower Rb and higher Sr and Ba concentrations. <b>Pseudoleucites</b> from other areas show a similar distribution of these elements relative to their bulk rock or groundmass composition. Leueite phenocrysts from fine-grained or glassy lavas also show high concentrations of Rb and low concentrations of Sr and Ba relative to their bulk rocks or groundmasses. The above relationships do not conform with those expected con-sidering the normal laws of trace element distribution (Goldschmidt, 1937; Ringwood, 1955) and the possible reasons for this are discussed in this paper. The Marangudzi complex. The Marangudzi igneous complex, Southern Rhodesia, consists of a large gabbro mass intruded by ring dykes of quartz-syenite, cone sheets of nepheline-syenite (pulaskites, foyaites...|$|R
50|$|The {{plutonic}} leucite-bearing {{rocks are}} leucite syenite and missourite. Of these the former consists of orthoclase, nepheline, sodalite, diopside and aegirine, biotite and sphene. Two occurrences are known, one in Arkansas, {{the other in}} Sutherland, Scotland. The Scottish rock has been called borolanite. Both examples show large rounded spots in the hand specimens; they are <b>pseudoleucites,</b> and under the microscope prove to consist of orthoclase, nepheline, sodalite and decomposition products. These have a radiate arrangement externally, but are of irregular structure at their centres; {{it is interesting to}} note that in both rocks melanite is an important accessory. The missourites are more mafic and consist of leucite, olivine, augite and biotite; the leucite is partly fresh partly altered to analcite, and the rock has a spotted character recalling that of the leucite-syenites. It has been found only in the Highwood Mountains of Montana.|$|R
50|$|The leucite-hearing dike-rocks {{are members}} of the tinguaite and monchiquite groups. The leucite tinguaites are usually pale grey or greenish in color and consist principally of nepheline, alkali {{feldspar}} and aegirine. The latter forms bright green moss-like patches and growths of indefinite shape, or in other cases scattered acicular prisms, among the feldspars and nephelines of the ground mass. Where leucite occurs, it is always euhedral in small, equant, many-sided crystals in the ground mass, or in larger masses which have the same characters as the <b>pseudoleucites.</b> Biotite occurs in some of these rocks, and melanite also is present. Nepheline decreases in amount as leucite increases since the abundances of the two reflect the Na:K ratio of the rock. Rocks of this group are known from Rio de Janeiro, Arkansas, Kola Peninsula (in Russia), Montana and a few other places., In Greenland there are leucite tinguaites with much arfvedsonite, (hornblende) and eudialyte. Wherever they occur they accompany leucite- and nepheline syenites. Leucite monchiquites are fine-grained dark rocks consisting of olivine, titaniferous augite and iron oxides, with a glassy ground mass in which small rounded crystals of leucite are scattered. They have been described from Czechoslovakia.|$|R

He is reported to have done extensive work on the genesis of alkaline rocks and has experimentally proved the genesis of <b>pseudoleucite,</b> ultrapotassic rocks and analcime. His studies have been detailed in two books, Petrology and Genesis of Leucite-bearing Rocks and Young Potassic Rocks as well as several peer reviewed articles; the online article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed a number of them. He was the first professor of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences of the University of Allahabad and has contributed to the establishment of the National Centre of Experimental Mineralogy and Petrology, Allahabad where he served as a director.

40|$|Brooks and Gittins {{make three}} main criticisms of my paper. The first, {{and perhaps the}} most impor-tant, is that they (Gittins et al. 1980) have already {{described}} and illustrated "all the textures de-scribed by Hesselbo and some additional ones". However, the four photomicrographs referred to (Gittins et al. 1980, p. 121) are only of inter-growth sets from plutonic rocks and devoid of crystal outlines, which, by their own conclusions, should not actually be called <b>pseudoleucite</b> at all.

40|$|Igneous <b>pseudoleucite</b> {{has been}} found {{for the first time}} in the Gardar {{alkaline}} province of South Green-land. The 10 cm diameter pseudoleucites occur in a trachyte dyke and are comprised of radiating inter-growths of K-feldspar with sericite and cancrinite. The textures are interpreted as being a direct reflection of original nepheline/K-feldspar intergrowths. Major element and trace element data are presented and these show that the <b>pseudoleucite</b> retains the structural formula of leucite but with considerable alkali loss. Consideration of the textural relationships is very important in determining possible and impossible modes of genesis although in this case interpretation is constrained by the very advanced state of altera-tion of the rock. It is proposed that the Gardar pseudoleucites formed by a breakdown reaction of an ori-ginally sodic leucite by reaction involving deuteric waters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Hamit pluton {{is one of}} the {{alkaline}} intrusions in the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex (CACC). The pluton {{consists of}} nepheline syenite, <b>pseudoleucite</b> syenite, alkali-feldspar syenite and quartz syenite. The nepheline syenite and <b>pseudoleucite</b> syenite are cut by foid-bearing microsyenitic dykes, whereas the alkali-feldspar syenite and quartz syenite are cut by aplitic and silicic dykes. The predominantly peralkaline Hamit intrusive rocks possess field, petrographic and geochemical characteristics comparable to A-type granites. All intrusive rocks of this pluton show enrichment in LILE and LREE relative to HFSE. The Th/Yb versus Ta/Yb plot suggests that the intrusive rocks formed from an enriched mantle source region carrying a subduction component inherited from pre-collision subduction events. Either thermal perturbation of the metasomatised lithosphere by delamination of the thermal boundary layer (TBL) or removal of a subducted plate (slab breakoff) are the likely mechanisms for initiation of the post-collisional magmatism of this complex...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{description}} is presented here {{of a group}} of highly potassic, highly magnesian dikes, originally called kersantites but better-named as lamproites. These rocks may contain phenocrysts of forsteritic olivine, diopside, phlogopite, amphibole (a unique potassic magnesioarfvedsonite) and <b>pseudoleucite</b> set in a groundmass rich in phlogopite, amphibole and carbonate. A K-Ar date on phlogopite indicates an age of ca. 1200 m. y. which {{is similar to that of}} a number of other alkaline rocks in the North Atlantic region...|$|E
40|$|In situ zircon U-Pb {{ages and}} Hf isotopic {{compositions}} and whole rock geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data are presented for the Zijinshan alkaline intrusive complex from the Shanxi Province, western North China Craton. Salic rocks dominate the complex with the monzonite {{occurring in the}} outermost and <b>pseudoleucite</b> phonolitic breccia in the center. The intrusion took place 127  Ma ago with the earliest emplacement of monzonite and the termination of cryptoexplosive <b>pseudoleucite</b> phonolitic breccia. All rocks from this complex show LREE enrichment and HFSE depletion and exhibit enriched to depleted Sr-Nd isotopic features. The presence of inherited zircons and enriched Hf isotopic compositions in zircon rims, along with the enriched whole rock Sr-Nd isotopic compositions, indicate that the monzonite was formed through the mixing of lithospheric mantle-derived magma with lower crust-derived melts. The diopside syenite and nepheline-bearing diopside syenite are more depleted than the monzonite {{in terms of the}} Sr and Nd isotopes, together with their very high concentrations of LILE, we proposed that they originated from a mixed mantle source of enriched lithospheric mantle and depleted asthenosphere. The nepheline syenite has very low concentrations of MgO, Ni, Cr, suggesting that the magma underwent significant crystal fractionation. The most depleted Sr and Nd isotopic compositions ((87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i = 0. 7036 - 0. 7042, εNd(t) = - 0. 2 - 0. 3) among all rock types indicate a great contribution of asthenosphere to the nepheline syenite. The Zijinshan complex and its related crust-mantle interaction occurred in an extensional environment which resulted in continuously asthenospheric upwelling. Such an extensional environment might have been developed during the post-orogenic stage of the Late Paleozoic amalgamation of North China Craton with Mongolian continents and subsequent Mongol-Okhotsk ocean closure. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract—Nordstrandite from Lages {{represents}} the first occurrence of this mineral in an oxisoil {{that does not}} involve {{the influence of a}} calcareous substrate. This is also the first reported occurrence in Brazil. Nordstrandite occurs near the city of Lages only in the weathered bedrock facies, mostly where the circulation of meteoric water is restricted. There is also a close association between nordstrandite and the weathering of modified <b>pseudoleucite</b> structures. The interaction of meteoric water and feldspathic alkaline country rock with uncommon texture and mineralogy (rich in nepheline, sodalite, nosean, analcime and natrolite) promotes the development of solutions enriched in alkaline ions with basic pH, necessary to form nordstrandite. A detailed study by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy in natural or chemically leached samples was performed to identify the Al(OH) 3 polymorphs of gibbsite and nords-trandite...|$|E
40|$|Rare metal {{mineralization}} i Mongolia {{is represented}} by occurrences of rare metals (Sn, W) and rare elements (Ta, Nb, Zr, Be, Li, Cs, Sr, and REE) which {{can be divided into}} two groups (magmatic and hydrothermal) according to their composition and genesis. The magmatic group consists ofdeposits whose origin is mainly aresult of processes of igneous concentration of rare elements and includes rare metal granites (e. g., Ta-bearing lithium-fluorine granites and Nb-REE-Zr-bearing peralkaline granites), pegmatites, ongonites, cesium glasses, beryllium tuffs, Nb-REE-Zr panteller-ites and comendites, rare metal albite-bearing epheline syenites, REE-bearing carbonatites and magnetite-apatite alkaline volcano-plutonic ro ks. The hydrothermal group comprises hydrothermal deposits of Sn, W, and Mo with a significant enrichment of rare elements (Ta, Li, Be) and fluorine. Rare metal mineralization in both groups is closely related to igneous rocks of a relatively narrow compositional r nge including peralka-line granites, lithium-fluorine granites, leucogranites, nephehne and <b>pseudoleucite</b> syenites, and corresponding volcanic rocks. Four metallogenic epochs of magmatism and associated rare metal mineralization are distinguished: (1) middle Paleozoic, (2) late Paleozoie, (3) early Mesozoic, and (4) late Mesozoic.

40|$|The Morro de São João Alkaline Complex (MSJ) {{is located}} in the NE part of Rio de Janeiro State and shows {{pronounced}} topography, with the following lithology: coarse-grained felsic syenites (K-feldspar, nepheline, hornblende, titanite and <b>pseudoleucite),</b> and mafi c syenites (with K-feldspar, hornblende and piroxene). Petrography and lithogeochemistry data suggest a bimodal suite. Felsic and mafi c magma mixing and mingling textures are locally observed indicating thepresence of coeval magmas. Nd and Sr isotope compositions correspond to EMI (Enriched Mantle I) mantle reservoir signatures,suggesting an asthenospheric enriched mantle source with low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values (from 0. 7049 to 0. 7061) and low 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (from 0. 512361 to 0. 512428). The εNd values range from - 4. 03 to - 5. 54, indicating an anomalous enriched mantle reservoir, confi rmed by the high TDM values between 730 - 830 Ma, very different from the 72 - 56 Ma K-Ar cooling ages. The comparison of Sr and Nd signatures with related hotspot traces (Trindade, St. Helena and Tristan da Cunha) indicates that they {{are similar to those of}} Tristan da Cunha, but somewhat different from those of Trindade and St. Helena...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 Similar to {{the nearby}} Galore Creek deposit, the Copper Canyon {{prospect}} of northwestern British Columbia is a porphyry-type copper-gold-silver occurrence associated with alkalic intrusive rocks of the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic Copper Mountain Suite. A reevaluation of the prospect geology shows that, of the previously recognized orthoclase and/or <b>pseudoleucite</b> porphyry syenite intrusions, mineralization is spatially and temporally associated with a single intrusive phase (unit i 5) and biotite-garnet stockworks. Further, a newly defined unit of pre-mineralization magmatic-hydrothermal intrusive breccia occupies {{the core of the}} prospect and is a favorable host for much of the prospect mineralization. Prospect alteration can be divided into two distinct styles. Calc-potassic alteration consists of K-feldspar, Mg and Fe³-rich (An₂₀) biotite, andradite-rich garnet, hematite, magnetite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, and sphalerite (Zn₉₄₋₉₉, Fe₀. ₅₋₂, Cd₀. ₄₋₁) S and is associated with copper-gold-silver mineralization. Ankerite-sericite-pyrite (± fluorite, albite, anhydrite, pyrite, and trace covellite and bornite) alteration adjoins this core, hosting gold mineralization and insignificant copper. Sulfide-electrum and biotite geothermometry suggest fluid temperatures decreasing from the core (<̲S 550 °C) to distal gold mineralization (<̲ 361 °C). Distal gold mineralization is most likely the result of higher than typical sulfur activity and bisulfide transport of gold...|$|E
40|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks of}} the Bearpaw Mountains {{are part of}} the Montana high-potassium province, emplaced through Archaean rocks of the Wyoming Craton between 54 and 50 Ma ago. Extrusive rocks, dominated by minettes and latites, have a volume of Ü 825 km 3. The minettes range in composition from 20 to 6 % MgO. The more magnesian varieties contain the phenocryst assemblage forsterite + Cr-spinel + diopside ± phlogopite. More evolved rocks are olivine-free, with an assemblage of either salite + phlogopite + <b>pseudoleucite</b> or salite + phlogopite + analcime. The analcime is thought to be secondary after leucite, produced by loss of potassium from the minettes. Mineral chemistry and textures, especially of clinopyroxenes, indicate that mixing between minette magmas of varying degrees of evolution was commonplace. Compositional variation was further extended by accumulation of olivine + spinel + clinopyroxene phenocrysts, and by the preservation of mantle xenocrysts in the minettes. The primary minette magmas are inferred to have had 12 – 14 % MgO and to have been generated at 30 kb from an olivine + diopside + phlogopite-bearing source. The primary magmas evolved dominantly by fractionation of olivine + diopside. The minettes have high contents of large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE), with K 2 O up to 6. 18 %, Ba 5491 ppm, Sr 2291 ppm, and Ce 99 ppm. (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) 0 ranges from 0. 707 to 0. 710 and £Nd varies from – 10 to – 16. These data, plus high LILE/HFSE (high field strength elements) values, are interpreted to show that the minettes contain at least three different mantle components. The lithosphere was initially depleted in Archaean times, but was metasomatically enriched in the Proterozoic and in the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary. The latites have many chemical features in common with the minettes, such as potassic character and high LILE/HFSE values. They formed by fractional crystallization of minette magma in combination with assimilation of crustal rocks; this process enriched the magmas in SiO 2 and raised Na 2 O/K 2 O and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values. Chemical data for phenocrysts and bulk rocks in minettes suggest mixing between minette and latite magmas...|$|E
