40|$|In {{addressing}} the client's needs for both complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) healing methods and psychotherapy (White, 2000; Saks, 2001), the <b>psychotherapist's</b> role is challenged. Research {{is needed in}} this area. From an applied phenomenological perspective, this research explores the problem of integration by interviewing <b>psychotherapists</b> who integrates their accredited psychotherapy and CAM qualifications into one practice. This research aims to ascertain what conscious experiences led these <b>psychotherapists</b> to integrate their two qualifications. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} such <b>psychotherapists</b> and the text was then thematically coded. Themes emerged from this thematic coding that describes the essences of these experiences. Such themes form the results of this dissertation. One of the main results indicated that there was a change in philosophy of life for most of the <b>psychotherapists</b> during their integration processes. Further the process of integration was natural and self-perpetuating and self-reinforcing for these <b>psychotherapists.</b> Mr. R. L. van Nieker...|$|R

40|$|Laypeople and <b>psychotherapists</b> alike tend {{to assume}} that <b>psychotherapists</b> are more {{effective}} than the average population in regulating negative emotions. Being receptive to patients' distress and being able to downregulate negative emotions are important skills for <b>psychotherapists</b> to provide effective help and sustain their own well-being. We investigated whether <b>psychotherapists</b> react to negative material differently and downregulate emotions more effectively than individuals working in other, nontherapeutic, professions. Practicing <b>psychotherapists</b> (n = 21) and a control group of nontherapists (n = 18) were exposed to pictures designed to elicit negative emotions in varying intensities and were asked to rate their emotional response, first after viewing them naturally and then after choosing and applying one of two given regulation strategies (i. e., distraction and reappraisal). Both groups responded similarly in terms of emotional reactivity and strategy choices, but <b>psychotherapists</b> were more effective than nontherapists in reducing their emotional response after applying emotion regulation strategies. We suggest that psychotherapists' comparable emotional reactivity and more effective emotion regulation make them well prepared to provide effective help to patients and safeguard their own well-being...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} how <b>psychotherapists</b> experience using individual, face-to-face {{cognitive behavioural therapy}} (CBT) aimed at alleviating depressive symptoms in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHOD: Semi-structured interviews with three <b>psychotherapists</b> were conducted after CBT with 12 participants with MS, and analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Two main themes emerged: Trusting their expertise as <b>psychotherapists</b> whilst lacking MS-specific knowledge, and The process of exploring the participants' readiness for CBT with modifications of content and delivery. The <b>psychotherapists</b> perceived it difficult to know whether a symptom was attributable to depression or to MS, and for some participants the CBT needed to be adapted to a more concrete content. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Psychotherapists</b> may need more MS-specific knowledge and an insight into the individual's functioning. The content of CBT in terms of concrete home assignments and behavioural activation needs to be individualised...|$|R

In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance as Althea Leasure in Miloš Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, she saw further mainstream success with the release of Hole's third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), which was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards.|$|E

Driven paranoid by repeated shoplifting, Bosco is obsessed with conspiracies, believing that nearly every US government agency, as well as many criminal outfits, are after him. As such, his store is overwhelmed with security devices and contraptions created by Bosco himself. He regularly attempts to disguise himself as a variety of foreign nationals, but to little effect. Further down the neighborhood is Sybil Pandemik, who owns a small office across from Sam and Max. Sybil is unable to keep a consistent job and regularly changes her career choices. Introduced as a <b>psychotherapist,</b> she is noted to have worked as a tattoo artist, software tester, tabloid journalist and professional witness.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Family Studies and Human ServicesSandra StithRecent {{years have}} seen {{a rise in the}} medicalization of {{treatments}} for erectile dysfunction (ED). While there has been a divide between the medical and psychological communities, some have called for a more collaborative relationship. Little research has been done on the collaboration between medical professionals and <b>psychotherapists</b> in treating ED. This study seeks to increase current knowledge about medical professionals’ referral practices and communication post-referral. An online survey was developed and distributed {{to the members of the}} Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMSNA) (N = 541). Survey questions inquired as to the factors that increased participants’ willingness to refer ED patients, the form of communication participants currently desire to have with <b>psychotherapists</b> and the participants’ desired level of communication with <b>psychotherapists</b> to whom they might refer. Less than ten percent of the medical professionals invited to participate in the study completed the survey (n= 50). Those who did complete the survey were primarily male, specialized in urology and practiced in the U. S. Almost half the respondents were employed in an academic setting while just over half of respondents worked in hospital-based, group, or solo practices. Just over half of the survey participants practiced in urban areas. Although the number of medical professionals who completed the survey was small, findings indicated that those who completed a sexual medicine fellowship and who had a larger percentage of their patient population being seen for ED were more likely to refer patients to <b>psychotherapists.</b> Participants who have referred ED patients to <b>psychotherapists</b> reported little-to-no communication between them and the <b>psychotherapists</b> to whom they refer. The study participants expressed a desire to refer patients to <b>psychotherapists</b> who are experienced in working with both sexual and couples issues. Questions about the desires and experiences of medical professionals who have not referred to <b>psychotherapists</b> were not able to be answered because of the limited number of these individuals in the data set. Although the number of participants who completed the survey limits the generalizability of the data, this study demonstrates that most medical professionals who responded to the survey are willing to refer ED patients to <b>psychotherapists...</b>|$|R
