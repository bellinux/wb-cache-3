5000|$|Jay Cooke {{was among}} the investors who in 1864 {{purchased}} the South Mountain Iron Company at Pine Grove Furnace, a charcoal-fired iron operation dating to 1764. The specific reason that Cooke Township was created in 1872 out of previously existing Penn Township (established 1860) is unclear. Jay Cooke lost the company in the Panic of 1873, but bought back {{a major portion of}} it four years later with a group of investors as the South Mountain Mining and Iron Company. [...] He was still a co-owner {{at the time of his}} death. According to the biography by Oberholtzer (who Cooke and his family assisted), Jay Cooke visited Pine Grove Furnace repeatedly. Cooke fished for trout there—he was an avid outdoorsman throughout his life—and he annually brought gifts such as <b>pocket</b> knives and <b>scissors</b> to the small school established there for the workers' children. Cooke Township continues to this day as a very lightly populated but heavily forested area, while the former center of the iron industry within it is now Pine Grove Furnace State Park.|$|R
