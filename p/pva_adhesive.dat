5000|$|The postform {{countertop}} {{is typically}} a high volume factory-produced product, {{which accounts for}} {{the economy of the}} product. The material composition consists of a single thin sheet of laminate (typically [...]030" [...] - [...]040" [...] in thickness) that gets bonded to a 45# density particle board substrate (or other similar base material such as MDF - medium density fiberboard, or plywood), with a <b>PVA</b> <b>adhesive</b> (poly vinyl acetate - a water-based adhesive). Traditionally postform countertops were manufactured with a solvent-based contact cement (a highly flammable, volatile organic compound - VOC). However, in today's marketplace PVA adhesives have taken over for reasons of environmental responsibility (no VOC's), safety (non-combustible), economy, and strength of the glue line.|$|E

However, still remains unclear what adhesion-related changes occur, when the outside factor, i. e. ammonia, affects bonding or what the stability of bonding strength is, when the moisture content of ammonia modified wood increases. The aim of this work was to assess adhesive properties of ammonia modified oak wood and the bonding strength of <b>PVA</b> <b>adhesive</b> and modified wood, and to evaluate suitability and boundaries of <b>PVA</b> <b>adhesive</b> for bonding ammonia modified wood. To explore phenomena of adhesive interface of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) dispersion and modified wood ammonia treated oak was bonded using PVA dispersions manufactured by JSC “Achema”.

40|$|These {{are three}} large format bound volumes of prints, each 77 x 56 cm, made {{especially}} for the Medieval and Historical Bindings in a Modern Design exhibition at Dominik Rostworowski Gallery, Krakow, Poland, May 2006. The research field is bookbinding for a volume of Gus Mazzocca’s prints using ‘lost’ techniques derived from codicology, particularly medieval binding associated with Anton Koburger. Supported by the Academy of the Arts in Krakow, this practice-based research sought to present images by the experimental printmaker Mazzocca as framed prints and contained within a book. A number of medieval bookbinders have developed a flexible binding technique with Anton Koburger, active in Nuremburg between 1478 and 1515, being a focus of study. The conclusion drawn was that for the volume to open flat the boards had to be stable and the spine needed to be round not flat (a relative rarity in medieval bindings). The adhesive (animal glue) needed to be used fresh as it quickly dries, although modern <b>PVA</b> <b>adhesives</b> obviate this difficulty. Linen tapes were laced in and the stitches kept tight. At each tape station the needle dropped down to catch the previous thread. Thread may have been pierced to prevent it running from the needle and silk thread, though used, left openings. Dividers may have been employed for measuring the vellum prior to cutting. Bone folders were commonly used to assist in adhering the vellum to the boards without creasing. These were the major principles that informed the binding of Mazzocca’s prints. The volume withstood many openings during the exhibition at the Dominic Rostworowski Gallery without any damage. It could even be opened board-to-board, permitting unimpeded visual access to the viewer.

ABSTRACT: Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) are the polymers of great interest because of many desirable characteristics. They {{can be used for}} many purposes. One of the major uses of these polymers is they can be used to produce adhesives for paper converting, packaging and laminating. The purpose of this work is to develop a suitable process for producing PVA based adhesives. In this work, both polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl alcohol adhesives were prepared. Adhesives were prepared by the polymerization and alcoholysis of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). Different performance tests were conducted after preparing these adhesives. In this study it was found that better quality adhesives can be prepared from polyvinyl alcohol. Different performance tests were conducted on the adhesives prepared. It was found from the performance tests that polyvinyl alcohol adhesive is the best adhesive {{that can be used for}} lamination. Drying time for polyvinyl alcohol was found 12. 9 minutes which was better than polyvinyl acetate adhesives. Moreover, pull-off test shows that maximum allowable pressure for <b>PVA</b> <b>adhesive</b> is higher than PVAc adhesives and the value is 195 psi...|$|E
40|$|A wood surface, {{which is}} exposed to a high {{temperature}} condition, can experience inactivation. Surface inactivation results in reduced ability of an adhesive to properly wet, flow, penetrate, and cure. Thus, an inactivated wood surface does not bond well with adhesives. The changes in surface chemistry, wettability, and adhesion of inactivated wood surfaces, including heartwood of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and southern pine (Pinus taeda), were studied. Wood samples were dried from the green moisture content condition in a convection oven at five different temperature levels ranging from 50 to 200 °C. The comparative characterization of the surface was done by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), sessile drop wettability, and fracture testing of adhesive bonds. The oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) decreasedand the C 1 /C 2 ratio increased with drying temperature. The C 1 component is related to carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds, and the C 2 component represents single carbon-oxygen bond. A low O/C ratio and a high C 1 /C 2 ratio reflected {{a high concentration of}} non-polar wood components (extractives/VOCs) on the wood surface, which modified the wood surface from hydrophilic to more hydrophobic. Wettability was directly related to the O/C ratio and inversely related to the C 1 /C 2 ratio. Contact angle decreased with time and increased with the temperature of exposure. Southern pine had a lower wettability than yellow-poplar, which was due to a greater concentration of non-polar hydrocarbon-type extractives and heat-generated volatiles on the surface. Solvent extraction prior to drying did not improved wettability, whereas, extraction after drying improved wettability. A contribution of extractives migration and VOCs generation {{played a significant role in}} the heat-induced inactivation process of southern pine. The maximum strain energy release rate (Gmax) showed that surface inactivation was insignificant for was most susceptible to inactivation at drying temperatures > 156 °C, particularly when bonded with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) adhesive. Chemical treatments improved the wettability of inactivated wood surfaces, but an improvement in adhesion was not evident for specimens bonded with polyvinyl-acetate (<b>PVA)</b> <b>adhesive.</b> NaOH surface treatment was most effective for improving adhesion of the PF adhesive bond. yellow-poplar when exposed to drying temperatures < 187 °C.

40|$|In {{the paper}} it is {{proposed}} to use fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors {{to monitor the}} deformation and strain in a woven textile. Non-contact digital image correlation (DIC) is used to validate the results. The principal objective {{of the work in}} this paper is to identify a suitable adhesive for attaching the FBG sensors to tapestries and textiles. To do this, the interfacial interactions of the optical fibre, the textile material and the necessary adhesive must be considered. The performance of two types of adhesive are studied: a <b>PVA</b> conservation <b>adhesive</b> and a two-part epoxy adhesive Araldite 2015. The effect of the application of the adhesives on the mechanical response of the textile is investigated. Full-field stain maps are obtained from the DIC and are used as the basis to characterise the behaviour of the FBG sensors/adhesive system. The strain transfer coefficients and a reinforcement factor are determined under quasi-static conditions. It is shown that the local reinforcement introduced is more significant in the specimen with the FBG bonded using the Araldite adhesive than those with conservation adhesives. Nevertheless, the Araldite adhesive has a better strain transfer coefficient than the conservation adhesive, although not as high as that expect with conventional engineering materials...|$|R

PVA film solubility was tested in water and in cell compatible media. Various methods for stabilizing PVA films were investigated, hoping that they would show desirable dissolution profiles. The cell repellent properties of prepared films were assessed using HeLa cells. During solubility tests, a flaw was discovered and corrected in the previously established dissolution investigation method using wafers as substrates. None of the attempted preparation methods resulted in PVA films that had ideal dissolution profiles. At best, films would either dissolve completely or stabilize {{after only a few}} minutes. No method for reversing the PVA-film stabilization succeeded either. Thus new preparation and stabilization methods for PVA films should be investigated. </p...|$|R
