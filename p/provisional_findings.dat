40|$|Lewy’s {{phase shift}} {{hypothesis}} (PSH) of {{seasonal affective disorder}} (SAD) asserts that winter depression is caused by an abnormal delay of circadian phase in winter. The {{aim of this study}} was to further investigate the PSH by testing the novel hypothesis that winter pattern seasonality of mood in the general population is associated with a phase delay of circadian rhythms in winter. Using a random community sample of 244 adults in Melbourne, seasonality of mood was measured prospectively as the within-subject difference between self-reports of behavioural engagement in summer and winter across 3 years. The Horne–Ostberg Morningness–Eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) was used as a self-report estimate of circadian phase. Phase delay in winter was measured as the within-subject difference between summer and winter estimates of circadian phase, with relative shifts towards Eveningness being interpreted as phase delay. As expected, a significant association was found between winter pattern seasonality of mood and within-subject phase delay in winter(r 50. 17, P, 0. 01). Limitations: Circadian phase was operationalised on the MEQ. While a number of studies have shown the MEQ to correlate with physiological measures of circadian phase, the findings await replication using a more direct measure of the circadian system. A positive association was found between lowered mood in winter and winter phase delay amongst a random community sample. This <b>provisional</b> <b>finding</b> adds support to Lewy’s PSH by demonstrating that phase delay may be causally important not just in clinical cases of SAD, but across the continuum of mood seasonality...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, {{strategic}} {{management and}} corporate entrepreneurship are combined {{in a single}} empirical research investigating the influence of business strategic management practices on organisational entrepreneurial orientation. Understanding this relationship has progressively become crucial in today’s hypercompetitive global environment where businesses, regardless of national location, size, age and industry, are facing incessant and dynamic change. Specifically, the influence of strategic management practices on corporate entrepreneurship in medium to large corporations in the financial and business services sector in South Africa is analysed by testing hypotheses that predict the relationship between strategic management dimensions of locus of planning, scanning intensity, planning flexibility, planning horizon, and strategy control attributes, and entrepreneurial orientation. By applying factor, cluster and multiple regression statistical analyses, the study made four key findings. First, the results confirm that selected dimensions of strategic management practices influence the entrepreneurial orientation of firms. This in turn effect the position a firm occupies along a conceptual conservative-entrepreneurial continuum. Second, the study indicates that firms with perceived higher entrepreneurial orientation exhibit better performance measures. This finding supports the thesis that entrepreneurial orientation is an integral component for business performance in attaining sustainable competitive advantage, achieving above-average earnings and wealth creation. Third, a methodology that combined strategic management and corporate entrepreneurship in a single research generated new knowledge confirming that entrepreneurial orientation is a key construct in both subdisciplines. Fourth, {{the results show that}} divergent organisational entrepreneurial orientation profiles help in classifying firms along the entrepreneurial continuum. Furthermore, the research made a <b>provisional</b> <b>finding</b> that there are four possible distinct and excusive clusters of business groups along the conservative-entrepreneurial continuum in determining corporate entrepreneurial orientation in organisation...|$|R

40|$|Private-sector {{involvement}} in the construction and operation of roads is growing {{around the world and}} private toll roads are seen as a useful tool in the battle against congestion. Yet serious concerns remain about exercise of monopoly power if private operators can set tolls freely. A number of theoretical studies have investigated private toll-road pricing strategies, and compared them with first-best and second-best public tolls. But most of the analyses have employed simple road networks and/or used static models that do not capture the temporal dimension of congestion or describe the impacts of tolling schemes that vary by time of day. This paper takes a fresh look at private toll road pricing using METROPOLIS: a dynamic traffic simulator that treats endogenously choices of transport mode, departure time and route at the level of individual travellers. Simulations are performed for the peak-period morning commute on a stylized urban road network with jobs concentrated towards the centre of the city. Tolling scenarios are defined in terms of what is tolled (traffic lanes, whole links, or toll rings) and how tolls are varied over time. Three administration regimes are compared. The first two are the standard polar cases: social surplus maximization by a public-sector operator, and unconstrained profit maximization by a private-sector operator. The third regime entails varying tolls in steps to eliminate queuing on the tolled links. It is a form of third-best tolling that could be implemented either by a public operator or by the private sector under quality-of-service regulation. Amongst the results it is found that the no-queue tolling regime performs favourably compared to public step tolling, and invariably better than private tolling. Another <b>provisional</b> <b>finding</b> is that a private operator has less incentive than does a public operator to implement time-of-day congestion pricing. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{implement}} a new {{method by which}} to study the faint end of the field star luminosity function. The method relies on deep, multicolor photometry of fields projected against highly obscured, nearby molecular clouds. The clouds act as nearby opaque screens and delimit a well-defined survey volume which is in principle free {{of the problem of}} distinguishing nearby, intrinsically faint dwarf stars from more distant red giants. This study is based upon deep photographic and CCD photometry at optical (V, R, I) bandpasses toward the most highly obscured portions of the Taurus and Ophiuchus molecular clouds. The total volume delimited by the clouds is approximately 200 cu pc. Within this region our survey is complete for all stars brighter than M(sub V) = 16 - 17 mag; at R and I, the survey is complete down to the lowest mass stars capable of sustaining core hydrogen burning. We estimate the faint end of the field star luminosity function for the composite Taurus and Ophiuchus foreground sample and find that it resembles the local luminosity function down to M(sub V) approx. 16. At still fainter magnitudes we find more stars than do photometric parallex studies of the polar regions. This difference widens dramatically if even the simplest correction for incompleteness is applied to our data. We therefore tentatively conclude that the luminosity function rises beyond M(sub V) approx. 16; even if we discard our attempts to correct for incompleteness in the faintest magnitude bins, the luminosity function at least remains flat for the lowest mass stars. Our <b>provisional</b> <b>finding</b> that the luminosity function rises beyond its well-known peak at M(sub V) approx. 12 - 13, implies that the initial mass function (IMF) probably rises beyond the turnover point associated with this peak. Even if our most conservative estimate for the faint end of the luminosity function is used-in which no corrections are made for incompleteness-the IMF must at least remain flat down {{to the edge of the}} hydrogen-burning main sequence...|$|R
40|$|We {{implement}} a new {{method by which}} to study the faint end of the field star luminosity function. The method relies on deep, multicolor photometry of fields projected against highly obscured, nearby molecular clouds. The clouds act as nearly opaque screens and delimit a well-defined survey sample volume free {{of the problem of}} distinguishing nearby, intrinsically faint dwarf stars from more distant red giants. We demonstrate that with this technique it is possible to probe the faint end of the field star luminosity function down to the hydrogen-burning main sequence out to distances much further than have been previously attempted. ^ This study is based upon deep photographic and CCD photometry at optical (V, R, I) bandpasses towards the most obscured portions of the Taurus and Ophiuchus molecular clouds. The fields comprise a total area of ∼ 0. 63 square degrees, and the total volume delimited by the cloud distances is ∼ 198 pc 3. Within this volume, the survey is complete for all stars brighter than M v = 16 - 17 mag; at R and I, the survey is complete down to the lowest mass stars capable of sustaining core hydrogen burning. ^ Color-color criteria are used to distinguish between background, highly reddened stars and stars located in front of the clouds. The method of photometric parallax is used to deduce the absolute magnitude and spectral type of those stars found to lie in front of the luminosity function rises beyond M v∼ 16; there appears to be little double that the luminosity function at least remains flat for the lowest mass stars. ^ Our <b>provisional</b> <b>finding</b> that the luminosity function rises again beyond its well-known peak at M v∼ 12 - 13, also implies that the IMF probably rises beyond the turnover point associated with this peak.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the extraordinary political swing {{that occurred in the}} Durham coalfield in the 1931 general election. Having won all eleven county seats in 1929, Labour lost all but two in 1931. This was despite the dominance of the coal industry, the strength of the miners' union, and the increasing pre-eminence of Durham's Labour organization. While the circumstances of the election certainly motivated a traditional anti-socialist base, the article suggests that previous explanations have failed to acknowledge the extent to which mining constituents may also have been responsible for the result. Rather than any uniform political identity amongst the mining community, it finds that allegiances were fluid and complex, swayed by factors such as political charisma (particularly with regard to Ramsay MacDonald, re-elected at Seaham), specific local concerns, and paternalistic loyalties. In doing so, it reveals the fragility of the Labour Party's appeal even amongst its ‘core’ supporters. The National success in 1931 demonstrated that Labour's dominance in Durham remained recent, limited and as yet <b>provisional,</b> a <b>finding</b> that has significant implications for the wider picture of Labour's national advance, revealing that Labour's progress in the inter-war years was conditional and erratic even in its most ‘natural’ strongholds...|$|R

40|$|Inflation {{during the}} Napoleonic wars {{is a widely}} {{investigated}} and interesting case study; it generated a fantastic contemporary theoretical debate, which per se is a stimulating subject, ad provides a revealing perspective on more generic topics such as the gold standard, the Bank of England behaviour {{and the level of}} price. The bullionist position had a short-living initial victory, but since Tookes study, the anti-bullionist perspective dominated the scene and remained relatively unchallenged. Although still <b>provisional,</b> our <b>findings</b> are in contrast with the outcome of the two centuries-long debate and provide a possible solution to this puzzle. Granger tests show very little about the causal relation between paper issue of the Bank of England and price levels and no definitive answer can be inferred by these measurements. The structure of monetary payments of the time, however, suggests that the use of the Bank of England issue could be a poor and misleading proxy of the amount of monetary means. Problems with the estimations of both gold coins and country bank issue do not allow providing a better proxy. The solution we found is to use, instead, the level of advances and discounts. This variable shows a higher level of long-term correlation with prices as well as better results when used to run Granger test with price changes. Granger causality from price to currency does not emerge, but the opposite relation stands, at least with broader interval of confidence. ...|$|R
