The effects of hollow ratio on the radial stiffness of bearings, the maximum contact stress of rollers, and the maximum radial load of bearing are analyzed. The analysis results show that the smaller the hollowness is, the larger the radial stiffness of <b>pre-loaded</b> cylindrical roller <b>bearings,</b> the maximum contact stress of the rollers, and the maximum radial load of the bearing would be. Under different magnitude loads, the reasonable combination of interference magnitude with the hollowness can not only increase the stiffness of roller bearings, but also decrease the maximum stress of rollers, which provides a reference for the design and manufacture of <b>pre-loaded</b> cylindrical roller <b>bearings...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the machine lay-out of a scale based stand-alone design, presently under construction, aimed at an accuracy of 25 nm in a 50 × 50 × 4 mm 3 volume. The scales have 1 nm resolution and are direct driven by single phase, linear DC motors. In the horizontal plane an air bearing guide system is used with separate stress frames for <b>bearing</b> <b>pre-load</b> forces. The elastically guided vertical z-axis has 4 mm stroke and is measuring in Abbe. It is thermally-, weight- and stiffness compensated and mounted statically determined on the x, y scale carrying beams. Compared to CMMs with a vertical air bearing guide system, {{the mass of}} the guides and their vertical drive offset was reduced significantly. A large improvement in system dynamics features a lowest eigenfrequency (rotation mode around the z-axis) of about 60 Hz. The uncertainty of a volumetric length measurement, due to residual geometric errors, will be about ± 20 nm...|$|R
40|$|Linear aerostatic {{bearings}} {{are frequently}} used in high precision stages for their advantageous bearing properties, with low friction and absence of stick-slip being most notable. To improve relatively low out-of-plane stiffness of air <b>bearings,</b> <b>pre-loading</b> is applied. A common method of pre-loading is by utilizing vacuum, where a constant vacuum force decreases film height resulting in increased stiffness. Other methods for increasing stiffness are available, {{which is an}} active field of research. However, high stiffness results in strong coupling between bearing and running surface, transferring unwanted external vibrations. The amount of vibration transfer is quantified as transmissibility, which is the ratio of displacements between coupled surfaces. This property is frequency dependent. To reduce disturbance from external vibrations, this research focusses on reducing air bearing stiffness by combining pressurized and vacuum bearing pads, which to {{the knowledge of the}} author has not yet been researched. To analyse stiffness behaviour, air bearings have been modelled based on Reynolds equation. The effect of a vibrating running surface is modelled by linear perturbation of Reynolds equation. Resulting equations have been solved with a self developed finite volume method code, resulting in air film stiffness and damping as a function of frequency in an computationally efficient manner. Two combinations of thrust and vacuum bearings with a stable low stiffness operating point have been designed with the developed models. By offsetting vacuum and thrust surfaces or by using a micrometer pocket in the thrust bearing surface, vacuum and thrust stiffness cancel out, creating a range of low stiffness between regions with higher stiffness. To validate the models, air bearings have been manufactured. Measurements on restrictor properties have shown the literature model to be invalid for realistic pressure drops. Without taking the measured restrictor behaviour into account, model and measurement will not match. Also shown is that controlling surfaces flatness is essential for predictable bearing behaviour. Performance of available production methods is thoroughly researched. Model and measurement correspondence can only be achieved by taking surface properties into account. Also, the low tip-tilt stiffness of a single air bearing has been found to negatively effect measurements on film height. By using three bearings in the measurement set-up, tip-tilt stiffness has been significantly increased. This reduces measurement uncertainty. By taking these findings into account, excellent agreement between measurements and model has been achieved. This clears the way for development of a low stiffness prototype, combining thrust and vacuum bearings. Ideas on model improvement and prototype development are shared in the recommendations.

40|$|In recent years, the {{manufacturing}} industry has seen {{an increase in}} demand for micro-components in biomedical, opto-mechatronics, and automotive applications. Traditional machine tools {{are no longer a}} viable solution to meet the tolerances required by the customers. Hence, new ultra-precision machine tools have emerged with nanometer level accuracy in response to these demands. This thesis presents a novel ultra-precision machine tool with the intent {{to bridge the gap between}} traditional machine tools with larger work volumes and lower accuracy, and ultra-precision machine tools with high accuracy and small work volumes. The machine was designed using a T-type gantry and worktable configuration with a precision ground granite base, to achieve a work area of 300 x 300 mm 2, with a maximum velocity of 1 m/s and a maximum acceleration of 10 m/s 2. Actuation is provided by direct drive linear motors with high resolution feedback supplied by 4 µm grating linear encoders with 4096 x interpolation. Aerostatic porous bearings are employed to reduce the effect of friction while maintain high stiffness of the guideways and structure. A Vacuum <b>Pre-Loaded</b> (VPL) air <b>bearing</b> supports the worktable on the granite, decoupling vertical load from the gantry. Thermal error reduction is achieved using environmental temperature control (20 ± 0. 2 °C) to help reduce thermal errors. As well, internally cooled couplings were designed to remove heat generated by the motors, thus further reducing the effects that contribute to thermal error. The target static stiffness of the machine was 50 N/µm and was measured to be 22. 2 N/µm and 23. 9 N/µm in the x and y axes respectively. Frequency response experiments were used to identify the open-loop transfer functions for each axis. A multivariable framework was implemented for the y-axis due to the cross coupling between the primary and secondary motors of the gantry. Two prominent vibration modes were identified at 68 Hz and 344 Hz. The first mode is attributed to the rigid body yaw mode of the gantry while the higher frequency is related to the bending mode of the beam. The first mode of the x-axis is seen at 220 Hz. A state space, active mode compensation control law was developed for the y-axis, in collaboration with Mr. Daniel Gordon, which eliminates the effects of the 68 Hz mode, allowing for high performance from the motors. The following error during a high speed (200 mm/s) test was measured at 2. 74 µm and 2. 41 µm in the x and y axes respectively. Metrology tests using laser interferometry were performed in accordance with international and American metrology standards for linear positioning, vertical and horizontal straightness, and yaw and pitch errors. The results will be used for geometric error compensation in future work. Finally, an overall error budget is presented with focus on the geometric, dynamic, servo, and thermal errors, where the maximum static resultant error of the machine was estimated to be 1. 44 µm, and the maximum dynamic resultant error of 3. 69 µm...|$|R
40|$|Damage {{resulting}} from an interaction with lightning current {{in a military}} naval vessel, especially in a conflict zone {{and at the time}} of a conflict, which leads to the incapacitation of vital activities on the ship, is unacceptable. Because many potential conflict zones are in littoral areas, and because of the increase in lightning activity, both now and expected in the years to come, the provision of protection for naval vessels sailing in those waters should be a high priority. The fact that many standards exclude both naval vessels and the littoral area transforms this work into a potential contemporary solution. With the knowledge about the formation of charge layers in the atmosphere, and about the influence such weather phenomena as fog, clouds, and aerosols have on the transport of additional charge particles, it is possible to understand the formation of lightning. A review of the existing thunderstorm prediction models, and finding a way to verify and update the accuracy of such, is equally important at this stage. Merely understanding the root cause of the problem will not be enough to solve the problem, and therefore an extensive evaluation of the available literature, with a special attention to standards, also has to take place. Evaluating risks and finding what was previously accomplished by others, and any stones they have left unturned, can improve the life expectancy of a system or building block when applying and improving the existing technology. Conventional lightning protection measures serve as points of departure to reach the goals of this research. Such issues as positioning, zoning, and proximity to other components more attractive to lightning strikes must not be overlooked since these are equally important. The rolling sphere concept, as described in civil standards, is applied to naval vessels, and serves now as a basic tool within THALES to estimate the risk of lightning, and possible damage and/or interference. Steps taken by other branches of industry in this direction is investigated too. Investigation and a thorough analysis of other protective methods will help to generate the right ideas to tackle the issue and to improve lightning protection of electronics enclosed by composite structures against both direct contact with the lightning current, and the indirect effects of the associated electric and magnetic fields. Diverters are used by the aircraft industry and the possible use to protect radars under a composite non-conducting radome has been investigated experimentally. The constant increase in our dependency on composite panels throughout many branches of industry, including the naval and maritime sectors, make it necessary to quantify and measure all the risks associated with lightning strikes. Evaluating risks, and where necessary fixing them, will guarantee the successful use of this technology. The lack of shielding properties, and the high likelihood of deterioration and damage {{as a result of a}} lightning attachment, mean improvements are essential to make the use of complete fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite structures completely safe. A novel idea has been presented, and evaluated via modelling and simulation, as well as via experiments, where the shielding properties of thin materials is used in combination with the coupling of the electromagnetic field, as generated by the lightning strike, into cabling. It has been shown that a smart combination of the shielding and coupling aspects can be very beneficial. Another novel concept is the use of <b>pre-loading</b> of ball <b>bearings.</b> This <b>pre-loading</b> results in a continuous conducting path between the rotating and static part, such that no sparks and hence no damage will occur.
