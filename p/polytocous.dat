40|$|The {{litter size}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} determinants of mammalian life-histories. Depending on the size of the litter, the mammals can be divided into two main groups: (1) the monotocous mammals, producing only one offspring per litter; and (2) the <b>polytocous</b> mammals, producing more than one offspring per litter. This life-history dichotomy entails different strategies whereby the mammalian females may optimize their maternal investment. The aim of this Ph. D. thesis is to show variation in the maternal investment strategies of monotocous and <b>polytocous</b> mammals from a life-history perspective. In order to address this issue, I investigated the strategy of maternal investment in the red deer (Cervus elaphus), representing a typical monotocous mammal, and the house mouse (Mus musculus), representing a typical <b>polytocous</b> mammal. From a life-history perspective, the red deer, producing no more than one litter per year, can be viewed as a model of "K-selected species", while the house mouse, producing up to ten litters per year, can be viewed as a model of "r- selected species". The red deer and the house mouse are ideal model organisms for this type of research also because they both are representatives of the most common mammalian mating system - the simultaneous polygyny. A general assumption of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{considered}} the first dealt with Trivers-Willard hypothesis in China using a wildlife population of plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) by which we have investigated the relationship between maternal quality, litter sex ratio and litter size in a <b>polytocous</b> mammal. The {{results indicated that the}} reproductive time significantly affected the litter sex ratio. Although, the concentration of female adult plasma Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Glucagon (Glu) at gestation, body weight, ear length, rear foot length and body length of adult female after gestation did not affect the litter sex ratio however, litter size has a significant negative impact on the litter sex ratio and body weight of adult females {{have a significant effect on}} the litter size. These results might give some evidence for the Trivers-Willard hypothesis in <b>polytocous</b> mammals...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} traits for both animal science and livestock production is the number of offspring for a species. This study was performed to identify differentially evolved genes and their distinct functions that influence the number of offspring at birth by comparative analysis of eight monotocous mammals and seven <b>polytocous</b> mammals in a number of scopes: specific amino acid substitution with site-wise adaptive evolution, gene expansion and specific orthologous group. The mutually exclusive amino acid substitution among the 16 mammalian species identified five candidate genes. These genes were both directly and indirectly related to ovulation. Furthermore, in monotocous mammals, the EPH gene family was found to have undergone expansion. Previously, the EPHA 4 gene was found to positively affect litter size in pigs and supports the possibility of the EPH gene playing a role in determining the number of offspring per birth. The identified genes in this study offer a basis from which the differences between monotocous and <b>polytocous</b> species can be studied. Furthermore, these genes may harbor some clues to the underlying mechanism, which determines litter size and may prove useful for livestock breeding strategies...|$|E

Here, we show that the distribution of alloparental care by non-breeding subordinates is associated with habitats where annual rainfall is low. A possible reason for this association is that the females of species found in arid environments are usually <b>polytocous</b> and this may have facilitated the evolution of alloparental care.

40|$|In mammals, {{litter size}} {{is a highly}} {{variable}} trait. Some species such as humans or cattle are monotocous, with one or sometimes two newborns per birth, whereas others, the <b>polytocous</b> species such as mice or pigs, are highly prolific and often produce a dozen newborns at each farrowing. In monotocous species, however, two or three newborns per birth may sometime be unwanted. In more <b>polytocous</b> species such as sheep or pigs, litter size is studied {{in order to increase}} livestock prolificacy. By contrast, twinning rates in humans or cattle may increase birth difficulties and health problems in the newborns. In this context, the aim of our review was to provide a clearer understanding of the genetic and physiological factors that control multiple births in low-ovulating mammalian species, with particular focus on three species: sheep, cattle, and humans, where knowledge of the ovulation rate in one may enlighten findings in the others. This article therefore reviews the phenotypic and genetic variability observed with respect to ovulation and twinning rates. It then presents the QTL and major genes that have been identified in each species. Finally, we draw a picture of the diversity of the physiological mechanisms underlying multiple ovulation. Although several major genes have been discovered in sheep, QTL detection methods in humans or cattle have suggested that the determinism of litter size is complex and probably involves several genes in order to explain variations in the number of ovulations...|$|E
40|$|Natal {{features}} (e. g. Julian {{birth date}} and birth mass) often have fitness consequences {{and can be}} influenced by endogenous responses by the mother to seasonal fluctuations in nutritional quality and photoperiodic cues. We sought to further understand the biological and environmental factors that influence the natal features of a <b>polytocous</b> species in an environment with constant nutritional resources and limited seasonal variation. During a 36 -year study we assessed the influence of biological factors (maternal age and litter type [i. e., litter size and sexual composition]) and environmental factors (total precipitation and mean maximum temperature during months encompassing conception, the last trimester of gestation, and {{the entire length of}} gestation) on Julian birth date and birth mass using linear-mixed effects models. Linear and quadratic functions of maternal age influenced both natal features with earliest Julian birth dates and heaviest birth masses occurring at prime-age and older individuals, which ranged from 5 - 9 years of age. Litter type influenced Julian birth date and birth mass. Interestingly, environmental factors affected Julian birth date and birth mass even though mothers were continuously allowed access to a high-quality diet. Random effects revealed considerable variation among mothers and years. This study demonstrates that, in long-lived <b>polytocous</b> species, environmental factors may have a greater influence on natal features than previously supposed and the influence from biological factors is also complex. The documented responses to environmental influences provide unique insights into how mammalian seasonal reproductive dynamics may respond to current changes in climate...|$|E
40|$|In <b>polytocous</b> mammals, the {{sex ratio}} during {{gestation}} can influence {{a variety of}} morphological, physiological, and life-history traits because of steroid leakage between fetuses. Similar phenomena have also recently been described for a viviparous lizard. Some of these effects have important fitness consequences by influencing reproductive success later in life. Thus, biasing the sex ratio toward one sex {{may lead to a}} decreased fitness for the other sex, and therefore constrain the evolution of skewed sex ratios. By incorporating effects of sex ratio on offspring fitness in a simple sex-allocation model, I show that, under some circumstances (1) skewed sex ratios are predicted to evolve, and (2) this cost can constrain the evolution of skewed sex ratios...|$|E
40|$|Males {{and females}} often have {{different}} requirements during early development, leading to sex-specific interactions between developing offspring. In <b>polytocous</b> mammals, competition for limited resources in utero may be asymmetrical between the sexes, and androgens produced by male foetuses could have {{adverse effects on}} the development of females, with potentially long-lasting consequences. We show here, in an unmanaged population of Soay sheep, that female lambs with a male co-twin have reduced birth weight relative to those with a female co-twin, while there was no such effect in male twins. In addition, females with a male co-twin had lower lifetime breeding success, which appeared to be mainly driven by differences in first-year survival. These results show that sex-specific sibling interactions can have long-term consequences for survival and reproduction, with potentially important implications for optimal sex allocation...|$|E
40|$|I {{should like}} to raise two main points in {{connection}} with the recent note by Bernstein (1995). Firstly, the possible genetic control of human sex ratio and secondly, the variances of the distributions of the combinations of the sexes in human sibships and in litters of <b>polytocous</b> mammals. Possible genetic control of human sex ratio Bernstein's suggestion that there is some genetic control of sex ratio is supported by the evidence that some parental HLA genes may partially control offspring sex ratios. Ivanyi et al (1972) reported that in the mouse 'a genetic factor identical with, or closely linked to, the H- 2 system is involved in the control of sex hormone metabolism'. On the basis of this, they made a remarkable prediction: 'If the situation in histocompatibility genetics and associated traits in man is analogous with that seen in the mouse, a great numbe...|$|E
40|$|During {{embryonic}} development, offspring {{are exposed}} to hormones of both maternal and sibling origin. Maternal stress increases offspring exposure to corticosterone, and, in <b>polytocous</b> animals, the sex ratio or intrauterine position can influence the levels of androgens and estrogens experienced by the offspring. Such hormone exposure {{has the potential to}} influence many important morphological and behavioural aspects of offspring, in particular sexually dimorphic traits. Although well known in rodents, the impact of prenatal hormone exposure in other vertebrates is poorly documented. We experimentally investigated the relationship between maternal stress, population density, sex ratio (a surrogate for the degree of exposure to steroids produced by siblings), and sexual dimorphism in a viviparous lizard, Lacerta vivipara. Our results show that prenatal sex ratios have consequences for sexually dimorphic morphology (ventral scale count) in both sexes, but with no effect of maternal stress or any interaction between the two. Embryonic steroid exposure can potentially be an important factor in generating individual variation in natural populations of viviparous animals...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of mouse plasma LH, FSH. {{prolactin}} (PRL) and progesterone {{were measured}} throughout pregnancy {{in a small}} litter size line (CN-) in which prenatal mortality is markedly increased especially at the postimplantation stage.

Levels of FSH and progesterone, however, were lower in the CN- than in line C {{during the second half of}} pregnancy. Gonadotropin administration from days 6 through 12 was ineffective in reducing prenatal losses in line CN-, whereas progesterone treatment reduced fetal losses to the level found in line C. Litter size in <b>polytocous</b> species is depend-ent upon the number of ova shed and the proportion of these represented by normal fetuses at birth. Variations in litter size have occurred in mouse strains selected for ovula-tion rate (Falconer, 1960), directly selected for litter size (Falconer, 1960 : Bateman, 1966), and as a correlated response to selec-tion for growth rate or body size (MacArthur...|$|E
40|$|The {{peptide hormone}} INSL 3 is uniquely {{produced}} by the fetal testis to promote the transabdominal phase of testicular descent. Because it is fetal sex specific, and is present in only very low amounts in the maternal circulation, INSL 3 acts as an ideal biomarker with which to monitor the movement of fetal hormones within the pregnant uterus of a <b>polytocous</b> species, the pig. INSL 3 production by the fetal testis begins at around GD 30. At GD 45 of the ca. 114 day gestation, a time at which testicular descent is promoted, INSL 3 evidently moves from male to female allantoic compartments, presumably impacting also on the female fetal circulation. At later time-points (GD 63, GD 92) there is less inter-fetal transfer, although there still appears to be significant INSL 3, presumably of male origin, in the plasma of female fetuses. This study thus provides evidence for substantial transfer of a peptide hormone between fetuses, and probably also across the placenta, emphasizing {{the vulnerability of the}} fetus to extrinsic hormonal influences within the uterus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Multiple mating and {{multiple}} paternity in <b>polytocous</b> {{species have been}} mostly studied from an adaptive (i. e., cost– benefit) perspective. Disease, time, energy, {{and the risk of}} injuries are well-known costs of multiple mating, yet from both male and female perspectives, a number of genetic and non-genetic bene-fits have also been identified. The effects of environmental conditions and individual-specific behavior, however, are much less well understood. Using a long-term study on yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris), we evaluated the impacts of environmental variation, social structure, female body mass, and female docility (a personality trait) on the occurrence of multiple paternity. Multiple paternity was influenced by environmental constraints, social constraints, a female’s personality, and her body mass at emergence from hibernation. Personality and mass effects were detected only when environmental or social condi-tionswere favorable. Our results suggest that multiple paternity is mainly limited by the opportunity to have access to multiple mates and is influenced by costs or mate choice because heavier females {{were more likely to have}} litters with multiple sires than smaller ones. Future studies in other species might benefit from considering environmental constraints when studying multiple paternity...|$|E
40|$|In {{polygynous}} mammals, males generally benefit {{more from}} extra allocation of maternal resources than females. However, limitations to sex-specific allocation are usually ignored. We propose the ‘allocation constraint’ hypothesis, whereby maternal resource allocation {{is more likely}} to follow life-history predictions in single sex litters than in mixed sex litters, due to limitations in prenatal resource targeting. Consequently, for polygynous species, males in mixed litters are likely to receive suboptimal maternal investment, which may {{have a negative effect on}} lifetime reproductive success. We test this hypothesis for the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica), a highly polygynous species with the highest level of maternal allocation reported among ungulates. At such high reproductive output levels, the limitations on additional investment in males are likely to be particularly acute. However, we demonstrate high levels of sexual dimorphism in both late-stage foetuses and newborn calves, including within the same litter. Male twins with a brother tended to be heavier than those with a sister. This may be due to allocation constraints or differences in maternal quality. We conclude that an explicit focus on potential constraints can enhance the progress in the field of sex-specific maternal allocation in <b>polytocous</b> species...|$|E
40|$|Female {{promiscuity}} {{is widespread}} among mammals, although its function is poorly understood. Recently, much interest has been {{generated by the}} hypothesis that female promiscuity, combined with post-copulatory paternity-biasing mechanisms, may function to reduce the costs of reproductive failure resulting from genetic incompatibility. Here, a comparative approach is used to determine if average rates of reproductive failure differ for <b>polytocous</b> mammal species with contrasting levels of female multiple-mating behaviour. After control for phylogeny, promiscuous species {{were found to have}} significantly lower rates of early reproductive failure than monogamous and polygynous species, in which females are relatively monandrous. Monandrous females appear to compensate for higher early reproductive failure with increased ova production, and thus produce comparable average litter sizes to those of more promiscuous females. However, there is significantly more variation around the average litter sizes produced by relatively monandrous females. These findings are broadly consistent with predictions of the genetic incompatibility avoidance hypothesis, although it is emphasized that alternative explanations cannot be ruled out {{on the basis of the}} comparative evidence presented. Further studies are needed to explore ecological correlates of multiple-mating behaviour, to investigate potential post-copulatory paternity-biasing mechanisms, and to identify the causes of reproductive failure in natural mammal populations...|$|E
40|$|In many species, {{females have}} evolved {{behavioral}} strategies {{to reduce the}} risk of infanticide. For instance, polyandry can create paternity confusion that inhibits males from killing offspring they could have sired. Here, the authors propose that females could socially obtain the same benefits by nesting communally. Singly sired litters could be perceived as a large multiply sired litter once pooled together in a single nest. Long-term data from a wild house mouse population showed that monandrous litters (singly sired) were more common in communal than in solitary nests and 85 % of them were raised with litters sired by different males hence becoming effectively polyandrous (multiply sired). These socially polyandrous litters had significantly higher offspring survival than genetically or socially monandrous litters and reached a similar survival to that of multiply sired litters raised in solitary or communal nests. Furthermore, the number of sires within nests significantly improved offspring survival whereas the number of mothers did not. These results suggest that the survival benefits associated with communal nesting are driven by polyandry and not communal defense. This socially mediated polyandry was as efficient as multiple paternity in preventing infanticide, and may also occur in other infanticidal and <b>polytocous</b> species where the caring parent exhibits social behavio...|$|E
40|$|The {{oestrous cycle}} in pigs spans {{a period of}} 18 – 24 days. It {{consists}} of a follicular phase of 5 – 7 days and a luteal phase of 13 – 15 days. During the follicular phase, small antral follicles develop into large, pre-ovulatory follicles. Being a <b>polytocous</b> species, the pig may ovulate from 15 to 30 follicles, depending on age, nutritional status and other factors. During the luteal phase, follicle development is less pronounced, although there is probably a considerable turnover of primordial to early antral follicles that fail to further develop due to progesterone inhibition of gonadotrophic hormones. Nevertheless, formation of the early antral follicle pool during this stage probably has {{a major impact on}} follicle dynamics in the follicular phase in terms of number and quality of follicles. Generally, gilts are mated at their second or third estrous cycle after puberty. After farrowing, pigs experience a lactational anoestrus period, until they are weaned and the follicular phase is initiated, resulting in oestrus and ovulation 4 – 7 days after weaning. This paper describes the major endocrine processes during the follicular and luteal phases that precede and follow ovulation. The role of nutrition and metabolic status on these processes are briefly discusse...|$|E
40|$|Studies of milk {{allocation}} in <b>polytocous</b> species {{provide the}} opportunity to investigate the effects of offspring number and sex ratio on maternal investment. In these species maternal control over milk allocation is more difficult because physiological limits on milk production may stimulate sibling competition. This study investigated the nursing behavior of domestic goats bearing twins or singletons in an experimental situation for the first 47 days post-partum. Milk yield and composition did not correlate with litter size, kid weight, or with the behavior of kids. Males were heavier than females, {{but there were no}} sex differences in behaviors related to nursing. Milk allocation differences existed between twins and singletons, even though, on the average, there were no significant weight differences. However, one twin was always larger than the other. Twins spent less time in proximity to the mother than did the singletons, and were more responsible for achieving proximity to the mother. These results suggest that nursing behavior was more affected by litter size than by sex of young, although there might be an interaction between both, that early mother-young interactions were different for twins and singletons, and that kids played {{an active role in the}} allocation of milk and its conversion to body weight...|$|E

Results We used the REML-animal model to estimate genetic parameters for litter size and individual birth size for a common Palearctic small mammal, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Even though a phenotypic trade-off between offspring number and size was evident, it was not explained by a genetic trade-off, but rather by negative correlations in permanent and temporary environmental effects.

While most {{often seen in}} multiparous and <b>polytocous</b> species like swine, it is also observed in monotocous species when the fetus is retained for a long time. The low prevalence of the condition may help explain the scarcity of information in the literature. To further complicate the study of this phenomenon, the physiological mechanisms that maintain pregnancy vary between species, implying different pathways for the condition. The exact outcome of early fetal mortality is unpredictable, and is influenced by several factors, including the cause of fetal mortality, differences in pregnancy between species, stage of gestation at fetal death, and number of fetuses. Based on our current knowledge of natural fetal mummification events, {{there are a number}} of prerequisites for the process of fetal mummification to occur. Examining the circumstances associated with fetal mummification can help scientists better understand the etiology and clinical situation in different species. The objective of this article is to review fetal mummification in the major domestic species: cattle, goats, sheep, horses, swine, dogs, and cats.

40|$|The most {{prominent}} histological feature in ageing of the rodent uterus is the accumulation ofcollagen. There is a progressive increase in connective tissue {{between the two}} muscle layers, stroma, and around the blood vessels. <b>Polytocous</b> laboratory mammals exhibit four characteristic phases during their reproductive lifetime: (1) a gradual increase in litter size, (2) a relatively constant litter size, (3) a decline in litter size, and (4) a failure to reproduce (Biggers, Finn & McLaren, 1962). In golden hamsters this decline begins at approximately 14 months of age (Soderwall, Kent, Turbyfill & Britenbaker, 1960), and is not caused by a depletion of oocytes, since some females continue to ovulate adequate numbers of eggs although the female fails to produce any offspring (Harman & Talbert, 1970). The ageing uterus is generally considered as the organ most responsible for a reduction of offspring (Finn, 1970). The amount of collagen increases in the uterus with age (Finn, Fitch & Harkness, 1963, Schaub, 1964; Maurer & Foote, 1972), {{and it has been}} suggested that increased deposition of collagen might impair uterine function, possibly by interfering with vascularization(Biggers et al., 1962).

The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyse the relation between factors affecting delivery of individual liveborn piglets and acid-base balance values (pH, P-CO 2, HCO 3 - and BEecf) at birth. In total 201 piglets originating from 44 litters were used for the collection of blood samples from the umbilical artery immediately after birth, preferably in the period of apnea. Blood samples were analysed with the iStat (R) Portable Clinical Analyser. Significantly lower pH, HCO 3 -, BEecf and significantly higher P-CO 2 levels were found in posteriorly presented piglets, independently of the condition of the umbilical cord, birth weight and cumulative birth interval/rank. Independently of presentation, birth weight and rank, piglets born with ruptured umbilical cords showed significantly lower pH values. Next to that, increasing birth weights resulted in increasing HCO 3 - and BEecf values at birth, independently of presentation, condition of the umbilical cord and cumulative birth interval/rank. Both an increase in cumulative birth interval and in rank was associated with a significant decrease of pH, HCO 3 -, BEecf and increase of P-CO 2 levels in umbilical cord blood at birth.

40|$|The present {{interest}} in malformations of the rabbit stems almost entirely from {{a chain of}} events that originated in the thalidomide disaster and expanded through a multiplicity of animal studies which, among other things, demon-strated that thalidomide consistently causes malformations in the rabbit embryo. Culmination of the chain was the acceptance of the rabbit as a suitable species for teratogenicity screening tests in the safety evaluation of new drugs (Table 1). It is now evident that, for drug evaluation studies, susceptibility of the test species to thalidomide is a somewhat doubtful recommendation. Thalidomide is unique and atypical so that a positive result obtained with it is not necessarily indicative that a species will be susceptible to teratogens that depend on quite different modes of action. Fortunately the rabbit (especiaIly the New Zealand White) possesses a number of basic characteristics that are an asset in teratology studies. Some of these characteristics, and the advantages that spring from them, are: domesticated and of moderate size (foetus 40 g, adult 3 - 4 kg) ~easily visible defects, moderate drug need, ease of handling and maintenance, short gestation (32 days); prolonged oestrus and induced ovulation~pregnancy easily and accurat-ely timed, artificial insemination possible; high fertility and <b>polytocous</b> [...] -+high pregnancy rate (80 per cent +), large litters (7 - 10); relatively high incidence of varied anomalies~sensitive to teratogens.

40|$|Litter size {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{reliable}} state-dependent life-history traits that indicate parental investment in <b>polytocous</b> (litter-bearing) mammals. The tendency to optimize litter size typically increases with decreasing availability of resources during the period of parental investment. To determine whether this tactic is also influenced by resource limitations prior to reproduction, we examined the effect of experimental, pre-breeding food restriction on the optimization of parental investment in lactating mice. First, we investigated the optimization of litter size in 65 experimental and 72 control families (mothers and their dependent offspring). Further, we evaluated pre-weaning offspring mortality, and the relationships between maternal and offspring condition (body weight), as well as offspring mortality, in 24 experimental and 19 control families with litter reduction (the death of one or more offspring). Assuming that pre-breeding food restriction would signal unpredictable food availability, we hypothesized that the optimization of parental investment would be more effective in the experimental rather than in the control mice. In comparison to the controls, the experimental mice produced larger litters and had a more selective (size-dependent) offspring mortality and thus lower litter reduction (the proportion of offspring deaths). Selective litter reduction helped the experimental mothers to maintain their own optimum condition, thereby improving the condition and, indirectly, the survival of their remaining offspring. Hence, pre-breeding resource limitations may have facilitated the mice to optimize their inclusive fitness. On the other hand, in the control females, the absence of environmental cues indicating a risky environment led to "maternal optimism" (overemphasizing good conditions at the time of breeding), which resulted in the production of litters of super-optimal size and consequently higher reproductive costs during lactation, including higher offspring mortality. Our study therefore provides the first evidence that pre-breeding food restriction promotes the optimization of parental investment, including offspring number and developmental success...|$|E
40|$|For 829 {{mammalian}} species, data on {{age at weaning}} or age {{at first}} solid food were analyzed with respect to body mass, phylogeny, habitat, diet, length of gestation, basal metabolism, and neonatal development. The primary influence on lactation length is female mass, but phylogenetic constraints are important. Thus, lactation {{can be characterized as}} short (earless seals and baleen whales), long (marsupials, bats, and primates), or average (remaining eutherians). Among average mammals, lagomorphs have short lactations. Lactation may have different functions, evolutionary constraints, and physiological control depending on whether young first eat solid food near weaning or well before it. First solid food eaten near weaning occurs in <b>polytocous</b> species with altricial young; in this case, lactation has a clear energetic role. In contrast, first solid food well before weaning is common for mammals with single, precocial offspring. For these species, the energetic and nutritional constraints on lactation may be less important than the benefits of maintaining contact between mother and young, such as reduced juvenile mortality and increased opportunities for learning social or foraging patterns. Thus, the age at first solid food relative to the age at weaning may indicate the function of lactation within the reproductive biology of a given mammal. Delayed development and implantation alter the timing of energetic investment during gestation, so too, the age at first solid food may alter or reflect the rate of energetic investment during lactation. Thus, the age at first solid food relative to the age at weaning may indicate the function of lactation within the reproductive biology of a given mammal. Testing these hypotheses will require data from diverse species on the nutritional and energetic value of milk before and after first solid food {{as well as on the}} mechanics and consequences of nursing or suckling during the course of lactation.

40|$|International audienceDensity‐dependence {{is a key}} {{concept in}} {{population}} dynamics. Here, we review how body mass and demographic parameters vary with population density in large herbivores. The demographic parameters we consider are age‐ and sex‐specific reproduction, survival and dispersal. As population density increases, the body mass of large herbivores typically declines, affecting individual performance traits such as age of first reproduction and juvenile survival. We documented density‐dependent variations in reproductive rates for many species from the Arctic to subtropical zones, both with and without predation. At high density, a trade‐off between growth and reproduction delays the age of primiparity and often increases the costs of reproduction, decreasing both survival and future reproductive success of adult females. Density‐dependent preweaning juvenile survival occurs more often in <b>polytocous</b> than monotocous species, while the effects of density on post‐weaning juvenile survival are independent of litter size. Responses of adult survival to density are much less marked than for juvenile survival, and may be exaggerated by density‐dependent changes in age structure. The role of density‐dependent dispersal in population dynamics remains uncertain, because very {{few studies have examined}} it. For sexually dimorphic species, we found little support for higher sensitivity to increasing density in the life history traits of males compared to females, except for young age classes. It remains unclear whether males of dimorphic species are sensitive to male density, female density or a combination of both. Eberhardt's model predicting a sequential effect of density on demographic parameters (from juvenile survival to adult survival) was supported by 9 of 10 case studies. In addition, population density at birth can also lead to cohort effects, including a direct effect on juvenile survival and longterm effects on average cohort performance as adults. Density effects typically interact with weather, increasing in strength in years of harsh weather. For some species, the synchronization between plant phenology and reproductive cycle is a key process in population dynamics. The timing of late gestation as a function of plant phenology determines whether density‐dependence influences juvenile survival or adult female reproduction. The detection of density‐dependence can be made difficult by nonlinear relationships with density, high sampling variability, lagged responses to density changes, changes in population age structure, and temporal variation in the main factors limiting population growth. The negative feedbacks of population size on individual performance, and hence on life history traits, are thus only expected in particular ecological contexts and are most often restricted to certain age‐specific demographic traits...|$|E
40|$|Assessment {{of fetal}} {{motility}} is {{an approach to}} evaluate the development and function {{of the nervous system}} before birth. Reference values for the time of first occurrence and the incidence of normal fetal movements are indispensable for studies in which prenatal motor activity is applied as a model to study the central and peripheral nervous systems. Studies on fetal motility have been performed in a few species, particularly in the human. The aim of the present study is to describe the ontogeny of fetal motility in the guinea pig, a precocious <b>polytocous</b> species. After a pilot study to establish procedures for repeated ultasonographic scanning of guinea pigs, 10 domesticated animals were scanned (5. 0 or 7. 5 MHz convex transducer) at 2 - 4 day intervals between day 24 and 63 of gestation (term age 68 days). Per animal two selected fetuses were each scanned for 15 min. Images were stored on videotape and analyzed off-line for the first onset, presence and quality of fetal movement patterns, and quantity of sideway bendings, general movements, breathing movements and periods of fetal rest. Twenty-five different movement patterns could be characterized, 6 emerging at the onset of motor activity were performed only temporarily. The very first fetal movement was observed on day 24 gestational age, and subsequently most other movements developed during a period of only 5 days. Interfetal difference in onset of the frequently occurring sideway bendings, general movements, and front and hind limb movements was only 2 days. Sideway bendings and general movements co-existed during days 29 to 43. There were developmental trends in the course of pregnancy. Sideway bendings increased rapidly between 24 and 30 days and declined hereafter. General movements and fetal breathing increased during midpregnancy and declined towards parturition. Conversely, fetal rest was observed for approximately 60 % of time at midgestation and a marked increase was found towards parturition. There {{were no significant differences in}} developmental trend of the various movement patterns between individual fetuses. Fetal motility in the guinea pig followed a specific temporal pattern, like in the human, but at a different time scale. The present quantitative data will enable functional investigations into the role of the neuromuscular system. They may also facilitate studies on the effect of environmental influences, such as stress, drugs, toxic substances, and food conditions, on fetal neurobehavioural development in this species.

40|$|Female-female {{competition}} {{has been relatively}} overlooked in favour of male-male competition for mates, {{but it can also}} have important reproductive consequences. There are an increasing number of studies describing conditions where females compete to obtain breeding rank, gain access to or control resources or actively defend young. Communally breeding females are thought to be relatively egalitarian, sharing the cost of parental care with other females. Hence little {{attention has been paid to}} the potential for competition in such breeding systems, despite evidence of aggression and reproductive suppression between females. This thesis therefore explores the extent of competitive behaviours between female wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus), a species with communal care of young, and investigates the physiological effects of competition and its consequences for breeding success and reproductive output. I examined the effects of age and other characteristics that may predict the degree of female competition. I identified that body mass, relative age of social partners, urinary testosterone concentration and reproductive experience were all useful predictors for the amount of competitive behaviour observed between female pairs. Following competitive female interaction I found that urinary testosterone and protein output increased, but there was no significant change in body mass and no significant effect on oestrus cycle length. Older females (> 12 months) with competitive experience had larger adrenal glands compared to females previously housed with their sisters, suggesting a possible stress response to competitive interaction. There was also evidence that competitively housed females had enlarged clitoral glands, which may play a role in signalling social status. As female house mice were found to compete and assume social ranks, I investigated the impact of female social status on male mate choice and mating behaviour. There was no evidence of significant male preference for more or less competitive females prior to or after competitive interaction in a choice test with restricted access to females or when presented with female odours. To investigate breeding behaviour I introduced female pairs to a male in semi-naturalistic enclosures, filming continuously over a four day period to examine mating attempts and female behaviour. Interestingly males mounted less competitive females either exclusively or preferentially during the test, with a small number of competitive females interrupting mating behaviour between their social partners and the male. Therefore males may prefer female partners that are less likely to act aggressively towards their advances. The effect of female competition on reproductive success was examined by comparing breeding success of subjects under solitary and communal breeding conditions. Despite the prediction that reproductive success increases for secondary litters in house mice, reproductive output was significantly reduced for more and less competitive females in the communal nest compared to previous output in a solitary nest. This finding illustrates the negative impact of competition on reproductive success. Females that gave birth first in communal nests also had significantly fewer pups present on post natal day one compared to females that gave birth second. Interestingly female offspring of more competitive females in this experiment went on to produce larger litters on average than females born to less competitive females. Litters were also likely to be male biased if females had been reared in a competitive environment rather than a solitary nest, suggesting that competitive ability and rearing environments can both influence reproductive success for offspring. These results, together with evidence in the literature, suggest that competition does occur between communally breeding females, and that reproductive success can be affected as a result. However competition between communal females may be less intense than between females in cooperative systems, where reproductive skew is biased towards one or two individual females in a group. Using a comparative analysis I found that cooperatively breeding species had increased reproductive output compared to other <b>polytocous</b> species, which is likely to be influenced by the presence of non-breeding helpers in the nest site. Cooperative species also had decreased inter-litter intervals compared to non-cooperative species, as well as a reduction in lactation length and protein content of milk. Communal species were found to have increased offspring growth and reduced sexual size dimorphism, suggesting that competition between females may have resulted in selection for increased female body mass. Together these results illustrate the significance of female competition in wild house mice, with consequences for mating behaviour and reproductive success, as well as the evolutionary implications of female-female competition in mammalian species residing in communal breeding systems...|$|E
