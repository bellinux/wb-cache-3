40|$|This project {{focused on}} fuel stream {{preparation}} improvements prior to injection into a solid oxide fuel cell reformer. Each milestone {{and the results}} from each milestone are discussed in detail in this report. The first two milestones were {{the creation of a}} coking formation test rig and various testing performed on this rig. Initial tests indicated that three anti-carbon coatings showed improvement over an uncoated (bare metal) baseline. However, in follow-up 70 hour tests of the down selected coatings, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that no carbon was generated on the test specimens. These follow-up tests were intended to enable a down selection to a single best anti-carbon coating. Without the formation of carbon it was impossible to draw conclusions as to which anti-carbon coating showed the best performance. The final 70 hour tests did show that AMCX AMC 26 demonstrated the lowest discoloration of the metal out of the three down selected anti-carbon coatings. This discoloration did not relate to carbon but could be a useful result when carbon growth rate is not the only concern. Unplanned variations in the series of tests must be considered and may have altered the results. Reliable conclusions could only be drawn from consistent, repeatable testing beyond the allotted time and funding for this project. Milestones 3 and 4 focused on the creation of a <b>preheating</b> <b>pressure</b> atomizer and mixing chamber. A design of experiment test helped identify a configuration of the preheating injector, Build 1, which showed a very uniform fuel spray flow field. This injector was improved upon by the creation of a Build 2 injector. Build 2 of the preheating injector demonstrated promising SMD results with only 22 psi fuel pressure and 0. 7 in H 2 O of Air. It was apparent from testing and CFD that this Build 2 has flow field recirculation zones. These recirculation zones may suggest that this Build 2 atomizer and mixer would require steam injection to reduce the auto ignition potential. It is also important to note that to achieve uniform mixing within a short distance, some recirculation is necessary. Milestone 5 generated CFD and FEA results {{that could be used to}} optimize the preheating injector. CFD results confirmed the recirculation zones seen in test data and confirmed that the flow field would not change when attached to a reformer. The FEA predicted fuel wetted wall temperatures which led to several suggested improvements that could possibly improve nozzle efficiency. Milestone 6 (originally an optional task) took a different approach than the <b>preheating</b> <b>pressure</b> atomizer. It focused on creation and optimization of a piezoelectric injector which could perform at extremely low fuel pressures. The piezoelectric atomizer showed acceptable SMD results with fuel pressure less than 1. 0 psig and air pressure less than 1. 0 in H 2 O. These SMD values were enhanced when a few components were changed, and it is expected would improve further still at elevated air temperatures. It was demonstrated that the piezoelectric injector could accomplish the desired task. The addition of phase tracking and a burst mode to the frequency controller increased the usability of the piezoelectric injector. This injector is ready to move on to the next phase of development. Engine Components has met the required program milestones of this project. Some of the Milestones were adjusted to allow Milestone 6 to be completed in parallel with the other Milestones. Because of this, Task 3. 10 and 3. 13 were made optional instead of Milestone 6. Engine Components was extremely grateful for the support that was provided by NETL in support of this work...|$|E

The heaters consume considerable amount of natural gas flowing though the CGS as fuel to provide the required heat for preheating the natural gas stream.

The high shear resistance is explained by the high mechanical adhesion between the hot melts and the wood substrate. After a prolonged moisture influence (70 days at relative air humidity of 80 %), all the systems investigated showed a considerable (up to 25 %) increase in the shear strength.

Rubber seeds contain 40 - 50 % non-edible oil {{that can be}} used as industrial materials to produce variety of products such as linoleum, lubricant, cutting oil, alkyd resin, biodiesel, etc. To obtain oil from rubber seeds, there are two common methods {{that can be used}}, i. e. solvent extraction and mechanical pressing. Solvent extraction method uses solvent such as hexane to extract oil from rubber seeds. This method gives a higher yield compared to mechanical pressing method. However, since solvent is used in this method, it may reduce the quality of the oil. Mechanical pressing method gives a lower yield but simpler to do and gives a higher quality of oil. One of mechanical pressing machine usually used is hydraulic press. The objective of this research is to study the effects of temperature, <b>pressure,</b> <b>preheating</b> time and pressing time on rubber seed oil yield. Rubber seeds that had been cleaned, dehulled, dried, and flaked until the flakes are about 0. 5 - 0. 8 mm, are preheated at 60 - 80 °C for 45 - 75 minutes. Then, while the rubber seed flakes get further heated, the flakes are pressed for 30 - 90 minutes at 80 - 120 bar. The effects of temperature, <b>pressure,</b> <b>preheating</b> time, and pressing time on rubber seed oil yield are then evaluated using a 24 factorial design with 4 center points. The analysis of variance shows that pressure, pressing time and their interaction have significant effects on rubber seed oil yield.

The reaction mechanisms are assessed by comparing ignition delay and laminar flame speed results obtained from CHEMKIN with available data, however, the amount of data at these conditions is scarce and a recommended candidate among the mechanisms can presently not be selected.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} a solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine (SOFC-GT) hybrid system design is conducted {{with the intention of}} determining the thermodynamically based design space constrained by modern material and operating limits. The analysis is performed using a thermodynamic model of a generalized SOFC-GT system where the sizing of all components, except the fuel cell, is allowed to vary. Effects of parameters such as pressure ratio, fuel utilization, oxygen utilization, and current density are examined. Operational limits are discussed in terms of maximum combustor exit temperature, maximum heat exchanger effectiveness, limiting current density, maximum hydrogen utilization, and fuel cell temperature rise. It was found that the maximum hydrogen utilization and combustor exit temperature were the most significant constraints on the system design space. The design space includes the use of cathode flow recycling and air preheating via a recuperator (heat exchanger). The effect on system efficiency of exhaust gas recirculation using an ejector versus using a blower is discussed, while both are compared with the base case of using a heat exchanger only. It was found that use of an ejector for exhaust gas recirculation caused the highest efficiency loss, and the base case was found to exhibit the highest overall system efficiency. The use of a cathode recycle blower allowed the largest downsizing of the heat exchanger, although avoiding cathode recycling altogether achieved the highest efficiency. Efficiencies in the range of 50 - 75 % were found for variations in pressure ratio, fuel utilization, oxygen utilization, and current density. The best performing systems that fell within all design constraints were those that used a heat exchanger only to <b>preheat</b> air, moderate <b>pressure</b> ratios, low oxygen utilizations, and high fuel utilizations.

The finite element commercial software (FIDAP) was used to simulate the induction melting process and the casting process. Phase change is considered both in the heating and in the solidification process. Various factors and properties are studied, such as boundary conditions and initial conditions, output current, frequency of the current, main dimensions of the system, mold preheating temperature, heat transfer coefficient and mold material. As shown in simulated results, several conclusions can be drawn: • The design of the system has great impact on the induction melting process. In order to obtain high heat efficiency, the coils group number can be designed as many as possible and the coils are located as near to the crucible as possible. • The induction melting process is sensitive to the electrical factors and properties (Current density; frequency and output power). Through the control of these values we can control the melting process. The thermal properties of the feedstock and the crucible material are also important in the heating process. • A direct IH has a much higher efficiency than an indirect IH.

40|$|Carbon Dioxide {{emissions}} from power production {{are believed to}} have significant contributions to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Alternative energy resources, such as solar radiation, may help abate emissions but suffer from high costs of power production and temporal variations. On the other hand, Carbon Capture and Sequestration allows the continued use of fossil fuels without the CO 2 emissions but it comes at an energetic penalty. The Advanced Zero Emissions Plant (AZEP) minimizes this energy loss by making use of Ion Transport Membrane (ITM) -based oxy-combustion to reduce the cost of carbon dioxide separation. This work seeks to assess if there are any thermodynamic gains from hybridizing solar-thermal energy with AZEP. The particular focus is hybridizing of the bottoming cycle with supplemental solar heating. A simple model of parabolic solar trough was used to hybridize a model of the AZEP cycle in ASPEN Plus*. Two cycle configurations are studied: the first uses solar parabolic troughs to indirectly vaporize high pressure steam through Therminol and the second uses parabolic troughs to directly <b>preheat</b> the high <b>pressure</b> water stream prior to vaporization. Simulations of the solar vaporizer hybrid by varying the total area of collectors (holding fuel input constant) show an increase of net electric output from 439 MW for the non-hybridized AZEP to 533 MW with an input solar share of 38. 8 %. The incremental solar efficiency is found to be around 16 % for solar shares of input ranging from 5 % to 38. 8 %. Moreover, simulations of variable solar insolation for collector area of 550, 000 m 2, show that incremental solar efficiency increased with solar insolation reaching a plateau around 17 %. Simulations of the direct solar preheater, show a net electric output of 501. 3 MW for a solar share of 35 %, (an incremental solar efficiency of 13. 73 %). The power generation and hence incremental efficiency is lower than in hybridization with steam vaporization with the same input solar share. Synergy analysis for the steam vaporization hybrid indicates no thermodynamic gains from hybridization. by Ragheb Mohamad Fawaz El Khaja. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The driving {{mechanism}} of pulsations in gas turbine combustors {{depends on a}} complex interaction between flow field, chemistry, heat release and acoustics. In aeroengines with airblast nozzles, {{the response of the}} fuel, in terms of liquid fuel flux, atomization and evaporation to a fluctuating aerodynamical and thermochemical environment needs to be considered as well. The objective of this work was to investigate the response of the heat release and the liquid fuel distribution to forced periodic modulations of the primary air flow through a diffusion type burner using airblast atomizers. A second focus was on the investigation of the pressure effect and the influence of the nozzle exit geometry on fuel placement and its interaction with the heat release region. The spatial distribution of spray density and heat release at three different modulation frequencies was studied using simultaneous phase-resolved OH chemiluminescence for heat release visualization, and planar Mie scattering of kerosene in two airblast nozzles with different exit geometries. Experiments were performed for a variety of <b>pressures,</b> <b>preheat</b> temperatures, AFR values and modulation frequencies. The purpose of these experiments was to study the potential effect of the prefilmer on the impedance of the system, and its dependence on operating parameters. For one set of operating conditions, the dependence of the phase shift between plenum and combustor pressures on modulation frequency was studied as well. It was observed that the exit geometry of the nozzle has a considerable effect on the flame shape and fuel distribution, but also on the modulation depth of the response to forcing of the air flow. Superposition of fuel and heat release distributions shows that the expanding and contracting fuel spray cone during a period of the air flow modulation drives the region of the heat release, by establishing favourable flammability conditions at varying locations during the oscillation. Instantaneous and phase-averaged images of spray and heat release distribution were recorded at eight phase angles with 45 ° separation, to cover a full period of the oscillation. Within this phase resolution, no phase shift between spatially integrated fuel flux and heat release could be observed. If there is a changing impedance of the fuel flow caused by a potential storage effect on the prefilmer, it is too small to cause a phase shift variation with forcing frequency within the phase resolution of this experiment. ...|$|R
40|$|Utilisation {{of natural}} gas (mainly methane, CH[subscript] 4), a clean and {{abundant}} resource, is of great importance. Conventional method, steam reforming, though still dominant, requires a considerately high capital investment and an intensive energy input. Reforming natural gas by partial oxidation, potentially {{one of the most}} attractive alternatives, has been investigated vigorously for decades, mainly focusing on looking for suitable catalyst and understanding of the mechanisms of methane partial oxidation. This work focuses on the feasibility of methane partial oxidation reforming from gas phase reaction under fuel-rich conditions. Firstly, a detailed thermodynamic analysis has been conducted, which covers a broad range of operation conditions of temperature up to 2073 K, pressure up to 100 atm and initial O(subscript) 2 /CH(subscript) 4 ratio of 0 to 2. 5. It has been found that high syn-gas (H(subscript) 2 and CO) yields can be achieved when the temperature is above 1073 K and the initial O(subscript) 2 /CH(subscript) 4 ratio close to 0. 5. High pressure is not favoured. However, high temperatures can suppress the effect of high pressures. Carbon deposition, a crucially important factor in methane partial oxidation, is mainly examined by means of thermodynamic analysis. Solid carbon was identified the major carbon deposition form, which could severely happen if the initial O(subscript) 2 /CH(subscript) 4 ratio is less than 0. 5. This feature was also indirectly proven during the experimental tests. Secondly, a series of CHEMKIN simulations were performed using various CH(subscript) 4 oxidation reaction mechanisms. The general trend of the CH(subscript) 4 partial oxidation reforming was revealed by simulations using the GRI, NIST and Konnov mechanisms. A new concept characterising CH(subscript) 4 partial oxidation was conceived. i. e., a fast oxidation zone and a slow conversion ++zone, the reaction is under chemical control that requests high operating temperatures, and the reaction can be accelerated by using relatively high initial 0 (subscript) 2 /CH(subscript) 4 ratios. Experimental tests were performed to verify the findings obtained in thermodynamic and kinetic studies, and to identify appropriate reaction schemes for further analysis. Prediction from the NIST mechanisms has shown to be in good agreement with experimental observation when the temperature is less than 1273 K. For higher temperatures the NIST under-predicts the H(subscript) 2 yield caused by the lack of carbon formation mechanisms. Two other mechanisms (Konnov and GRI) predicted similar trends but the reaction predicted commenced earlier. Therefore, the NIST was identified to be the best. NO(subscript) x catalytic effect on CH 4 oxidation at fuel-rich conditions was confirmed experimentally. However, this effect only exists where the oxygen is available. Therefore, employing NO(subscript) x cannot help the CH(subscript) 4 partial oxidation in the second reaction zone. Solely relying on NO(subscript) x to speed up the process or lower the operating temperature is not possible. However, employing NO(subscript) x to initiate the reaction at lower temperatures is viable. The possibility of taking the advantage of NOx catalytic effect for direct synthesis of CH 3 OH (methanol) has been shown feasible and, more attractively, the operating temperatures required are much lower than that for syn-gas production. Among three reaction schemes, i. e., the Glarborg, Bromly and Dagaut, which are able to account for the NO(subscript) x catalytic effect, the Glarborg mechanism proved to be the best in reproducing experimental measurements for syn-gas production tests. However, none available mechanisms can predict similar magnitude of the direct synthesis of CH(subscript) 3 OH. To understand the mechanisms ++of NO(subscript) x catalytic effect, a reaction scheme, Partial Oxidation Mechanisms (POM), has been composed successfully adding five additional reactions into the NIST. The POM can reveal the major catalytic reaction pathways and it is suitable for CH(subscript) 4 partial oxidations both with and without NO(subscript) x addition. Finally, a series of simulations were conducted to conservatively estimate the feasibility of CH(subscript) 4 partial oxidation using POM. High syn-gas yield is achievable within a reasonable residence time using adiabatic reactor. The variables significantly affecting the syn-gas yield, are <b>preheating</b> temperature, operating <b>pressure,</b> inert dilution, initial ratio of O(subscript) 2 /CH(subscript) 4 and residence time.

40|$|Oxyfuel {{combustion}} is {{a concept}} proposed {{for the implementation of}} carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies in coal and gas turbines power plants to prevent emission of carbon dioxide into the atmopshere. In order to apply the concept to gas turbines power plants, they have to be modified or alternatively new cycles need to be developed for using this concept. Amongst the different cycles proposed those involving oxygen and carbon dioxide as working fluid offer simplicity of design together with promising carbon capture and cycle efficiencies. New burners need to be designed for use in such oxyfuel gas turbines. The combustion characteristics of such burners would strongly depend on the proportion of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the oxidizer. In this work oxyfuel combustion with a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide as oxidizer has been studied experimentally using a well-researched methane-air swirl burner with an optically accessible combustion chamber. Partially premixed swirl stabilized oxyfuel flames have been investigated using optical measurement techniques at atmospheric and elevated pressure conditions. The effect of changing parameters such as carbon dioxide dilution, flow velocity, equivalence ratio, and thermal power on flame stabilization, flow field and flame chemistry has been studied. The investigations were performed under conditions of comparable thermal power and inlet flow velocity for different carbon dioxide dilutions. A strong dependence of the flame shape and stability on carbon dioxide dilution was observed at similar thermal powers and inlet flow velocities. Flames containing less than 26 % oxygen in the oxidizer could not be stabilized, while 26 % oxygen flames showed poor stabilization over a wide operating range. Flames with 30 % oxygen were predominantly stable over a large range of operation and had a typical conical swirl flame shape. Flames with an oxygen concentration higher than 30 % showed a flat flame shape and excited thermo-acoustic oscillations. A comparison to air flame behavior showed similarity between the influences of carbon dioxide dilution in oxyfuel flames to a change in equivalence ratio for air flames. Laser Raman Spectroscopy measurements revealed that despite similar conical flame shape of 30 % oxygen oxyfuel and lean air flames, the stabilization of the oxyfuel flame was poorer due to the lower reactivity. The 30 % oxygen flame and air flames were investigated under elevated pressure conditions with {{a modified version of the}} atmospheric burner with optical access to the combustion chamber. At conditions of increased oxidizer <b>preheat</b> and elevated <b>pressure</b> an unconventional flame shape was observed, where the flame burned at close proximity to the burner plate and chamber windows. A change in burner aerodynamics at elevated pressure was identified as the cause for the unconventional flame shape. The burner design for oxyfuel gas turbines is dependent on the carbon dioxide dilution intended to be used. The investigations showed unsuitability of using partially premixed combustion for low oxygen concentrations. The high oxygen concentration flames are thought to be suitable for a staged combustion concept where the higher reactivity of such flames would be useful for pilot flame stabilization and keeping overall temperatures in an acceptable region for the gas turbine. At the end of the work the differences between air and oxyfuel combustion are summarized and an overview is presented of burner configurations favorable for use in real oxyfuel gas turbines. Die Oxyfuel-Verbrennung ist eine von verschiedenen Methoden zur CO 2 -Abscheidung und Speicherung, um die Emission des Treibhausgases Kohlendioxid aus Kraftwerksprozessen in die Atmosphäre zu verhindern. Diese Technik kann für Kohle wie auch für Gasturbine-Kraftwerke angewendet werden. Es wurden mehrere thermodynamische Zyklen für die Oxyfuel-Vebrennung vorgeschlagen. Die Zyklen, die für Sauerstoff und Kohlendioxid als Oxidator ausgelegt sind, sind weniger komplex und vielversprechend in Bezug auf die Kohlendioxid-Abtrennungs-und Energieeffizienz. Um diese Zyklen in Gasturbinen anzuwenden, sind jedoch neue Brennerkonzepte erforderlich. In dieser Dissertation wurde die Oxyfuel-Verbrennung mit Sauerstoff und Kohlendioxid als Oxidator in einem drallstabilisierten Gasturbinen-Modellbrenner mittels optischer Messmethoden untersucht, um die Unterschiede zur Verbrennung mit Luft als Oxidator zu analysieren. Teil-vorgemsichte Oxyfuel-Drallflammen wurden mit OH*-Chemilumineszenz, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) und Raman-Spektroskopie unter atmosphärischen und Hochdruckbedingungen charakterisiert. Anhand dieser Methoden wurde der Einfluss von Parametern wie der Sauerstoff-Konzentration, dem Äquivalenzverhältnis, der Strömungsgeschwindigkeit und der thermischen Leistung auf die Flammeneigenschaften studiert. Die Flammen mit weniger als 26 % Sauerstoff waren über einen großen Betriebsbereich instabil. Die Flammen mit 30 % Sauerstoff hatten eine konische Flammenform und zeigten die beste Stabilität mit geringen thermoakustischen Schwingungen. Thermoakustische Instabilitäten traten bei Flammen mit mehr als 30 % Sauerstoff auf. Ein Vergleich mit Luftflammen zeigte, dass die Änderung der Flammenform, die durch Variation der Sauerstoff Konzentration im Oxidator bei Oxyfuelflammen entsteht, dem Verhalten in Luftflammen bei Änderung des Äquivalenzverhältnis ähnelt. Trotz der Ähnlichkeit der Flammenform von Luftflammen und Oxyfuelflammen mit 30 % Sauerstoff, brannten die Oxyfuelflammen auf Grund geringerer chemischer Reaktivität weniger stabil im Vergleich zu Luftflammen. Eine modifizierte Version des atmosphärischen Brenners wurde unter erhöhtem Drück (5 bar) und bei erhöhter Oxidatortemperatur untersucht. Dabei wurden (insbesondere) Oxyfuelflammen mit 30 % Sauerstoff und Luftflammen untersucht. Unter diesen Bedingungen wurde für Luft- und Oxyfuelflammen eine unkonventionelle Flammenform beobachtet mit einer Flammenstabilisierung nah an der Brenneroberfläche und den Brennkammerfenstern. Diese eher ungünstige Flammenform wurde durch eine Änderung der aerodynamischen Eigenschaften des Brenners erklärt. Die Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, dass das Brennerdesign in Oxyfuel-Gasturbinen stark von der geplanten Kohlendioxid-Verdünnung im Oxidator abhängt. Für einen Oxidator mit weniger als 30 % Sauerstoff ist die teil-vorgemischte Verbrennung auf Grund der geringen Reaktivität nicht geeignet. Ein Oxidator mit höherem Sauerstoff-Anteil zeigt eine vorteilhafte Stabilisierung und die damit verbundene hohe Flammentemperatur könnte mit einem gestuften Verbrennungssystem reduziert werden. Am Ende der Arbeit wurden die Unterschiede zwischen Oxyfuel- und Luftverbrennung zusammengefasst und Brenner-Modifikationen sowie Konfigurationen zur Anwendung in technischen Oxyfuelbrennern vorgestellt...|$|R
