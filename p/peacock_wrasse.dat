50|$|In Sturla {{there is}} a Site of Community Importance, as was {{proposed}} by the Natura 2000 network of Liguria, for its particular nature and geology. The site is located between Boccadasse, Sturla, Quarto dei Mille, Quinto al Mare and Nervi. It has a very particular habitat formed by Posidonia oceanica (commonly known as Neptune Grass or Mediterranean Tapeweed) and coral formations. Among the animal species are the following fish: tentacled blenny, tompot blenny, seahorse, gray wrasse, brown wrasse, pointed-snout wrasse, east Atlantic <b>peacock</b> <b>wrasse.</b>|$|E
50|$|The East Atlantic <b>peacock</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Symphodus tinca) is {{a species}} of wrasse native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Spain to Morocco and in the coastal waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. This species lives around rocks {{surrounded}} by eelgrass and {{can also be found}} in brackish waters in lagoons. It occurs at depths from 1 to 50 m. This species can reach 44 cm in standard length, though most grow no larger than 25 cm. This species is sought as a game fish and is also important to local peoples as a food fish. It can also be found in the aquarium trade.|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} the <b>peacock</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Symphodus (Crenilabrus) tinca (Linnaeus, 1758), from the {{southern}} coast of Tunisia were investigated with respect to fish size and season. Stomach contents of 1334 specimens, 8. 1 - 23. 1 cm total length, were analyzed. Of the total, 1166 were empty (87. 4 %). This percentage varied over the year, with a maximum during the spawning period (May-July) and minimum in February and August. Crustaceans and mollusks constituted the main prey in both the small and large size classes. As fish grew, the proportion of isopods in the stomachs decreased {{and the proportion of}} shrimps and benthic organisms increased. Diet composition varied seasonally, with crustaceans the most important prey item in all seasons especially summer and autumn. Higher feeding activity in winter {{may be related to the}} reproductive cycle of the wrasse and the abundance of benthic organisms. Results indicate that the <b>peacock</b> <b>wrasse</b> feeds on a wide range of prey items and is an opportunistic predator...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{polymorphic}} microsatellite loci {{were isolated}} and characterized for the <b>peacock</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Symphodus tinca), a labrid fish inhabiting the Mediterranean and Black seas. Characterization of 35 {{individuals from the}} western Mediterranean indicated a relatively high allelic diversity (mean = 12. 4, range 9 - 17), and observed heterozygosity ranging from 0. 65 to 0. 91. We {{found no evidence of}} linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci. Two loci showed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the genetic structuring of biodiversity is crucial for management and conservation. For species with large effective population sizes a low number of markers may fail to identify population structure. A solution of this shortcoming can be high-throughput sequencing that allows genotyping thousands of markers on a genome-wide approach while facilitating the detection of genetic structuring shaped by selection. We used Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) on 176 individuals of the endemic East Atlantic <b>peacock</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Symphodus tinca), from 6 locations in the Adriatic and Ionian seas. We obtained a total of 4, 155 polymorphic SNPs and we observed two strong barriers to gene flow. The first one differentiated Tremiti Islands, in the northwest, {{from all the other}} locations while the second one separated east and south-west localities. Outlier SNPs potentially under positive selection and neutral SNPs both showed similar patterns of structuring, although finer scale differentiation was unveiled with outlier loci. Our results reflect the complexity of population genetic structure and demonstrate that both habitat fragmentation and positive selection are on play. This complexity should be considered in biodiversity assessments of different taxa, including non-model yet ecologically relevant organisms...|$|E
40|$|Data on sex ratio, length-weight relationship, age, {{growth and}} {{survival}} rate were analysed for <b>peacock</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Symphodus (Crenilabrus) tinca L., (total = 1443; males = 848, females = 595) collected in the eastern middle Adriatic island area during the reproductive period (April and May) from 1995 to 1999. The total length of sampled specimens ranged from 8. 9 to 42. 5 cm and the weight from 7. 9 to 764. 2 g. The overall sex ratio was 1. 43 : 1 in favour of males. All individuals larger than 28. 9 cm were males as an effect of faster growth. The oldest females were 12 and the oldest males 13 years old. The von Bertalanffy growth formula was estimated for females (L∞ = 28. 14; k = 0. 294; t 0 = - 0. 775) and males (L∞ = 42. 24; k = 0. 214; t 0 = - 0. 628). The slopes (b values) of total length - weight regressions indicated allometric growth for males (b = 2. 7205) and both sexes (b = 2. 8147) and isometric growth for females (b = 2. 9901). Survival rate of males (S = 0. 80) was slightly greater than that for females (0. 756) ...|$|E
40|$|Roughgarden et al. (2006) {{proposed}} a theory called social selection as a behavioral game theoretic model for sexual reproduction that incorporates both competition {{and cooperation in}} 2006. Players oscillate between playing competitively to maximize their individual fitness, leading to a Nash Competitive Equilibrium, and playing cooperatively to maximize a team fitness function, leading to a Nash Bargaining Solution. Roughgarden et al. (2006) gives rates of change for both the competitive state and the cooperative state, but does not explain her rates or how to switch between the states in sufficient detail. We test and rederive the rates, critiquing an assumption that the derivation of such a rate must make, as well as create a probabilistic model that switches between the two states. We test our model on the reproductive behaviors of Symphodus tinca, the <b>peacock</b> <b>wrasse.</b> The results follow the trajectory of the reproductive strategies for the wrasse throughout the breeding system, suggesting that cooperation could be a mechanism through which wrasse change their reproductive behaviors. However, the inputs to the model need to be analyzed more critically. Future work could include deriving rates for competitive play and cooperative play that do not rely on assumptions {{of being able to}} quantify strategy allocation proportion and refining the model and drawing generalized conclusions about it...|$|E

40|$|Mate choice studies {{typically}} {{consider how}} sexual selection shapes mate preferences and corresponding traits. Through theoretical models and empirical {{studies of the}} threespine stickleback, my dissertation shifts the focus to the mate choice process, which includes information gathering and decision making under time and energy costs. I construct a model (Comparative Bayes) that allows females to choose a mate or selectively gather information about potential mates. Bayesian updating combines prior information about male quality with new information gained from assessment, thus relaxing assumptions of previous models (namely, that females randomly encounter and gain perfect information about males). I find that females should selectively gather information from males that are less familiar, have clearer signals, and cost less to assess. The model generates patterns of female encounters with males similar to those observed for several species and produces higher female fitness than previously proposed mate choice models. I study the mate choice process and test the Comparative Bayes model in threespine sticklebacks. My field and enclosure observations show that females actively initiate courtships, court with multiple males, and regularly revisit males. The costs of gathering information were manipulated in an experiment that allowed stickleback females of different states (reproductive and energetic) to choose between two males. Females held gravid longer before trials {{were more likely to}} respond positively to male courtship initiations. Females forced to swim against a current before trials were more likely to continue courtships and enter a male's nest, and took less time to do so. I also develop a model examining how female <b>peacock</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Symphodus tinea) should utilize experience when making reproductive decisions. Females can choose to search for and spawn with nesting males or forgo costly searching and spawn with non-nesting males. Benefits of searching change as the availability of nesting males varies over the breeding season. When there is predictable or unpredictable variation within or between breeding seasons. using experience to estimate the probability of successfully searching for nesting males is better than having a fixed estimate shaped by selection. Females should optimally forget older experiences, however, with the rate of environmental change...|$|E
