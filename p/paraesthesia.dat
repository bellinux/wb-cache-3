5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or <b>paraesthesia</b> (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.|$|E

5000|$|The word paresthesia ( [...] or [...] ) (British English paraesthesia; plural <b>paraesthesiae</b> [...] or <b>paraesthesias),</b> {{comes from}} the Greek para ("beside", i.e., abnormal) and aisthesia ("sensation").|$|R
40|$|A {{minority}} of normal humans experience <b>paraesthesias</b> (usually tingling) projected to the contralateral hand {{in response to}} individual transcranial magnetic coil (MC) pulses. The cortical source of the <b>paraesthesias</b> was sought by comparing their incidence with that of muscle responses to focal MC stimulation with either a figure 8 MC or with edge stimulation of a tilted round MC in 4 susceptible subjects. In all 4, <b>paraesthesias</b> were best felt with MC stimulation either at, or anterior to sites yielding movement, implying an initial source in precentral gyrus (and possible premotor cortex), rather than parietal cortex. In the two subjects exhibiting the strongest <b>paraesthesias,</b> the threshold for the <b>paraesthesias</b> was less than that for movement in the relaxed arm. The optimal site of the <b>paraesthesias</b> within the hand was usually in the digits, but differed among subjects. Motor responses and <b>paraesthesias</b> following a given stimulus occurred at different sites in the hand. implying that excitation of differing sets of motor cortical neurons subserved sensory and motor responses. In only one subject were the <b>paraesthesias</b> sufficiently reproducible to warrant interacting electrical digital and transcranial MC pulses. The data suggested that central processing of {{the response to the}} MC pulse is slowed by an antecedent digital stimulus, but the delay for perception of each type of stimulus does not greatly differ. The central sense of movement (Amassian et al., 1989 a) elicited by MC stimulation of motor cortex is compared with the <b>paraesthesias.</b> Both are attributed to brief, high frequency discharge by motor cortical neurons accessing the perceptual system more readily than after excitation of post-central gyrus. which requires prolonged repetitive stimulation (Libet et al., 1964). Given also the normal pattern of muscle responses in the 4 subjects, their <b>paraesthesias</b> are best explained by a heightened sensitivity of the perceptual system to the motor cortical response to MC stimulation...|$|R

25|$|Paroxetine shares many of {{the common}} adverse effects of SSRIs, {{including}} (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%), diarrhea 12% (8%), constipation 14% (9%), dry mouth 18% (12%), somnolence 23% (9%), insomnia 13% (6%), headache 18% (17%), hypomania 1% (0.3%), blurred vision 4%(1%), loss of appetite 6% (2%), nervousness 5% (3%), <b>paraesthesia</b> 4% (2%), dizziness 13% (6%), asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)), tremor 8% (2%), sweating 11% (2%), and sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, {{a higher incidence of}} anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|The dose-limiting {{side effects}} are liver damage, lung disease and immunosuppression.

40|$|Anxiety can induce hyperventilation, and the {{resultant}} hypocapnia and hypocalcaemia can lead to <b>paraesthesiae</b> and tetany. To define {{the nature of the}} disturbance created in peripheral nerve, the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons was monitored in 6 normal subjects requested to hyperventilate until <b>paraesthesiae</b> developed in the hands, face and trunk. This occurred when alveolar PCO 2 (PACO 2) had declined on average by 20 mmHg. Spontaneous EMG activity developed when PACO 2 had declined by a further 4 mmHg. Changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons were measured from changes in the compound action potentials evoked by stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist and recorded over the digital nerves of the index finger and over the thenar muscles, respectively. As PACO 2 declined, the size of the compound sensory and muscle potentials evoked by a constant stimulus progressively increased, indicating an increase in axonal excitability. These changes occurred before <b>paraesthesiae</b> or tetany developed. In each subject there was a statistically significant inverse correlation between PACO 2 and axonal excitability. Independent of this increase in axonal excitability, there was no significant change in the supernormal phase of the recovery cycle of cutaneous axons. Microneurographic recordings from the median nerve in 2 subjects revealed spontaneous bursting activity of cutaneous axons, perceived as <b>paraesthesiae.</b> It is concluded that the <b>paraesthesiae</b> and tetany induced by hyperventilation result solely from changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons in the peripheral nerve, presumably due to an alteration in the electrical properties of the axonal membrane resulting from a reduced plasma [Ca 2 +]. The supernormal phase may entrain the ectopic discharge and thereby determine the maximal discharge frequency of impulses in ectopically generated trains, but does not otherwise contribute to the physiological disturbance...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY A {{quantitative}} assessment of post-ischaemic <b>paraesthesiae</b> {{has been made in}} 50 diabetic subjects and in a group of healthy age-matched controls. The results show a highly significant diminution of the paraesthetic response in the diabetic subjects. The degree of depression of the paraesthetic response was associated with the duration of the disease and the severity of the meta-bolic abnormality as determined by the degree of insulin dependence. Diabetics with the juvenile onset type of the disease were more adversely affected than those with the maturity onset type. There was no consistent relationship between the degree of depression of the <b>paraesthesiae</b> and the presence of peripheral neuropathy. The significance of these results is discussed in relation to the factors which determine the composition of the ionic micro-environment of myelinated nerve and the level of electrical excitability of the nerve fibre.

2500|$|Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is {{a poison}} {{produced}} by organisms {{belonging to the}} Tetradontidae order, which includes the puffer fish, ocean sunfish, and porcupine fish. Within the puffer fish, which is a common delicacy especially in Japan, TTX {{is found in the}} liver, gonads, ovaries, intestines, and skin. TTX can be fatal if consumed, and has become a common form of poisoning in many countries. Common symptoms of TTX consumption include <b>paraesthesia</b> (often restricted to the mouth and limbs), muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting and often manifest within 30 minutes of ingestion. The primary mechanism by which TTX is toxic is through the inhibition of sodium channel function, which reduces the functional capacity of neuron communication. This inhibition largely affects a susceptible subset of sodium channels known as TTX-sensitive (TTX-s), which also happens to be largely responsible for the sodium current that drives the depolarization phase of neuron action potentials. [...] TTX-resistant (TTX-r) is another form of sodium channel which has limited sensitivity to TTX, and is largely found in small diameter axons such as those found in nociception neurons. When significant levels of TTX is ingested, it will bind sodium channels on neurons and reduce their membrane permeability to sodium. This results in an increased effective threshold of required excitatory signals in order to induce an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron. The effect of this increased signaling threshold is a reduced excitability of postsynaptic neurons, and subsequent loss of motor and sensory function which can result in paralysis and death. Though assisted ventilation may increase the chance of survival after TTX exposure, there is currently no antitoxin. The use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Neostigmine or the muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist Atropine (which will inhibit parasympathetic activity), however, can increase sympathetic nerve activity enough to improve the chance of survival after TTX exposure.|$|E
