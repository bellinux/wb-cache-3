40|$|This profile {{provides}} a brief {{introduction to the}} yeast production industry with particular emphasis on the production of baker's yeast. Yeast can be obtained either as the primary product of a process, {{as in the case}} of baker's yeast, or as a secondary or by-product from alcoholic fermentations. Secondary yeast is usually preferred to <b>primary</b> <b>yeast</b> for use as animal feed for reasons of economy. Carbohydrates in the form of molasses or hydrolysed starches are the most commonly used substrates for yeast growth. Carbohydrate-containing waste streams from other processes and n-paraffins from oil have also been exploited for the production of feed yeast. Processes for the production of <b>primary</b> <b>yeast</b> vary but basically consist of materials preparation, seed yeast production, fermentation, yeast separation and pressing or drying steps, depending on the type of yeast required. About half a million tonnes are thought to be produced annually, slightly under half as baker's yeast. The size of plant can vary from half a tonne per day upwards. Plants have been built for n-paraffin feed yeast with capacities of 100, 000 tonnes per year. The cost of a basic plant to produce 7. 5 tonnes of active dried baker's yeast (10 % moisture) per day would be about £ 3. 5 million f. o. b. UK in July 1980. Additional plant, necessary in many locations, would increase the cost. Yeast plants are not labour intensive; this scale of operation would provide 21 - 24 jobs.

The following industrial cultivars of grapes were selected for the research: Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon, Riesling Rhenish, Aligote, Rkatsiteli, Bastardo, Traminer, Telti Kuruk, Grinosh. The grape cultivars were cultivated on the sandy soils in the district located between the Black Sea and the Dnestrovsky estuary.

Five genes capable of rescuing growth on sulfur-deficient GSH-containing medium were identified: prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1 (PMEPA 1); lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 4 alpha (LAPTM 4 α); solute carrier family 25, member 1 (SLC 25 A 1); lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF factor (LITAF); and cysteine/tyrosine-rich- 1 (CYYR 1). All of these genes encode small integral membrane proteins of unknown function, although none appear to encode prototypical GSH transporters. Nevertheless, they all increased both intracellular glutathione levels and [3 H]GSH uptake rates. [3 H]GSH uptake was uniformly inhibited by high concentrations of unlabeled GSH, GSSG, and ophthalmic acid. Interestingly, each protein is predicted to contain Pro-Pro-x-Tyr (PY) motifs, which {{are thought to be}} important for regulating protein cell surface expression. Uptake of the endocytotic markers lucifer yellow and FM 4 - 64 was also enhanced by each of the five genes. Mutations of the PY motifs in LITAF largely abolished all of its effects.

40|$|Pages i-ii not in originalCharacterised by a fermentative sugar {{metabolism}} {{resulting in}} lactic acid {{as a major}} end product, the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) may be isolated from {{a broad range of}} sources. Dairy products, fermented vegetables, meats and baking products such as sourdough bread involve these organisms in a consistent and intentional manner in present times, no matter how accidental or fortuitous their initial involvement may have been. Alcoholic beverages such as beer, cider and, most pertinently here, wine are also affected by the presence of particular LAB. As conditions differ between nutrient environments so do the LAB found in wine differ to those isolated elsewhere - being both ethanol tolerant to the degree where growth is capable in 10 % v/v ethanol and aciduric, able to maintain an active presence at acidic levels as great as pH 4 or less. This ability to remain viable during the <b>primary</b> <b>yeast</b> fermentation of juice into wine leads to these LAB being of no small practical interest in the wine industry. The process of malolactic fermentation (MLF) involves the wine LAB altering the law materials present in the juice and wine further, increasing the intricacies of the winemaking and final product. Primarily encouraged due to its effect of reducing wine acidity, MLF also alters flavour and aroma in what is generally thought to be an advantageous manner when applied correctly. Another factor thought to be of significance is an increase in biological stability. Found, for example, among the lactobacilli, pediococci and leuconostocs, the wine LAB are classed as either homofermentative or heterofermentative. Homofermenters commonly produce two moles of lactic acid per mole of glucose fermented, while heterofermenters form one mole each of lactic acid and carbon dioxide and varied quantities of ethanol and acetic acid from one mole of glucose. Natural or chance occurrences of wine LAB, whether as part of the microbiological community on the raw materials or from other sources - such as inoculation from contaminated equipment - were the original manner in which these organisms were introduced into the vinification equation. With the predilection towards quality control, standardisation and safety in the present day, the use of pure microbial starter cultures to initiate MLF has become increasingly widespread. In order to optimise the manipulation of wine LAB in both the laboratory and industry a thorough insight into their physiology and metabolism is an obvious necessity. Certain areas of interest have undergone more intensive study than others, with, for example, the catabolism of carbohydrates in both wine (Davis et al., 1986) and model wine systems (Liu et al., 1995 a) having had a considerable amount of research compared to less primary sources of energy such as nitrogen metabolism...|$|E

In this study, we identify for the first time clinical (both human and veterinary) and environmental isolates from Australia that retain sexual fecundity. A collection of 120 isolates from a variety of geographic locations was analyzed for molecular type, mating type, and the ability to develop mating structures when cocultured with fertile tester strains. Nine isolates produced dikaryotic filaments with paired nuclei, fused clamp connections, and basidiospores. DNA sequence analysis of three genes (URA 5, the MATα-specific SXI 1 α gene, and the MATa-specific SXI 2 a gene) revealed little or no variability in URA 5 and SXI 2 a, respectively. However across the 108 MATα strains sequenced, the SXI 1 α gene was found to exist as 11 different alleles. Phylogenetic analysis found most variation to occur in the more fertile genotypes.

It has long been established that the biophysical rate processes that result in injury or necrosis of cells and tissues are characterized by approximately exponential relationships between temperature and exposure time (Levitt 1980).

Gene activation is tightly linked to histone acetylation on lysine residues that can be recognized by bromodomains. Previously, the testis-specifically expressed bromodomain protein tBRD- 1 was identified in Drosophila. Expression of tBRD- 1 is restricted to highly transcriptionally active primary spermatocytes. tBRD- 1 is essential for male fertility and proposed {{to act as a}} co-factor of testis-specific TATA box binding protein-associated factors (tTAFs) for testis-specific transcription. Here, we performed microarray analyses to compare the transcriptomes of tbrd- 1 mutant testes and wild-type testes. Our data confirmed that tBRD- 1 controls gene activity in male germ cells. Additionally, comparing the transcriptomes of tbrd- 1 and tTAF mutant testes revealed a subset of common target genes. We also characterized two new members of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family, tBRD- 2 and tBRD- 3. In contrast to other members of the BET family in animals, both possess only a single bromodomain, a characteristic feature of plant BET family members. Immunohistology techniques not only revealed that tBRD- 2 and tBRD- 3 partially co-localize with tBRD- 1 and tTAFs in primary spermatocytes, but also that their proper subcellular distribution was impaired in tbrd- 1 and tTAF mutant testes.

This update maintains an emphasis on standards compliance, unambiguous metabolite naming, and computer-readable annotations available through a structured document format. Additionally, we have developed MATLAB scripts to evaluate the modelÃ¢â�¬â�¢s predictive accuracy and to demonstrate basic model applications, such as simulating aerobic and anaerobic growth. These scripts, which provide an independent tool for evaluating the performance of various stoichiometrically constrained yeast metabolic models using flux balance analysis, are included as additional files. Conclusions: Yeast 5 expands and refines the computational reconstruction of yeast metabolism and improves the predictive accuracy of a stoichiometrically constrained yeast metabolic model. It differs from previous reconstructions and models by emphasizing the distinction between the yeast metabolic reconstruction and the stoichiometrically constrained model, and makes both available as additional files and at [URL] as separate systems biology markup language (SBML) files. Through this separation, we intend to make the modeling process more accessible, explicit, transparent, and reproducible...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Efforts {{to improve}} the {{computational}} reconstruction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae biochemical reaction network and to refine the stoichiometrically constrained metabolic models that {{can be derived from}} such a reconstruction have continued since the first stoichiometrically constrained yeast genome scale metabolic model was published in 2003. Continuing this ongoing process, we have constructed an update to the Yeast Consensus Reconstruction, Yeast 5. The Yeast Consensus Reconstruction is a product of efforts to forge a community-based reconstruction emphasizing standards compliance and biochemical accuracy via evidence-based selection of reactions. It draws upon models published by a variety of independent research groups as well as information obtained from biochemical databases and <b>primary</b> literature.
