Selden constantly chastised him for using corporate funds to buy an expensive wardrobe or making lavish gifts to potential clients.

5|$|The first {{satellite}} to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. It was followed up by three other EOS satellites: Terra, Aqua and QuikSCAT. To ensure a sustainable financing of operations, NSC started negotiating with other <b>potential</b> <b>customers.</b> However, {{the project was}} rejected by the Indian Space Research Organisation. Instead, a cooperation was made with Kongsberg Aerospace and Defence and Lockheed Martin, who built the second antenna as a joint venture. In 2001, a German research group applied for permission to establish a ground station in Ny-Ålesund. NSC feared that the competition could undermine the financial capabilities of SvalSat. However, no facility in Ny-Ålesund was built.|$|E
5|$|Coleman {{hired the}} Portland company Sandstrom Design {{to help with}} marketing. Sandstrom helped to improve the promotional {{materials}} of the organization, while Portland Center Stage modified the nature and style of its performances. Sandstrom Design produced a 56-page flyer that showed the performance schedule for the 2003–2004 season which was mailed to subscribers, <b>potential</b> <b>customers,</b> handed out at performances and placed around town. The promotional campaign stressed the unique qualities of a live theater performance as entertainment over television and film. PCS's productions were presented in the Winningstad and Newmark theatres in Portland through the 2005–2006 season. Portland Center Stage moved to the new Gerding Theater at the Armory beginning with the 2006–2007 season.|$|E

5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, the issuing of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) did not {{prove to be}} the {{opportunity}} as envisioned by Hawker, as NBMR-3 sought performance characteristics of which the P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to be developed to meet in its current form either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade <b>potential</b> <b>customers</b> from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E
5|$|The Pulaski station spurred {{commercial}} {{development in the}} Archer Heights neighborhood. Area development began even before the station opened, as the Midway Square shopping mall opened at Pulaski Road and 51st Street in 1988 {{in anticipation of the}} <b>potential</b> <b>customers</b> the Orange Line would bring. The station's opening continued the trend of development, and Pulaski station was credited with boosting business in Archer Heights and doubling property values in the neighborhood. The station also created a parking problem in the neighborhood. The station's parking lot filled up as early as 7 A.M. most workdays, causing commuters to park on residential streets. The commuters prompted local residents to ban non-residents from parking on certain streets during daytime hours.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged <b>potential</b> <b>customers</b> from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E
