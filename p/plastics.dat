40|$|Wide {{usage of}} {{mulching}} technology has increased crop yields, but the {{large amounts of}} mulching film residue resulting from widespread use of <b>plastic</b> film in China has brought about a series of pollution hazards.

5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of <b>plastics</b> are {{commonly}} welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and <b>plastics</b> have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene <b>plastics</b> in the construction of models.

40|$|The gross <b>plastic</b> {{deformation}} {{and associated}} <b>plastic</b> loads of four axisymmetric torispherical pressure vessels {{are determined by}} two criteria of <b>plastic</b> collapse: the ASME twice elastic slope (TES) criterion and the recently proposed <b>plastic</b> work curvature (PWC) criterion. Finite element analysis was performed assuming small and large deformation theory and elastic–perfectly <b>plastic</b> and bilinear kinematic hardening material models. Two <b>plastic</b> collapse modes are identified: bending-dominated <b>plastic</b> collapse of the knuckle region in small deformation models and membrane-dominated <b>plastic</b> collapse of the cylinder or domed end in large deformation models. In both circumstances, the PWC criterion indicates that a <b>plastic</b> hinge bending mechanism leads to gross <b>plastic</b> deformation and {{is used as a}} parameter to identify the respective <b>plastic</b> loads. The results of the analyses also show that the PWC criterion leads to higher design loads for strain hardening structures than the TES criterion, as it takes account of the effect of strain hardening on the evolution of the gross <b>plastic</b> deformation mechanism...|$|R
