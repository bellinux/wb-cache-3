5000|$|Another {{short-lived}} concurrent label was Sunrise, {{which may}} have been made for sale by artists or [...] "mom & pop" [...] stores. Few discs, and essentially no information, survive.

50|$|A third edition {{began in}} 1930 by the Cova Record Corporation and was {{strictly}} commercial dance bands and vocals specially recorded for QRS, pressed on inferior shellac material. It was most certainly a budget <b>priced</b> <b>label</b> {{and based on}} its rarity, was probably never sold throughout the country. It's doubtful the label survived into 1931. Only 57 numbers (1000-1056) have been traced.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} the Colruyt company was almost bankrupt, {{competing}} with newcomer Aldi. From 1988 the company slowly returned to profitability.

Replenishment, stock management and orders were automated with bar code scanners.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the price of milk is {{sometimes}} used (perhaps semi-humorously) as a way of distinguishing how detached the wealthy are from the reality perceived by the less wealthy. This is characterized by people who either do not read the <b>price</b> <b>labels</b> on their food or have others to do their shopping, and hence are unaware of the monetary cost of basic necessities.|$|R
50|$|Piggyback {{labels are}} made from {{combining}} two layers of adhesive substrate. The bottom layer forms the backing for the top. The label {{can be applied to}} any object as normal, the top layer can be a removable label that can be applied elsewhere, which may change the message or marking on the remaining label underneath. Often used on Express mail envelopes. Other applications include <b>price</b> change <b>labels</b> where when being scanned at the till, the till assistant can peel back the price-reduction label and scan the original barcode enabling stock flow management. Also, as the retained label is adhesive free it prevents customers from re-applying the cheaper <b>priced</b> <b>labels</b> to premium products.|$|R
50|$|Because {{he spent}} many years {{creating}} instruments for W.E. Hill, C.F Langonet <b>labelled</b> <b>instruments</b> are extremely rare but highly regarded.

5000|$|In 2011, {{during the}} celebration of MİT's 85th anniversary of foundation, it was learnt that the {{institution}} owns a spy museum.

50|$|In 1987 Interceptor {{launched}} Pandora, a new premium <b>priced</b> <b>label.</b> Pandora released several {{games for}} 8 and 16bit computers.

Other titles included Galdregon's Domain (1988), Xenomorph (1990), Outlands (1989) and Debut (1990). It is believed Debut (a complex planet simulator coupled with a side-scroller action element) {{was one of the}} last titles to be published under the Pandora label, in December 1990.|$|R
50|$|Fisher v Bell 1961 1 QB 394 is an English {{contract}} law case concerning {{the requirements of}} offer and acceptance {{in the formation of}} a contract. The case established that, where goods are displayed in a shop together with a <b>price</b> <b>label,</b> such display is treated as an invitation to treat by the seller, and not an offer. The offer is instead made when the customer presents the item to the cashier together with payment. Acceptance occurs at the point the cashier takes payment.|$|R

50|$|Consumers tend to {{base their}} buying {{decisions}} on incomplete and biased information about total costs of products which {{is referred to}} as bounded rationality. Sufficient calculations of savings due to lower use costs (e.g. energy consumption) and trade-offs are not possible under these conditions, although savings are probable. This price sensitivity of consumers is enforced by price focused marketing techniques. Sustainable marketers consequently may use producer instruments such as saving calculators (e.g. energy saving potential of Electrolux lights), life cycle cost information sheets or <b>labeling</b> <b>instruments</b> to emphasize the advantages of lower use costs when compared to conventional products.|$|R
5000|$|Fracture {{can also}} {{occur in the}} {{adherend}} if the adhesive is tougher than the adherend. In this case, the adhesive remains intact and is still bonded to one substrate and remnants of the other. For example, when one removes a <b>price</b> <b>label,</b> the adhesive usually remains on the label and the surface. This is cohesive failure. If, however, a layer of paper remains stuck to the surface, the adhesive has not failed. Another example is when someone tries to pull apart Oreo cookies and all the filling remains on one side; this is an adhesive failure, rather than a cohesive failure.|$|R
