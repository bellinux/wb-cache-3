40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>pralidoxime</b> <b>iodide,</b> 1, 1 -trimethylenebis(4 -formylpyridinium bromide) dioxime and {{diacetyl}} monoxime on {{the activity of}} phosphorylphosphatase prepared from pig kidney in vitro have been studied. It was found that these oximes, even at high concentrations, {{did not affect the}} activity of the enzyme...|$|E
3000|$|... 5, 5 -Dithio-bis- 2 -nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI), and {{bovine serum}} albumin (BSA), were {{procured}} from Sisco Research Laboratories (Mumbai, India). <b>Pralidoxime</b> <b>iodide</b> (25  mg/mL) was procured {{from a local}} pharmacy. Technical grade (76 %) sample monocrotophos (dimethyl (E)- 1 -methyl- 2 -(methylcarbomoyl) vinyl phosphate) {{was a gift from}} Hyderabad Chemical Supplies Ltd. (Hyderabad, India). All other chemicals used in the study were of analytical grade.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} four organophosphorous compounds, three oximes and {{atropine}} sulphate, injected through an indwelling cannula {{into the third}} ventricle of unanaesthetized dogs were examined. The effects of 200 μg of dyflos were involuntary micturition, defaecation, akinesia of hind limbs and pronounced disturbances of awareness; those of 100 μg of ethyl pyrophosphate were tremor, restlessness and signs of fear; 500 μg to 5 mg of dyflos and 250 μg to 500 μg of ethyl pyrophosphate caused vomiting, salivation, twitches of facial muscles and recurrent epileptiform seizures. The injection of 40 to 80 mg of dimefox and of 50 mg of schradan elicited involuntary micturition, vomiting, salivation and defaecation. These effects occur probably after these substances have passed into the blood stream and have been converted in the liver to potent anticholinesterases. This view {{is supported by the}} finding of reduced blood cholinesterase activity. At a dose level of 12. 5 mg, 1, 1 '-trimethylenebis(4 -hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium bromide) produced strong convulsions. At this dose level <b>pralidoxime</b> <b>iodide</b> and diacetyl monoxime produced no observable effects. Atropine sulphate in a dose of 1 mg caused disturbances in consciousness and behaviour followed by convulsions. Intraventricular atropine and to a minor extent intraventricular oximes were able to antagonize the effects of intraventricular ethyl pyrophosphate. <b>Pralidoxime</b> <b>iodide</b> exerted a strong antagonistic effect also on intravenous injection...|$|E
50|$|Pralidoxime, 2-pyridinaldoxime methylchloride, is {{prepared}} by treating pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde with hydroxylamine. The resulting pyridine-2-aldoxime is alkylated with methyl <b>iodide</b> giving <b>pralidoxime</b> as the <b>iodide</b> salt.|$|R
40|$|In {{experiments}} on mice treated with <b>pralidoxime</b> <b>iodide</b> (pyridine- 2 -aldoxime methiodide; PAM) and atropine, the cholinesterase {{activity in the}} brain was assayed after poisoning with very high doses of organophosphorous anticholinesterases. Acetylcholine {{was added to the}} buffer solution in which the brains were homogenized. This precaution reduced the combination between free inhibitor present in the tissue and active enzyme, and the cholinesterase activity found was below 0 · 5 % of controls. When the experimental data were corrected for spontaneous reactivation in vitro during incubation, the calculated activities in vivo were even less. It is concluded that mice can survive complete inactivation of the cholinesterase in the central nervous system, if enough atropine is given to protect the animals against the toxic effects of the accumulating acetylcholine...|$|E
30|$|A {{combination}} of anticholinergic drugs, AChE reactivators (oximes), and anticonvulsants (symptomatic drugs) {{is considered the}} most promising treatment of organophosphate poisonings (Marrs, Rice, & Vale, 2006). Pralidoxime (PAM), trimedoxime (TMB 4 or TMC 4), obidoxime (LüH- 6), methoxime (MMB 4 or MMC 4), and HI- 6 (HI- 6 2 Cl or HI- 6 DMS) are examples of AChE reactivators available for treating OPI intoxication (Antonijevic & Stojiljkovic, 2007). However, {{there is no single}} broad-spectrum AChE reactivator with potency to activate AChE inhibited by many OP compounds, and hence, new reactivators are being still being synthesized and evaluated (Chambers et al., 2016; Chambers, Meek, & Chambers, 2016; Kliachyna et al., 2014; McHardy, Wang, McCowen, & Valdez, 2017). In order to understand the involvement of AChE inhibition in monocrotophos-induced paralysis in C. elegans, we co-incubated the worms with both monocrotophos and <b>pralidoxime</b> <b>iodide</b> (PAM), an AChE reactivator. PAM {{is one of the many}} oxime-based substances clinically used to reactivate AChE inhibited by OPI. The mechanism by which PAM activates the enzyme is based on nucleophilic attack followed by displacement of the phosphoryl group from the enzyme as the oxime-inhibitor complex (Kuca, RC, Musilek, Jun, & Pohanka, 2009). We observed that PAM rescued worms from the paralyzing effects of monocrotophos. PAM activated, albeit partially, AChE activity inhibited by monocrotophos. This further suggests that AChE inhibition is the underlying mechanism of monocrotophos-induced paralysis. More importantly, the OPI model of paralysis described in the present study utilizing paralysis as a visualizable physiological end point with AChE assay can be further developed as a good model for screening AChE reactivators.|$|E
