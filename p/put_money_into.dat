5|$|Marie-Pascale Elfman, at {{the time}} of shooting, was married to {{director}} Richard Elfman. She designed the film's expressionistic sets and starred in the film. Actor and former Mystic Knight Gene Cunningham helped fund the film. When Cunningham and Elfman ran out of money during production, Richard and Marie-Pascale Elfman helped finance by selling houses, before Carl Borack <b>put</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the production in order for Elfman to complete the film. According to Elfman, he had originally intended the film to be screened in color, stating that the original plan was to ship the film to China, where each frame would be hand-tinted, but that this plan was not practical within the production costs.|$|E
5|$|The baths were {{originally}} built in approximately 1815, {{by a local}} builder called Newton, from John Pinch the elder's design, on the Duke of Cleveland's land, giving the site its name. They were intended as public pleasure baths, and {{are believed to be}} the oldest surviving outdoor swimming baths in England. The area of Bath to the north and east of the River Avon was undergoing development {{at the end of the}} 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, after the opening of Pulteney Bridge on land around Bathwick which had been owned by William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. William Johnstone had inherited the land and planned to create a new town. It was foreseen that, along with the access provided by Pulteney Bridge and Great Pulteney Street, the eastern side of the Avon would become popular with speculators and developers, as Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors. In the 18th century, Bath acquired its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, along with the Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, who presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. After 1789, the financial climate did not encourage further building, as the Panic of 1797, related to a period of deflation between 1793 and 1800, was followed by the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the Depression of 1807. These limited the proposed development of new housing in the area for some years. The Bathwick Water Act of 1801 had prohibited nude bathing in the river and meant that many local subscribers were willing to <b>put</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the construction of the baths.|$|E

25|$|Galveston {{had become}} one of the largest {{shipping}} centers in the nation during the 19th century, but the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 destroyed much of the city and made outside investors leery of continuing to <b>put</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the island.

Attempting to diversify away from shipping, business leaders tried various means of reviving tourism and establishing new enterprises such as insurance.|$|E
25|$|The {{bank was}} {{organized}} {{by a group of}} men led by Condy Raguet, who had read about the concept of savings banks becoming popular in Great Britain. The bank quickly began to expand by adding services and branches, and moving into larger headquarters buildings. By the late 1910s, PSFS had the most depositors of any savings bank in the United States; it was second to the Emigrant Savings Bank in the amount of money deposited. PSFS began programs in the 1920s that encouraged children to <b>put</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> savings accounts instead of spending it on treats and school programs, allowing children to open accounts with PSFS.|$|E

25|$|Díaz was a {{political}} pragmatist and not an ideologue, likely seeing that the religious question re-opened political discord in Mexico. When he rebelled against Lerdo, Díaz had at least the tacit and perhaps even the explicit support of the Church. When he {{came to power in}} 1877, Díaz left the anti-clerical laws in place, but no longer enforced them as state policy, leaving that to individual Mexican states. This led to the re-emergence of the Church in many areas, but in others a less full role. The Church flouted the Reform prohibitions against wearing clerical garb, there were open-air processions and Masses, and religious orders existed. The Church also recovered its property, sometimes through intermediaries, and tithes were again collected. The Church regained its role in education, with the complicity of the Díaz regime which did not <b>put</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> public education. The Church also regained its role in running charitable institutions. Despite an increasingly visible role of the Catholic Church during the Porfiriato, the Vatican was unsuccessful in getting the reinstatement of a formal relationship between the papacy and Mexico, and the constitutional limitations of the Church as an institution remained the law of the land.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 2009, Miller {{requested}} {{federal funding}} from the Harper government's $12-billion stimulus spending to purchase new streetcars {{as part of the}} Transit City plan. The city faced a deadline of 27 June 2009 to commit to the $1.2-billion deal signed with Bombardier for the 204 streetcars. Miller and Premier Dalton McGuinty flew to Thunder Bay to announce their funding for the new streetcars, hoping to convince the Harper government to come up with its one-third share of the cost. Federal Transport Minister John Baird rejected the request outright. Baird stated that streetcar funding clearly failed to meet the stimilus bill's requirement that the funds would have to be spent in 2 years, as that was meant to <b>put</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the economy quickly to buoy demand and staving off deflation, while Transit City would have been a long-term project. Also the stimulus required funds to be spent on infrastructure in the municipality where the application is granted in order to create local employment, whereas the jobs created by building streetcars would be in Thunder Bay and not Toronto. Baird noted that Toronto was the only one out of 2,700 applicants that didn't meet the eligibility criteria.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to this turn of events, McCalmont Brothers liquidated its holdings in the Reading and withdrew from ongoing litigation. The forty-year predominance of English capital in the finances and affairs of the Reading Railroad was thus ended; but in exchange the company's future became a fresh, inviting target for opportunistic American capital. In 1881 and 1882 the Coal & Iron Co. continued to register losses, but the railroad actually saw upturns in its passenger, coal and merchandise freight business lines. Austerity measures implemented early in the bankruptcy at the railroad's car production and repair shops in Reading now found these operations taxed to their limits. Rather than rehabilitate these units, though, Gowen <b>put</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> building diverse new stations {{as well as a}} million-bushel grain elevator at Port Richmond. He also moved to expand the Reading Railroad's scope by having it lease the Central Railroad of New Jersey (the Jersey Central). Vanderbilt supported the move as it would increase the value of his own railroad's interconnection at New York Harbor. Ominously, the Jersey Central was at the time in receivership, and the deal included assumption by Gowen's Reading of the Jersey Central's US$2 million of floating debt and guaranteeing a 6% dividend on all of the Central's stock then outstanding.|$|E

500|$|Paul Raibourn {{served as}} the {{president}} of Paramount Television Productions. Raibourn was also appointed vice president of Paramount Pictures Corporation, and, due to Paramount's minority interest in DuMont, was installed as treasurer of the DuMont Television Network. This appointment created another point of conflict between Paramount and DuMont. According to Leonard Goldenson, president of ABC during this era, Raibourn [...] "constantly nitpicked and needled [...] over the smallest expenditures. DuMont came to the point where, psychologically, he thought he couldn't do anything without Raibourn's approval." [...] Raibourn trimmed DuMont's budgets {{at a time when the}} network should have been expanding. Goldenson credits Raibourn as one of the reasons ABC eventually became a successful, established television network while the DuMont network failed: [...] "the name of the television game is programs.

2500|$|Needing {{additional}} {{sources of}} finance to fund Birmingham's bid for immediate promotion {{back to the}} Football League First Division, the board approached Clifford Coombs, founder of home credit company S, for a loan.

My heart is in Birmingham City and now my pocket will be as well", became chairman in January 1966, and lured Stan Cullis, manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers in their glory days, out of retirement. Cullis's team played attractive football, and average attendance doubled between 1965–66 and 1967–68. Cullis led Birmingham to the semi-final of the League Cup in 1967, and in the 1967–68 FA Cup, they beat Arsenal and Chelsea in front of crowds in excess of 50,000 at St Andrew's before losing to West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final. Cup success was not restricted to the first team: the youth team reached {{the final of the}} FA Youth Cup in 1967, losing to what was described as an experienced Sunderland team. Fourth place in the division in 1967–68 and seventh in 1968–69 preceded a slump towards the bottom of the table, and Coombs decided {{it was time for a}} change. He persuaded Cullis back into retirement in March 1970, and approached top-class managers, including Brian Clough and Peter Taylor and Don Revie, without success, before appointing Freddie Goodwin of Brighton & Hove Albion manager.|$|E
