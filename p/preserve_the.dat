The publication of their condition, sketches and interpretation by James Burgess in 1871 brought wider attention. The earliest efforts to <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909, when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act included it within its scope.
