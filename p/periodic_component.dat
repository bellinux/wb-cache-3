40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{estimating}} {{the parameters of}} the continuous spectrum of a time series which might contain <b>periodic</b> <b>components</b> is studied. When a series contains <b>periodic</b> <b>components,</b> the periodogram ordinates at frequencies near the frequencies of the <b>periodic</b> <b>components</b> have significant amplitude, and can be viewed as outliers in an exponential sample. Three estimation procedures are proposed, which apply robust techniques on the periodogram ordinates to reduce the effect of the peaks. Under some regularity conditions, the asymptotic distributions of the estimates are derived. The proposed procedures have one major advantage that they do not need a precise model for the <b>periodic</b> <b>components,</b> and therefore can be applied when the <b>periodic</b> <b>components</b> are too complicated to model or when the number of the <b>periodic</b> <b>components</b> is unknown.

40|$|Abstract—Internet usage over mobile devices {{is on the}} rise. The {{bandwidth}} {{demand for}} mobile Internet access is also increasing {{with the number of}} mobile users. To answer users ’ demand, carrier aggregation is proposed in LTE-A system. In carrier aggregation, the best available one or more component carriers of each band are assigned to each user to provide efficient services. Several works {{have been reported in the}} literature on mandatory and <b>periodic</b> <b>component</b> carrier assignment methods. Although the previous works, especially <b>periodic</b> <b>component</b> carrier assign-ment methods, have significantly improved performance of LTE and LTE-A systems, many limitations still exist. One limitation of previous works is that data transfer is interrupted during <b>periodic</b> <b>component</b> carrier assignment operation which can decrease performance of the system. Therefore, in this paper, selective <b>periodic</b> <b>component</b> carrier assignment technique which allows continues data transfer during periodic carrier assignment operations is proposed. Results show that the proposed technique increases throughput rate up to 25 % and decreases average delay time up to 35 %.
