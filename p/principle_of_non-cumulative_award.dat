40|$|O imposto sobre produtos industrializados é um tributo de competência da União, nos termos do art. 153, IV da Constituição Federal, sendo objeto de estudos do presente trabalho. Considerando que o imposto sobre produtos industrializados teve sua origem no imposto sobre consumo, iniciamos o trabalho traçando a evolução histórica desse tributo nas Constituições Federais, para melhor compreensão de suas características, e de sua materialidade, que se apresenta com interpretações divergentes. As materialidades do IPI foram construídas a partir do texto constitucional que prescreveu a sua incidência sobre produto industrializado, bem como das disposições da lei complementar, que estabeleceu três hipóteses de incidência, mas, {{considerando que}} a lei ordinária instituiu apenas duas delas, o desenvolvimento do trabalho circunscreveu-se às construções das regras-matrizes de incidência de importação de produtos industrializados e industrialização de produtos para o mercado interno. Os critérios das regras-matrizes foram analisados e desenvolvidos, tendo sido abordados os critérios da hipótese material, espacial e temporal, bem como os critérios do consequente pessoal e quantitativo. Por meio do exame de alguns princípios constitucionais aplicados ao IPI, delinearam-se suas principais características, fundamentalmente, pela possibilidade de o Poder Executivo alterar as alíquotas por Decreto, mas dentro dos limites estabelecidos pela lei, o que releva afirmar a observância do princípio da legalidade. O princípio da anterioridade se aplica ao IPI somente quanto à anterioridade nonagesimal, não se lhe aplicando a anterioridade anual. Tratou-se do princípio da não cumulatividade, que objetiva salvaguardar o direito de {{abatimento}} entre as operações havidas e, consequentemente, tornar o produto final mais barato, e se realizou o exame do direito de crédito do contribuinte como repercussão do princípio da não cumulatividade. Por fim, a seletividade pela essencialidade foi analisada conjuntamente com a extrafiscalidade, resultando na conclusão de que a essencialidade é categoria autônoma, sendo fator determinante na fixação da carga tributária e política fiscal impositiva, onde as medidas atinentes aos produtos essenciais são peremptórias, não se confundindo com a extrafiscalidade, cujas medidas são desejadas pelo Estado, com liberdade de escolha e da forma de execução, podendo a seletividade ser aplicada na essencialidade e na extrafiscalidadeThe Tax on Industrialized Products (IPI) {{is a tax}} of Union competence, pursuant to art. 153, IV of the Federal Constitution, {{and it is the}} subject of study of this work. Whereas such a tax had its origin in the excise tax, we began this study by tracing the historical evolution of this tax in Federal Constitutions, for better understanding its characteristics, and of its materiality, which has varying interpretations. The materiality of the IPI were built from the Constitution which prescribed its impact on industrialized product {{as well as from the}} additional provisions of the law, which established three hypotheses incidence, but, considering that the ordinary law instituted only two of them, the work development is confined to the constructions of matrix rules of incidence of importing manufactured goods and industrialization of products for the domestic market. The criteria of the matrix-rules were developed and analyzed, by addressing the criteria of the material, spatial and temporal hypothesis, as well as the consequent quantitative and personal criteria. Through examination <b>of</b> some constitutional <b>principles</b> applied to IPI, its main features were outlined basically by the Executive Branch s ability to alter the rates by means of a Decree, but within the limits established by law, which allows stating the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legality. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> precedence is applied to the IPI only in relation to the 90 -day holding period, not being applied to the same tax year. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-cumulative</b> tax, which aims to safeguard the right of rebate rate incurred among operations and therefore to make the end product more cheaply, was studied as well as the examination of the taxpayer s right to credit as repercussions <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-cumulative</b> tax was held. Finally, the selectivity for essentiality was analyzed jointly with extrafiscality, resulting in the conclusion that the essentiality is an independent category and the determining factor in setting the tax burden and imposing fiscal policy, where the measures relating to essential commodities are peremptory, not mingling with extrafiscalidade, whose measures are desired by the State, with freedom for choosing and applying, in which selectivity can be applied in essentiality and extrafiscalit...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} sources of {{law has been}} a matter of {{considerable}} attention not only in legal theory and philosophy but also in positive law disciplines. Sources of law are commonly divided into substantive, formal and value-based sources. Depending on classifications suggested by different authors, general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> law may fall into all three categories of sources <b>of</b> law. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> domestic law are rules covering a vast number of specific situations which are subsequently used as grounds for generating numerous norms regulating these situations in more detail. In international law, there are general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> international law as well as legal principles recognized by civilized nations. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the European Union law {{are an integral part of}} the positive EU legislation, which clearly differentiates them from similar sets of general goals, objectives, values, agenda postulates, and the like. The general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are have their origins in the Founding Treaties, the legal systems of the Member States and the case law of the EU Court of Justice. Considering their content and legal nature, the general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are divided into: compulsory or axiomatic principles, regulatory or structural principles (which all national laws of the Member States have in common), and the general principles inherent to the EU legal order. Some of the most important general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are: the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> supremacy of EU law over the national law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> direct effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> autonomy of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> full effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> State liability for damage, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legal certainty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith and fair dealing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> fair hearing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> subsidiarity, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> proportionality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> non-discrimination, etc...|$|R

40|$|Existing cost {{analysis}} frameworks have been defined for cumulative resources which keep on increasing along the computation. Traditional cumulative resources are execution time, number of executed steps, amount of memory allocated, and energy consumption. Noncumulative resources are acquired and (possibly) released along the execution.

We present, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first generic static analysis framework to infer an upper bound on the peak cost for <b>non-cumulative</b> types <b>of</b> resources. Our analysis comprises several components: (1) a pre-analysis to infer when resources are being used simultaneously, (2) a program-point resource analysis which infers an upper bound on the cost at the points of interest (namely the points where resources are acquired) and (3) the elimination from the upper bounds obtained in (2) of those resources accumulated that are not used simultaneously.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to be an outline of Kuhn's conception of the relations between the history of science and the history of art and, at the same time, an introduction to Kuhn's philosophy of science. Kuhn considers that his influential book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, is a portrayal of the development of science as a succession of periods dominated by tradition and punctuated by non-cumulative ruptures. He borrows this idea of development from other fields, including the history of art. Thus, I follow here the footsteps of the Austrian historian of art, Ernst Gombrich, whose name is suggested by Kuhn himself. And I strive to show what Kuhn has in mind when he speaks of a transposition of the idea <b>of</b> <b>non-cumulative</b> development, found in the history of art, to the realm of science (which was traditionally thought to be characterized by a specific cumulative progress). This allows us to introduce some of Kuhn's fundamental notions of the philosophy of science, such as the concepts of "paradigm" and "incommensurability", understanding them beforehand, more intuitively, {{within the context of the}} history of art...|$|R

After controlling for multiple contextual factors associated with reduction, word frequency, which reflects a speaker 2 ̆ 7 s cumulative experience with a word, {{has been reported to}} predict several types of pronunciation reduction. However, word frequency effects are not found consistently. Some studies have alternatively reported effects on reduction of the cumulative exposure of words to specific reducing environments or measures of contextual predictability.

The results show effects <b>of</b> <b>non-cumulative</b> factors on reduction, argued to occur on-line during articulation.
