Optimum condition of ink-jet printing {{with respect to the}} content of pre-treatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> and steaming time has been successfully developed through the orthogonal analysis. The parameters of the pre-treatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> including sodium alginate, urea and ammonium tartrate, as well as the post-treatment of steaming time right after ink-jet printing have been investigated. The optimum content of the pre-treatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> and the proper condition of post-treatment has been developed to achieve higher colour yield for cyan, yellow, magenta and black color (CYMK). The results of the highest colour yield obtained confirm that steaming time is the most dominating factor when compared with the other factors. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

The research is about the application of chitosan separately on the cotton fabric for digital ink-jet printing. a two-bath method was utilized in order to evaluate the effect of neutralization during the mixing of chitosan solution and sodium bicarbonate, which is the test material, in the pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> preparation process. The fabrics were treated with an alkali bath after the chitosan treatment with acidic bath method. Results show that the best color yield was obtained with the two-bath method. In addition, the neutralization effect happened within the pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> and consequently reducing the effectiveness of digital ink-jet printing. In terms of color fastness, an improvement in it {{was caused by the}} introduction of primary amino groups into the cellulosic fiber structure.

40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} plasma (APP) {{treatment was}} applied as a pretreatment process {{to enhance the}} deposition of <b>printing</b> <b>paste</b> {{in order to improve}} the final colour properties of digital ink-jet printed cotton fabrics. Three <b>printing</b> <b>pastes</b> containing natural polymers, i. e. (1) sodium alginate, (2) chitosan and (3) sodium alginate-chitosan mixture, were prepared separately. After APP treatment, cotton fabric was padded with different <b>printing</b> <b>pastes</b> prior to digital ink-jet printing. Experimental results showed that APP pretreatment could increase the colour yield of the digital ink-jet printed cotton fabric significantly even after washing. In addition, other properties such as colour fastness to crocking, colour fastness to laundering, outline sharpness and anti-bacterial properties were also improved when compared with those of the control cotton fabric printed without APP pretreatment. However, the influence of <b>printing</b> <b>paste</b> on the colour properties of the digital ink-jet printed cotton fabrics depended very much on the composition of the <b>printing</b> <b>paste.</b> The scanning electron microscope images evidenced that the APP treatment could enhance the deposition of <b>printing</b> <b>paste</b> on the cotton fabric surface as proved qualitatively by both the contact angle and wetting time measurement as well as quantitatively by both the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and carboxyl group/nitrogen content analysis.

The printing performance, using original and recycled polymers, was studied via rheological properties of <b>printing</b> <b>pastes</b> and quality-determining parameters of printing. A quantitative interpretation of the flow and the viscoelastic properties, which are strongly connected to the qualitative parameters of printing, was obtained using rheological models (Cross and Friedrich–Braun model).

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using chitosan as a thickener in the pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> for textile ink-jet printing was explored. An orthogonal {{analysis was used}} to determine the optimum conditions for using chitosan as a thickener in the pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> and the effects of different process factors for achieving the best color yield in textile ink-jet printing. With the help of the orthogonal analysis, the importance of different process factors was found to be in the order of (1) the amount of urea used, (2) the amount of chitosan used, (3) the amount of sodium bicarbonate used, and (4) the steaming time. On the basis {{of the results of the}} orthogonal analysis, the optimum conditions for using chitosan as a thickener for the pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> were concluded to be 40 mL of chitosan, 10 g of urea, 8 g of sodium bicarbonate, and 5 min of steaming. According to an analysis of the results of different color fastness tests, chitosan could principally work as a pretreatment <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> thickener. However, the final color yield obtained from chitosan-containing cotton fabrics depended greatly on the stage of the chitosan application. Nevertheless, the color fastness properties and the outline sharpness of the prints of cotton fabric were greatly improved by the chitosan treatment. A two-bath chitosan treatment was developed to separate the chitosan from sodium bicarbonate and urea before it was padded onto the fabric surface to minimize the neutralization effect. On the basis of the results for the highest color yield obtained on the cotton fabric, it was confirmed that the two-bath chitosan treatment was successfully developed. In addition, chitosan could impart higher antibacterial properties with a slight reduction in the tensile strength of the cotton fabric. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

The printed, fired and plated fingers covers only 70 % of the area of a screen-printed contact; {{at the same time}} the line conductivity is improved due to followed light induced plating step. The requirements for an aerosol ink were determined and an ink was formulated. The ink was successively improved to extend the machine uptime, to decrease the printed line width and to increase the printing speed. Additionally a commercially available screen <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> was modified for aerosol printing. Line widths below 50 ?m using a diluted screen print ink and line width below 20 ?m and machine uptimes of more than 10 hours are possible using a new ink formulation. The minimum amount of silver ink which is necessary to process a front side contact, electrically and mechanically, was determined. The contacts were analyzed, and solar cells were processed on monocrystalline and multicrystalline material. The new formulated aerosol ink was tested on 15. 6 cm x 15. 6 cm mc Si solar cells, achieving efficiencies up to 16. 5 %.

40|$|Although {{a lot of}} {{antibacterial}} finishes {{are available}} for cotton, the user safety and durability of the finish are always the important issues. Some of the natural dyes are known to possess antibacterial properties; however, {{most of them are}} nonsubstantive. Hence, they are used in conjunction with eco-friendly natural mordants. Although metallic mordants are effective, they are environmentally pollutants, hence not desirable. In the current work, the novel natural mordant like chitosan with different concentrations (10 % and 20 % of weight of fiber) was applied on cotton and fabric was printed with natural dyes such as catechu, turmeric, and marigold using screen printing method. All the three dyes were used in powder form in <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> with different concentrations (1 %, 5 %, and 10 %) and guar gum was used as thickener. The printed samples using chitosan as a mordant showed the equivalent color values to that of prints obtained using alum as a mordant.

40|$|In {{order to}} facilely {{increase}} the color yield of ink-jet prints using reactive inks, one-bath pretreatment of cotton fabrics with pretreatment formulation containing sodium alginate, glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTA), sodium hydroxide, and urea {{is designed for}} realizing sizing and cationization at the same time. The pretreatment conditions, including the concentrations of GTA and alkali, baking temperature, and time are optimized based on the result of thecolor yield on cationic cotton for magenta ink. The mechanism for color yield enhancement on GTA-modified fabrics is discussed and the stability of GTA in the <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> is investigated. Scanning electron microscopey, tear strength, and thermogravimetric analysis of the modified and unmodified cotton are studied and compared.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of a new two-layer process to contact industrial solar cells. However, most of the results seem to be transferable to standard screen <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> contacts. The seed layer was created by a pad or screen printer and thickened by light-induced plating (LIP) of silver. These contact structures were investigated microscopically {{to gain a better understanding}} of the observed electrical parameters. A review of the present microscopic contact formation model for flat surfaces is presented. This model was extended and applied to surfaces textured with random pyramids. This analysis has revealed two new types of silver crystallites which can be described by a crystallographic model. The dependence of the silver crystallite density on the surface doping concentration was investigated. Next, the dependence of the contact resistance on the width of the seed layer was measured showing that the contact resistivity increases with a reduction of the seed layer width. These results have been further approved by an analysis of SEM images of wet-chemically etched contacts examining the density of crystallites and the fraction of removed SiNx layer. Contact resistance R-C measurements before and after LIP of silver showed surprisingly a positive influence of tire plating process on R-C. A detailed microscopical analysis revealed four new possible current flow paths due to the LIP of a conventional contact or a seed layer. The results led to an extension of the existing model for a screen printed contact...|$|E
40|$|Indigo is {{insoluble}} {{in water}} and most dyeing solvents. Hence, its use in textile coloration is achieved by alkaline reduction to a soluble leuco-compound and then applying this solution followed by oxidation. Printing with indigo on cotton commonly employs sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) as the alkali and sodium hydrosulphite (hydros) as the reducing agent. Caustic soda poses effluent disposal problems. Hydros rapidly loses potency by reacting with atmospheric oxygen during the printing / padding process. This causes premature oxidation of <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> and necessitates constant monitoring. Further, the degradation products of hydros pose effluent hazards. Hence, {{there is a constant}} search to find better alternatives in terms of chemical stability and effluent management. In the above context, the present research used thiourea dioxide (TUD) as a more stable reducing agent and sodium carbonate as a milder alkali. The resulting effect on printing cotton fabric with both natural and synthetic indigo has been evaluated. The shades obtained using synthetic indigo were about 20 % darker than those obtained using natural indigo. When caustic soda was used as the alkali, a steaming time of 60 seconds was found to be ideal, for both natural and synthetic indigo. However, when sodium carbonate was used darkest shades were obtained at steaming times of 2 and 6 minutes for natural and synthetic indigo respectively. The printed samples showed good colour fastness ratings when evaluated according to Australian standards. The study concludes that indigo can be printed on cotton fabric using chemicals with a lesser environmental impac...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the findings from}} investigations into adapting the padding process for dyeing cotton and wool using natural dyes. The aim was to apply traditional dyes employing current and emerging technologies of textile colouration. This synergistic amalgamation led to a cleaner production process with low environmental impact. Mordant dyes (derived from Acacia catechu and Acacia nilotica) and vat dyes (Indigofera tinctoria) were evaluated. The work on mordant dyes focused on determining optimal process parameters (padding sequence, mordanting method and mordant concentration). Post-mordanting with copper (II) sulfate or iron (II) sulphate yielded the darkest shades for both dyes. Ideal process sequence for copper (II) sulfate was pad (dye) → dry → steam followed by pad (mordant) → steam → dry while for iron (II) sulfate it was pad (dye) → steam → dry followed by pad (mordant) → steam → dry for both dyes. Similarly, use of the first mordant yielded a beige shade while a yellow-grey shade was obtained with the second. Optimum mordant concentration for 10 g/l dye was 15 g/l copper (II) sulfate or 5 g/l iron (II) sulphate for both dyes. These were lower than those recommended for exhaust dyeing (5 % OWM) and padding (60 g/l) reported in the literature. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed higher amount of metal in the dyed fabric compared to identically mordanted fabric, confirming {{the formation of a}} dye-metal-textile complex. FTIR spectra were distinctly different for the two dyes investigated. However, the spectra for dyed samples, coloured using the above dyes in combination with the same mordant, exhibited minimal differences. This indicated that metal {{plays a major role in}} defining the bonds created during dye-metal-textile complex formation causing a similarity in shade. Darker shades were obtained by atmospheric pressure plasma pretreatment of the textile, or including chitosan in the pad liquor. Pure helium and a 95 / 5 helium/nitrogen mixture were evaluated as the plasma gas. Exposure to either plasma improved the wettability of wool. Wool treated in pure helium plasma for 14 seconds exhibited a 30 % increase in the depth of shade. A tone-on-tone pattern was created in a single padding operation by selective plasma pretreatment. Incorporation of 0. 05 % chitosan in the pad liquor resulted in a 20 % darker shade while imparting antimicrobial properties to the dyed fabric. Indigo was applied on cotton by the vat dyeing process of pad (dye) → dry → pad (reducing chemicals) → steam. In this process, sodium dithionite and sodium hydroxide, the common reducing agent and alkali in exhaust dyeing of indigo, were replaced by thiourea dioxide and sodium carbonate respectively. Although equivalent shades were obtained, the use of sodium carbonate required comparatively longer steaming time. Natural indigo produced a darker shade when reduced using the alternative chemicals perhaps due to its higher reactivity resulting from its lower crystallinity as compared to synthetic indigo. However, printing with synthetic indigo resulted in darker shades. The discrepancy between printing and dyeing may be attributed to interference by the <b>print</b> <b>paste</b> thickener on diffusion of reduced indigo into the fabric...|$|E
