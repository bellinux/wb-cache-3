40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this paper}} is to report {{findings}} from a major study that evaluated the Fitness for Practice nursing and midwifery curriculum in Scotland, UK. Background. The competence of student nurses and midwives at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> has been the focus of debate and research. However, no major study, on such a large scale, had specifically evaluated pre-registration programmes to determine whether they enabled students to achieve ‘fitness to practice’. Design. The study had a broad evaluation design conducted in three phases using a mixed methodology. Method. Phase 1 involved questionnaires, Objective Structured Clinical Examination’s (OSCE) and curriculum evaluation. Phase 2 involved semi-structured interviews (some telephone) and focus groups across main stakeholders: students (n = 78), mentors (n = 78), practice-education facilitators (n = 24), academics (n = 59), senior clinical (n = 46) and education managers (n = 16), service users and carers (n = 10). Results. The findings suggest that the Fitness for Practice curriculum model in Scotland has on the whole been successful. The key finding is the predominant opinion of stakeholders that newly qualified nurses and midwives are perceived as being fit for practice at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration.</b> A perceived lack of confidence is, as with all transitions to new roles, an understandable outcome. Conclusions. Previous concern that student nurses and midwives are not ‘fit for practice’ has focused on the perceived lack of clinical skills at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration,</b> not on competence to practice in general. This study demonstrates that this is an important distinction and recognises that registration is only the beginning of a life long learning experience. Relevance to clinical practice. Students need to be supported to develop their confidence following registration as well as additional skills in their chosen field of practice. Appropriate mentorship and a period of preceptorship should be in place to accommodate this...|$|E

40|$|The {{automatic}} and accurate <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data {{is a topic}} of great interest in the domains of city modeling, construction surveying or cultural heritage. While numerous {{of the most recent}} approaches focus on keypoint-based point cloud registration relying on forward-projected 2 D keypoints detected in panoramic intensity images, little {{attention has been paid to}} the selection of appropriate keypoint detector-descriptor combinations. Instead, keypoints are commonly detected and described by applying well-known methods such as the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) or Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF).

30|$|An {{evaluation}} of the overall performance of RIR {{can be carried out}} subjectively and objectively. An observer identifies subjectively the success or failure <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> result using overlaid image pairs. However, visual evaluation needs an expert observer and is not adequate for comparing the performance of different techniques on a large dataset. Therefore, objective measurement is necessary to evaluate the registration result. The performance <b>of</b> image <b>registration</b> methods can be measured by the centerline error measure [18, 26]. For each point on the vessel centerline, the distance to the nearest centerline point is found in the second image, and the median of these distances is considered a registration error. However, centerlines can be hard to detect for low-quality or unhealthy images. In practice, small difference will exist between coordinates <b>of</b> matched <b>points.</b> Therefore, accuracy <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> can be evaluated by the error in point placement as the RMSE between the transformed points and the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> reference image [5, 24]. We select 20 matched points manually using MATLAB R 2008 a and generate ground truth to evaluate the proposed approach. Points have to be distributed uniformly with an accurate localization.|$|R
40|$|Automatic image {{registration}} {{is an attractive}} and unresolved problem in the machine vision literature. This paper presents two novel structural constraints, namely proximity and closeness constraints, that improve both the accuracy and robustness of an existing motion consistency based algorithm (GICP) for automatic {{image registration}}. It also defines the conditions when such constraints are fired at specific <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> two overlapping range images. The proximity constraint says that neighbouring points should be neighbouring before and after a rigid motion. The closeness constraint implements a local closest point search from the second image to the first image. While the GICP algorithm uses an exhaustive search for the closest points, in this paper, we employ the optimised k–d tree data structure to accelerate the closest point search. A large number of experiments based on real range images demonstrate {{that the combination of}} rigid motion constraints with these novel proximity and closeness constraints leads to a more accurate and robust evaluation of possible correspondences leading, in turn, to more accurate, robust and efficient automatic image registration results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A 4 D image {{registration}} method is proposed for consistent estimation of cardiac motion from MR image sequences. Under this 4 D registration framework, all 3 D cardiac images taken at different time-points are registered simultaneously, and motion estimated is enforced to be spatiotemporally smooth, thereby overcoming potential limitations of some methods that typically estimate cardiac deformation sequentially from one frame to another, instead of treating the entire set of images as a 4 D volume. To facilitate our image matching process, an attribute vector {{is designed for}} each point in the image to include intensity, boundary and geometric moment invariants (GMIs). Hierarchical <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> two image sequences is achieved by using the most distinctive <b>points</b> for initial <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> two sequences and gradually adding less-distinctive <b>points</b> for refinement <b>of</b> <b>registration.</b> Experimental results on real data demonstrate good performance of the proposed method in registering cardiac images and estimating motions from cardiac image sequences. ...|$|R

40|$|Today a {{combined}} analysis of imaging and scanner data is {{state of the}} art, because advantages of both systems can be combined. Using terrestrial laser scanner data in a uniform coordinate system, requires a calculation to registrate the point clouds. This thesis presents a new approach <b>of</b> <b>point</b> cloud <b>registration</b> determining the best transformation between the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> views {{on the basis of}} straight lines that are extracted directly from the photographic pictures {{as well as from the}} point cloud. This approach exploits the advantages of both methods to determine optimal, spatial lines by evaluation of image and scanner data. These are used for the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> terrestrial laser scanner data. Because more and more precise lines can thus be produced, the new approach allows for many applications to be worked out which could not be evaluated before due to a lack of information in one system. The registry approach uses spatial straight lines instead <b>of</b> <b>point</b> clouds, so that the quantity of data is reduced substantially by this step. The presented registration needs no local control points, saving time and costs. This new registry approach is explained theoretically and the application is demonstrated by various examples...|$|R
