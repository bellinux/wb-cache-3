5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the fan motors within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound <b>Permanent</b> <b>Split</b> <b>Capacitor</b> (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat. Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control.

(PEG), the Consortium for Advanced Residential Buildings (CARB) has evaluated the Concept 3 (tm) replacement motors for residential furnaces. These brushless, permanent magnet (BPM) motors can use much less electricity than their PSC (<b>permanent</b> <b>split</b> <b>capacitor)</b> predecessors. This evaluation focuses on existing homes in the heating-dominated climate of upstate New York {{with the goals of}} characterizing field performance and cost-effectiveness. The results of this study are intended to be useful to home performance contractors, HVAC contractors, and home efficiency program stakeholders. The project includes eight homes in and near Syracuse, NY. Tests and monitoring was performed both before and after fan motors were replaced. Average fan power reductions were approximately 126 Watts during heating and 220 Watts during cooling operation. Over the course of entire heating and cooling seasons, these translated into average electric energy savings of 163 kWh. Average cost savings were $ 20 per year. Homes where the fan was used outside of heating and cooling mode saved an additional $ 42 per year on average. Results indicate that BPM replacement motors will be most cost-effective in HVAC systems with longer run times and relatively low duct static pressures. More dramatic savings are possible if occupants use the fan-only setting when there is no thermal load. There are millions of cold-climate, U.

40|$|Fans can {{be thought}} of as low {{pressure}} air pumps that utilize power from a motor to output a volumetric flow of air at a given pressure. A propeller converts torque from the motor to increase static pressure across the fan rotor and to increase the kinetic energy of the air particles. The motors are typically <b>permanent</b> <b>split</b> <b>capacitor</b> AC induction motors or brushless DC motors. We shall now look at this system in more detail. Types of Fans and Blowers Air moving devices are generally described as being either a type of fan (Fig. 1 a) or a centrifugal blower (Fig. 1 b). The main difference between fans and blowers is in their flow and pressure characteristics. Fans deliver air in an overall direction that is parallel to the fan blade axis and can be designed to deliver a high flow rate, but tend to work against low pressure. Blowers tend to deliver air in a direction that is perpendicular to the blower axis at a relatively low flow rate, but against high pressure. There are several types of fans, some of the most common being propeller, tube axial and vane axial styles. Propeller fans are the simplest type of fan, consisting of only a motor and propeller. One problem with propeller fans is that tip vortices are produced by the pressure differential across the airfoil section. A tube axial fan (the most common type in electronic cooling systems) is similar to a propeller fan, but also has a venturi around the propeller to reduce the vortices. The vane axial fan has vanes that trai...|$|E

40|$|Residential gas {{furnaces}} contain blowers {{to distribute}} warm air. Currently, furnace blowers use either a <b>Permanent</b> <b>Split</b> <b>Capacitor</b> (PSC) or a Brushless Permanent Magnet (BPM) motor. Blowers {{account for the}} majority of furnace electricity consumption. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important for understanding electricity consumption of furnaces. The electricity consumption of blower motors depends on the static pressure across the blower. This paper examines both types of blower motors in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured static pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption of a furnace blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen {{at the beginning and end}} of each furnace firing cycle. These operating modes are the pre-purge and post-purge by the draft inducer, the on-delay and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions. The performance gains depend on the static pressure of the household ducts, which are typically much higher than in the test procedures...|$|E
40|$|Currently, total {{electricity}} consumption of furnaces is unregulated, tested at laboratory conditions using the DOE test procedure, and is {{reported in the}} GAMA directory as varying from 76 kWh/year to 1, 953 kWh/year. Furnace blowers account for about 80 {{percent of the total}} furnace {{electricity consumption}} and are primarily used to distribute warm air throughout the home during furnace operation as well as distribute cold air during air conditioning operation. Yet the furnace test procedure does not provide a means to calculate the electricity consumption during cooling operation or standby, which account for a large fraction of the total electricity consumption. Furthermore, blower electricity consumption is strongly affected by static pressure. Field data shows that static pressure in the house distribution ducts varies widely and that the static pressure used in the test procedure as well as the calculated fan power is not representative of actual field installations. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important to address electricity consumption of furnaces and air conditioners. This paper compares the potential regional and national energy savings of two-stage brushless permanent magnet (BPM) blower motors (the blower design option with the most potential savings that is currently available in the market) to single-stage <b>permanent</b> <b>split</b> <b>capacitor</b> (PSC) blower motors (the most common blower design option). Computer models were used to generate the heating and cooling loads for typical homes in 16 different climates which represent houses throughout the United States. The results show that the potential savings of using BPM motors vary by region and house characteristics, and are very strongly tied to improving house distribution ducts. Savings decrease dramatically with increased duct pressure. Cold climate locations will see savings even in the high static pressure duct situations, while warm climate locations will see less savings overall and negative savings in the high static pressure duct situations. Moderate climate locations will see little or no savings...|$|E
40|$|Evaporator {{fan motors}} used in {{commercial}} refrigeration applications are fractional horsepower in size, {{are responsible for}} moving air across the evaporator coil, and typically run at one speed. Historically, shaded-pole motors {{have been the most}} commonly used evaporator fan motors in commercial refrigeration equipment and beverage vending machines. These motors, a type of single-phase AC induction motor, are the simplest and least expensive type of fractional-horsepower motor. They are also the least efficient, with the common 9 â€“ 12 W sizes exhibiting an efficiency of approximately 20 %. Electronically commutated (EC) motors, also known as brushless DC motors, became widely commercialized in the late 1980 s, and their use in commercial refrigeration applications has increased within the last 10 to 15 years because of economic incentives and regulatory requirements. Another motor type, the <b>permanent</b> <b>split</b> <b>capacitor</b> (PSC) motor, offers a mid-point between shaded-pole and EC motor price and efficiency levels. Typically for commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motor applications, EC motors are 66 % efficient and PSC motors are usually about 29 % efficient. Â A new motor technology, a type of permanent magnet synchronous AC motor that can directly use grid-supplied AC current without the need to rectify to DC, has recently been commercialized. This new motor has the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption of evaporator fans in commercial refrigeration equipment. Previously, synchronous motors have been prohibitively expensive for evaporator fan applications because of the high cost of the electronic control circuit that is required to bring the synchronous motor up to synchronous speed. However, this new motor technology makes use of a novel patent-pending controller that is simpler and lower in cost than previous synchronous motor controllers or EC motor controllers, making the new motor a cost-effective alternative in the commercial refrigeration market. Â In this paper, the results of field demonstrations, consisting of side-by-side measurements of the power consumption of the new motor technology versus shaded-pole, PSC, or EC evaporator fan motors in identical refrigerated display cases, are presented. Measured quantities include fan motor power, current, and power factor, as well as display case discharge and return air temperatures and ambient store temperature. Currently, field demonstrations are being conducted at six supermarkets and commissaries located in Kansas City, MO, San Antonio, TX and San Diego, CA, with the duration of these tests ranging from approximately one month to over six months. Initial results from the field demonstrations indicate that the new synchronous AC motor technology is approximately 20 to 30 % more energy efficient than existing EC motors and nearly 80 % more energy efficient than shaded-pole motors. In addition, the new motor exhibits a power factor of approximately 0. 86, which is on average 40 % greater than that of existing evaporator fan motors. Analyses indicate that retrofitting the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motors with the new motors would produce a 68 % evaporator fan site energy savings, or 4. 9 Ã— 109 Â kWh/year for the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motors. This would result in an annual cost savings of $ 516 million and reduce the annual CO 2 equivalent emissions by 8. 1 Ã— 109 Â lb...|$|E
