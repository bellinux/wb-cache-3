Furthermore, we compare their network performances in terms of the acceptance rate and delay by experimental simulations. The simulation result gives us that the nearest node first Dijkstra algorithm can be the optimal solution of multicast connection for IPTV service delivery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In label-switched {{networks}} such as MPLS, pro-tection routing involves computing {{and setting}} up the backup paths {{at the same time}} when the primary paths are routed. It has previously been shown that two or more backup paths may share bandwidth along common links if such backup paths will never be activated simultaneously. Such sharing between the backup paths leads to reduced bandwidth reservations and, hence improved performance in terms of number of <b>path</b> <b>requests</b> that can be accommodated on the network [1], [2]. We present a novel idea that backup paths may also share bandwidth with certain primary paths, thereby further reducing the overall bandwidth reservations on the network. This results in even more <b>path</b> <b>requests</b> being accommodated on the network. Sharing with primary paths is possible with any protection routing framework. To demonstrate this sharing, we use the NPP protection routing framework as an example [1]. We provide the enhancements to the NPP framework needed to exploit sharing with the primary paths. For the enhanced NPP framework, simulation results on various networks confirm that sharing with primary paths indeed results in better network utilization. This increased performance is achieved with bounded local state information and without requiring any additional routing or signaling overhead. I...|$|R
40|$|The induced {{liberalisation}} process {{within the}} European railway system severely affects the railway infrastructure capacity allocation procedure. In the past a single and often governmental owned integrated railway company planned, built and operated a national railway system. The liberalisation process {{led to a}} segregation of the integrated railway companies into railway infrastructure manager and railway undertaking in many European Countries. The open access paradigm for railway infrastructure capacity that grants any licensed railway undertaking access to the railway infrastructure capacity induces competition between different railway undertakings trying to acquire railway infrastructure capacity. Recent figures indicate that more railway undertakings emerge and do request railway infrastructure capacity. Their increasing share of uncoordinated request for railway infrastructure capacity increases {{the complexity of the}} coordination phase of the railway infrastructure capacity allocation process. In this phase the railway infrastructure manager needs to adjust train <b>path</b> <b>requests</b> in a way to resolve conflicting requests for railway infrastructure capacity. This work introduces an algorithmic framework that shall provide efficient measures to support the railway capacity allocation process and to analyse different allocation procedures. In order to make algorithmic approaches applicable in this domain of railway engineering a sophisticated modelling approach for railway infrastructure capacity is extended in order to account for the objectives of the railway undertakings participating on the secondary railway market for railway infrastructure capacity. The objectives for railway capacity allocation are formulated {{from the point of view}} of the railway undertakings submitting train <b>path</b> <b>requests.</b> These objectives account for the negative effects due to adjustments applied to their train <b>path</b> <b>requests</b> during the coordination phase of the railway capacity allocation process. The formalised railway capacity allocation process can be optimised globally, by taking into account standardised objectives with help of algorithmic approaches introduced in this work. However, due to the required confidentiality of information provided by the railway undertakings to the railway infrastructure manager, a global optimisation, taking into account the real objectives of all railway undertakings is not applicable. In order to allow for incorporating the real objectives of the railway undertakings a game theoretical setting is formulated: the railway undertakings are players acting on the secondary railway market for railway infrastructure capacity. Assuming that these players act rationally, such a game theoretical setting always leads to a result, where no player can further improve his situation. Such a solution of the game is a Nash Equilibrium. Comparing the obtained Nash Equilibria of the game theoretical setting to the optimal solution obtained by global optimisation techniques gives an indication of the negative effect of non-cooperative behaviour in such a competitive market for railway capacity allocation. Moreover, it will be shown how the algorithmic framework for railway capacity allocation can be used to determine the degree of congestion of a railway system, based on the submitted train <b>path</b> <b>requests</b> and standardised objectives...|$|R

The challenge of solving this problem is that the networking information used for routing may be imprecise. The Ticket-Based Probing (TBP) routing algorithm provides a heuristic approach to solve the routing problem. In this paper we present a Reversing Ticket-based Probing (RTBP) routing protocol. RTBP has two novel features compared to the original TBP algorithm. The first feature is the use of one type ticket. By using just one type ticket, RTBP generates less ticket at <b>path</b> <b>request</b> phase and it reduces message overhead. The second feature is that if a ticket violates delay constraint, RTBP can reverse previous nodes to search the alternative paths. Through extensive simulations, it is shown that RTBP has fewer messages overhead than existing ticket based probing algorithms.

End {{users and}} ISPs alike have little control over how their packets are handled outside of their networks, {{stemming}} in part from limitations of the current wide-area routing protocol, BGP. We believe {{that many of these}} constraints are due to policy-based restrictions on route exportation. Separating forwarding policy from route discovery would allow users to select among the possibly many inter-AS paths available to them and enable ISPs to more effectively manage the end-to-end behavior of their customers’ traffic. As a concrete mechanism for enforcing forwarding policy,we propose the concept of a network capability that binds together a <b>path</b> <b>request,</b> an accountable resource principal, and an authorizing agent. Network capabilities are central to Platypus, a loose source routing protocol we are designing,which composes network capabilities authorized by multiple ISPs to construct alternative inter-AS routes that can be independently validated and accounted for on the fly...|$|E

By dynamically varying the abstraction we are able to maintain a balance between path quality and search time.

Our experimental results show that DSMA 2 ̆ 7 s performance is a balance between Dense HA* and Sparse HA*. Depending on the resources available DSMA can behave either as Dense HA* or as Sparse HA* or lie somewhere in between.

Unfortunately, the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol defined in the IEEE 802. 11 s standard was designed for WMNs using the single-interface single-channel technic. So, we define a problem that happens when the legacy AODV is used in MIMC WMNs and propose an interface assignment-based AODV (IA-AODV) in order to resolve that problem.

An approach {{to support such}} applications and provide inter-domain guarantees, enabling new avenues for innovation, is using centralized inter-domain routing brokers. These entities centralize routing control for mission-critical traffic across domains, working in parallel to BGP. In this work, we propose using IXPs as natural points for stitching inter-domain paths {{under the control of}} inter-domain routing brokers. To evaluate the potential of this approach, we first map the global substrate of inter-IXP pathlets that IXP members could offer, based on measurements for 229 IXPs worldwide. We show that using IXPs as stitching points has two useful properties. Up to 91 % of the total IPv 4 address space can be served by such inter-domain routing brokers when working in concert with just a handful of large IXPs and their associated ISP members. Second, path diversity on the inter-IXP graph increases by up to 29 times, as compared to current BGP valley-free routing. To exploit the rich path diversity, we introduce algorithms that inter-domain routing brokers can use to embed paths, subject to bandwidth and latency constraints. We show that our algorithms scale to the sizes of the measured graphs and can serve diverse simulated <b>path</b> <b>request</b> mixes.
