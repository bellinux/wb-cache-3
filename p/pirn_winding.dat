40|$|Abstract â€” <b>Pirn</b> <b>winding</b> is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. Firm and coherent winding tension is required to maintain in the <b>pirn</b> <b>winding</b> process to withstand the high forces produced by the deceleration of the shuttle {{at the end of}} each pick and to avoid permanent strains in yarns which will appears as fabric defects in weaving. The package size and its diameter vary due to subsequent winding of pirns. Hence the balloon effect varies and caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. The thread tension variation is considerably significant from the first pirn wound from a package to the last pirn wound from the same if no tension controlling mechanism is devised. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent to combat with this problem. However, this is a stepwise manual compensation technique which needs the correct timing of compensation to avoid significant tension variations in pirn windings. The author attempted to theoretically analyze the tension variation in the yarn path of the <b>pirn</b> <b>winding</b> machine and theoretically model the tension variation with and without deadweight placement on the tensioners. Author also verified the accuracy and the validity of the model developed through the experimental results obtained at different locations along the yarn path. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pirn</b> <b>winding</b> is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. As the package size varies when winding pirns, the varying balloon effect caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. As a number of pirns can be wound from a single supply yarn package, pirns are wound from different yarn package diameters. A significant change in take off tension takes place from pirn to pirn. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent. However, incorrect timing of compensation and stepwise compensation may create significant tension variations in pirn windings. The authors attempted to design a tension control device by applying an automatically continuously varying electromagnetic force on the dead weight, so that the variation of take off tension due to change of package diameter is compensated and investigate influence of varying supply yarn package diameter on the fmal winding tens ion of pirn...|$|E
40|$|An Orbital Winch {{mechanism}} enables high-load, multi-line tethers to {{be deployed}} and retracted without rotating the spool on which the tether is wound. To minimize damage to the tether and the wound package during retraction or deployment under load, it can incorporate a Tension Management Module that reduces the infeed tension {{by a factor of}} 15 {{through the use of a}} powered capstan with guide rollers. This design eliminates the need for rotating high-voltage electrical connections in tether systems that use propellantless electro-dynamic propulsion. It can also eliminate the need for rotating optical connections in applications where the tether contains optical fibers. This winch design was developed to deploy a 15 -km-long, 15 -kg high-strength Hoytether structure incorporating conductive wires as part of the MXER- 1 demonstration mission concept. Two slewing rings that orbit around the tether spool, combined with translation of one of the slewing rings back and forth along the spool axis to traverse the wind point, enables the winch to wind the tether. Variations of the traverse motion of the slewing ring can accomplish level <b>winds</b> and conical <b>pirn</b> <b>winds.</b> By removing the non-traversing slewing ring, and adding an actuated guide arm, the winch can manage rapid, low-drag deployment of a tether off the end of a pirn-wound spool, followed by controlled retraction and rewinding, in a manner very similar to a spin-casting reel. The winch requires at least two motor driver controller units to coordinate the action of two stepper motors to accomplish tether deployment or retraction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} {{observed}} {{over the years that}} yarn tension during high speed over-end unwinding from a helically wound stationary package is highly non linear (1). Each yarn element during unwinding performs a complex motion that involves a movement along the yarn axis and rotation about the package axis. Parameters that affect the yarn tension are linear yarn density, unwinding speed, package diameter, balloon profile, and specific yarn winding density of the cone or cheese. This paper analyses mathematically the influence of the above stated parameters at the guide eyelet on yarn unwinding tension. On the basis of the model it proposes a cost effective mechanical device for tension variation control where a movable guide eyelet is used. The proposed device helps to minimize tension variation during unwinding and to obtain more or less constant tension, which definitely improves the quality of the package prepared from cones or cheeses (for example a warp beam). The concept behind the proposed system is to move the guide eyelet with respect to reducing cone or cheese diameter according to the proposed mathematical model. This will invariably affect the uniform unwinding tension, which also improves the quality of subsequent processes such as warping, sizing, <b>pirn</b> <b>winding</b> and processes associated with package dyeing...|$|E
