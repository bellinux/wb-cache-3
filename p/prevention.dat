5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary <b>prevention</b> entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for <b>prevention</b> of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{systematic}} literature review over 12 peer reviewed articles regarding the topiccyberbullying. The {{purpose of this study}} is to summarise and critically discuss different interventions and <b>preventions</b> used to tackle cyberbullying in school environments. Interventions and <b>preventions</b> will be analysed from a relational perspective. The articles are sorted and discussed in four relevant categories. These are: Netiquette, building relationships, Learning through role models, antibullying programs. The study found that the foundation of most successful interventions against cyberbullying is healthy relationships between students and school staff. The result showed that based on meaningful relationships, successful interventions and <b>preventions</b> can be formed and used in school. It is important to acknowledge that not a single intervention can solve a complex problem like cyberbullying, but instead there is a need for a combination of different interventions and more knowledge about the phenomena cyberbullying...|$|R

40|$|The result {{shows that}} {{television}} {{is the most}} accessible mass media and owned {{by the majority of}} the respondents. Even though the respondents very intensive in accessing the television, they only incidentally viewed the news of swine influenza risk and thus they are very speculative in nature in viewing the news of swine influenza risk. Thus, cognition aspect of respondent about the swine influenza risk news release is very low because they only acknowledge the news but they do not understand the importance of the news for them. While, their affective aspect shows that they feel more anxious about swine flu risk because there is no socialization of swine flu risk <b>preventions.</b> The last but not least aspect is the behavior aspect. Here, the respondents generally act to ask to close the pig livestock to the owners or even to the state apparatuses if there is a swine flu infected case in their area. This research suggested that the Banyumas local government through the health, animal husbandry, and fishery agencies should more proactive on the swine flu risk <b>preventions</b> policy implementation, for example, socializing, periodically and sustainably, swine flu risk <b>preventions</b> specially in the area surrounding the pigs livestock...|$|R
