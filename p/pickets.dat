5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{campaign}} successfully desegregated downtown lunch counters, sit-ins, <b>pickets,</b> and protests against other segregated facilities continued in Nashville until {{passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended overt, legally sanctioned segregation nationwide. Many of {{the organizers of the}} Nashville sit-ins went on to become important leaders in the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5|$|At about 23:00 on August 26, {{the first}} {{shots were fired}} in the Battle of Long Island, near the Red Lion Inn (near present-day 39th Street and 4th Avenue). American <b>pickets</b> from Samuel John Atlee's Pennsylvania {{regiment}} fired upon two British soldiers who were foraging in a watermelon patch near the inn.|$|E

During May, she served {{as one of the}} rescue <b>pickets</b> {{stationed}} along the route across the Atlantic flown by three Navy NC-type seaplanes in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. After that, the destroyer returned to normal operations along the east coast and annual winter maneuvers in Cuban waters until placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia on 10 December 1919.|$|E
50|$|Informational <b>picketing</b> is {{the legal}} name given {{to the type of}} <b>picketing</b> {{described}} above. Informational <b>picketing,</b> as described by Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law, entails <b>picketing</b> by a group, typically a labour or trade union, which inform the public about a matter of concern important to the union. It is a popular <b>picketing</b> technique for nurses to use outside of healthcare facilities. For example, on April 5, 2006 nurses of the UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMHC) participated in two separate informational <b>picketing</b> events to protect the quality of their nursing program. Informational <b>picketing</b> was used to gain public support and promote further bargaining with management.|$|R

5|$|On May 27, 1862, Colonel Crook's 3rd Brigade routed rebel {{infantry}} in {{a conflict}} where the shooting lasted for only 27 minutes. Rebel casualties were 72 men killed, over 100 wounded, and 157 men taken prisoner. They also lost four cannon, 300 small weapons, and 25 horses. Crook's brigade lost 13 killed, 50 wounded (including Crook, who {{was shot in the}} foot), and 6 missing. The feat was accomplished by taking advantage of aggressive rebel soldiers and a hostile town. Crook had learned that a large rebel infantry under the command of General Henry Heth was moving toward Lewisburg. Crook positioned his brigade {{at the far end of}} the town, and sent a small group of <b>pickets</b> to the opposite end where the rebels would approach. Heth's rebels raced into town after the <b>pickets,</b> urged on by the pro-rebel local population. The rebels were quickly ambushed in a short action that ended after a charge by Union infantry and cavalry. The 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry battalion had been held out of the fighting, but was used to chase the fleeing rebels. The rebels escaped by burning the Greenbrier Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The novella {{was first}} {{published}} in the United Kingdom in May 1981 as a paperback original by Faber and Faber, and in the United States in hardcover in April 1982 by Simon & Schuster. Adapted for the theatre by British playwright Christopher Hampton, it was staged in London in 1982 and in Hartford, Connecticut a year later. The productions generated further controversy, resulting in public <b>pickets</b> and condemnation being levelled against Steiner.|$|E

50|$|A mass <b>picket</b> is {{an attempt}} to bring as many people as {{possible}} to a <b>picket</b> line to demonstrate support for the cause. It is primarily used when only one workplace is being <b>picketed</b> or for a symbolically or practically important workplace. Due to the numbers involved, a mass <b>picket</b> may turn into a potentially unlawful blockade.|$|R
5000|$|A third {{important}} difference {{is under the}} FLRA it is an unfair labor practice for labor unions to call or participate in <b>picketing</b> that interferes with the operation of a federal agency, employee <b>picketing</b> under the Statute may consist of [...] "informational" [...] <b>picketing</b> only. Under the NLRA, appropriate <b>picketing</b> is a right guaranteed to private sector employees. <b>Picketing</b> allowed by the Statute must not disrupt {{the operations of the}} agency. It also may not occur while the employees are on duty.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the end of}} the sit-in {{campaign}} {{brought a}} brief respite for civil rights activists in Nashville, institutionalized racism remained a problem throughout the city. Over the next few years, further sit-ins, <b>pickets,</b> and other actions would take place at restaurants, movie theaters, public swimming pools, and other segregated facilities across Nashville. These actions continued until Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited segregation in public places throughout the United States. In that year, many of the key figures of the sit-ins, including James Lawson and Kelly Miller Smith, were interviewed by Robert Penn Warren for his book Who Speaks for the Negro?, in which they reflected on their experiences.|$|E
5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time {{but it was not}} going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there {{did not seem to be}} any American <b>pickets</b> and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that the leagues were engaged in class struggle against a coalition of landowners and mafiosi and ignore evidence of strategic alliances between the Fasci and the Mafia. The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi. The Mafia bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro. The Mafia was sometimes needed to enforce flying <b>pickets</b> with credible threats of violence {{and to make the}} strike costly to landowners by destroying their property.|$|E
2500|$|Farmer {{disagreed}} on both counts. In Washington Coca-Cola Bottling Co., {{the board}} held that [...] "secondary situs" [...] <b>picketing</b> could not occur if the primary employer had sites nearby. <b>Picketing</b> should occur at these nearby sites instead. In the same decision, the board strictly limited [...] "secondary situs" [...] <b>picketing</b> to consumer entrances. (Even then, the board barred secondary <b>picketing</b> if those entrances {{were also used}} by the secondary employer's employees.) The board also strictly limited the language the union could use on its <b>picket</b> signs. Finally, if the primary and secondary employer shared the same site, the NLRB held, <b>picketing</b> had {{to be even more}} limited.|$|R
50|$|<b>Picketing</b> {{in labor}} {{negotiations}} {{is an example}} of negative leverage. The goal of <b>picketing</b> is to attract negative attention to the employer, but the employees do not gain any material benefits from the act of <b>picketing</b> itself.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{recognized}} <b>picketing</b> {{as freedom}} of expression, consistent with section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Since the Court found <b>picketing</b> to be ingrained in the Charter, they declined to limit <b>picketing</b> based on location. The Court {{felt that the}} limited financial and human resources of labour unions would prevent the unchecked spread of <b>picketing</b> beyond the primary parties, with limited resources they felt it was unlikely the union would <b>picket</b> a location which has no possible impact on their labour dispute.|$|R
5|$|The Maratha {{redeployment}} was swifter {{and more}} efficient than Wellesley had anticipated and he immediately reacted by extending his front to deny Pohlmann the opportunity to outflank him. A battalion of <b>pickets</b> and the 74th Highlanders, which formed {{the right of the}} first and second lines, were ordered to move obliquely to the right. This allowed the 78th to anchor the left flank and Madras infantry battalions (the 1/10th, 1/8th, 1/4th and 2/12th) to form the centre of the British line. Wellesley's intention was to force back the Marathas from their guns and then– operating by his left to avoid the heavily defended Assaye– throw them back on the Juah and complete their destruction with his cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The Second Brigade, {{commanded}} by Colonel William H. Powell, {{consisted of three}} West Virginia cavalry regiments plus the 1st New York (Lincoln) Cavalry (attached). The Lincoln Cavalry detachment, {{commanded by}} Captain Abram Jones, rode {{on the west side}} of Gibson's Brigade, while Powell and the West Virginians rode on the east side. Powell had the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry in the lead, followed by the 1st West Virginia Cavalry. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was held in reserve, and also guarded the <b>pickets</b> that had been captured earlier in the pre-sunrise morning. Powell rode with the 1st West Virginia. Further east, Major Work's 22nd Pennsylvania Cavalry battalion was in place on the Wardensville Road and moving west toward Moorefield.|$|E
5|$|Almost 50,000 Hungarians live in Cluj-Napoca. The city {{is home to}} {{the second-largest}} urban Hungarian {{community}} in Romania, after Târgu Mureș, with an active cultural and academic life: the city features a Hungarian state theatre and opera, as well as Hungarian research institutions, like Erdélyi Múzeumi Egyesület (EME), Erdélyi Magyar Műszaki Tudományos Társaság and Bolyai Társaság. With respect to religious affairs, the city houses central offices for the Reformed Diocese of Transylvania, the Unitarian Diocese and an Evangelical Lutheran Church Diocese (all of which train their clergy at the Protestant Theological Institute of Cluj). Several newspapers and magazines are published in the Hungarian language, yet the community also receives public and private television and radio broadcasts (see Media). , 7,000 students attended courses in the 55 Hungarian-language specialisations at the Babeș-Bolyai University. Gheorghe Funar, mayor of Cluj-Napoca from 1992 to 2004, was notorious for acts of ethnic provocation, bedecking the city's streets in the colours of the Romanian flag and arranging <b>pickets</b> outside the city's Hungarian consulate; however, tensions have subsided since.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picketing</b> is {{also used}} by {{pressure}} groups across the political spectrum. In particular, <b>picketing</b> has been employed by religious {{groups such as the}} Westboro Baptist Church that <b>picket</b> a variety of stores or events they consider to be sinful.|$|R

5|$|Andrea Dworkin is {{most often}} remembered {{for her role as}} a speaker, writer, and activist in the feminist anti-pornography movement. In February 1976, Dworkin took a leading role in {{organizing}} public <b>pickets</b> of Snuff in New York City and, during the fall, joined Adrienne Rich, Grace Paley, Gloria Steinem, Shere Hite, Lois Gould, Barbara Deming, Karla Jay, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Robin Morgan, and Susan Brownmiller in attempts to form a radical feminist antipornography group. Members of this group would go on to found Women Against Pornography in 1979, but by then Dworkin had begun to distance herself from the group over differences in approach. Dworkin spoke at the first Take Back the Night march in November 1978, and joined 3,000 women in a march through the red-light district of San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|Biko and SASO were openly {{critical}} of NUSAS' protests against government policies. Biko argued that NUSAS merely sought {{to influence the}} white electorate; in his opinion, this electorate was not legitimate, and protests targeting a particular policy would be ineffective for the ultimate aim of dismantling the apartheid state. SASO regarded student marches, <b>pickets,</b> and strikes to be ineffective and stated it would withdraw from public forms of protest. It deliberately avoided open confrontation with the state until such a point when it had a sufficiently large institutional structure. Instead, SASO's focus was on establishing community projects and spreading Black Consciousness ideas among other black organisations and the wider black community. Despite this policy, in May 1972 it issued the Alice Declaration, in which it called for students to boycott lectures {{in response to the}} expulsion of SASO member Abram Onkgopotse Tiro from the University of the North after he made a speech criticising its administration. The Tiro incident convinced the government that SASO was a threat.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron <b>pickets</b> anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E

2500|$|Under Paul Herzog, the NLRB {{made two}} {{decisions}} involving secondary <b>picketing.</b> The first, Schulz Refrigeration Service, addressed an issue which had arisen in the transportation industry. Delivery trucks were {{an extension of}} the primary employer's business. But was <b>picketing</b> the truck while it visited a secondary employer (the secondary site, or [...] "secondary situs" [...] in the Latin phrase) a violation of Section 8(b)(4)? The Herzog Board said no. The second decision, Crowley's Milk Co., addressed the purpose of [...] "secondary situs" [...] <b>picketing.</b> Section 8(b)(4) of the Taft-Hartley Act (enacted the year before Crowley's Milk was decided) forbade secondary boycotts.

5|$|Homophile organizations—as {{homosexual}} {{groups were}} called—grew {{in number and}} spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, Kameny, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, organized a picket of the White House and other government buildings to protest employment discrimination. The <b>pickets</b> shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.|$|E
5|$|On Shepard's second cruise with Cogswell, he was {{appointed}} a gunnery officer, responsible for the 20mm and 40mm antiaircraft guns on the ship's bow. They engaged kamikazes in the Battle of Okinawa, where the ship served in the dangerous role of a radar picket. The job of the radar <b>pickets</b> was to warn the fleet of incoming kamikazes; but because they were often the first ships sighted by incoming Japanese aircraft, they were also the most likely ships to be attacked. Cogswell performed this duty from May 27, 1945, until June 26, when it rejoined Task Force 38. The ship also participated in the Allied naval bombardments of Japan, and was present in Tokyo Bay for the Surrender of Japan in September 1945. Shepard returned to the United States later that month.|$|E
5|$|The {{ferocity of}} the fight {{convinced}} Black Hawk that Apple River Fort was impossible to defeat. He considered burning the fort, but feared the rising smoke would alert other militia in the area. His war-party slackened their fire as their fellow braves raided cabins near the fort. Taken were meat, flour, clothing, cooking utensils. Left behind was a paucity of real vandalism. Braves then raided the livestock: horses were run off and pigs and cattle were shot down and the choicest cut of meat taken. In the gathering darkness, Black Hawk quietly withdrew his war party and retreated back to the gap in Terrapin Ridge and gained the Galena Road. Casualties were few, given {{the intensity of the}} battle. Courier George Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died; it has been documented that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall's <b>pickets.</b> Besides Welch, the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting, who suffered a non-lethal wound to the side of his head. The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E
40|$|<b>Picketing,</b> {{a method}} used by employees, collectively, {{to assert their}} demands against employers, is a {{controversial}} subject arising from the conflict of interest existing between labour and employers! Previously, South African law neither forbade nor regulated <b>picketing.</b> Consequently, no immunity from civil liability existed {{in relation to a}} person's conduct during a <b>picket.</b> Presently, <b>picketing</b> is regulated by section 17 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 19 % (right to <b>picket)</b> and section 69 of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, which provides for a protected <b>picket</b> (one that complies with the requirements of section 69) whereby immunity from civil liability attaches to a person's conduct during a <b>picket.</b> These provisions and their coexistence is examined, comparing foreign law where relevant, in an attempt to provide a foundation for a topic relatively disregarded.
