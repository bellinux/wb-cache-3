25|$|Scarring (US: Scoring) {{can occur}} if brake pads are not changed {{promptly}} {{when they reach}} the end of their service life and are considered worn out. Once enough of the friction material has worn away, the pad's steel backing plate (for glued pads) or the <b>pad</b> <b>retainer</b> rivets (for riveted pads) will bear directly upon the disc's wear surface, reducing braking power and making scratches on the disc. Generally a moderately scarred / scored disc, which operated satisfactorily with existing brake pads, will be equally usable with new pads. If the scarring is deeper but not excessive, it can be repaired by machining off a layer of the disc's surface. This can only be done a limited number of times as the disc has a minimum rated safe thickness. The minimum thickness value is typically cast into the disc during manufacturing on the hub or the edge of the disc. In Pennsylvania, which {{has one of the most}} rigorous auto safety inspection programs in North America, an automotive disc cannot pass safety inspection if any scoring is deeper than , and must be replaced if machining will reduce the disc below its minimum safe thickness.|$|E
40|$|A twin {{caliper brake}} system is {{investigated}} using {{the whole body}} visual technique of holographic interferometry. It is shown that the disc mode of vibration has a preferred position where a disc antinode is situated under one caliper and a disc node under the second caliper. The maximum angular space occupied by the pad antinode is, as predicted by the theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry, the angle subtended by the pad length. For a four- piston opposed caliper the minimum distance is slightly larger than the piston centers. There {{is evidence that the}} disc mode position, in relation to the two calipers, may be antinode/node, node/node or antinode/antinode. With these arrangements an accompanying revised theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry predicts two stable conditions are possible - if the calipers are positioned either at an angle between 125 to 130 or 165 to 175. The smaller angle was not tested but the brake became quiet at angles greater than 166. A brief study of the caliper modes and <b>pad</b> spring <b>retainer</b> is included in the holographic results...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of evaluating the influence of different methods for end surface preparation of compressive strength test specimens. Four different methods were compared: a mechanical wear method through grinding using a diamond wheel established by NBR 5738; a mechanical wear method using a diamond saw which is established by NM 77; an unbonded system using neoprene <b>pads</b> in metal <b>retainer</b> rings established by C 1231 and a bonded capping method with sulfur mortar established by NBR 5738 and by NM 77. To develop this research, 4 concrete mixes were determined with different strength levels, 2 of group 1 and 2 of group 2 strength levels established by NBR 8953. Group 1 consists of classes C 20 to C 50, 5 in 5 MPa, also known as normal strength concrete. Group 2 is comprised of class C 55, C 60 to C 100, 10 in 10 MPa, also known as high strength concrete. Compression tests were carried out at 7 and 28 days for the 4 surface preparation methods. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the method established by NBR 5738 is the most effective among the 4 strengths considered, once it presents lower dispersion of values obtained from the tests, measured by the coefficient of variation and, in almost all cases, it demonstrates the highest mean of rupture test. The method described by NBR 5738 achieved the expected strength level in all tests...|$|R
