5|$|In the 1970s {{four of the}} Universal-produced films {{fell into}} the public domain when their {{copyright}} was not renewed. These four films were restored and colourised. Some of the films in the series had become degraded over time, {{with some of the}} original negatives lost and others suffering from nitrate deterioration because of the unstable cellulose nitrate film. The UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the series, putting the films onto modern <b>polyester</b> <b>film,</b> in a process that was jointly paid for by UCLA, Warner Bros. and Hugh Hefner.|$|E
25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of PET film capacitors {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors is relatively high compared to other film capacitors, ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors compared with the other film capacitors is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors compared with the other film capacitor types.|$|E

25|$|Film {{capacitors}} {{have become}} much smaller {{since the beginning}} of the technology. Through development of thinner plastic films, for example, the dimensions of metallized <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors were decreased by a factor of approximately 3 to 4.|$|E
25|$|The plastic films {{used as the}} {{dielectric}} for film capacitors are Polypropylene (PP), Polyester (PET), Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), and Polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon (PTFE). Polypropylene film material with a market share of something about 50% and <b>Polyester</b> <b>film</b> with something about 40% are the most used film materials. The rest of something about 10% will be used by all other materials including PPS and paper with roughly 3%, each.|$|E
25|$|For simple higher-frequency filter circuits, or in voltage {{regulator}} or voltage doubler circuits, low-cost metallized <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors provide long-term stability, and can replace more-expensive tantalum capacitors. Because capacitors pass AC signals but block DC, film capacitors with their high insulation resistance and low self-inductance are well-suited as signal coupling capacitors for higher frequencies. For similar reasons, film capacitors {{are widely used}} as decoupling capacitors to suppress noise or transients.|$|E

25|$|PET was {{patented}} in 1941 by John Rex Whinfield, James Tennant Dickson {{and their}} employer the Calico Printers' Association of Manchester, England. E. I. DuPont de Nemours in Delaware, USA, first used the trademark Mylar in June 1951 and received registration {{of it in}} 1952. It is still the best-known name used for <b>polyester</b> <b>film.</b> The current owner of the trademark is DuPont Teijin Films US, a partnership with a Japanese company.|$|E
25|$|Filament tape or {{strapping}} tape is a {{pressure-sensitive tape}} used for several packaging {{functions such as}} closing corrugated fiberboard boxes, reinforcing packages, bundling items, pallet utilizing, etc. It consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material which is usually a polypropylene or <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> and fiberglass filaments embedded to add high tensile strength. Filament tape was invented in 1946 by Cyrus Woodrow Bemmels. In 1949, it {{was placed on the}} market and was an immediate success.|$|E
25|$|The {{double-sided}} metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} electrodes {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene film capacitor with double-sided metallization on a <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner polyester foil improves the volumetric efficiency of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} ballasts usually {{change the}} frequency of the power from a standard mains frequency of 50 or 60 Hz up to 40 kHz or higher, often using a Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) circuit topology with Power Factor Correction (PFC). First the AC input power is rectified to DC, and then it is chopped at a high frequency to improve the power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a film capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In the picture at right, the flat grey rectangular component {{in the middle of the}} ballast circuit is a <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitor used for PFC.|$|E
25|$|The voltage at the {{terminals}} {{generated by}} the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit. For sensitive analog circuits such as sample and hold circuits, integrators, charge amplifiers or high-quality audio circuits, Class-1 ceramic or polypropylene capacitors instead of Class-2 ceramic capacitors, <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors or electrolytic capacitors are used. For most electronic circuits, particularly filtering applications, the small dielectric absorption voltage has no influence on the proper electrical function of the circuit. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte which are not built into a circuit, the dielectric absorption voltage generated can be a personnel safety risk. The voltage can be quite substantial, for example 50V for 400V electrolytic capacitors, and can cause damages to semiconductor devices, or cause sparks during installation in the circuit. Larger aluminum electrolytic capacitors and high-voltage power capacitors are transported and delivered short-circuited to dissipate this unwanted and possibly dangerous energy.|$|E
500|$|The {{restoration}} involved {{transferring the}} films onto modern <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> and restoring the images frame-by-frame. The process was {{complicated by the}} poor quality {{of some of the}} films. Robert Gitt, the UCLA Preservation Officer, commented that [...] "the copies of the films that survive are many generations removed from the original and flaws have been photographed and re-photographed into these copies". The Scarlet Claw and Pursuit to Algiers were both in very poor condition and Dressed to Kill was missing some 35mm reels. This being the case, the restorers had to blow up some 16mm prints to replace the scenes.|$|E

2500|$|Film {{capacitors}} {{made with}} lower-cost plastics {{are used for}} non-critical applications which do not require ultra-stable characteristics over a wide temperature range, such as for smoothing or AC signal coupling. [...] <b>Polyester</b> <b>film</b> (KT) capacitors of the [...] "stacked" [...] type are often used now instead of polystyrene capacitors (KS), which have become less available.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Polyester</b> <b>film</b> {{capacitors}} are film capacitors using a dielectric {{made of the}} thermoplastic polar polymer material {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PET), trade names Hostaphan or Mylar®, from the polyester family. [...] They are manufactured both as metallized wound and stacked versions, as well as film/foil types. The <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> adsorbs very little moisture, and this feature makes it suitable for [...] "naked" [...] designs without any further coating needed. They are the low-cost mass-produced capacitors in modern electronics, featuring relatively small dimensions with relatively high capacitance values. [...] PET capacitors are mainly used as general purpose capacitors for DC applications, or for semi-critical circuits with operating temperatures up to 125 nbsp&°C. The maximum temperature rating of 125nbsp&°C also allows SMD film capacitors to be made with PET films. The low cost of polyester and the relatively compact dimensions are {{the main reasons for}} the high prevalence of PET film capacitors in modern designs.|$|E
2500|$|Polypropylene film {{capacitors}} have a dielectric {{made of the}} thermoplastic, non-polar, {{organic and}} partially crystalline polymer material Polypropylene (PP), trade name Treofan, from the family of polyolefins. They are manufactured both as metallized wound and stacked versions, as well as film/foil types. Polypropylene film is the most-used dielectric film in industrial capacitors and also in power capacitor types. The polypropylene film material absorbs less moisture than <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> and is therefore also suitable for [...] "naked" [...] designs without any coating or further packaging. But the maximum temperature of 105nbsp&°C hinders use of PP films in SMD packaging.|$|E
50|$|FilmTack {{also became}} one of the world's largest {{sputtered}} films distributor in mid-2000s. Titanium, Nichrome and Silver sputtered films were the three popular metals added to <b>polyester</b> <b>films</b> to achieve solar protection properties for glazing. Sputtered semi-products were shipped via air to minimize oxidation risk and U.S.-made Nichrome-Silver-Nichrome(NSN) was the most popular formulation based on regional sales volume.|$|R
40|$|In a {{great many}} cases the well-adhering coating of plastic films {{requires}} a purposive pretreatment. For the in-line treatment prior to physical vapor deposition processes, plasma and ion beam techniques will be the method of choice. The success of the pretreatment does not only depend on the polymer type concerned but, in a highly sensitive manner, also on the intensity and type of processing. Exemplified by <b>polyester</b> <b>films,</b> acrylate-coated <b>polyester</b> <b>films</b> and films made of oriented polypropylene the effects a plasma or ion-beam pretreatment exerts on the adhesion strength of sputtered and evaporated copper layers are discussed. In {{order to make the}} results transferable, Langmuir probe and retarding field analyzer measurements were conducted to assess the ion-current dose of the plasma and the ion-beam treatment, respectively. Since the layer adhesion often reaches a maximum at extremely low doses of pretreatment, the application of available plasma and ion sources allows one to implement web speeds in a range of some meters per second...|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} table, the estimated world polyester production is shown. Main applications are textile polyester, bottle <b>polyester</b> resin, <b>film</b> <b>polyester</b> mainly for packaging and specialty polyesters for engineering plastics.

2500|$|Polystyrene film capacitors, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "Styroflex Capacitors", were {{well known for}} many years as inexpensive film capacitors for general purpose applications, in which high capacitance stability, low dissipation factor and low leakage currents were needed. But because the film thickness could be not made thinner than 10nbsp&µm, and the maximum temperature ratings reached only 85nbsp&°C, the PS film capacitors have mostly been replaced by <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors as of 2012. However, some manufacturers may still offer PS film capacitors in their production program, backed by large amounts of polystyrene film stocked in their warehouse.|$|E
2500|$|An early special type {{of plastic}} film {{capacitors}} were the cellulose acetate film capacitors, also called MKU capacitors. The polar insulating dielectric cellulose acetate was a synthetic resin {{that could be}} made for metallized capacitors in paint film thickness down to about 3µm. [...] A liquid layer of cellulose acetate was first applied to a paper carrier, then covered with wax, dried and then metallized. During winding of the capacitor body, the paper was removed from the metallized film. The remaining thin cellulose acetate layer had a dielectric breakdown of 63V, enough for many of general purpose applications. The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other film capacitors of the time. MKU film capacitors are no longer manufactured, because <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors can now be produced in the smaller sizes that were the market niche of the MKU type.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rated voltage}} of {{different}} film materials depends on {{factors such as}} the thickness of the film, the quality of the material (freedom from physical defects and chemical impurities), the ambient temperature, and frequency of operation, plus a safety margin against the breakdown voltage (dielectric strength). But to a first approximation, the voltage rating of a film capacitor depends primarily on the thickness of the plastic film. For example, with the minimum available film thickness of <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors (about 0.7µm), it is possible to produce capacitors with a rated voltage of 400VDC. If higher voltages are needed, typically a thicker plastic film will be used. [...] But the breakdown voltage for dielectric films is usually nonlinear. For thicknesses greater than about 5 mils, the breakdown voltage only increases approximately with the square-root of the film thickness. On the other hand, the capacitance decreases linearly with increased film thickness. [...] For reasons of availability, storage and existing processing capabilities, it is desirable to achieve higher breakdown voltages while using existing available film materials. This can be achieved by a one-sided partial metallization of the insulating films in such a manner that an internal series connection of capacitors is produced. By using this series connection technique, the total breakdown voltage of the capacitor can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor, but the total capacitance is also reduced by the same factor.|$|E

40|$|Free-standing <b>polyesters</b> <b>films</b> from mono and polyhydroxylated {{fatty acids}} (C 16 and C 18) have been {{obtained}} by non-catalyzed melt-condensation polymerization in air at 150 °C. Chemical characterization by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and 13 C Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13 C MAS-NMR) has confirmed {{the formation of the}} corresponding esters and the occurrence of hydroxyl partial oxidation which extent depends on the type of hydroxylation of the monomer (primary or secondary). Generally, <b>polyester</b> <b>films</b> obtained are hydrophobic, insoluble in common solvents, amorphous and infusible as revealed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). In -polyhydroxy acids, esterification reaction with primary hydroxyls is preferential and, therefore, the structure can be defined as linear with variable branching depending on the amount of esterified secondary hydroxyls. The occurrence side oxidative reactions like the diol cleavage are responsible for chain cross-linking. Films are thermally stable up to 200 - 250 °C though this limit can be extended up to 300 °C in the absence of ester bonds involving secondary hydroxyls. By analogy with natural occurring fatty polyesters (i. e. cutin in higher plants) these polymers are proposed as biodegradable and non-toxic barrier films or coatings to be used, for instance, in food packin...|$|R
