5|$|Even where metal {{objects such}} as bowls and dishes {{do not seem to}} have {{geometric}} decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do not repeat) and open or repetitive <b>patterns</b> are used. <b>Patterns</b> such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12thcentury. Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate <b>patterns</b> interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic <b>patterns,</b> such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.|$|E

But, this method for the <b>pattern</b> recognition possesses the next two weak points. (1) The typical <b>pattern</b> and the unknown <b>pattern</b> must be fitted {{at the center of the}} gravity with each <b>pattern</b> and then the cross correlation of the typical <b>pattern</b> and the unknown <b>pattern</b> must be taken.

5|$|Scales play an {{important}} part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable the development of vivid or indistinct <b>patterns</b> which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark <b>patterns</b> on wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour <b>patterns</b> in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour <b>patterns</b> help edible lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in Müllerian mimicry, inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} evaluating the structural conformance of a UML class diagram to a design <b>pattern.</b> A design <b>pattern</b> is specified in {{an extension of the}} UML that defines the <b>pattern</b> as a family of models. A <b>pattern</b> specification consists of a set of <b>pattern</b> roles where a role specifies the properties of a <b>pattern</b> participant. The approach uses a divide-and-conquer method to evaluate <b>pattern</b> conformance. In the approach a <b>pattern</b> and the model being evaluated are decomposed into blocks. Then, the model blocks are evaluated for conformance to the role blocks in the <b>pattern.</b> When all individual role blocks are satisfied by the model blocks, the <b>pattern</b> as a whole is considered to evaluate the entire conformance of the model. A major benefit of this approach is the support for variations of <b>pattern</b> realizations through the notion of <b>pattern</b> roles. We illustrate the approach using the Visitor <b>pattern</b> and a price calculator, and demonstrate a prototype tool that supports the approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an approach for developing transformations from business process models to implementations that facilitates reuse. A transformation is {{developed as a}} composition of three smaller tasks: <b>pattern</b> recognition, <b>pattern</b> realization and activity transformation. The approach allows one to reuse the definition and implementation of <b>pattern</b> recognition and <b>pattern</b> realization {{in the development of}} transformations targeting different business process modeling and implementation languages. In order to decouple <b>pattern</b> recognition and <b>pattern</b> realization, the approach includes a <b>pattern</b> language to represent the output of the <b>pattern</b> recognition task, which forms the input of the <b>pattern</b> realization task. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the late stage is marked {{by the use of}} simple 16-point <b>patterns</b> at the Hasan Sadaqah mausoleum in Cairo in 1321, and in the Alhambra in Spain in 1338–1390. These <b>patterns</b> are rarely found outside these two regions. More elaborate combined 16-point geometrical <b>patterns</b> are found in the Sultan Hasan complex in Cairo in 1363, but rarely elsewhere. Finally, 14-point <b>patterns</b> appear in the Jama Masjid at Fatehpur Sikri in India in 1571–1596, but in few other places.|$|E
5|$|The {{scale of}} {{camouflage}} <b>patterns</b> {{is related to}} their function. Large structures need larger <b>patterns</b> than individual soldiers to disrupt their shape. At the same time, large <b>patterns</b> are more effective from afar, while small scale <b>patterns</b> work better up close. Traditional single scale <b>patterns</b> work well in their optimal range from the observer, but an observer at other distances will not see the pattern optimally. Nature itself is very often fractal, where plants and rock formations exhibit similar <b>patterns</b> across several magnitudes of scale. The idea behind multi-scale <b>patterns</b> is both to mimic the self-similarity of nature, and also to offer scale invariant or so-called fractal camouflage that works at close range {{as well as at}} traditional combat range.|$|E
