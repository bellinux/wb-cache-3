In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to {{the morning of the}} funeral service. Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects. At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an {{estimated}} 42,000 people waiting.|$|E
5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry {{to do something about}} it, but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E

25|$|There is {{verbal and}} nonverbal {{guidance}} from parents to children with chores and other activities. For example, a <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way. This example relates to the LOPI model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) {{in order to support}} their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.|$|E

Gordon Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice. The Labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty, {{and is one of}} the leading EU countries in combating child poverty. David Cameron's promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of the Conservative government I experienced as a lone parent. It sends the message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but married couple is more deserving of a financial <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head than those struggling, as I once was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times.|$|E

During the trial, Bloch claimed Greenglass wanted revenge for the machine shop business failure. Bloch attempted to discredit Greenglass' character and testimony. At Greenglass' sentencing hearing, his attorney O.

[...] Armstrong shut the engine off and said, [...] "shutdown." [...] As the LM settled onto the surface, Aldrin said, [...] "Okay. Engine stop", then they both called out some post-landing checklist items. After a ten-second pause, Duke acknowledged the landing with, [...] "We copy you down, Eagle." [...] Armstrong announced the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, [...] "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." [...] Aldrin and Armstrong celebrated with a brisk handshake and <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back before quickly returning to the checklist of tasks needed to ready the lunar module for liftoff from the Moon should an emergency unfold during the first moments on the lunar surface. After Armstrong had confirmed touch-down, Duke re-acknowledged, and expressed the flight controllers' anxiety: [...] "Roger,Twang -- Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue - we're breathing again - thanks a lot!"

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reported that}} [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter" [...] was a [...] "stellar episode that was hitting {{all the right}} beats", and commented that [...] "ven the tired, formulaic structure of Jack's two women scenario was given some great new lines" [...] from Fey and Cannon, who developed the script. He opined that if the episode centered only around Jack's two women dilemma it [...] "would have been just fine." [...] Canning appreciated Elizabeth Banks' and Julianne Moore's appearances, writing that the two [...] "exhibited the charms that have made them welcome additions to this season". In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10 rating. Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad said that the Toofer story was [...] "funny, without being (too) offensive." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin said that he enjoyed [...] "just about every minute" [...] of this episode, and praised Liz's speech citing it as the [...] "crowning moment" [...] from [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". Rabin also liked the Toofer quitting storyline writing that it [...] "could easily have gone nowhere but the show made it both funny and surprisingly thoughtful by {{using it as a}} springboard to discuss Affirmative Action and our society's defiantly uneven playing field." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik noted that this episode was stronger than [...] "Khonani", which aired the same day of the week as this episode. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote that Toofer's plot was not [...] "given {{more than a few minutes}} of screen time [...] it also doesn't wear out its welcome... The show doesn't address race, gender, or affirmative action in a particularly enlightened manner, but who cares, it's funny." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that he found the most enjoyment in Liz's story, writing that he found it [...] "endearing". In regards to Jack's plot, Mersel said that Jack is able to play off Nancy and Avery so well that [...] "I am going back and forth on whether or not to scold the NBC boss or give him a <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back. Avery and Nancy both have their shining moments, but I feel that he must choose quite soon, or he will be loosing [...] both." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michigan's first {{touchdown}} {{was set up}} when end Ed Frutig {{blocked a}} punt out of bounds inside the Northwestern one-yard line.

2500|$|Unfortunately, Elderspeak {{is based}} on {{stereotypes}} and not actual behaviour of elders because it is used in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. Elderspeak is actually offensive but nursing home residents are no longer offended by these speech patterns because they have claimed it as a normal habit. [...] The use of elderspeak in more [...] “warmth” [...] and lower in a “superiority” dimension when the speaker was a family member and/or friend compared to an unfamiliar. Generally, young adults use an overstated version of elderspeak when addressing impaired older persons. When older adults converse with older people with cognitive impairments, they make speech accommodations {{to a lesser extent}} than young people. They speak more slowly and incorporate more pauses, however they do not use more repetition as young people do. It is possible that older speakers may not accommodate their speech as much in order to avoid seeming patronizing. Research shows that approximately 80% of communication is non verbal. Elderspeak involves communicating to the older adult in a coddling way, which includes non verbal cues and gestures. An example would be looming over a wheelchair or bed in dominancy, or a <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> buttocks resembling parent-child touching.|$|E
2500|$|In December, {{the company}} went on to produce their best known {{theatrical}} performance Kamra No. 9 (Room No. 9) a radio play written by Saadat Hasan Manto and directed by Azeem Hamid. The performance was well received by critics and audiences, the Daily Times wrote [...] "Kamra #9 ... mystery musical {{is an example of}} Urdu theatre at its finest." [...] Shoaib Ahmed of Dawn Newspaper wrote [...] "The 60-minute three-act play had such a strong production value that it kept glued the audience to their seats till the end. The literary piece was deeply and meaningfully tailored for the play.", while during an interview to The Express Tribune, director Azeem Hamid said, [...] "Visualising and creating a 1930s Delhi feel for a radio play was an immense challenge; we walked around Jalander, India to get inspiration for Kamra #9’s set design." [...] The Mani-Nama blog reviewed the performance saying, [...] "The set was quite modest- a realistic one with an old radio, telephone and chairs. After sometime I witnessed some quality lighting which was done by Shakeel Siddique, who literally set the pace of play with classic lights." [...] and The News on Sunday wrote, [...] "Kamra #9 provided insight into human complexities." [...] Aleeza Rasool, writer and critic, of Youlin Magazine reported praising the performance as she wrote, [...] "Firstly, a radio play by Manto was a refreshing choice, for {{it is one of the}} lesser-known genres that Manto composed during his brief lifetime. Secondly, the play was very well-acted, and most importantly, the direction was even-tempered, making the play engaging., adding that, [...] "It is unusual to come across the genus of anticipation and suspense in Pakistani stage plays, which is why Azeem Hamid, actor and director of the play, deserves a <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back for putting up a wonderful performance on Manto’s radio play." ...|$|E
