40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an efficient}} text input technique {{that can be}} used in various environments where conventional full-sized keyboards cannot be used. The technique, called <b>POBox,</b> consists of two steps for entering a word or a phrase. First, a user enters a small part of the word or some other attribute, and <b>POBox</b> dynamically searches a dictionary for candidate words and shows them to the user for selection. The user then selects the desired word from the candidate list, and <b>POBox</b> enters the word into the user's document. <b>POBox</b> uses the context of the user's document to help identify likely candidates. Many times <b>POBox</b> can predict the desired word based on the context. This allows the user to skip the first step and enter text even more efficiently. We show that the same technique can be applied to various handheld and ubiquitous computers including PDAs and cellular phones, where conventional full-sized keyboards are inadequate. 1 Introduction Full-sized keyboards have been by [...] ...|$|E

The startup problem is of dual objectives. One {{objective is to}} fill up the tank {{and the other is}} to achieve certain reaction conversion. The two objectives compete with each other because each has a different gain sign. Consequently, standard PI algorithms may not perform well. In fact, nonlinear control algorithms can be tested for the startup control problem. However, to avoid computational complexity brought in by such nonlinear controllers, Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) can be a simple and suitable alternative.

40|$|Some online {{resources}} {{are free and}} others are not—but {{it can be hard}} to predict which {{resources are}} in which category. Do users pay for web-based e-mail? Sometimes they do, as in the case of lifetime e-mail service from <b>Pobox,</b> but often they do not, as in the case of Hotmail from Microsoft or Gmail from Google. Do users pay for wireless Internet access at “hotspots”? Historically such access carries a fee, as it does at the T-Mobile HotSpots at many airports and hotels, but now a number of retail outlets are providing such access without a fee, such as Panera Bread, Whole Foods, and recently Starbucks. Do users pay for software? Many users do pay for a wide variety of commercial software, yet other software like the Linux operating system and the FireFox web browser can be downloaded without charge. Zero prices offer important benefits, even relative to small positive prices. For one, fee-free access reduces transaction costs—eliminating the need for billing systems as well as, in many cases, account setup, user names, and the like. Furthermore, zero prices seem to create an environment of experimentation and progress for products and consumers (Lessig, 2002; von Hippel, 2001). Finally, consumers overwhelmingly favor zero-price products, even beyond what might be predicted by their ordinary efforts to maximize consumer surplus (Shampanier, Mazar, and Ariely, 2007). Yet experience in other contexts offers cause for concern. Although marginal costs may be near zero for many levels of use of online resources, costs generally eventually increase as usage nears a capacity constraint given by technological capability or system design. More generally, experience in other contexts repeatedly reveals overconsumption, scarcity, and even hoarding when resources ar...|$|E
40|$|Hedges of Vetiver grass (Vetiver zizanioides) offer farmers a cheaper, {{easier and}} more {{effective}} way to stop soil erosion than soil bunds. They are also more efficient in reducing runoff. Vetiver grass (Khus in India), is being grown in several {{parts of the world}} but its usefulness has remained unrecognised. It has been grown in Karnataka State India, for 100 years, in the West Indies for the last 50 years, and in Fiji for 30 years. Now the World Bank and other organizations are beginning to support projects for its wider use. Studies of the grass have shown that it can grow over a wide range of climates and latitudes. From over 2000 m in the Himalayas to the deserts of Rajasthan, and the wastelands of Andhra Pradesh, in fact anywhere between the latitudes 22 degrees north and south. It does not readily produce seed and in the wet tropics it will take five months to establish from. In arid areas it will take three seasons to get going. As long as it is planted during the rains, the > can withstand 60 days without further rain. As Vetiver grass does not readily seed, it will not spread sideways. Its roots go straight down and so do not compete with adjacent crops, neither does it harbour any pest and diseases that can spread to crops. A 50 cm wide strip of Vetiver grass slows water run-off, filters out the silt and allows excess water to ooze through {{the entire length of the}} hedge, rather than concentrate in one spot. In Fiji, where the grass has been planted on 50 % slopes, terraces three to four metres wide have been formed by the silt retained by the grass. Normally all this soil would have been lost. In other places farmers have been able to crop land with 45 degree slopes, something that would have been impossible with normal soil conservation techniques. In Karnataka, farmers keep their hedges of Vetiver grass cut down to 30 to 50 cm; they feed the cut grass to their cattle.

40|$|Available at Plantenkundige Dienst, <b>PObox</b> 9102, 6700 HC Wageningen The NetherlandsIn opdracht van het Ministerie van LNV is een milieu-{{indicator}} opgezet die het mogelijk maakt volumecijfers te koppelen aan milieubelasting. Er zijn verschillende milieu-indicatoren uitgewerkt, te weten voor aquatoxiciteit, alg, kreeftachtige, vis, uitspoeling naar grondwater en toxiciteit voor vogels. Trends per indicator zijn opgesteld voor gewasbeschermingsmiddelen, gewasbeschermingsmiddelen exclusief grondontsmettingsmiddelen, herbiciden, fungiciden en insecticiden. De uitgewerkte milieu-indicator maakt het mogelijk aan te geven waar knelpunten bestaan; zowel op het niveau van werkzame stoffen als op het niveau van gewassen. Uit deze studie zijn vele punten gevolgd op grond waarvan toekomstige indicatoren verbeterd kunnen worden. The Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment {{commissioned the}} RIVM {{to assess the}} environmental effect of the policy measures for sustainable construction, for the period 1995 - 2020. This study asseses the environmental effects of technical measures for the reduction of energy use, water use {{and the use of}} materials in existing and new dwellings and utility buildings. Two models have been developed, one for dwellings and one for utility buildings (only for the sectors health, education, offices and retail trade). These models are uses to assess technical measures of the National Sustainable Construction Package for the reduction of energy, water use and the use of materials in existing and new dwellings and buildings can be assessed. Behavioral changes have not been included in the models. In order to calculate the effects the measures with regard to sustainable construction have been equipped with penetration scenarios. These penetration scenarios are explicated in consultation with experts (in the fields of policy and construction). For the dwellings in the Netherlands a reduction of energy use for space heating with approximately 15 % is calculated. As a result the CO 2 -emission related to space heating will also decline. In utility buildings the energy use per m 2 gross ground area will decline. As a result of the increase in ground area for most of the sectors in utility buildings the energy use (and the resulting CO 2 -emission) will be stable. The reduction of water use in dwellings is much larger than in utility buildings. This {{is a result of the}} much larger possibilities of water reduction in dwellings as compared to utility buildings. The reduction of material use has also been assessed in the prognosis. In the near future environmental profit will be gained in the recycling of materials for buildings, for instance for shingle, gypsum and PVC. In the reduction of harmful emissions, for instance for volatile organic compounds and heavy metals. In the durable use and the reduction in use of non-renewable elements, for instance wood and tar products. ...|$|E
