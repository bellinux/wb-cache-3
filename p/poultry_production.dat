5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of <b>poultry</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
40|$|China's {{livestock}} and <b>poultry</b> <b>productions</b> have changed {{significantly in the}} last three decades, from mainly traditional and small-scale systems in early 1980 s towards more intensive and industrialized ones in recent years, due to the booming economy and the changes in people' diet. There is an urgent need to increase the understanding of the changes in the {{livestock and}} <b>poultry</b> <b>productions</b> and the impact of manure recycle on the environment. Here, we reported on a systematic and quantitative analysis on the temporal and spatial variability of livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>productions</b> and manure nutrients in Shanxi Province, China, using a large database and a coupled food chain nutrient flow model (NUFER) with GIS. In the period of 1978 to 2012, total animal manure production increased from 1. 61 × 10 7 t to 2. 75 × 10 7 t by 171 %. The manure N increased from 7. 74 × 10 4 t to 17. 32 × 10 4 t, and the manure P from 1. 09 × 10 4 t to 3. 39 × 10 4 t. Besides the huge increase in total animal manure production, the distribution of animal manure was much uneven among regions, with high amounts of manure N and P per unit land in the north, middle and southeastern regions and low values in the north-central and southwestern regions, {{based on the results of}} 2012. The uneven distribution of manure was the combined effect of regional specializations in livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>productions</b> and related policies. Our findings suggested that optimizing the structure of livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>productions</b> and enhancing interregional collaborations on nutrient management could be two effective measures for reducing pollution and environmental risks, while achieving efficient and sustainable use of manure nutrient in the long term. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Poultry</b> meat <b>production</b> {{has doubled}} in past 40 years in the world, with the {{tendency}} of constant growth, and its production volume exceeds beef, but is behind pork <b>production.</b> For <b>poultry</b> meat <b>production</b> it is typical that its annual increase exceeds pork as well as beef production. The biggest producers of poultry meat are Asia, North and South America and Europe. The most significant category of poultry is meat of young chicken (broilers). Cobb, Ross and Hubbard broiler provenance are most common in Serbia. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to analyse <b>poultry</b> meat <b>production</b> volume in Serbia, observed during three six-years periods - A (1984 - 1989), B (1994 - 1999) i C (2004 - 2009). For data processing there were used the data obtained from Statistical Yearbooks of Serbia from 1984. to 2009. It was found out that average <b>poultry</b> meat <b>production</b> in period A was 108, 33 ± 7, 00 thousand tonnes, than it statistically significantly decreased and in period B it was 76, 67 ± 5, 54 thousand tonnes, and finally in period C it was 72, 17 ± 5, 78 thousand tonnes.

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was <b>poultry</b> <b>production,</b> especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E

25|$|Willow Bunch's {{agriculture}} {{generates the}} most profit from grain yields; {{as a result}} there is much less emphasis on livestock. Surveys from the 1930s show high <b>poultry</b> <b>production,</b> and moderate production of horses, cattle, sheep and swine. Sheep production saw a major drop from 1931 to 1936 and never rose again. The 1950s continued these pre-existing trends with low sheep production, high cattle production, and very high <b>poultry</b> <b>production.</b> The trend has since continued unabated, with far more land dedicated to crops than pasture fields. A 2011 census shows no farms dedicated to animals other than beef cattle ranches and animal combination farms. Furthermore, there are no farms dedicated to general apiculture. The small presence of livestock is characteristic of the farming division, however. While areas like Old Post, Waverly and Excel have many farms dedicated to cattle ranching/farming, these municipalities have few other farms dedicated to animal production.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} analyze break-even point and {{margin of safety}} of <b>poultry</b> egg <b>production</b> in the rural area in Southeast Sulawesi. The research used a case study approach by using questionnaire 1, in-depth interviews, and observation to collect data and information from a small-scale poultry egg producing enterprise which was selected purposively with the consideration that the farm is located in rural area and had less than 1. 000 laying hens. Data were analyzed using costs and returns, break-even point, and margin of safety ratio. Research {{results show that the}} enterprise record net income of Rp 9. 232. 165, 00. R/C ratio of 1, 32 means that the enterprise would earn a revenue of Rp 1, 32 for every one rupiah it invested. Break even sales are Rp 3. 374. 474, 00 and break even volume was 140, 60 kg. The egg production is far above both the break-even sales and units, meaning that the enterprise earns a profit from egg production. The margin of safety is Rp 34. 750. 526, 00 or 91, 15 %, indicating a high level of safety in the enterprise. In view of its profitability and the importance of <b>poultry</b> egg <b>production</b> in the generation of employment and fulfillment of protein needs of the population, local government and other stakeholders are suggested to take measures to promote <b>poultry</b> egg <b>production</b> in rural areas by providing technical assistance program for small-scale poultry farmers at the community level and improving managerial skills in the <b>poultry</b> egg <b>production.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{capability}} of firms {{to compete on}} markets is linked {{more and more to}} the development of integration relationships between firms operating at different stages of the production chain. Thus the value created by an integrated production system arises both from the efficiency of single firms and the development of cooperative relationships. In the <b>poultry</b> meat <b>production</b> chain this kind of relationship is rather frequent and it could be a worthwhile task to assess the total value created by this chain and the value distribution among firms. This paper firstly describes the economical profile of the <b>poultry</b> meat <b>production</b> chain, considering the organizational and technological relationships between enterprises. Then, accounting data of about fifty firms has been processed to evaluate the total returns that is derived from internal activities developed along the chain and its distribution.
