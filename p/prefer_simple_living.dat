50|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>living</b> or {{voluntary}} poverty {{encompasses a}} number of different voluntary practices to simplify one's lifestyle. These may include reducing one's possessions, generally referred to as minimalism, or increasing self-sufficiency, for example. <b>Simple</b> <b>living</b> may be characterized by individuals being satisfied with what they have rather than want. Although asceticism generally promotes living simply and refraining from luxury and indulgence, not all proponents of <b>simple</b> <b>living</b> are ascetics. <b>Simple</b> <b>living</b> is distinct from those living in forced poverty, as it is a voluntary lifestyle choice.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{considerable}} attention paid to the methodology of philosophy. The puzzle is simple—if philosophy is not an empirical discipline, how can one philosophical theory be rationally preferred over another? One {{answer to this question}} is that we should apply the theoretical virtues. Foremost among these theoretical virtues is simplicity—so perhaps we should <b>prefer</b> <b>simpler</b> philosophical theories to more complex ones. Huemer (Philos Q 59 : 216 – 236, 2009) objects that the reasons to <b>prefer</b> <b>simpler</b> theories in science do not apply in philosophy. I will argue that Huemer is mistaken—the arguments he marshals for <b>preferring</b> <b>simpler</b> theories in science can also be applied in philosophy. Like Huemer, I will focus on the philosophy of mind and the nominalism/Platonism debate. But I want to engage with the broader issue of whether simplicity is relevant to philosophy...|$|R
