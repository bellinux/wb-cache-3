The design and construction of a rig to enable a controlled fretting action to be applied to a <b>push-pull</b> <b>type</b> of fatigue specimen is discussed. Special consideration is given to the form of the fretting contact geometry with regard to the generated stress field, and the reasons behind the final choice of a circular Hertzian contact are given. The investigation of the effects of various parameters on the fatigue life of the specimen are reported. The parameters chosen for the investigation were the slip amplitude, the bulk stress and the normal load. Examination of the developing fretting damage was carried out ty interrupting the tests at prescribed intervals. The subsequent observations made of the surface and sue-surface damage are illustrated by optical and scanning electron micrographs. Two distinct forms of damage are proposed, these have been termed type I and type II fretting fatigue damage. Type I damage is considered to be by crack nucleation from the conjoint action of the bulk and surface stress fields. These cracks were found to nucleate in the direction of maximum shear {{at the edge of the}} fretting contact, and at the position where the alternating tensile stress was largest. The subsequent direction of propagation of these cracks, determines whether or not fatigue failure of the specimen will occur. The type I fretting damage process, is noted to have been responsible for every case of catastrophic fatigue failure of the test specimens. Type II fretting damage was found at the centre of the fretting contact area, where the hydrostatic stress and surface shear traction are maximum. The material in this region was found to have undergone extensive microstructural alteration. White etching layers with a hardness in excess of 1300 Hv (more than four times the original hardness) are reported. An extensive literature survey is presented which shows no previous evidence of white etching layers forming under clean fretting conditions. The white layers are shown to have important consequences on the rate of wear, thus it is postulated that under certain conditions fretting wear and fretting fatigue may be linked ty the same mechanism, i. e. white etching layer formation.

Practically speaking, it is important to frequently switched breakers, such as live-tank breakers that switch shunt capacitors and reactors and generator circuit breakers in pumped-storage hydro power plants—these breakers suffer from higher arcing contact and nozzle wear, possibly causing the allowed ablation to be reached within the standard service interval—and to breakers that are expensive to main-tain, such as GIS.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Organic {{electro-optic}} {{materials are}} {{at the forefront of}} current photonics applications that enable high speed data transmission, micro-scale sensors, and terahertz applications. Typically linearly conjugated <b>push-pull</b> <b>type</b> chromophores are the primary molecules of choice for various second and third order non-linear optical (NLO) applications. However, intra-molecular charge transfer responsible for many NLO properties can take place in molecules through other means such as σ-conjugation, cross-conjugation and omniconjugation as well. In Chapter 2 a study of electronic transitions, excited states and first hyperpolarizibility (β) of a series of molecules with a cross-conjugated bridge functionalized with a dialkylaminobenzene donor on one end and varying strength acceptors on the other end is reported. A lowered excited state dipole moment compared to the ground state dipole was indicated for an asymmetric cross-conjugated molecule with a relatively stronger acceptor confirming that the cross-conjugated bridge does in fact break the over-all molecular dipole into two constituent parts. The primary charge-transfer transition was, however still identified to occur from the donor across the cross-conjugated bridge to the acceptor. X-ray diffraction (XRD) found the molecules to be twisted significantly resulting in further isolation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This reduced overlap of the HOMO and the LUMO in cross-conjugated systems may in fact enable independent modulation of donor and acceptor strengths while minimizing unfavorable effects on electronic transitions and dipole moments. Comparison of hyperpolarizabilities with a control molecule found that cross-conjugation did not completely diminish β. In Chapter 3, a tricyanopyrroline (TCP) type acceptor was substituted on the cross-conjugated molecules to observe the effects of cross-conjugation on the molecular structure, the ground and excited states of the molecules and consequently β. Through XRD the cross-conjugated motif was found to be perpendicular to the conjugated TCP chromophore and the TCP acceptor was twisted out of plane from the donor despite being conjugated to the donor. Further the aromatic substituents on the cross-conjugated side group were found to interact with each other influencing crystal packing. The dihedral twist and the aromatic interactions are indicated as the cause of reduced aggregation behavior. Hyper-Raleigh scattering measurements found the compounds to have β values comparable to their fully conjugated control molecules. The β values were expected to be influenced by the cross-conjugated side groups acting as auxiliary acceptors {{as well as by the}} dihedral twist observed in these molecules resulting in larger spatial isolation between the HOMO and LUMO. In conclusion the use of a cross-conjugated motif by itself (Chapter 2) and in conjunction with a conjugated chromophore (Chapter 3) was studied and found to be useful towards affecting aggregation, solubility and hyperpolarizability of NLO chromophores...|$|R
40|$|Texto en español y resumen en inglésThe {{development}} of new organic materials with nonlinear optical properties (NLO) {{was one of the}} aims of research over the past decades due to their potential use in the field of telecommunications, optical computing and processing and optical data storage, among others. The advantages of organic compounds compared to inorganic crystals are its low cost, ease of processing and high number of structural variability, which makes them very attractive to industry. Most organic compounds with non-linear optical (NLO) properties are based on highly conjugated molecules with donors and acceptors substituted at the two ends of the molecule, called donor-acceptor (?push-pull?) systems, and these are amongst the most interesting structures for new compounds with efficient NLO responses. The PhD project presented in this report is framed {{in the context of a}} search for new molecules <b>push-pull</b> <b>type,</b> based on heteroaromatic cations as acceptors of the system (for these systems has been appointed a new name as "NLO-catiophores), and partly in the {{development of}} the synthesis of new macrocyclic rigid cationic nature. First we describe the synthesis and study of nonlinear optical properties by Hyper-Rayleigh Scattering (HRS) of new push-pull system based on heteroaromatic cations. They were obtained through the development of the Suzuki, Heck and Sonogashira reactions. We have demonstrated that organotrifluroborates are better efficient partners than boronic acids for the Suzuki coupling reaction with pyridinium and, Moreover, the ease with which these potassium organotrifluoroborates reacted with azinium and quinolizinium salts in water and the coupling products can be isolated is a further advantage of the procedure and provides a new means for accessing to a great variety of substituted cations. It has proved possible to Heck coupling with aryl iodides with the four isomers of vinilquinolizinium. We have achived the synthesis of a series of D-A and D-A-D catio-phores by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction from aziniun and quinolizinium bromoderivatives. Noting the overall study ONL values of selected molecules can be obtained the following conclusions: a) heteroaromatic cations type azinium and quinolizinium have good NLO properties (βHRS values between 25 - 500 10 - 30 esu). In general, for the pyridinium cation, substitution at the C 4 produces best response NLO and in case of cation quinolizinium position C 2 is best. b) electrodonating substituent favor the charge transfer on the system Donnor-Acceptor. Moreover it was found that the quinolizinium cation is better acceptor increasing the value of hyperpolarizability. On the other hand, in this context of {{development of new}} materials, we considered introducing the quinolizinium system on macrocyclic structures shape-persistent type, i. e. a rigid skeleton formed by aryl units linked together by triple bonds, which resulting in large molecular surfaces. These properties make the AEMs (arylene-ethynylene macrocycles), structures of interest in the field of organic materials...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} focused on fatigue crack {{initiation}} and early growth in two-phase titanium alloy VT 3 - 1 (similar to Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) under VHCF loads. The material was produced by two different processes: forging and extrusion. Each kind of material was investigated under three different loading <b>types</b> (<b>push-pull,</b> pull-pull and fully reversed torsion). Fracture surfaces of the tested specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for getting information on crack initiation sites and surrounded fracture surface zones. The results of such analysis were compared with microstructure of the titanium alloy for establishing a crack initiation and early crack growth mechanisms. It was found that crack initiation in this alloy is caused by single or an agglomeration (“cluster”) of alpha-platelets. Under fully reversed tension the fatigue life seems {{to depend on the}} geometry of alpha-platelets clusters whereas under tension tension loading such dependence was not observed. However, materials with larger alpha-platelets clusters (macro-zones) have a lower VHCF resistance. The comparison of tension and torsion VHCF test results show a higher slop of the S-N curve under torsion than under tension for both forged and extruded titanium alloys. Nonetheless, some similarities in crack initiation and propagation scenarios were outlined between tension and torsion loadings...|$|R
40|$|Neste trabalho de tese investigamos teoricamente três sistemas conjugados diferentes. O primeiro destes problemas consistiu no estudo de uma molécula orgânica de tipo "push-pull", Q 3 CnQ, que apresentaria propriedades retificadoras. Esta molécula possi duas estruturas de ressonância principais, uma neutra e a outra de carga separada (switteriônica). Estudamos o mecanismo de transferência de carga {{intramolecular}} que leva ao comportamento retificador do sistema, e as conformações adotadas pela molécula em diferentes ambientes químicos mediante métodos semi-empíricos baseados na teoria Hartree-Fock (AM 1,AM 1 /campo elétrico, AM 1 /CI, AM 1 /solvente). No segundo problema estudamos as interações entre pares de oligômeros de tiofeno em funcão da carga e do aumento do tamanho da cadeia mediante cálculos {{ab initio}} baseados na teoria Hartree-Fock, avaliando os efeitos de correção eletrônica. Investigamos os principais mecanismos responsáveis pela coesão entre as moléculas para arranjos paralelos e antiparalelos de bitiofenos, tetiofenos e quatertiofenos. Para meléculas neutras só são observados estados ligados se a correlação eletrônica é explicitamente considerada, resultado em energias de ligação na faixa de 0. 32 a 0. 70 eV. Pares formados por dois radicais cátions foram reportados na literatura em condições de baixas temperaturas e altas concentrações e foram denominados dímeros p. As entalpias de dimerização calculadas neste trabalho são da ordem de grandeza das experimentais e seguem a mesma têndencia com o aumento do tamanho da cadeia. Os dímeros formados por um dicátion e uma molécula neutra possuem uma energia de ligação da ordem de 1 e V. Estes dímeros não foram reportados na literatura. A partir dos resultados deste trabalho pode-se pensar que este fato se deve a que estes dímeros são instaveis com respeito a pares formados por dois radicais cátion. Os espectros de absorção dos pares foram simulados e comparados com dados da literatura. No último trabalho estudamos a estrutura eletrônica de diferentes aglomerados formados por carbono e nitrogênio utilizando o Hamiltoniano Efeitvo de Valência (VEH). Estudamos aglomerados de grafite com átomos de nitrogênio substituidos aleatoriamente para diferentes concentrações [N]/[C] (previamente otimizados mediante métodos semi-empíricos). Obtivemos ainda as estrutura eletrônica de aglomerados representativos das fases a e b cristalinas preditas para C 3 N 4. Os calculos foram comparados com resultados experimentais e identificados os diferentes picos observados. Discutimos o ambiente quimico do carbono em função da concentração relativa [N]/[C]In this work we have investigated theoretically three different conjugated systems. Firstly, we have studied an organic <b>push-pull</b> <b>type</b> molecule, Q 3 CNQ, which presents rectifying properties. This molecule has two main resonance structures, one neutral {{and the other}} with separated charges (zwitterionic). We have studied the intramolecula 5 r charge transfer, which leads to the rectifying behavior of the system, as well as the conformations adopted by the molecule in different chemical environments. The calculations were carried out using semi-empirical methods based on the Hartree-Fock theory (AM 1,AM 1 /eletric field, AM 1 /CI, AM 1 /solvent). The second problem concerns the study of the interaction between oligothiophene pairs as a function of both the net charge of the molecules and the number of thiophene rings. We employed ab initio methods based on the Hartree-Fock t heory, and correlations effects were evaluated by th second order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory. We have investigated the mechanisms responsible for the cohesion between the molecules for both parallel and anti-parallel arrangements of bithiophenes, terthiophenes and quaterthiophenes. For neutral molecules we have found bound states only if the electronic correlation is explicity considered, leading to binding energies in the range 0. 32 - 0. 70 eV. Pairs formed by two cation radicals were reported in the literature for low temperature and high concentration conditions, and have been called the p- dimers. The dimenrization enthalpies calculated in this work are of the same order of maqnitude of the experimental ones, and follow the same trend with increasing chain lenth. the dimers formed by a dication and a neutral molecule present a binding energy of the order of 1 e V. These dimmers were not yet reported in the literature. A reason for this could be that these dimmers ara unstable with respect to the pairs formed by two cation radicals. The absorption spectra of the pairs were simulated through the semi-empirical ZINDO/CI technique and compared with experimental data from the literature. Finally, in the last part of this work we have studied the electronic structure of different clusters formed by carbon and nitrogen, using the Valence Effective Hamiltonian (VEH) pseudo-potencial technique. We have studies graphite clusters with randomly substituted nitrogen atoms, for different [N]/[C] concentrations (previously optimised by means of semi-empirical methods), as well as clusters that are representative of the predicted crystalline structures a and b - C 3 N 4. The calculations were compared with the experimental UPS and XPS spectra. The identification of the serveral features present in the experimental density-of-states and nitrogen core-level spectra was done. We have discussed the carbion chemical environments as function of the relative concentrations [N]/[C...|$|R
