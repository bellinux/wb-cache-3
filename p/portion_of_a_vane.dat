40|$|Various {{methods and}} systems related to chaos-based {{pseudo-random}} number generation are presented. In one example, among others, a system includes a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to generate <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> digital outputs and a nonlinear post processing circuit {{to perform an}} exclusive OR (XOR) operation on <b>a</b> first <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current digital output of the PRNG and <b>a</b> permutated version <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corresponding first <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previous post processed output to generate <b>a</b> corresponding first <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current post processed output. In another example, a method includes receiving at least <b>a</b> first <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current output from a PRNG and performing an XOR operation on the first <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the current PRNG output with <b>a</b> permutated version <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corresponding first <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previous post processed output to generate <b>a</b> corresponding first <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current post processed output...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this {{theoretical}} paper, the wide-band low-gain feature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tapered smooth wall gyro-traveling {{wave tube}} (gyro-TWT) was {{combined with the}} low beam energy, low magnetic field, and high gain, though narrow band, feature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vane</b> loaded nontapered gyro-TWT, to propose <b>a</b> distributed, tapered <b>vane</b> loaded gyro-TWT for both high gains and wide bandwidths. The device was analyzed for the tapering of {{any one of the}} three parameters—the waveguide radius, the vane depth, and the vane angle—keeping the remaining two as constant. The magnetic field was also synchronously tapered. The optimum taper and vane parameters were predicted for a large gain and bandwidth.
