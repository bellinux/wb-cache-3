This <b>process</b> <b>provides</b> an excellent bonding surface for repair material and new coating applications. First developed in Europe in the 1970s, this technology has become widely accepted for concrete removal and surface preparation throughout Europe and North America.|$|E
25|$|In Oakland, California at the East Bay Municipal Utility District’s main {{wastewater}} treatment plant (EBMUD), food waste is currently codigested with primary and secondary municipal wastewater solids and other high-strength wastes. Compared to municipal wastewater solids digestion alone, food waste codigestion has many benefits. Anaerobic digestion of food waste pulp from the EBMUD food waste <b>process</b> <b>provides</b> a higher normalized energy benefit, compared to municipal wastewater solids: 730 to 1,300 kWh per dry ton of food waste applied compared to 560 to 940 kWh per dry ton of municipal wastewater solids applied.|$|E

2500|$|Milk with {{a higher}} {{concentration}} of solids than normal milk may be used; the higher solids content produces a firmer yogurt. Solids can be increased by adding dried milk. The yogurt-making <b>process</b> <b>provides</b> two significant barriers to pathogen growth, heat and acidity (low pH). Both are necessary to ensure a safe product. Acidity alone has been questioned by recent outbreaks of food poisoning by [...] that is acid-tolerant. E. coli O157:H7 is easily destroyed by pasteurization (heating); the initial heating of the milk kills pathogens as well as denaturing proteins. The microorganisms that turn milk into yogurt can tolerate higher temperatures than most pathogens, so that a suitable temperature not only encourages the formation of yogurt, but inhibits pathogenic microorganisms. Once the yogurt has formed it can, if desired, be strained to reduce the whey content and thicken it.|$|E

2500|$|Therapeutic {{storytelling}} is the act {{of telling}} one's story {{in an attempt to}} better understand oneself or one's situation. [...] Oftentimes, these stories affect the audience in a therapeutic sense as well, helping them to view situations similar to their own through a different lens. [...] Noted author and folklore scholar, Elaine Lawless states, [...] "…this <b>process</b> <b>provides</b> new avenues for understanding and identity formation. [...] Language is utilised to bear witness to their lives". [...] Sometimes a narrator will simply skip over certain details without realising, only to include it in their stories during a later telling. [...] In this way, that telling and retelling of the narrative serves to [...] "reattach portions of the narrative". [...] These gaps may occur due to a repression of the trauma or even just a want to keep the most gruesome details private. [...] Regardless, these silences are not as empty as they appear, and it is only this act of storytelling that can enable the teller to fill them back in.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{alternate}} model of object recognition by Carbonnel et al. episodic and semantic memory {{arise from the}} same memory traces, and no semantic representations are stored permanently in memory. [...] By this view, the meaning of any stimulus emerges momentarily from reactivation of one's previous experiences with that entity. [...] Each episode is made of several components of many different sensory modalities that are typically engaged during interactions with an object. In this scenario, a retrieval cue triggers reactivation of all episodic memory traces, {{in proportion to the}} similarity between the cue its 'echo,' the components shared by most activated traces. [...] In a process called 're-injection,' the first echo acts as a further retrieval cue, evoking the 'second echo,' the less frequently associated components of the cue. [...] Thus, the 're-injection' <b>process</b> <b>provides</b> a more complete meaning for the object. [...] According to this model, different types of stimuli will evoke differential 'echos' based on typical interactions with them. [...] For example, a distinction is made between functional and visual components of various stimuli, such that impairment to these aspects of the memory trace will inhibit the re-injection process needed to complete the object representation. [...] This theory has been used to explain category-specific agnosias that impair recognition of various object types, such as animals and words, to different degrees.|$|E
