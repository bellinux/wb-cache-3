40|$|Short-lived {{greenhouse}} gases that {{also contribute to}} air pollution are playing {{a major role in}} global warming. Black carbon alone is likely the second or third most important climate forcing agent. The short atmospheric lifetime of these <b>pollutants</b> <b>means</b> that, unlike CO 2, reducing emissions produces a decrease in atmospheric concentration and a reduction of the radiative forcing that drives climate change. Black carbon and tropospheric ozone also have large negative effects at the regional and local level contributing substantially to indoor and urban air pollution and the formation of Atmospheric Brown Clouds that disrupt regional climate. Moreover, technologies to reduce emissions are available, cost-effective, and have already been widely deployed in developed countries. Reducing these short-lived {{greenhouse gases}} is therefore a mitigation pathway for industrializing countries that is both appropriate to their level of development and highly climatically effective. It is also consistent with both responsibility and capability fairness principles, both of which play important roles in the international climate regime. As such, it offers {{a way out of the}} current deadlock between developed and developing countries in which each group asks for more substantial emissions reduction commitments from the other before taking action. China, as the world’s largest black carbon emitter, should push for substantial CO 2 mitigation commitments from the developed countries in return for aggressive action to reduce its own soot emissions. This action is consistent with China’s own development strategy and would contribute substantially to the mitigation of climate change...|$|E

Carbon monoxide (CO) content was measured over an 8  hour period by a CO portable monitor. The fine suspended particles were measured according to the black smoke index (BS), with a flow controlled portable pump provided with a cellulose filter. The nitrogen oxides, NO and NO 2 were measured with a passive sampler.  RESULTS—These drivers are exposed during their professional activity to relatively high concentrations of <b>pollutants</b> (<b>mean,</b> median (SD) 3. 8,  2  (1. 7) ppm for CO, 168,  164  (53) µg/m 3 for BS, 625,  598  (224) µg/m 3 for NO, and 139,  131  (43) µg/m 3 for NO 2.) For CO the concentrations were clearly lower than the threshold values recommended by the World Health Organisation. The situation is less satisfactory for the other pollutants, especially for the BS index. All concentrations of pollutants recorded were noticeably higher than concentrations in air recorded by the ambient Parisian air monitoring network and were close to, or slightly exceeded, the concentrations measured at the fixed stations close to automobile traffic. Pollutant concentrations were also influenced greatly by weather conditions.  CONCLUSION—This first French study conducted in taxi drivers shows that they are highly exposed to automobile pollutants.

However, regional atmospheric chemistry-transport models (CTMs) can provide pollution data with national coverage at fine geographical and temporal resolution.

Methods: Statistical simulations {{were based on a}} theoretical area of 4 regions each consisting of twenty-five 5 km × 5 km grid-squares. In the context of a 3 -year Poisson regression time-series analysis of the association between mortality and a single pollutant, we compared the error impact of using daily grid-specific model data as opposed to daily regional average monitor data. We investigated how this comparison was affected if we changed the number of grids per region containing a monitor. To inform simulations, estimates (e. g. of <b>pollutant</b> <b>means)</b> were obtained from observed monitor data for 2003 – 2006 for national network sites across the UK and corresponding model data that were generated by the EMEP-WRF CTM.

40|$|Control and {{reduction}} of pollution from stormwater overflow {{is a major}} concern to be addressed by municipalities in order {{to improve the quality of}} the receiving water bodies and the environment in general. In the European context, these actions are driven by the Water Directive 2000 / 60 /CE. In this regard, assessment studies of the potential load from sewer networks recognize the need for adaptation and upgrade of existing networks with waterworks and management measures. In many cases this is done by building first-flush detention tanks that, however, present consistent practical and economical burdens. In this work, simple rules to manage existing pumping stations in combined sewer systems are proposed as a way to apply management rules that mitigate pollution load. Such rules can be easily implemented in real cases with minimal cost of activation and no need of additional infrastructures. The procedure is based on the previous knowledge of the precipitation forcing and of a quantity/quality model of the sewer network. The steps adopted are (1) use of a (long-term, high-resolution) sequence of rainfall events to compute a wide spectrum of flow conditions (hydrographs and pollutographs) to the pumping stations; (2) definitions of a pumping rule to apply to the whole sequence of events to filter the incoming flow toward the wastewater treatment plant, so to compute outflows; and (3) efficiency assessment of the pumping rule by cumulative frequency analysis of water volume, pollutant mass, and <b>pollutant</b> <b>mean</b> concentration. Rule optimization can be performed by iterating points (2) and (3). An example is proposed to show how two simple parameters (a discharge threshold on the inflow and a maximum pumping time) can control the management of water and pollutant fluxes. Numerical results show that a proper optimization allows one to reduce the pumped volumes (thus reducing energy requirements and increasing the treatment plant efficiency) without significant changes to the overall pollutant mass outflow. The new pumping rules can be implemented on real stations with minimal and economically sustainable intervention...|$|R

Two highways with high {{average daily traffic}} were monitored using passive stormwater samplers for collecting first-flush runoff during a 16 -month period. Detailed traffic and weather data were collected at College Station sites, but only weather data were obtained at Austin sites. A stepwise regression analysis on College Station data identifies the antecedent dry period (ADP) as the most significant predictor of pollutant concentration. Specifically, the College Station data show an unexpected result that <b>pollutant</b> event <b>mean</b> concentrations significantly decrease with increasing ADP for all analyzed pollutants. However, the runoff concentrations observed in Austin were not significantly correlated with ADP. The result from College Station data provides a different insight to the pollutant buildup and removal process on highways.

40|$|Urbanisation has {{produced}} {{an increase in}} impervious surfaces which is {{reducing the amount of}} storm water infiltration and increasing rapidly surface runoff. Urban storm water carries a variety of pollutants from activities on residential, commercial, and industrial land. There are several objectives that must be accomplished to meet the European Water Framework Directive, however to date, no clear guidelines or legislation have been established regarding storm water quality. Transition to sustainable approaches such as Best Management Practices (BMPs) and Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) is essential, especially {{in the face of an}} uncertain future with climate changes affecting the urban water system. The concentration and types of contaminants depends greatly on the type and intensity of activities and land use. By knowing the size of a catchment and the type of land use, it is possible to predict storm water run-off quantity. Subsequently, using generalised pollutant concentrations, it is possible to estimate the pollutant loads transported by the run-off to the receiving water bodies. The main objective of this study was to investigate the annual <b>pollutant</b> <b>mean</b> loads transported from a catchment to receiving water bodies. The study furthermore aimed at estimation of effects of climate change on pollutant loads. The case study was performed in the Luleå city centre located in the north part of Sweden with a cold climate condition. To perform the study, a GIS model was created with a total area of 230 hectares divided into 19 sub-catchments by using a Digital Elevation Model, an Orthophoto map, a storm water network map and a field study. Within each sub-catchment different kinds of land use were identified: roads, housing areas, parking areas, and green areas. As a result of this mapping, the pollution generated from the catchments was estimated as monthly and annual loads for today condition and also for future in periods of 2041 - 2070 and 2071 - 2100. Studied pollutants were heavy metals, such as Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd and some other pollutants including COD, Tot-P, Tot-N, and TSS. While this study roughly estimates the pollutant loads transported to near water bodies, there is a need for further studies to evaluate the values of the water bodies and the legislation to allow the BMP and WSUD recommendations to be realized. Further more it is needed to consider climate change effects. The result of this study shows that climate change will have positive effects in case of pollutants loads but it is needed to perform further study on that since there might be some factors which was ignored and could affect the condition.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the association between air pollution and the daily number of consultations due to upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in general outpatient clinics (GOPCs) in Hong Kong. METHODS: Daily data on the numbers of consultations due to URTIs in GOPCs, the concentrations of major air <b>pollutants,</b> and the <b>mean</b> values of metrological variables were retrospectively collected over a 3 -year period (2008 - 2010, inclusive).

40|$|As local {{authorities}} {{are becoming more}} interested in the assessment of pollutant loads, this study offers a Geographic Information System (GIS) model for assessing nonpoint source of pollution for two scenarios: the current and ultimate stage of urbanization. The Puhinui Catchment, Manukau City, {{has been used as a}} case study in developing and testing this model. This catchment has all the attributes of a "typical" urban area and gives a good representation of the effects of land use on the receiving waters of Puhinui Stream and its estuary. Annual mass contaminant loadings were calculated by firstly assessing the physical characteristics of the Puhinui catchment (case study catchment) and secondly describing the nature of storm water quality and calculating the annual mass contaminant loadings. GIS is used to multiply the annual runoff volume by a <b>mean</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentration to acquire an average annual pollutant load. The annual runoff volume is calculated from the drainage area, runoff coefficient and annual rainfall. To calculate the total <b>mean</b> <b>pollutant</b> load, the pollutant loads for all land use types within the catchment are summed and the process is applied for each pollutant. This GIS model determines the connection of typical pollutant concentrations with land uses in the catchment and offers a characterisation of nonpoint source pollution in that catchment. This model can be used for, identifying catchment areas that contribute considerably to the pollution of waterways, determining the appropriate treatment of the storm water runoff for particular sub catchment, storm water quality improvement prioritization and cost-benefit analysis, selecting locations for water-quality monitoring stations, improvement in maintenance practices, assessment of proposed development environmental effects...|$|R

The analysis regressed daily PEFR on pollutant level adjusting for confounders and serial correlation and calculated a weighted pooled estimate of effect overall for each pollutant. In addition, large decrements in PEFR were analysed as a binary outcome. Same day, lag 1, lag 2, and a five day average of pollutant levels were used. RESULTS: There were no clear effects of any <b>pollutant</b> on <b>mean</b> PEFR. In addition, we analysed large PEFR decrements (a binary outcome), observing consistent negative associations with NO 2, SO 42 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 2, and PM 10, although few lag/pollutant combinations were significant: odds ratios (95...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to verify}} the effect of {{physically}} removing the outer surface of contaminated concrete on total contents and on potential mobility of <b>pollutants</b> by <b>means</b> of leaching tests. Reclaimed concrete from 3 industrial sites in Sweden were included: A tar impregnated military storage, a military tar track-depot, as well as concrete constructions used for disposing of pesticide production surplus and residues. Solid materials and leachates from batch and column leaching tests were analysed for metals, Cl, F, SO 4, DOC and contents of suspected organic compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAH, and pesticides/substances for pesticide production such as phenoxy acids, chlorophenols and chlorocresols, respectively). In case of PAH contaminated concrete, results indicate that removing 1 or 5 mm of the surface lead to total concentrations below the Swedish guidelines for recycling of aggregates and soil in groundwork constructions. 3 out of 4 concrete samples contaminated with pesticides fulfilled Swedish guidelines for contaminated soil. Results from batch and column leaching tests indicated, however, that concentrations above environmental quality standards for certain PAH and phenoxy acids, respectively, might occur at site when the crushed concrete is recycled in groundwork constructions. As leaching tests engaged in the study deviated from leaching test standards with {{a limited number of}} samples, the potential impact of the leaching tests' equipment on measured PAH and pesticide leachate concentrations has to be evaluated in future work...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation of particles, gases, and vapors from {{environmental}} pollution {{results in a}} number of localized and general responses by the lungs. In this article we report investigations performed in humans that have enabled the identification of these specific processes in response to inhaled materials. We also offer insights that could help generalize environmental inhaled <b>pollutants</b> and potential <b>means</b> of studying them in humans. Three specific areas are covered: impact of denervation of the lungs and airway inflammation on the acute defense mechanism of the lungs to inhaled "irritants," differential uptake of inhaled particles into separate regions of the lungs, and the effect of inhaled nitric oxide on pulmonary vasculature and gas exchange. The inhalation of nitric oxide reflects the potential of inhaled pollutants to influence gas exchange, especially in patients with established lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease...|$|R
40|$|A real {{petroleum}} refinery wastewater, containing {{a range of}} aliphatic and aromatic organic compounds, was treated using nanotitania particles, as the photocatalyst in UV/TiO 2 process. Samples were collected from the inlet point of the biological treatment unit. A conic-shape, circulating, and upward mixing reactor, without dead zone, was employed. The light source was an immersed mercury UV lamp (400 [*]W, 200 – 550 [*]nm). Optimal suspended catalyst concentration, fluid pH, and temperature were obtained at amounts of near 100 [*]mg·L− 1, 3 and 45 °C, respectively. A maximum reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) of more than 78 % was achieved after about 120 [*]min and, hence, 72 % after only 90 [*]min. Significant pollutant degradation was also relevant under other conditions. The identification analysis of the organic <b>pollutants,</b> provided by <b>means</b> of a GC/MS, equipped with headspace injection technique, showed that different petroleum compounds were degraded with high efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Several dichotomous-response {{models of}} {{carcinogenesis}} are discussed and their implications for low-dose risk estimation are examined. In addition, a pharmacokinetic model incorporating non-linear kinetics is studied {{and the results}} are investigated with respect to multiple-pollutant exposures. None of these models appears to suggest the existence of "thresholds". The analysis of both linear and nonlinear models indicates that if background concentrations are present, then under almost all models discussed, the marginal response associated with the new carcinogen increases more linearly with dose. The results of the study are then examined with respect to dispersal of carcinogenic <b>pollutants</b> as a <b>means</b> of reducing environmental hazards to a given population. It was then concluded that dispersal may not reduce the overall risk if linear or near-linear dose-response relationships are assumed. A conceptual experimental design is also presented to investigate a general relationship between dispersal and total population incidence...|$|R
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} variability of SO 2, NO 2, NOx, PM 10 and {{total suspended particles}} (TSP) concentrations in Lanzhou, China is analyzed using the observational data collected from October 1999 to April 2001. The concentrations of SO 2, NO 2, NOx are within the national second-standard level of air quality in spring, summer and fall, but much worse in winter, reaching low to mid alert level of air pollution. Since 1999, the concentrations of SO 2, NO 2, and NOx have been decreasing. However, the concentrations of PM 10 and TSP have been increasing, and become major <b>pollutants.</b> The <b>mean</b> concentration of PM 10 is 2. 56 mg m- 3. Even in summer the air pollution due to PM 10 is at low alert level. The rate of polluted-day occurrence is 71 % in a year, 89 % in winter, and 79 % in spring. Starting from November, the air pollution due to PM 10 intensifies, and reaches mid to high alert level of air pollution, and continues until April next year. The mean concentration of TSP is 5. 92 mg m- 3, which {{is higher than the}} air quality standard. In winter and spring, the TSP concentration is 2 - 10 times higher than the third-standard level of air quality. Intrinsic factors and exterior preconditions for increase of PM 10 and TSP are discussed such as the propagation of dust storms.
