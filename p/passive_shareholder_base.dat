40|$|This paper uses {{a sample}} of 4, 410 firms from 29 {{countries}} to investigate the relation between corporate governance and the <b>shareholder</b> <b>base.</b> In contrast to previous work, our results strongly {{support the notion that}} poor corporate governance, at both the firm and country level, negatively impacts the willingness of foreign investors to hold a firm's equity. Specifically, we find that firms whose managers have sufficiently high control rights that they may reasonably be expected to expropriate minority equity investors attract significantly less U. S. investment, especially in countries with poor external governance. Our findings suggest that the prices U. S. investors are asked to pay for firms with poor governance are not low enough to fully compensate them for expected expropriation or increased estimation risk associated with expected poor disclosure by these firms. Because prior research shows that a smaller <b>shareholder</b> <b>base</b> is associated with a lower firm value, our results are consistent with the notion that the <b>shareholder</b> <b>base</b> represents an important channel through which poor expected corporate governance contributes to a reduction in firm value.

50|$|Whilst CSR {{strategies}} have been intensively adopted by large and publicly visible corporations, {{the effectiveness of}} this type of social regulation with SMEs remains questionable. This is partly due to their size, as their smaller-scale activities are less visible within society. It is thought that many larger firms develop CSR strategies voluntarily to avoid disclosure for bad practice and to maintain and develop a <b>shareholder</b> <b>base.</b> Small firms however are not subject to the same incentives for practicing CSR. This is because they are defined by a limited <b>shareholder</b> <b>base</b> and are unlikely to exhibit environmental and social bad practice on a scale worthy of media attention. These ideas are exemplified in a study by Lynch-Wood and Williamson which has suggested that SME environmental practice is driven by ‘business performance’ and ‘regulation’, rather than the ‘business case’ (i.e. maintaining and improving <b>shareholder</b> <b>base)</b> which CSR practice stems from. It is also apparent that smaller firms may not have the available financial resources for pursuing costly CSR strategies (CSR programmes typically involving funding community projects).|$|R

40|$|The {{shareholder}} {{composition of}} listed property companies {{has changed from}} the fragmented, retail ownership, to more concentrated, institutional ownership over the past decade. In this paper, we first document significant variation {{in the composition of}} the <b>shareholder</b> <b>base</b> across the world's five largest listed property markets. We then examine the relation between the composition of the <b>shareholder</b> <b>base</b> and stock market performance and share turnover during the turbulent trading days of 2008 and 2009. By directly relating the <b>shareholder</b> <b>base</b> of firms to excess returns and turnover on these volatile days, we are able to isolate the importance of shareholder composition during periods when trading behavior is most likely to vary across different types of shareholders. We find that both large block holdings and high levels of institutional ownership decrease trading volumes and moderate stock returns; however, the effects largely occur when stock prices move sharply downward. Moreover, these effects are strongest when ownership concentration and institutional ownership exceed 25 percent. We also find that the disaggregation of institutional investors into distinct categories (banks, pension funds, advisors, etc.) increases our understanding of stock trading and share price dynamics of listed property companies...|$|R

While retail investors are typically also minority shareholders and therefore perceived in academic literature to have limited influence on corporate dividend decisions, casual empiricism suggests the contrary.

Our results are robust when controlled for the factors of size, profitability, financial leverage, signalling, agency costs and franking credits.

40|$|We analyze a publicly-traded firm’s {{decision}} to stay public or go private when managerial autonomy from shareholder intervention affects the supply of productive inputs by management. We show that both the advantage and the disadvantage of public ownership relative to private ownership lie in the liquidity of public ownership. While the liquidity of public ownership lets shareholders trade easily and supply capital at a lower cost, the liquidity-engendered trading also results in stochastic shocks to a firm’s <b>shareholder</b> <b>base.</b> This exposes management to uncertainty regarding the identity of future shareholders and their extent of intervention in management decisions and in turn curtails managerial incentives. By contrast, because of its illiquidity, private ownership provides a stable <b>shareholder</b> <b>base</b> and improves these input provision incentives but results in a higher cost of capital. Thus, capital market liquidity, while being a principal advantage of public ownership, also has a surprising 'dark side' that discourages public ownership. Our model takes seriously a key difference between private and public equity markets in that, unlike the private market, the firm’s <b>shareholder</b> <b>base,</b> namely the extent of investor participation, is stochastic in the public market. This allows us to extract predictions {{about the effects of}} investor participation on the stock price level and volatility and on the public firm’s incentives to go private, thereby providing a link between investor participation and firm participation in public markets. Lesser investor participation induces lower and more volatile stock prices, encouraging public firms to go private, whereas greater investor participation encourages younger firms to go public. Moreover, IPO underpricing is optimal because it is shown to lead to a higher and less volatile post-IPO stock price, greater autonomy for the manager and a higher supply of privately-costly managerial inputs. corporate finance...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze a publicly-traded firm’s {{decision}} to stay public or go private in a setting in which managerial autonomy from shareholder intervention affects the supply of productive inputs by management. With public ownership, the <b>shareholder</b> <b>base</b> of the firm is subject to stochastic shocks as market liquidity facilitates active trading.

Thus, capital market liquidity has a surprising “dark side ” that discourages public ownership.

40|$|In IPO market, {{the theory}} of {{liquidity}} as proposed by Booth and Chua (1996) suggest that higher initial return drives the broadness of <b>shareholder</b> <b>base</b> and thus may enhance post-listing liquidity of {{an initial public offering}} (IPO) stocks. Based on that hypothesis, this paper examines the sample of 299 Bursa Malaysia IPOs for years 1998 - 2008 and finds that market adjusted initial return has significant positive predictive power on broadness of initial <b>shareholder</b> <b>base.</b> Market adjusted initial return is positively correlated with the breadth of shareholders and negatively correlated with the proportion of five largest and non-block institutional shareholders. IPO companies with sizeable number of shareholders tend to have higher post-listing liquidity whereas the proportion of block-holders and five largest shareholders adversely affect the secondary market liquidity. These results provide evidence to Booth and Chua’s hypothesis. Initial return also has a direct positive effect on post-listing liquidity. The positive relationship between initial return and post-listing liquidity is stronger for IPO stock with ownership by government link corporations (GLCs). Concentrated ownership structure in GLC IPOs has negative effect on their trading turnover but greater liquidity is achieved through lower transaction cost...|$|R
