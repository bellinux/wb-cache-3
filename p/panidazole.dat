40|$|Tube-dilution MICs {{of seven}} 2 -methyl- 5 -nitroimidazole {{compounds}} varying at the 1 -substitution were determined against Bacteroides fragilis. Activities on a molar basis were ranked: tinidazole greater than <b>panidazole</b> {{greater than or}}nidazole greater than metronidazole {{greater than or equal}} to secnidazole greater than carnidazole greater than dimetridazole. Geometric mean MICs varied from 0. 5 to 6. 6 microM, and MICs against individual strains varied up to 50 -fold between compounds. In general, the MIC of each drug correlated with that of each of the other drugs, but with tinidazole the correlation coefficients tended to be small and were not significant versus metronidazole and secnidazole. MICs against 14 other bacteria of the B. fragilis group, including B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, and B. vulgatus, were within the range determined for B. fragilis...|$|E
