Safety was assessed by blood sampling before and after the preparation and by a 30 -day postcolonoscopy chart and complication database review. Acceptance was investigated by questionnaires, and the adequacy of bowel preparation was assessed by the Aronchick and Ottawa scales. One hundred eighty-eight patients, 98 in the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C group and 90 in the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution group, participated. Although changes in bicarbonate blood concentrations with <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C were seen {{to such an extent that}} the blinded investigator correctly guessed the preparation in 75. 6 %, no unsafe values were observed. A 30 -day chart and complication database review revealed 1 severe adverse event of a myocardial infarction in the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C group. Patient acceptance and compliance were significantly higher with the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C group. The impact on sleep, daily activities, and physical complaints were similar in both groups. <b>Polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C was noninferior to <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution in cleansing efficacy, but the segmental rating of excellent and good preparation in right and transverse colon was significantly better for <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution, especially when taken as a split dose.
