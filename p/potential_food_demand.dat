The genetic diversity between subspecies of sorghum makes it more resistant to pests and pathogens than other less diverse food sources. In addition, it is highly efficient in converting solar energy to chemical energy, and also in usage of water.  All of these characteristics make it a promising candidate to help meet the increasing global <b>food</b> <b>demand.</b> As such, many groups {{around the world are}} pursuing research initiatives around sorghum (specifically Sorghum bicolor): Purdue University , HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, Danforth Plant Science Center, and the University of Nebraska, among others.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{theoretical}} {{literature on the}} relationship between income distribution and <b>food</b> <b>demand,</b> and identifies main gaps of current food modelling techniques that affect the accuracy of <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> projections. At the heart of the relationship between income distribution and <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> is Engel's law. Engel's law establishes that as income increases, households' <b>demand</b> for <b>food</b> increases less than proportionally. A consequence of this law is that the particular shape of the distribution of income across individuals and countries affects the rate of growth of <b>food</b> <b>demand.</b> Our review of the literature suggests that existing models of <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> fail to incorporate the required Engel flexibility when (i) aggregating different food budget shares among households; and (ii) changing budget shares as income grows. We perform simple simulations to predict growth in <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> under alternative income distribution scenarios taking into account nonlinearity of <b>food</b> <b>demand.</b> Results suggest that (i) distributional effects are to be expected from changes in between-countries inequality, rather than within-country inequality; and (ii) simulations of an optimistic and a pessimistic scenario of income inequality suggest that world <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> in 2050 would be 2. 7 per cent higher and 5. 4 per cent lower than distributional-neutral growth, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> of a clam population (Ruditapes philippinarum (Adams & Reeve 1850)) and the isotopic contributions of <b>potential</b> <b>food</b> sources (phytoplankton, benthic diatoms, and organic matter derived from the sediment surface, seagrass, and seaweeds) to the clam diet were investigated. In particular, we investigated {{the manner in which}} dense patches of clams with high secondary productivity are sustained in a coastal lagoon ecosystem (Hichirippu Lagoon) in Hokkaido, Japan. Clam feeding behavior should affect material circulation in this lagoon owing to their high secondary productivity (ca. 130 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1)). Phytoplankton were initially found to constitute 14 - 77 % of the clam diet, although phytoplankton nitrogen content (1. 79 - 4. 48 kmol N) and the <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> of the clam (16. 2 kmol N d(- 1)) suggest that phytoplankton can constitute only up to 28 % of clam dietary demands. However, use of isotopic signatures alone may be misleading. For example, the contribution of microphytobenthos (MPB) were estimated to be 0 - 68 % on the basis of isotopic signatures but was subsequently shown to be 35 +/- 13 % (mean +/- S. D.) and 64 +/- 4 % (mean +/- S. D.) on the basis of phytoplankton biomass and clam <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> respectively, suggesting that MPB are the primary food source for clams. Thus, in the present study, the abundant MPB in the subtidal area appear to be a key food source for clams, suggesting that these MPB may sustain the high secondary production of the clam...|$|R

40|$|Many {{aspects of}} {{economic}} policy formulation and strategic industry planning in the food sector require estimates of <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> elasticities. Despite this central place in economic policy, there is a dearth of recent elasticity estimates of Australian <b>food</b> <b>demand.</b> This {{is a major problem}} because the use of dated elasticity estimates in policy analysis could lead to misleading results. This study presents disaggregated <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> elasticities for Australia using data drawn from the latest two national Household Expenditure Surveys covering the period 1998 / 99 and 2003 / 04. Adopting an Almost Ideal Demand System approach, a <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> system is estimated for 15 food categories, which cover {{a significant portion of the}} food items in households’ shopping lists. Own-price, cross-price and expenditure elasticity estimates have been derived for all categories. Elasticities for households with Australian-born heads are also computed.

However, consumers typically associate attributes such as e. g. healthiness and environment friendliness with organic variants of most types of food.

In this paper we utilize a unique Danish micro panel where all <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> is registered on a disaggregated level with an organic/non-organic indicator to estimate a general <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> system with organic variants.

We compute <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> elasticities using a method of cointegration that is shown to apply to a convenient but nonlinear functional form. Estimates are based on consumer reported expenditure data rather than commercial disappearance data. Key words: cointegration, <b>food</b> <b>demand,</b> generalized composite commodity theorem, nonlinear models. Appropriately specified models of consumer demand are central to market analysis. It has been established that a valid equilibrium for markets characterized by diverse firms or diverse consumer products depends on downward-sloping composite demand curves (Heiner, Braulke, Wohlgenant) or on valid indirect utility functions (Chavas and Cox). Given {{the large number of}} consumer <b>food</b> products, <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> and price analysis must be implemented at some level of product ag-gregation. Improper aggregation can lead to biased estimates of welfare loss associated with public policies, biased estimates of consumer and derived demand elasticities, and mislead-ing tests of market power. Testing for con-sistent aggregation over food products and estimating aggregate consumer <b>food</b> <b>demand</b> elasticities are the subjects of this article. By far, the most common justification for aggregation has been separable preferences. One reason for its popularity has been the lack of a viable alternative. Tests of the Com-posite Commodity Theorem (Hicks, Leontief, Lewbel) are always rejected because it restricts relative prices within a group to remain fixed over time.
