The PIAT was often also used in combat to knock out enemy positions located in houses and bunkers. It was possible to use the PIAT as a crude mortar by placing the shoulder <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> the weapon on the ground and supporting it.|$|E
5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest {{is little more}} than a <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E

5|$|Most mammals have agouti hair, {{with each}} {{individual}} hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to {{two different types}} of melanin pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.|$|E

25|$|Rove beetles of {{the genus}} Stenus are very {{interesting}} insects. They are specialist predators of small invertebrates such as collembola. Their labium can shoot out from the head using blood pressure. The thin rod of the labium ends in a <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> bristly hairs and hooks and between these hairs are small pores that exude an adhesive glue-like substance, which sticks to prey.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses can be {{mechanically}} cleaned of {{more substantial}} protein, lipid and debris build up by rubbing them between the clean <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> a finger and {{the palm of}} a hand, using {{a small amount of}} cleaning fluid as a lubricant.

40|$|Many insects bear leg {{attachment}} pads {{that have}} an excellent ability to adhere to a smooth surface. There are two alternative designs of such systems (Gorb and Beutel, 2001; Beutel and Gorb, 2001). <b>Pads</b> <b>of</b> flies, beetles and earwigs are covered by relatively long deformable setae which, due to the individual bending, {{increase the number of}} contact points with the surface. The second type <b>of</b> <b>pads,</b> so-called smooth systems, such as arolia and euplantulae, occurring in cockroaches, bees, grasshoppers and bugs, are soft deformable structures with a relatively smooth surface (Jiao et al., 2000). <b>Pads</b> <b>of</b> this type are composed of a very compliant material, which adapts to the surface profile and can increase the area of real contact (Gorb et al., 2000 b). There is also evidence that the non-volatile pad secretion is an essential factor for attachment to smooth substrata with both types of systems (Edwards and Tarkanian, 1970; Dixon et al., 1990; Vötsch et al., 2002). Attachment forces on smooth surfaces have been previously measured on the hairy adhesive <b>pads</b> <b>of</b> reduviid bugs (Edwards and Tarkanian, 1970), flies (Walker et al., 1985; Gorb et al., 2001 a), beetles (Stork, 1980; Ishii, 1987), and on the smooth <b>pads</b> <b>of</b> cockroaches (Roth and Willis, 1952) ...|$|R
25|$|PSLV-C6 was {{the sixth}} {{operational}} launch and overall ninth {{mission of the}} PSLV program. This launch was also the fifty-fourth launch by Indian Space Research Organisation since its first mission on 1 January 1962. The vehicle carried and injected India's two satellites; Cartosat-1 (a.k.a. IRS-P5) and HAMSAT into the Sun-synchronous orbit. PSLV-C6 was launched at 04:44 hours Coordinated Universal Time (10:14 hours Indian Standard Time) on 5 May 2005 from the second launch <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{the distal}} pads are wider {{than in other}} {{primates}} because the soft tissues of the finger tip are attached to a horseshoe-shaped edge on the underlying bone, and, in the grasping hand, the distal pads can therefore conform to uneven surfaces while pressure is distributed more evenly in the finger tips. The distal <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> the human thumb is divided into a proximal and a distal compartment, the former more deformable than the latter, which allows the thumb pad to mold around an object.|$|E
25|$|Traditional folding knives {{are opened}} using nail-nicks, or slots where the user's {{fingernail}} would enter {{to pull the}} blade out of the handle. This became somewhat cumbersome and required use of two hands, so there were innovations to remedy that. The thumb-stud, a small stud on the blade that allows for one-handed opening, led the way for more innovations. One of these being the thumb hole: a Spyderco patent where the user presses the <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> the thumb against a hole and opens the blade by rotating the thumb similarly to using the thumb-stud.|$|E

The first official equipment issued was similarly crude; a <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> material, usually impregnated with a chemical, tied over the lower face.

25|$|Contact lenses are {{typically}} {{inserted into the}} eye by placing them on the <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may {{be placed on the}} sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes and then look towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.|$|E
25|$|Insects gain kinetic energy, {{provided}} by the muscles, when they accelerate. When the wings begin to decelerate {{toward the end of}} the stroke, this energy must dissipate. During the downstroke, the kinetic energy is dissipated by the muscles themselves and is converted into heat (this heat is sometimes used to maintain core body temperature). Some insects are able to utilize the kinetic energy in the upward movement of the wings to aid in their flight. The wing joints of these insects contain a <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> elastic, rubber-like protein called resilin. During the upstroke of the wing, the resilin is stretched. The kinetic energy of the wing is converted into potential energy in the stretched resilin, which stores the energy much like a spring. When the wing moves down, this energy is released and aids in the downstroke.|$|E
