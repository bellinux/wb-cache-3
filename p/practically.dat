5|$|Attributive Adjectives {{after the}} noun they modify, and inflect for number and gender. Adjectives may also occur alone, {{in which case}} they become an NP. <b>Practically</b> all {{adjectives}} also have a verbal form used for predicative purposes, which behaves just like a normal verb.|$|E
5|$|Balinor {{returns to}} Tyrsis to {{activate}} the Border Legion {{only to find that}} it has been disbanded. Balinor is then imprisoned by his insane brother Palance Buckhannah, who has taken control of Callahorn's rule. His advisor, Stenmin, has driven Palance insane with drugs, making him his pawn. With help from Menion, Balinor escapes and confronts both Palance and Stenmin. <b>Practically</b> cornered, Stenmin stabs Palance as a distraction and flees.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly larvae, or {{caterpillars}}, consume plant {{leaves and}} spend <b>practically</b> {{all of their}} time searching for and eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous, eating ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|Coastguards were {{stationed}} at Reculver from {{the mid-19th century}} until they were withdrawn in the mid-20th century, but the towers of the ruined church remain a landmark for mariners, both <b>practically</b> and through their use to mark the division between areas covered by Thames Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) and Dover MRCC.|$|E
5|$|Current {{preclinical}} {{tests show}} that the SEGRAMs available so far would elicit fewer side effect or at least less grave side effects than classic glucocorticoids would. For example, skin atrophy in rats was significantly less pronounced than under prednisolone in a study using the SEGRAM Mapracorat, and metabolic effects like weight gain or increase of blood glucose were <b>practically</b> inexistent.|$|E
5|$|Curse of Enchantia was Core Design's {{first attempt}} in the {{adventure}} genre as {{they set up}} to compete with LucasArts and Sierra On-Line. The game features several highly unconventional and controversial game mechanics and design choices for an adventure title from that era, including having many simple action game style sequences and being <b>practically</b> devoid of in-game text and conversations.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{the work}} has two large concerto {{movements}} for organ and orchestra, probably from a lost concerto for keyboard, oboe or violin, perhaps indicating that the cantata was composed for a seasonal choral absentia at Thomaskirche. The first nine bars of the opening sinfonia are <b>practically</b> identical to the fragment BWV 1059.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{has a few}} {{advantages}} over DisplayPort, such as ability to carry Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) signals, and electrical compatibility with DVI (though <b>practically</b> limited to single-link DVI rates). Also, HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length and there are certification programs to ensure this; DisplayPort cables, conversely, don't ensure full bandwidth beyond 3 meters.|$|E
5|$|If the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of uranium was poorly understood, that of plutonium was <b>practically</b> unknown, {{as it had}} only existed in microscopic amounts. Samples began arriving from the reactors in 1943, and although the locus of the Manhattan Project's investigations into plutonium chemistry was at the Metallurgical Laboratory, the Ames Project investigated methods of separating plutonium metal from uranium and fission products.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the {{movement}} of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback. However, vehicular access to the summit was <b>practically</b> impossible until {{the construction of a}} road in 1964, and it continues to be restricted. Today, multiple trails to the summit exist, in various states of use.|$|E
5|$|M. p. orpheus (Linnaeus, 1758) {{from the}} Bahamas to the Greater Antilles, also the Cayman and Virgin Islands. Similar to M. m. polyglottos except smaller, a paler {{shade of gray}} on its back, and underparts with <b>practically</b> little, if any buff at all.|$|E
5|$|Mustafa Kemal the {{commander}} of the Seventh Army reported to Liman that his army had repulsed <b>practically</b> all attacks on its front, but was about to withdraw to its second-line position between Kefar Haris and Iskaka, to conform with von Oppen's Asia Corps (Eighth Army) retirement.|$|E
5|$|On Warner's {{train ride}} to Ithaca (the site of Cornell), he met Carl Johanson, then Cornell's {{football}} coach, who {{was impressed by}} Warner's weight (200 pounds). Johanson <b>practically</b> ordered Warner to attend practice. This happened even though Warner {{admitted that he had}} never handled a real football.|$|E
5|$|<b>Practically,</b> several {{immunodiagnostic}} methods {{based on}} detection of complex antigen-antibody {{are used to}} diagnose infectious diseases, for example ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blot, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, and magnetic immunoassay. Antibodies raised against human chorionic gonadotropin are used in over the counter pregnancy tests.|$|E
5|$|Princeton University {{built the}} chapel {{to replace the}} Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it {{burned to the ground}} in 1920. The {{location}} for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel would rise from the ashes of the old one, and <b>practically,</b> it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward.|$|E
5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is <b>practically</b> harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the digestive system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{conceptual}} issues around throffers are <b>practically</b> {{applied in}} studies {{in a number}} of areas, but the term is also used outside of academia. For instance, it has seen use in British policing and in British courts.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} how the bonding of two lovers can become so strong that they <b>practically</b> become one entity, through the act of sexual intercourse. Apart from the sexual connotations, there is an {{aspirational}} undercurrent to the lyrics, and like many of their subsequent songs, desire is explicitly linked to ambition–"Free your mind of doubt and danger/Be for real don't be a stranger/We can achieve it/We can achieve it".|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of 14N and 15N is <b>practically</b> constant {{in the atmosphere}} but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox reactions and the evaporation of natural ammonia or nitric acid. Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions typically result in 15N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product.|$|E
5|$|There were at most 20,000 comfort women. None of {{them were}} {{forcibly}} recruited. Forty percent {{of them were}} from Japan, the most heavily represented nation. Many were sold to brokers by their parents. Some responded willingly to brokers' offers; others were deceived. I would add that, on the average, living conditions in the comfort stations were <b>practically</b> identical to those in brothels set up for American troops during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|This pan-Germanic Empire was {{expected}} to assimilate <b>practically</b> all of Germanic Europe into an enormously expanded Reich. Territorially speaking, this encompassed the already-enlarged German Reich itself (consisting of pre-1938 Germany proper, Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Alsace-Lorraine, Eupen-Malmedy, Memel, Lower Styria, Upper Carniola, Southern Carinthia and German-occupied Poland), the Netherlands, the Flemish part of Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, at least the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Liechtenstein.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{much older}} than 10,000 years would be <b>practically</b> {{impossible}} in Sweden, because until around 11,000 years ago the area was {{in the grip of}} a world-wide ice age. Nature conservancy authorities considered putting a fence around the tree to protect it from possible vandals or trophy hunters.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{physical}} {{difference between}} these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is <b>practically</b> transparent to thermal neutrons, and {{it is commonly used}} for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a <b>practically</b> single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E
5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl, they have <b>practically</b> no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More <b>practically,</b> the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
5|$|Danzig had {{remained}} <b>practically</b> autonomous and adamant about protecting its status and foreign trade monopoly. The Karnkowski Statutes of 1570 gave Polish kings the control over maritime commerce, {{but not even}} Stephen Báthory, who resorted to an armed intervention against the city, was able to enforce them. Other Polish cities held steady and prosperous through {{the first half of}} the 17th century. War disasters in the middle of that century devastated the urban classes.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple was <b>practically</b> {{ignored by}} the music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced {{up and down on}} the Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close to the success of its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's {{financial}} problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E
5|$|During the 1768 Sejm, Repnin {{showed his}} {{disregard}} for local resistance by arranging the abduction and imprisonment of Kajetan Sołtyk, Józef A. Załuski, Wacław Rzewuski and Seweryn Rzewuski, all vocal opponents of foreign domination and the recently proclaimed policies. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had legally and <b>practically</b> become a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Nonetheless, several minor beneficial reforms were adopted, political {{rights of the}} religious minorities were restored {{and the need for}} more reforms was becoming increasingly recognized.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the Taylor Report in January 1990, Sunderland was obliged to make plans to turn their Roker Park home into an all-seater stadium. Roker Park was a ground that mainly {{consisted}} of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held far fewer spectators than before. Enclosed by residential streets on all sides, expansion was <b>practically</b> impossible. So, by 1991, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray began investigating the possibility of relocation to a new stadium.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, an {{experiment}} showed that when natural 209Bi is bombarded with neutrons, 210Bi is created, which then decays to 210Po via beta-minus decay. The final purification is done pyrochemically followed by liquid-liquid extraction techniques. Polonium {{may now be}} made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in nuclear reactors. Only about 100grams are produced each year, <b>practically</b> all of it in Russia, making polonium exceedingly rare.|$|E
5|$|In June 1776, American Patriot {{officers}} Henry Knox, Nathanael Greene, William Heath, and Israel Putnam {{examined the}} terrain on which Fort Washington would be located; {{they agreed that}} if the fort was properly fortified, it would be <b>practically</b> impossible to take. Later in June, the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, George Washington, inspected the location and determined that the area {{was the key to}} defense of the lower Hudson. Shortly after Washington's survey, troops from Pennsylvania began construction on the fort under the supervision of Rufus Putnam.|$|E
5|$|In early 1962 Nasser again {{attempted}} to wrest {{control of the}} military command from Amer. Amer responded by directly confronting Nasser {{for the first time and}} secretly rallying his loyalist officers. Nasser ultimately backed down, wary of a possible violent confrontation between the military and his civilian government. According to Boghdadi, the stress caused by the UAR's collapse and Amer's increasing autonomy forced Nasser, who already had diabetes, to <b>practically</b> live on painkillers from then on.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England <b>practically</b> killed the woollen trade. At the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt another blow to the trade of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which {{contained}} ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth, and religious convictions were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in <b>practically</b> all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred {{critique of the}} political system and proposals to reform this system to the delusional construct. Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and <b>practically</b> coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
