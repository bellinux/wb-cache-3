5|$|Wiesenthal {{learned from}} a letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that {{information}} to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. Fritz Bauer, <b>prosecutor-general</b> {{of the state of}} Hesse in West Germany, received independent confirmation of Eichmann's whereabouts in 1957, but German agents were unable to find him until late 1959. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family, as Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance and there were no current photos of the fugitive. He provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February. Zvi Aharoni, one of the Mossad agents responsible for Eichmann's capture in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960, said the photos were useful in confirming Eichmann's identity. On 23 May Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann was under arrest and in Israel. The next day Wiesenthal, while he was being interviewed by reporters, received a congratulatory telegram from Yad Vashem. He immediately became a minor celebrity, and began work on a book about his experiences. Ich jagte Eichmann: Tatsachenbericht (I Chased Eichmann: A True Story) was published six weeks before the trial opened in spring 1961. Wiesenthal helped the prosecution prepare their case and attended a portion of the trial. Eichmann was sentenced to death and was hanged on 1 June 1962.|$|E

25|$|In March 1990, {{after the}} Romanian Revolution toppled Ceauşescu, an inquiry was {{opened on the}} {{circumstances}} of his death, after a request was filed by Ursu's sister Georgeta Berdan. It found that Ursu {{died as a result of}} injury to the abdomen, caused by the many blows he received. The result incriminated Communist cadres who still had a career as police chiefs after 1989. The supervisor for the inquiry, Dan Voinea, had led the prosecution at Ceauşescu's trial of 1989 (which ended with the Communist leader's execution). Voinea was replaced by Romania's <b>Prosecutor-General</b> soon after the results of his investigations became known.

500|$|Also {{instrumental}} in exposing Eichmann's identity was Lothar Hermann, a half-Jewish German who had emigrated to Argentina in 1938. When in 1956 Hermann's daughter Sylvia began dating {{a man named}} Klaus Eichmann who boasted about his father's Nazi exploits, Hermann alerted Fritz Bauer, <b>prosecutor-general</b> {{of the state of}} Hesse in West Germany. Sylvia, sent on a fact-finding mission, was met at the door by Eichmann himself, who said he was Klaus's uncle. Informed that Klaus was not home, she sat down to wait. When Klaus returned, he addressed Eichmann as [...] "Father". In 1957 Bauer passed along the information in person to Mossad director Isser Harel, who assigned operatives to undertake surveillance, but no concrete evidence was initially found. On 1 March 1960 Harel dispatched to Buenos Aires the Shin Bet chief interrogator Zvi Aharoni, who over the course of weeks of investigation was able to confirm the identity of the fugitive. As Argentina had a history of turning down extradition requests for Nazi criminals, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion made the decision that Eichmann should be captured rather than extradited, and brought to Israel for trial. Harel himself arrived in person in May 1960 to oversee the capture. Mossad operative Rafi Eitan was named leader of the eight-man team, most of whom were Shin Bet agents.|$|E

Shayakhmetov himself was removed from his post in August 2010 {{in the aftermath of the}} arrest of <b>Prosecutor-General's</b> Office official Murat Musabekov, who was fingered as allegedly plotting a coup in an anonymous letter allegedly circulated by NSC officers.

50|$|On 28 July 2017, the Uzbek <b>Prosecutor-General's</b> Office {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} she was in custody following a 2015 conviction and faces additional charges in an ongoing investigation, marking the first time authorities have revealed details about her.

She was also alleged to have acquired $595 million worth of assets and received $869.3 million in kickbacks that were paid into offshore accounts.|$|R
2500|$|However, <b>prosecutor-general</b> of East Timor, Longuinhos Monteiro, withdrew {{support for}} the {{indictment}} claiming there [...] "might be some defects".

2500|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War left Ukraine with 1,612 Kh-55's, part of the {{armament}} of the 19 Tu-160's of the 184th Heavy Bomber Regiment at Priluki and the 25 Tu-95MS of the 182nd Heavy Bomber Regiment at Uzin-Shepelovka. [...] It {{was reported}} that Ukraine demanded US$3bn {{for the return of}} the planes and their missiles to Russia. In October 1999 a compromise was reached that saw Russia pay US$285m for 11 aircraft and 575 missiles, whilst the rest were meant to be destroyed under a US-funded disarmament programme. However, in March 2005 Ukraine's <b>prosecutor-general</b> Svyatoslav Piskun said that in 2001, 12 Kh-55's had been exported to Iran in a deal allegedly worth [...] US$49.5 million and six to China.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Prosecutor-General's</b> Office - {{part of the}} {{government}} - exerted undue influence, with judges often not daring to rule against state prosecutors. Those who did faced disciplinary actions; when a Kiev court ruled for opposition politician Yulia Tymoshenko, the presiding judge was himself prosecuted. The courts were not even independent from each other, and it was commonplace for trial court judges to call the higher courts and ask how to decide a case. Courts were often underfunded, with little money or resources. It was not uncommon for cases to be heard in small, cramped courtrooms with the electricity cut off while prisoners were unable to attend because of lack of transport from jails to courtrooms.|$|R
5000|$|In Latvia, {{soon after}} its first {{screening}} at the Gothenburg Film Festival in February 2001, {{the film was}} seen as a purposeful attempt to distort the country's image given that it was supported by the Swedish Film Institute. Latvian President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga called the film [...] "political propaganda", Prime Minister Andris Bērziņš suggested that the country could file an international criminal case against the film's authors, and the <b>Prosecutor-General's</b> Office advised the Interior Ministry to ban Hollender from entering the country. TV3 Sweden, which aired the documentary twice, apologised to Latvians for its negative content. Hollender said in 2006 that despite having received two invitations, he has avoided visiting Latvia since the controversy.|$|R
