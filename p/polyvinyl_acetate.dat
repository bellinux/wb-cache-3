5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2).

Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E

This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change to a deeper yellow.

Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease.

For the case in which the two copolymers have a common monomer unit (e. g., B) the isothermal boundary between domains of miscibility and immiscibility in a mean field treatment is determined by three segmental interaction parameters, XAB, XAC, and XBC, and the degrees of polymerization r 1 and r 2 of the copolymers. We have termed such representations 2 ̆ 2 miscibility maps 2 ̆ 2. The shape and size of the miscibility domain are determined by the relationships between these parameters, and the present study considers the various theoretical possibilities with interpretations based on intersegmental repulsion and/ or attraction. In addition, two experimental miscibility maps for blends of <b>poly(vinyl</b> chloride-co-vinyl <b>acetate)</b> with chlorinated <b>poly(vinyl</b> chloride) (regarded here as a random copolymer of vinyl chloride and 1, 2 -di­chloroethylene units) and <b>poly(vinyl</b> chloride-co-vinyl <b>acetate)</b> with poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) were constructed by using as a criterion of miscibility the glass transition temperatures determined by scanning calorimetry.

This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not.

25|$|Solar {{cells are}} {{commonly}} encapsulated in a transparent polymeric resin {{to protect the}} delicate solar cell regions for coming into contact with moisture, dirt, ice, and other conditions expected either during operation or when used outdoors. The encapsulants are commonly made from <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light. Such encapsulants have included roughened glass surfaces, diffractive elements, prism arrays, air prisms, v-grooves, diffuse elements, as well as multi-directional waveguide arrays.

25|$|A {{thermoplastic}} synthetic wax resin mixture {{developed by}} John W Burke and Steve Colton in 1997 {{can be used}} to compensate losses in objects from translucent materials such as alabaster, marble, calcite, diorite, and anhydrite.

This wax resin is a better substitute to wax-resins because wax collects dust and dirt and make the fill noticeable. Polyester resin and epoxies are toxic and noxious. The wax-resin is fast and easy to use, making it a possible new alternative to fill materials in the conservation field. The wax-resin works best on losses that allow for large contact with the original, primed surface and on losses that are thicker than 1/16in. Shallow losses and small gaps are more difficult due to the ease in which the fill is pulled out.|$|E

500|$|The {{science of}} conserving fossil remains {{was in its}} infancy, and new {{techniques}} had to be improvised {{to deal with what}} soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue, finishing with a final layer of tin foil. Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.|$|E

40|$|The work {{discussed}} in this thesis was undertaken as project CE 81 of the extra mural group for the Directorate of Chemical Warfare. The general problem {{was to find a}} suitable thickener for mustard gas, such that the thickened solutions might be used in aircraft spray and in chemical shell. For aircraft spray a liquid was required which had a viscosity approximating 6 poises at l 0 °C.; for chemical shell, a viscosity of 12 poises at 10 °C. was necessary. The solution was to be stable up to temperatures as high as 140 °F. for periods longer than one year. In England, chlorinated rubber was found to be a satisfactory thickener for certain types of mustard, but the supply of this material was strictly limited by war conditions. For this reason other thickeners had to be found. In Canada, Shawinigan Chemicals Limited possess facilities for manufacturing <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetates</b> (Gelvas) of molecular weights from approximately 5000 to 150, 000, so it was decided to try these materials as possible substitutes.

The currently available range of materials all have linear backbone architectures with interesting solubility, rheological, and interfacial properties. The latter might be significantly broadened if complementary polymers with branched backbone architectures could be synthesized, {{especially if the}} methodology involved only minor changes from that currently practiced. We have now synthesized branched PVOHs via conventional free radical copolymerization of vinyl acetate (VAc) and triallyl-triazine-trione (TTT), in 2 -isopropoxy ethanol (IPE) solvent {{in the presence of}} appropriate thiol free radical chain transfer agents, followed by alcoholysis of the so-formed branched <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetates)</b> s (PVAc) s with methanol.

Final confirmation of the branched architecture of the PVOH samples has been made by reacetylation of some samples, in effect to regenerate their PVAc precursors. SEC analysis of the latter has indeed shown these to be architecturally very similar to the original precursor PVAcs.
