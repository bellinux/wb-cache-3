Book <b>packager</b> Mega-Books subsequently hired authors to write the main Nancy Drew series and a new series, The Nancy Drew Files.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Hardy Boys books {{began to}} be {{published}} in paperback rather than hardcover. Lawrence and Buranelli continued to write titles; other authors included Karl Harr III and Laurence Swinburne. In 1984, the rights to the series were sold, along with the Stratemeyer Syndicate, to Simon & Schuster. New York book <b>packager</b> Mega-Books subsequently hired authors to write the Hardy Boys Mystery Stories and a new series, the Hardy Boys Casefiles.|$|E

25|$|With Scaife as publisher, {{the small}} {{circulation}} newspaper {{was the chief}} <b>packager</b> of editorials and news columns claiming that then United States President Bill Clinton or his wife, then First Lady Hillary Clinton {{were responsible for the}} death of Deputy White House counsel Vince Foster. Scaife paid freelancer Christopher Ruddy to write about the Foster case for the Tribune-Review and other right-leaning media. Special Prosecutor Ken Starr, appointed to investigate Clinton, concluded Foster had, in fact, committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{known to}} fans and historians as the Silver Age of Comic Books, Simon and Kirby again reteamed for Harvey Comics in 1966, {{updating}} Fighting American {{for a single}} issue (Oct. 1966). Simon, as owner, <b>packager,</b> and editor, also helped launch Harvey's original superhero line, with Unearthly Spectaculars #1–3 (Oct. 1965 – March 1967) and Double-Dare Adventures #1–2 (Dec. 1966 – March 1967), the latter of which introduced the influential writer-artist Jim Steranko to comics.|$|E
25|$|The {{network and}} <b>packager</b> faced an unusual and {{potentially}} disturbing obstacle, however. The network slated Password {{to replace the}} cult soap Dark Shadows at 4:00 PM (3:00 Central) on April 5, 1971. Some of the more devoted Shadows fans threatened ABC with physical disruption of the first tapings of Password at the Hollywood studios. However, these plans apparently never materialized and ABC went ahead, managing strong results against NBC's Somerset and reruns of Gomer Pyle, USMC on CBS.|$|E

25|$|One Life to Live enjoyed fair-to-middling {{ratings in}} the 1960s, but rose rapidly as it entered the 1970s, {{along with the}} rest of ABC's daytime lineup. Matters greatly {{improved}} for One Life to Live in 1972, when CBS relocated Edge of Night in response to <b>packager</b> Procter and Gamble's demands. The four-year-old show topped the ratings for the first time over CBS' declining Secret Storm, and later, the game Hollywood's Talking, which ran for only 13 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Barry and Enright's careers {{went into}} eclipse after the scandal broke, though Barry did get some hosting and acting gigs and briefly collaborated on {{projects}} with game show <b>packager</b> Goodson-Todman Productions. Barry purchased {{a radio station}} in Redondo Beach, California, and in 1969 {{he made his first}} network comeback as an emcee, replacing Dennis Wholey on a short-lived prime-time game, The Generation Gap on ABC. Two years later he sold his first post-scandal game show, also to ABC, called The Reel Game, which he emceed as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, Baily {{founded the}} {{publishing}} company Baily Publications and, with artist Mac Raboy, the comics <b>packager</b> Bernard Baily Studio. The latter concern, which lasted through 1946, was the outsource producer of such comics as Cambridge House Publishers' single-issue Star Studded Comics and Gold Medal Comics (both 1945). Other publishers for whom his studio created comics included the Rural Home Publishing imprint Croyden; Jay Burtis; Narrative; Lindsay Baird; Feature Comics; Neal Publications; the Spotlight Comics imprint Novack '45; R.B. Leffingwell; and Holyoke Publications. Among the fledgling artists gaining {{a foothold in}} the industry at Baily's studio were Gil Kane, Carmine Infantino, and Frank Frazetta, who at 16 assisted the established artist John Giunta there. Other personnel included Dan Barry, Dick Briefer, Manny Stallman, and Nina Albright, {{one of a handful of}} Golden Age women comic-book artists.|$|E

50|$|The Conary toolchain {{includes}} rmake, a build server for conary packages, which builds packages inside chroot environments containing {{only the}} package's explicitly listed build requirements {{and some other}} fundamental packages. This is very useful for <b>packagers,</b> because it means that package builds can be done inside a reproducible environment, and <b>packagers</b> cannot accidentally introduce dependencies on peculiarities of their machine's environment (such as custom configuration files, or undocumented extra packages).|$|R
50|$|All {{packages}} are updated in a rolling release style, i.e. as updates are released upstream, or <b>packagers</b> get to them. Packages move between three {{branches of the}} foresight repositories, originating usually at the development branch or in the personal repositories of <b>packagers,</b> after which they are promoted to the Quality Assurance branch, and finally to the Stable branch, intended for users. Snapshots are taken every few months, and new ISO images are produced.|$|R

500|$|After Harriet Adams died in 1982, her protégé, Nancy Axelrad, oversaw {{production}} of the Nancy Drew books briefly before the Stratemeyer Syndicate was sold to Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster turned to book <b>packager</b> Mega-Books for new writers. The books and Nancy's character began to change as a result, although there is disagreement {{on the nature of}} this change. Some contend that Nancy's character becomes [...] "more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [...] since 1956." [...] Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and [...] " [...] of pre-feminist [...]" [...] For example, volume 78 in the series Update on Crime (1992) opens with Nancy wondering in italics, [...] "Am I or am I not in love with Ned Nickerson?" [...] Nancy begins dating other young men and acknowledges sexual desires: [...] "'I saw ... You don't have to apologize to me if some guy turns you on.' 'Gianni doesn't turn me on!...

2500|$|The {{basis of}} {{packaging}} design and performance is the component materials. [...] The physical properties, and sometimes chemical properties, {{of the materials}} need to be communicated to packaging engineers {{to aid in the}} design process. [...] Suppliers publish data sheets and other technical communications that include the typical or average relevant physical properties and the test method these are based upon. [...] Sometimes these are adequate. [...] Other times, additional material and component testing is required by the <b>packager</b> or supplier to better define certain characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|Only a few {{rail freight}} {{customers}} remain {{in or near}} Boston, including a chemical <b>packager</b> in Allston, and food distribution facilities and a scrap metal processor in Everett.

2500|$|In 1949, Eisner, in his {{sideline}} as a comics <b>packager,</b> {{created the}} feature [...] "Secret Files of Dr. Drew" [...] for Fiction House. Grandenetti said Eisner instructed him to draw it [...] "in the Eisner style. [...] Which I did, badly. [...] Anyway, {{after a couple}} of stories I began to do my own thing". The eight-page story [...] "The Strange Case of the Absent Floor" [...] in Rangers Comics #47 (June 1949), which he both penciled and inked, marked Grandenetti's first credited comics art, and he remained on the feature (scripted by Eisner's office manager and future journalist Marilyn Mercer) through #60 (Aug. 1951). Grandenetti also drew [...] "Senorita Rio" [...] stories for the same publisher's Fight Comics.|$|E
2500|$|Around that time, the American {{comic book}} {{industry}} was booming. Kirby began writing and drawing for the comic-book <b>packager</b> Eisner & Iger, {{one of a}} handful of firms creating comics on demand for publishers. Through that company, Kirby did what he remembers as his first comic book work, for Wild Boy Magazine. This included such strips as the science fiction adventure [...] "The Diary of Dr. Hayward" [...] (under the pseudonym Curt Davis), the Western crimefighter feature [...] "Wilton of the West" [...] (as Fred Sande), the swashbuckler adventure [...] "The Count of Monte Cristo" [...] (again as Jack Curtiss), and the humor features [...] "Abdul Jones" [...] (as Ted Grey) and [...] "Socko the Seadog" [...] (as Teddy), all variously for Jumbo Comics and other Eisner-Iger clients. He first used the surname Kirby as the pseudonymous Lance Kirby in two [...] "Lone Rider" [...] Western stories in Eastern Color Printing's Famous Funnies #63–64 (Oct.–Nov. 1939). He ultimately settled on the pen name Jack Kirby because it reminded him of actor James Cagney. However, he took offense to those who suggested he changed his name in order to hide his Jewish heritage.|$|E
