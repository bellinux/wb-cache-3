Using a <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> relying upon resonant oscillations to determine pressure, a driving circuit drives such a <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> at resonance and tracks resonant frequency and amplitude shifts with changes in pressure. Pressure changes affect the Q-factor of the resonating portion of the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor.</b> Such Q-factor changes are detected by the driving/sensing circuit which in turn tracks the changes in resonant frequency to maintain the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> at resonance. Changes in the Q-factor are reflected in changes of amplitude of the resonating <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor.</b> In response, upon sensing the changes in the amplitude, the driving circuit changes the force or strength of the electrostatic driving signal to maintain the resonator at constant amplitude. The amplitude of the driving signals become a direct measure of the changes in pressure as the operating characteristics of the resonator give rise to a linear response curve for the amplitude of the driving signal.
