40|$|During the Viking Age, {{or about}} AD 750 to AD 1050, there were {{remarkable}} changes of buildingtechniques in the Mälaren region. After several {{thousands of years}} with long houses, framework houses appeared, the first evidence ofthis found {{in the town of}} Birka in the 8 th century. In Birka, there is also evidence of framework withposts on <b>padstones</b> {{in the first half of}} the 10 th century, which is the earliest clear evidence of such aconstruction north of the Alps. This building method became predominant in the first half of the 11 thcentury in the town of Sigtuna and probably in great parts of the region as well. Corner timbered buildings with lying logs seem to have appeared in the region roughly about AD 1000, with earliest evidence in Sigtuna about AD 1005. After a few decades, this technique had becomequite common in Sigtuna in addition to the framework technique. The treatment of the logs and thekind of log notches are very similar to those in Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod in Russia. The logs areround and the notches are, in principle, semi-circular, "round log notch" (Swe. "rundknut", Norw. "vagelaft"). There is no evidence of bevelling in the log notches (Swe. "rännknut", Norw. "findalslaft"). The introduction of corner timbering seems to have occurred roughly at the same time in several Scandinavian regions with influence above all from Russia...|$|R
