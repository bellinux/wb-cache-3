40|$|International audienceOcean color {{measurements}} {{have been}} intensively {{used to estimate}} chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a in abreviation) in the surface waters of the ocean, marginal seas and lakes. Phytoplankton is the first element in the ocean food webs and consequently drives the ocean productivity. It also plays {{a fundamental role in}} climate regulation by trapping atmospheric CO 2 through gas exchanges at the sea surface. With the growing interest in climate change, one may ask how the different phytoplankton populations will respond to changes in ocean characteristics (temperature, salinity) and nutrient supply. Pigment analysis by High Performance Liquid Chormatography (HPLC) has been widely used to categorized broad <b>Phytoplancton</b> size classes (PSC) or <b>phytoplancton</b> functional types (PFT) [Hirata et al. 2011]. Each <b>phytoplancton</b> group (PSC/PFT) is associated with diagnostic pigments and a convertion formula can be derived to estimate the percentage of each group from the pigment measurements. These in-situ measurements were used to build relationships between PSC/PFT and ocean properties that can be derived from satellite ocean color sensors (e. g. Chl-a concentration or water leaving-radiance), which is of fundamental interest to understand the phytoplankton behavior and to model its evolution [Uitz et al., 2006, Ciotti and Bricaud, 2006, Hirata et al., 2008, Sathyendranath et al., 2014, Alvain et al., 2005, Alvain et al., 2012]. In the present work, we propose a regional algorithm based on PHYSAT [Alvain et al., 2012], that estimates diagnostic pigments associated with PFT/PSC from satellite ocean color measurements.

40|$|ABSTRACT. To {{determine}} whether nitrogen or light exerts the most {{control for the}} rates of carbon production of ice algae and phytoplankton under the ice, nitrogen addition (NO 3 or NH 4) and light increment experiments were executed on the landfast sea ice of Barrow, Alaska, during the 2003 growing season by using a 13 C- 15 N dual isotope tracer technique. The productivity of the bottom sea ice algae and phytoplankton at Barrow in 2003 was limited mainly by low light levels (approximately 0. 3 % of the surface irradiance) at the bottom under the snow-covered sea ice. The carbon and nitrate uptake rates of ice algae and phytoplankton increased as the incubation depth in the ice hole decreased and light intensity increased. In addition, under higher light conditions, the relative production of proteins of the bottom ice algae decreased, whereas the lipid proportion increased. The higher level of lipid synthesis of the ice algae might be significant to the nutrition of zooplankton and benthos because lipids are the most energy-dense biomolecules.

Assimilation, sedimentation {{and release}} {{are the principal}} mechanisms controlling the behavior of phosphorus in aquatic ecosystems. There are numerous investigations of the phosphorus cycle in lakes and rivers in relation to the eutrophication process. There are, however, few studies about phosphorus cycling in waste stabilization ponds and most of these have discussed phosphorus removal. The aims of this paper were: 1) to study phosphorus dynamics in relation to the biomass compartment (zooplancton, <b>phytoplancton</b> and bacteria); and 2) to evaluate the phosphorus removal efficiency of the treatment plant under arid climatic conditions. Of particular interest was the remobilization of phosphorus from the pond sediment, both under laboratory conditions and in the field. The experimental installation consisted of two ponds receiving domestic wastewater (mean flow= 120. 4 + 5. 8 m 3. day- 1 and specific organic load= 56 kgBOD. ha- 1. day- 1; pond area= 0. 5 ha and depth= 1. 5 m). Samples were taken twice monthly from the surface, B 1 (S) and B 2 (S), and from the 1. 5 m layers, B 1 (F) and B 2 (F). Composite (24 h) samples were taken from the inflow and the outflowof the plant to determine the removal efficiencies. In each sample, soluble reactive phosphorus (PO 4), total phosphorus (PT) and total soluble phosphorus (PTD) were determined. Particulate phosphorus (PTP) was calculated as (PT-PTD) and soluble organic phosphorus (POD) as (PTD-PO 4). Phosphorus release was measured in a plexiglas flask containing sediment (collected by corer from the pond bottom) overlaid with distilled water. Over 15 days, daily measurements were made of PO 4 and total phosphorus. Sediment dry weight (%), volatile matter, organic carbon (%) and total phosphorus were measured before and after each test. Phosphorus contents of the phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria were estimated using the methods of BOUGIS (1974). The results show that cyclical and seasonal variations of phosphorus content were closely correlated with variations in the biological components. Significant correlation coefficients were noted between chlorophyll-a and particulate organic phosphorus. Organic phosphorus in algal cells was the more important form of particulate organic phosphorus. Under the arid climate, the waste stabilization ponds were more efficient at phosphate removal during the spring-summer period (77 % of PO 4 and 64 % of total phosphorus in spring). The first pond may play the major role in phosphate removal. Phosphorus is only eliminated from stabilization ponds through accumulation in the sediment. However, part of the phosphorus which accumulates in pond sediments remains potentially mobile. During the summer period, phosphorus release from the sediment, observed in situ, was favored by stratification of the overlying water. The same phenomenon was noted during the autumn, particularly the release of POD. Laboratory studies have shown that phosphorus release may amount to 55 mg P m- 2 d- 1. Biological activity may {{play a significant role in}} this mobilization...|$|E

Periodically {{a large amount}} of algae must be artificially removed, their collection and disposal representing a considerable management cost. This paper describes the design of a bloom predictor based on the daily fluctuations of simple water quality parameters such ad dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, pH and temperature. The task of the fuzzy predictor is to recognise the possibility that a bloom of the macroalgae population is about to occur based on the changing daily pattern of these variables. The fuzzy predictor is based on a number of fuzzy rules derived from experimental observations and expert knowledge. A whole year of hourly data was analysed and used to form the initial knowledge-base. The tests show that the inferential engine has good predictive capabilities, which could be improved when more data becoming available.

The importance of environmental variables triggering cyanobacterial bloom events is discussed. Our results indicate that neither temperature nor N/P ratio are related to the bloom development.

40|$|Resulting from synecological {{studies in}} some areas of the {{southern}} North Sea, a contradiction became evident between measurements of primary production and determinations of the activities consuming organic matter. In the Southern Bight, the consumption is 10 to 20 times higher than the production. This means that the primary production has been underestimated, and/or the consumption over-estimated. In order to discuss the validity of the methods used for determining the respiration activities, some results are presented: a. during a 24 h. cycle at the Sluice-Dock of Ostend, the variations of the oxygen concentration in the water are explained by the measured activities and diffusion fluxes; b. two different methods are shown to give comparable results : the initial rate of oxygen consumption and the anapheratic fixation of CO 2. The extrapolation of measured respiration rates in function of time and depth is discussed. The obtained results for organic matter, respiration activities and their ratio: the turnover rate, are compared with other ones from the literature. No argument was found against the validity of the methods used for the determination of respiration activities.

40|$|In running water, {{the main}} natural factor of {{disturbance}} is hydraulic. Investigation of its biological impact is currently com-plicated by {{the increase of}} anthropogenic disturbances which tend to mask the natural functioning of rivers. Monitoring of the impacts of the artificial alterations undergone by the Middle Rhône River for some decades {{took place in the}} mid- 1980 s. Discharge and temperature could constitute the major events controlling the biological dynamics in terms of variations in spe-cies richness, diversity, and abundance. The between-years changes of the structure and diversity of macroinvertebrate commu-nities were connected with the amplitude of discharge fluctuations. This was in accordance with the disturbance-diversity concept and it seems to confirm the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The fish community mainly depended on hydroclima-tic factors that influenced breeding success. Variations in nutrient input played a secondary role in controlling changes in some communities (particularly the periphyton). Therefore it appears that the study of long-term changes in river systems, including the dynamics of their biological communities, requires continuous observations and data collection that only medium- to long-term studies can provide, implying the setting up of ecological monitoring centres for the natural environment such as the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites in United States.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Phytoplankton, ice algae, and benthic microalgae are {{the three}} sources of primary {{production}} in the western Beaufort Sea in winter and spring. Phytoplankton levels in winter are low with chlorophyll a levels near the limit of detection. Microflagellates are the most abundant organisms present {{in the water column}} along with a few diatoms. Low chlorophyll a, standing stock, and primary productivity continue into June when the ice breaks up. Cells are present in sea ice from the time it forms in the fall and are generally scattered throughout the ice thickness. Microflagellates are the most abundant organisms, but some diatoms, mostly pennate species, are also present. Cells concentrate in the bottom few cm of ice during March-April in response to increasing light levels. Growth continues until late May-early June when maximum production and standing stock occur. Benthic microalgal production was barely detectable in spring although chlorophyll a levels were high, perhaps left from the previous production season. Light is apparently the major factor controlling production in the spring, with the ice algae being {{able to take advantage of}} increasing light levels early in spring. This community shades both the water column and benthos so that production in those habitats does not increase until after the ice algae disappear in early June, but the ice community may be inhibited by layers of sediment in the ice. During this study, the ice algae provided about two-thirds and the phytoplankton one-third of the spring primary production; the benthic community contribution was negligible.

In addition, Manila clams are collected illegally in different areas of the Venice lagoon located close to a highly polluted industrial zone. Arsenic content and speciation were determined in transplanted clams placed in nylon nets in the studied sites at two different tidal heights, and grown from spring 2003 to winter 2005, when they reached the commercial size. Within this growth period, clam samples were collected three times, together with bottom sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM). The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the relationship between arsenic environmental concentrations and bioaccumulation in clams, and to achieve a better evaluation of the possible risk posed to the human population exposed to arsenic through clam consumption, by quantifying the individual levels of the various arsenic compounds in clam tissues. The results seem to indicate different patterns of arsenic accumulation by clams in relation to contamination in sediments and SPM in the two lagoons, with a higher bioaccumulation at Marano (up to about 60 mg/kg d. w.), despite the lower arsenic levels found in the abiotic matrices, whereas for the Venice lagoon sites As concentrations were below 30 mg/kg d. w. In addition, the relative abundance of the various arsenic compounds in clams collected in the different sampling sites allowed to advance some hypotheses about arsenic uptake and metabolism in this bivalve filter-feeder.

40|$|Living benthic foraminiferal faunas of six {{stations}} {{from the}} continental shelf of the Bay of Biscay {{have been investigated}} during three successive seasons (spring, summer and autumn 2002). For the three investigated stations, bottom water oxygen concentration, oxygen penetration into the sediment and sediment organic carbon contents are all relatively similar. Therefore, {{we think that the}} density and the composition of the foraminiferal faunas is mainly controlled by {{the quantity and quality of}} organic input resulting from a succession of phytoplankton bloom events, occurring from late February to early September. The earliest blooms are positioned at the shelf break, late spring and early summer blooms occur off Brittany, whereas in late summer and early autumn, only coastal blooms appear, often in the vicinity of river outlets. In spring, the benthic foraminiferal faunas of central (B, C and D) and outer (E) continental shelf stations are characterised by strong dominance in the first area and strong presence in the second area of Nonionella iridea. In fact, station E does not serve as a major depocenter for the remains of phytoplankton blooms. If station E is not considered, the densities of this taxon show a clear gradient from the shelf-break, where the species dominates the assemblages, to the coast, where it attains very low densities. We explain this gradient as a response to the presence, in early spring, of an important phytoplankton bloom, mainly composed of coccolithophorids, over the shelf break. This observation is supported by the maximum particles flux values at stations close to the shelf break (18. 5  g m− 2 h− 1) and lower values in a station closer to the coast (6. 8  g m− 2 h− 1). In summer, the faunal density is maximum at station A, relatively close to more varied <b>phytoplancton</b> blooms that occur off Brittany until early June. We suggest that the dominant species, Nonion fabum, Cassidulina carinata and Bolivina ex. gr. dilatata respond to phytodetritus input from these blooms. In autumn, the rich faunas of inner shelf station G are dominated by N. fabum, B. ex. gr. dilatata, Hyalinea balthica and Nonionella turgida. These taxa seem to be correlated with the presence of coastal blooms phenomena, in front of river outlets.

Both comparison of (NO. d-N 02 +NJ. L) : P 04 (DIN: DIP) values with Redfic 1 d's ratio and bioassay inspection led to the sarne conclusions. Phosphorus was clearly the nutrient most limiting for the potcntial biornass of test species in nitrogen- rich waters, which occurred in mid spring, in the upper layer of the southern-eastern part of the Gulf which is greatly influenced by river discharge. In late spring, with the decrease of the total DIN reserve, nitrogen and phosphorus showed an equallimiting role. In deeper layers of this area and out of the river plume (western side and central part of the gulf), nitrogen was the limiting nutrient. In summer, whcn river discharge was the lowest, a 11 DIN concentrations but one ranged between 1. 6 and 2. 6 µM, and the whole area was nitrogen-limited for both the cyanobacterial and the algal test strains. In 74 % of the samples for which nitrogen was the limiting nutrient, phosphorus was recorded to be the second potentially limiting nutrient. In contrast, silicon never appeared as limiting the growth potential of either Microcystis aeruginosa or Phaeodactylum tricornutum; phosphorus was the limiting nutrient when DIN: Si 03 values were > 1 (in May), but DIN: Si 03 was 1, en mai, et < 1 en juin et juiliet quand l'azote était limitant.

40|$|L'impact du zooplancton métazoaire sur le <b>phytoplancton</b> et les protozoaires ciliés a été mesuré durant la période de juillet à décembre 1999 dans le réservoir Sahela sous climat méditerranéen semi-aride. Les expériences ont été réalisées à l'aide de {{chambres}} de diffusion immergées in situ pendant 7 heures en absence (chambres témoins) et en présence (chambres expérimentales) du zooplancton. Les résultats indiquent que la mortalité moyenne à 4 m des algues est de 0, 13 + 0, 03 h- 1, et celle des protozoaires ciliés de 0, 07 + 0, 03 h- 1. Cryptomonas ovata et Halteria grandinella ont subi la plus forte prédation, respectivement, 0, 31 + 0, 14 h- 1 et 0, 11 + 0, 04 h- 1 à 4 m. Toutefois, les algues de grande taille (Pediastrum sp, Ceratium hirundinella et Peridinium cinctum) n'ont été que très peu ou pas consommées. The Sahela reservoir, {{located in}} Taounate at 90 km from Fès, lying {{at an altitude}} of 325 m, was built to provide drinking water for the population of Taounate and to contribute to irrigate neighbouring farming perimeters. In order {{to assess the impact of}} metazoan zooplankton on phytoplankton and protozoan ciliates in the Sahela reservoir under semi-arid climate, we conducted experiments during the period from July to December 1999 at the deepest point in the lake (15 m). Sampling and measurements were carried out in diffusion chambers submerged in situ over a period of 7 h without (control chambers) and with (experimental chambers) zooplankton. During these experiments, counts were conducted on phytoplankton and ciliates to determine the abundance and the mortality of these organisms due to zooplankton in each diffusion chambers at t= 0 and t= 7 h incubation. The metazooplankton were counted and dry weight of each taxa was calculated. In summer the highest zooplankton biomass (150 µg·L- 1) mainly composed of cyclopoid Tropocyclops prasinus, caused mortality of the small-sized ciliates, such as Halteria grandinella (0. 10 h- 1). In Autumn, the zooplankton biomass (75 µg·l- 1), dominated by Daphnia longispina, induced a higher mortality for phytoplankton (0. 10 h- 1) than for ciliates (0. 05 h- 1). In Winter, the zooplankton biomass (100 µg·L- 1), also represented by Daphnia longispina, had a low impact on ciliate mortality (< 0. 02 h- 1). The study showed that a heavy predation by the metazoan zooplankton was exerted on small-sized phytoplankton and ciliates and clearly demonstrated the relationships between protozoans and metazoan zooplankton to transfering the matter and energy in aquatic food webs...|$|E

Avec le peuplement autochtone, par enrichissement en azote et en {{phosphore}} de l'eau filtrée sur 200 µm. 2. Avec deux algues tests épuisées en azote et en phosphore, sur l'eau filtrée stérilement. Les quotas cellulaires des algues tests en fin de croissance sont comparés aux quotas cellulaires minimaux et maximaux préalablement établis. Les bioessais avec enrichissement révèlent une limitation de {{la croissance}} des algues par l'azote. Les bioessais avec Fragilaria elliptica présentent une relation linéaire croissante simple entre la concentration en azote assimilée par l'algue test et la densité cellulaire du peuplement phytoplanctonique naturel. L'azote total en solution représente la fraction utilisée par ces algues : azote biodisponible. Par contre, la fraction « phosphore soluble » ne représente qu'une partie du phosphore biodisponible, et se trouve consommée de manière très diverses par les algues testées. Cependant, l'analyse des quotas cellulaires en fin de croissance des algues tests montre que le phosphore est l'élément impliqué dans la limitation de leur croissance. Les bioessais exposent des résultats contradictoires de limitation de la croissance. Les algues autochtones utilisent des ressources en phosphore supérieures à celles qui sont mises à disposition des algues tests, par stockage interne ou par consommation du phosphore minéral adsorbé sur les particules en suspension. In estuarine water, {{the knowledge of}} the resources bioavailability is indispensable for understanding phytoplankton dynamics. For assessing nitrogen and phosphorus bioavailability, algal bioassays are the most indicated. Nutrient limitations of an alga exhibit a threshold rather than an additive or a multiplicative response (ELRIFI et al., 1985). In contrast, numerous nutrient limitations are described for an algal population (TILMAN, 1982). Samples are taken monthly at 1 meter’s depth from two French river estuaries, Noyalo River and Vannes River, in the Morbihan Gulf from April to July. Main physico-chemical measures (temperature, salinity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, total nitrogen, reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus) were taken. Total soluble nitrogen and total soluble phosphorus concentrations were determined after filtration en 0, 2 µm, for comparison with bioassays. In addition two kinds of batch bioassays with 250 ml erlenmeyers into controlled environment (17 °C and 180 ~ 200 µEinstein), were employed :- Estuarine waters filtered on 200 µm, to remove most of the zooplankton, were enriched with sodium nitrate and/or dipotassium hydrogen phosphate. Algal Growth response, was recorded by fluorescence « in vivo », against a blank. - With the total growth on sterilely filtered (0, 2 µm) estuarine waters of two test algae, starved simultaneously in phosphorus and nitrogen in artificial sea water, it was possible to determine the bioavailability of these two elements in the soluble traction. The cellular density of the two test algae : Fragilaria elliptica Schumann and Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin, was related to optical density measures at 750 nm. Nitrogen and phosphorus intracellular concentrations, in the whole culture {{at the end of the}} growth, gave their bio-availability for the test algae provided. Nitrogen and phosphorus cell quotas, intracellular concentration per cell, were then compared with their higher and lower cell quotas. Higher and lower cell quotas were measured at the end of the test algae growth in an artificial medium without phosphorus or nitrogen resources. They were similar to those described by DAUTA (1982). In 1989, an exceptional drought reduced the river flow. Consequently, nutrient flux decreased and phytoplankton density, mainly diatoms, was reduced to between 100 and 800 cells/ml. Sea water dominated in the Morbihan Gulf with salinities higher Chan 30 %o. First, waters filtered on 200 µm and added to which was nitrate and/or phosphate revealed a nitrogen limitation of natural phytoplankton. Secondly, phosphorus limitation were found in bioassays on sterilely filtered waters, in all the test algae starved for phosphorus and nitrogen. At the end of the growth in bioassays, phosphorus cell quotas of the test algae were generaly similar to the lower ones. The growth of the tests algae was limited by that resource. These contrary results are related to the intracellular storage by the natural phytoplankton and/or the major role of particulate fractions in phosphorus bioavailability. Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations assimilated by the test alga : Fragilaria elliptica, were inversely related. From May to July 1989 the results showed a simple linear relation between soluble nitrogen source (filtered on 0. 2 µm) which was bioavailable for the test alga and natural phytoplankton density (R 2 = 0. 98). The two measurements of April did not agree with the latter relation, rather because of environmental factors such as temperature (11 °C against 20 ~ 21 °C for the next ones), than because of the resources. Moreover, the station B in July exhibited a natural phytoplankton density significantly lower than the station A and independent of the nitrogen bioavailability for the two test algae. The bioavailable phosphorus for Phaeodactylum tricornutum, was also significantly lower at station B. That resource can explain the difference in density monitored in July. The total soluble nitrogen source, inorganic and organic, and just a fraction of the total soluble phosphorus source, were assimilated. The soluble phosphorus assimilated by test algae, after sterile filtration, is not the total bioavailable phosphorus in the water of the Morbihan Gulf and seems to be inversely related to the natural <b>phytoplancton</b> density. A part from mineral phosphorus adsorbed on suspended matter is also bioavailable (BERLAND et al., 1973). However, for the phosphorus resource, bioassays have to be performed on particulate fractions...|$|E
40|$|Le Lac Nord de Tunis, dont la superficie est d’environ 24  km 2 et la profondeur moyenne de 1, 5  m, est lié à la mer par des écluses à marée appelées « Écluses de Khéréddine ». Nous avons étudié le fonctionnement hydrodynamique actuel de ce lac en utilisant un modèle bidimensionnel, intégré sur la hauteur d’eau. Le {{logiciel}} utilisé («Surfacewater Modeling System» ou SMS) ne simule pas le fonctionnement des écluses qui s’ouvrent et se ferment automatiquement {{en fonction}} du niveau de la marée en mer, comme c’est le cas dans le lac de Tunis. Pour cela, nous avons modifié son code source pour tenir compte du fonctionnement réel des écluses. Les paramètres du modèle sont calibrés en utilisant des mesures hydrauliques récentes, réalisées en décembre  2005. Le modèle a ensuite été utilisé pour simuler le fonctionnement hydrodynamique moyen actuel du lac. Les résultats de ces simulations montrent un bon fonctionnement hydraulique du lac : absence de zones de stagnation et renouvellement fréquent des eaux ne dépassant pas 21  jours. L’étape suivante a consisté en la mise au point d’un modèle écologique par zone (en divisant le lac en cinq zones supposées homogènes) couplé avec le modèle hydrodynamique. Il est basé sur les équations utilisées par HALCROW (en 1990) et calibré sur des mesures de l’année 2002. Ce modèle traite l’évolution des variables suivantes : la salinité, l’oxygène dissous, la chlorophylle a, les biomasses des macroalgues, du <b>phytoplancton</b> et du zooplancton, ainsi que les nutriments dans le compartiment détritique, dans la colonne d’eau et dans les sédiments. Les premiers résultats du modèle écologique sont encourageants. Cependant, des mesures complémentaires (des macroalgues, du <b>phytoplancton</b> et du zooplancton dans le lac, de l’azote et du phosphore dans les sédiments de surface) permettraient d’améliorer le calage et les résultats du modèle écologique. This work {{deals with the}} modelling of the hydrodynamic and ecological functioning of the Tunis North Lake. The Tunis North Lake is situated north-east of Tunisia, its surface is about 24  km 2 and the average depth is 1. 5  m. The lake {{is connected to the}} Gulf of Tunis by the Khereddine channel through ten sluices functioning under tide’s effect. In fact, five of these sluices are opened on flood tide and the others on ebb tide. These sluices were built with a separation dam, in the centre of the lake, during the period between 1985 and 1988, in order to improve the water circulation {{and the quality of the}} lake. We then studied the actual hydrodynamic functioning of the lake by using a 2 D vertical-integrated model. The numerical software used is the «Surfacewater Modeling System» (SMS). The initial code, SMS, does not simulate the change of the boundary conditions through the time of simulation, as it really occurs on the Khereddine sluices, which open in an automatic way according to the tide: high tide (opened northern sluices and closed southern sluices) and low tide (closed northern sluices and opened southern sluices). Therefore, first of all, we modified the source code of software «SMS» to take into account this specification of the Tunis North Lake. After these modifications, we carried out the calibration of the model by basing outselves on recent hydraulic measurements performed in December  2005. The model’s calibration enabled us to simulate the average hydrodynamic functioning of the lake, by imposing average boundary conditions: An average tide of marling 20  cm at the Khereddine sluices and a constant flow on the power electric station of La Goulette. The results of these simulations showed «a correct» functioning of the Tunis North Lake through an exchanged flow with the sea of 66  m 3 /s, an exchanged daily volume of 1. 65  Mm 3 /day, a velocity field that scanned all the surface of the lake and an average residence time of water in the lake of approximately 21  days which can reach 16  days with maximal tide and western wind of intensity  6  m/s. The following stage consisted in the development of a zonal ecological model taking into account specificities of the lake and the data which are available. This model was coupled with the hydrodynamic model that is presented in the preceding stage, in particular with regard to the exchanges between the zones (or sea) defined in the ecological model. The ecological model computes the evolution of the biomasses of the macroalgae, phytoplankton and zooplankton as well as nutrients in detritus, water column and sediments, the salinity, the dissolved oxygen and the chlorophyll-a concentrations. In this model, the growth of phytoplankton and macroalgae depends on the water temperature, light intensity and nutrient. Competition between phytoplankton and macroalgae for nutriments is simulated. The computation was carried out in two steps. The first step consists in the preliminary calibration of the model on the basis of measurements of water quality performed during the year 2002 and the parameter update used by HALCROW (Sir William Halcrow & Partners Ltd) (in 1990) which enabled us to bring closer the results of the model to the actual characteristics of the lake. The cyclical nature of the population density of macroalgae was reproduced, with a bloom throughout the spring especially in the southern part of the lake. In the second step, we carried out a five-year predictive simulation of the ecological functioning of the lake from the year 2002. The results of this simulation showed us that the lake presents good ecological conditions. The results of the present ecological model are the best results that we can obtain using the available data, but further measurements of phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroalgae and nutrients in the sediments can improve considerably the results of this model...|$|E
40|$|The Skager Rack {{coast of}} Norway is {{characterized}} by narrow coastal banks, a well developed system of skerries and small fjords. Intensive fishing is carried on, mackerel, herring, cod and some other Gadidoid fish, etc., being of special importance. Fishing statistics from years back reveal the occurrence of great fluctuations in the herring fisheries. Mackerel fishing has increased while {{the output of the}} cod fisheries is undoubtedly declining. There {{is no doubt that the}} fluctuation in the herring fisheries is, in a high degree, caused by the variation in hydrographic conditions. The increase in the mackerel fisheries on the other hand is obviously a result of the high standard of development of motor craft and fishing gear while the decline in output of the cod fisheries is attributed to fishing on too intensive a scale, as fishing experiments tend to show. It is commonly assumed that there may be great variations in the result of the spawning of the different species. In order to comprehend the fluctuation in the output of the fisheries it is therefore of importance to study the conditions under which fish eggs and larvae develope in the different years. Investigations having a bearing on this point have previously been undertaken on this coast by KNUT DAHL in 1904 and 1905 (6) and by me in 1917 (8) and 1924 (3). DAHL found great quantities of fish eggs and larvae in the fjords and advanced the suggestion of possible great interchanges between the fjords and the open sea of fish eggs and larvae by means of currents. My investigations in 1917 showed that the content of oxygen in the fjord at the intermediate and deep water layers was much lower than out at sea. It was not reasonable therefore to assume that great interchanges of water masses took place as a matter of course, and the collection of fish eggs and larvae demonstrated some difference between skerries and open sea both as regards species and comparative numbers. In the skerries there was a fauna of eggs and larvae differing from that of the fjord and the sea just a few miles outside. The investigations in 1924 demonstrated the effect of a cold period in the middle of the spawning season of the spring spawners. The eggs disappeared from the waters. The influence of the cold water, however, was more restricted to the open sea. In the fjords there were reservoirs of water of a sufficiently high temperature. When the ice melted here a good quantity of eggs was found to be present, and when the temperature of the sea outside the coast and in the skerries increased fish eggs and larvae were again found, but only in small numbers. A tentative suggestion was made to the effect that a cold period in the middle of the spawning process was detrimental to the eggs spawned and the larvae hatched and it was assumed that the best spawning and hatching results would be obtained if the temperature of the sea during the early winter prevented spawning. When the temperature subsequently rose conditions would be good for hatching and development of the larvae. In all years since 1917 regular hydrographic observations have been made, both near the coast and in the fjords. Outside the coast both salinity and temperature in the surface and intermediate layers vary greatly according to the meteorological conditions obtaining during the year. Easterly winds in winter and spring bring comparatively fresh and cold water near the coast. Spawning will not, therefore, take place and the spawners will seek warmer water layers. Westerly winds bring higher temperatures and salinities in their train, conditions well-suited for the spawning, hatching and development of the brood. The last mentioned process, however, is entirely dependent on the food available. Directly and indirectly the larvae feed on the <b>phytoplancton</b> and as the latter is very dependent on the light it is of great importance that hatching of the larvae should not take place until reproduction of the <b>phytoplancton</b> has commenced. In the fjords the investigations have shown that the variations in the hydrography of the deeper layers are insignificant. Except in special circumstances, between which there may be intervals of many years, no renewal of the waters takes place here. For this reason the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the bottom layers will be consumed by the life processes of animals and plants and by the oxydizing of organic matter. Thus for a time the bottom layers may be unfit for animal life. The intermediate layers of the fjords are also very stationary and the quantity of oxygen here may vary in quite a different manner to that of the water outside. Here, however, the quantities are never so low as to render the waters unsuitable for animal life. The material dealt with in this paper was collected in 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937 - from the waters outside the coast, the skerries and the fjords near Arendal, Kristiansand and Kragerø. The results arrived at in 1917 and 1924 are referred to. The figs. illustrating the occurrences of the different species show that the eggs and larvae of cod are found most abundantly in the fjord, the skerries and close outside the coast. The highest numbers of larvae caught in the Topdals fjord (11. - 12. May 1934) and Kragerø Fjord (14. - 16. May 1934) occurred, however, as already mentioned, some weeks after millions of cod fry had been liberated in these fjords. Haddock larvae are most numerous some miles further from the coast. Sprat larvae occur both in the fjords and in the open sea. Spawning appears to commence about one month earlier in the fjords than outside the coast. Herring larvae are most abundant in the skerries. Mackerel larvae occur almost exclusively outside the coast. Few hauls have been made in the fjords, however, during the mackerel spawning period. The results already attained in 1917 (DANNEVIG 8), namely, that each area of water, fjords, skerries and open sea, has its own special communities of fish eggs and larvae, are confirmed by the present investigations. Cod and herring are coastal forms both as to spawning and larvae. Haddock larvae are most prominent further out. This, undoubtedly, accords with the more oceanic character of the haddock as compared with the more littoral cod on this coast. The sprat and mackerel are pelagic forms. The former spawns both in the fjords and the open sea. A study of the detailed tables brings to light other differences between the fjord and the skerries. A number of species only occur in the open sea or in the skerries. In the most isolated waters investigated, namely, those of the Kils Fjord, only a few species are present. The special hydrographic conditions in the fjords will only permit a restricted number of species to live and propagate in the fjord. Such a distribution cannot take place if the waters in question interchange to a great extent and when a few species do occur in nearly all areas investigated they must be regarded as representatives of species with a wide spawning area...|$|E
40|$|Cet article vise à évaluer les effets à moyen terme des feux et des coupes de forêt sur la biomasse, la richesse spécifique et la {{composition}} du zooplancton des lacs de la forêt boréale au Québec. L'étude a été réalisée durant trois ans (1996 - 1998) après les perturbations sur 3 sous-ensembles de lacs similaires {{au niveau}} de leur morphométrie, incluant 7 lacs naturels non perturbés sur leur bassin versant, 7 lacs affectés par des coupes sur plus de 43 % de la surface du bassin versant et 7 lacs affectés par des feux sur plus de 50 % de la surface du bassin versant. Notre étude indique que le zooplancton a une forte résilience aux perturbations des lacs de la forêt boréale par les feux et les coupes. Les assemblages d'espèces sont très stables et varient peu entre les lacs naturels et les lacs perturbés. Les Rotifères sont le seul groupe affecté par les perturbations; leur richesse spécifique et leur biomasse sont plus fortes dans les lacs perturbés que dans les lacs naturels. Les feux ont un effet d'eutrophisation plus marqué que les coupes. Dans les lacs affectés par les feux, les apports accrus de nutriments favorisent la croissance du <b>phytoplancton</b> puis des rotifères. Toutefois, dans les lacs affectés par les coupes, la forte couleur de l'eau due aux apports accrus en carbone organique dissous est un facteur limitant, et la hausse du <b>phytoplancton</b> et des rotifères est moins accentuée. La richesse spécifique et la biomasse des Crustacés (Cladocères, Copépodes Calanoïdes et Cyclopoïdes) ne varient pas avec les perturbations. Sur l'ensemble du suivi, le niveau de perturbation n'est pas fortement relié aux changements dans la biomasse des groupes taxinomiques qui s'expliquent plutôt par les variations annuelles de la température de l'eau et des concentrations en chlorophylle a. This paper aims to evaluate mid-term impacts of forest wildfires and harvesting on the biomass, species richness and assemblages of zooplankton communities in boreal lakes in Québec. The research was carried out during a post-perturbation 3 -year survey (1996 - 1998) on three subsets of lakes (natural, cut, burnt lakes). It complements previous short-term studies conducted 1 year after perturbations in the same region by PATOINE et al. (2000, 2002 a) on different subsets of lakes, which failed to detect significant effects. This comparative study attempts to minimize the spatial variability among natural and perturbed lakes by selecting lakes with similar morphometric conditions. For this selection, we applied a multivariate approach developed by DUHAIME and PINEL-ALLOUL (2005). Making sure that natural and perturbed lakes have similar morphometric features allows minimization of the confounding effects of lake and watershed conditions on organic carbon and nutrient exports from perturbed watersheds, and subsequently on lake water quality and biota. The initial 3 -year survey was conducted on 31 lakes including 15 natural lakes without any perturbation in their watershed over the past 70 years, and 9 burnt lakes with more than 50 % of their watershed intensively burnt, and 7 logged lakes with more than 43 % of their watershed clear-cut. Lakes were visited three times per summer (May-June, July, August-September) between 6 : 00 to 15 : 00 h, during the 3 years (1996 - 98) following the fires and harvesting of 1995. Watershed and lake morphometry, and water quality, and algal communities were monitored and studied by CARIGNAN et al. (2000) and PLANAS et al. (2000). Fish communities were sampled and studied by SAINT-ONGE and MAGNAN (2000). Zooplankton was sampled using a cantilever net (53 µm mesh size) on vertical hauls from 1 m above the sediments to the lake surface. Sampling methods and analysis of zooplankton were previously described by PATOINE et al. (2000, 2002 a). We estimated species richness and assemblages, {{as well as the}} biomass of each zooplankton group (Rotifera, Cladocera, Copepoda Cyclopoida and Calanoida) and of the total community in each year and each lake. Simple ANOVA were used to evaluate global changes over the mid-term survey in zooplankton attributes among the three subsets of lakes (natural, cut, burnt). RMANOVA (analysis of variance with repeated measures) were used to test the effects of watershed conditions related to perturbations (natural, cut, burnt lakes), the effects of annual variations during the survey and their interaction. Redundancy analysis (RDA) served to evaluate the relationships between changes in the biomass of zooplankton groups during the survey in the three subsets of lakes and the changes in environmental factors and perturbation intensity. Environmental factors retained for the analysis were the drainage ratio (ratio of watershed area to lake area), lake water transparency, concentrations of total phosphorus, total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon, water temperature in the euphotic zone, chlorophyll a concentrations, and biomass classes of dominant fish (yellow perch, white sucker). The perturbation intensity, expressed as the percentage of watershed area clear-cut or burnt, was also included in the model. Based on their similarity in morphometric variables (drainage ratio, lake volume, area and maximum depth, percentage of wetlands in the watershed), we retained for the study 7 cut lakes (C 2, C 9, C 12, C 23, C 24, C 29, C 48), 7 burnt lakes (FBP 9, FBP 10, FP 2, FP 24, FP 30, FP 31, FP 32), and 7 natural lakes (N 5, N 16, N 56, N 70, N 82, N 88, N 109). Variations in morphometric characteristics were found within each subset of lakes (reference, burnt, logged), and we did not detect significant variation among groups. However, we did find significant differences in water quality variables among subsets of lakes. Thus, in our study, we have minimized the effects of variable morphometry among watersheds and lakes that could confound the responses of lakes to perturbations, while maintaining the same effects of fires and harvesting on water quality, as previously observed (CARIGNAN et al. 2000). This allowed us to test scaling-up effects of these changes on zooplankton communities. Our study shows that zooplankton communities in boreal lakes have strong resilience to environmental perturbations by wildfires and clear-cut logging. Species assemblages were very stable and varied little between natural and perturbed lakes. Some rotifer species such as Keratella taurocephala, known as a species adapted to acidic and humic lakes, had higher abundance in the cut lakes most enriched in dissolved organic carbon. Another rotifer species, Polyarthra vulgaris, adapted to eutrophic lake and reservoir ecosystems, was more abundant in the burnt lakes that were the most enriched in nutrients. Only short life-span and r-strategic species such as rotifers showed increases in species richness in the perturbed lakes compared to natural lakes. Compared to previous studies, our study showed that this {{increase in the number of}} rotifer species lasted for the 3 -year survey. Rotifers also showed higher biomass in perturbed lakes (especially burnt lakes), but only during the first two years of the survey. In general, fires had greater eutrophication effects than did clear-cut harvest. In lakes impacted by fires, increases in nutrient inputs (total phosphorus, total nitrogen) favoured phytoplankton and rotifer growth, while in lakes impacted by logging, increases in dissolved organic carbon and water color limited the increase of phytoplankton and rotifers. For the crustaceans (Cladocera, Calanoida, Cyclopoida), neither species richness nor biomass was related to watershed perturbations. In general, our study indicates that natural sources of temporal variation between years had greater effects on the biomass of some zooplankton groups than did the perturbations. Overall, increases in Rotifera biomass were primarily related to higher mean summer water temperature whereas increases in Cyclopoida biomass were related to higher chlorophyll a concentrations. Perturbation intensity, nutrient concentrations, and drainage ratio also tended to increase the responses of these zooplankton groups, but their influence over the mid-term survey was not significant. A higher biomass of Calanoida was observed in lakes (mainly natural ones) with high water transparency and low nutrients. Variation in Cladocera biomass was not related to lake enrichment, higher temperature or perturbation intensity. Our mid-term study generally confirms the effects of wildfires and logging, as previously suggested, but not significantly detected by other studies (PATOINE et al. 2000, 2002 a) conducted only during the first year after the perturbations. It shows the usefulness of mid-term monitoring to better assess the ecological impacts of natural and anthropogenic perturbations on aquatic ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Dans la retenue hypereutrophe de Grangent, le <b>phytoplancton</b> estival est dominé par la cyanobactérie Microcystis aeruginosa. Dans le but de lutter contre la {{formation}} de ces blooms cyanobactériens, une expérimentation de brassage artificiel épilimnique par aération a été réalisée en 1997 - 1998. Ce dispositif avait pour but de créer des turbulences supprimant l'avantage adaptatif que constitue, chez M. aeruginosa, la faculté de réguler sa flottabilité. Il devait également permettre l'homogénéisation des teneurs en oxygène dissous, la réduction des pics de pH, de la turbidité des eaux superficielles et des teneurs en ammonium. Les résultats escomptés ont été vérifiés pour les paramètres physicochimiques. Les valeurs se sont révélées plus homogènes, mais seulement à proximité des lignes de brassage et uniquement jusqu'à 10 m de profondeur. En revanche, les blooms cyanobactériens n'ont pas été réduits. Il apparaît même au contraire que, sous l'influence du mélange, les cyanobactéries ont eu à leur disposition une plus grande quantité de nutriments qu'elles ont utilisés pour constituer des réserves glucidiques. Ainsi, en aval de la zone brassée, ces réserves ont permis une synthèse protéique plus importante. Sur la retenue de Grangent, le dispositif de brassage peut offrir une solution palliative du point de vue touristique en limitant l'accumulation de cyanobactéries en surface, mais il ne permet pas d'éliminer, ni même de diminuer, les proliférations de M. aeruginosa en période estivale. In the reservoir of Grangent, a highly eutrophic lake {{located on the}} upper part of the Loire River, about 10 miles south of Saint-Étienne (France), Microcystis aeruginosa usually dominates the phytoplankton community in late summer and early autumn for many years. Mass developments of this cyanobacterium led to serious difficulties in multi-purpose usage. In order to fight against blooms, an epilimnic artificial mixing was experimented. M. aeruginosa is adapted to stable stratification of the water column. Therefore, partial destratification or bubbling with air are employed to replace M. aeruginosa by better grazable, non- " blooming " and non-toxic species. This cyanobacterium is supposed to lose its advantage of buoyancy and to reduce his growth. This system was also employed to reduce peaks of pH, turbidity of surface waters and concentration of NH 4 and to homogenize the dissolved oxygen concentration inside the water column. Three lines of mixing were tested in 1998 : one located at "Châtelet", upstream of reservoir, measuring 700 m at 11 m depth; one near the beach of Saint-Victor, with the same length and immersed to 15 m depth and, finally, a line of 400 m, near the port, at 16 m depth (figure 1). Data were collected from representative sites, upstream, near and downstream the artificial mixing. They were sampled weekly since April to November 1998. At each site the vertical profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured (figure 2). For each sample, the parameters following were analyzed: pH, NO 3, NH 4, PO 4, carbohydrates, proteins, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton enumeration. Concerning the physicochemical parameters, the assumptions were checked: the values appeared more homogeneous near the lines of mixing than at the other stations. For example, the average temperatures varied between 20, 6 °C (at 10 m depth) and 21, 3 °C (at 0, 5 m depth) at Saint-Victor. This variation reached 1, 3 °C at the station Camaldules. On the other hand, this effect was perceived only up to 10 m of depth and at a limited distance of mixing. In the same way, the colonies of M. aeruginosa were mixed in the water column but only up 10 m depth and near mixing. Moreover, their growth has not decreased on the whole of reservoir. In period of bloom (August 25), G/P ratio was higher in the mixing zone than in the neighbourhoods, primarily because of an increase in carbohydrates (figure 3). In the mixed zone, M. aeruginosa seemed to benefit greater quantity of mineral elements it could use to constitute carbohydrates reserves (figure 4). In this way, when the conditions that became less favourable, like downstream, cyanobacteria were able to follow their development by synthesizing proteins starting from their reserves in carbohydrates. In the reservoir of Grangent, artificial mixing did not allow to fight effectively against blooms of cyanobacteria. Colonies of M. aeruginosa were simply diluted in the water column near mixing but did not reduce their growth...|$|E
40|$|In Norway the oyster, Ostrea edulis, is {{cultivated}} in small natural salt-water ponds, with but narrow communications with the sea. On {{the top of}} the ponds we have generally a layer of fresh water. The temperature rises very high during summer - to 25 ° C or even higher. In winter the ponds may be covered by ice for about 5 months. And especially on the Skagerrak coast the temperature of the sea water may approach zero. During summer the production of <b>phytoplancton</b> is very high. And the quantity of oxygen produced may often exceed 150 per cent of saturation. In autumn the sunlight becomes scarce, the oxygen will be consurned to a high degree, and hydrogen of sulphur may occur in the bottom layers. It will be understood that the oysters in these ponds must be in possession of a great power of adaptation to different environments. In the present paper are given the results of experiments on the consumption of oxygen, and the production of carbondioxide by the oyster at different temperatures. The oysters used were taken from the same batch. They were partly brought directly into the experiments, and partly kept for a few days beforehand in filtered water, in order that they may rid themselves of contents in the intenstines that might impair tlie analysis. Prior to the experiments the oysters were brushed and washed with 40 per cent alcohol, and oysters intended for use in series in the experiments were numbered. The experiments were performed in glasses containing 2 litres of sea water. They were closed water-tight by means of glasslids, rubber bands and springs. During the experiments the glasses had to be turned in order to bring about circulation. To prevent small bits of shell to be broken off and come into the analysis for carbondioxide, the oysters were wrapped in pieces of gaze. In each experiment were used several oysters, kept in separate glasses. In order to eliminate the changes occasioned by the life processes of the plancton and the bacteria in the sea water used, glasses filled with the same water were included in the experiments. The results then represent the difference betwecn the actual sample and the blind proof. The duration of each experiment varied according to the temperature. Care was taken to stop the experiment before all the oxygen had been consumed. The results are given seperately for the individuels opened later, to determine the net weight, and for oysters kept for further experiments. In the latter the total weight was used. The chief results are given in Figs. 1 - 4. Fig. 1. The oysters used were kept in the rearing pond. And the closed experimental glasses were placed at a depth of one metre in the pond. The sea water in this pond was constantly renewed from a depht of approximately 15 metres below the surface. The temperature varied in conformity with the sea ternperature. The variations in the salinity were small. In the figure the temperature is given in the uppermost curve. It varied between - 1. 5 ° and + 19. 2 ° C. The consumption of oxygen expressed in ml of O 2 / 100 g of total weight per 24 hrs, both in filtered and unfiltered water, runs - as might be expected - fairly parallel to the temperature. The consumption is severely lowered when the temperature falls below 5 °, and equals 0 when the temperature reaches zero. The production of CO 2, stated in the same terms, runs fairly parallel, the R. Q. is varying from 0. 9 to 1. 0. The values of R. Q. for the experiments at the lowest temperatures are not given, not being reliable. The production of CO 2 in experiments with oysters in unfiltered water is not stated, the values being influenced by the excrements. At the bottom of the figure is given the average weight of the oysters used. The weight increased from June 1941 to January 1942. During the cold period the weight decreased. Fig. 2. The oysters used were kept in the oysters pond. In this basin the water was renewed when necessary. The temperature was allowed to rise, in this case to 26 ° C. Unlike the other basin, the quantity of oxygen rose here very high. From the diagram it will be seen that the O 2 percentage in the spring of 1942 reached nearly 300. In 1941 the consumption of oxygen was what might be expected. In 1942 the values for oysters kept in filtered water was very low. It is assumed that this was occasioned by the oysters having been transfered from water with a high percentage of oxygen, 200 per cent, to filtered water with but 100 per cent. Fig. 3 gives the consumption of oxygen. All the experiments are arranged according to temperature. In the preceding figures the values have been reduced to 100 g of the total weights. In the experiments, some of the specimens were opened to determine the net weights. By means of these net weights the consumption of oxygen were here reduced to 10 g of the net weights for all the samples. Fig. 3 a contains the result obtained with unfiltered water. The consumption rises along a straight line according to temperature, except at the lowest temperatures. In Fig. 3 b we have the corresponding values for oysters kept in filtered sea water. The values Iiere diverge very much. The pr-ocess of keeping the oysters in filtered water apparently caused some disturbances. They may have been due to variations in the temperature, and in the content of oxygen. At very low temperatures we found here no consumption of oxygen. In Fig. 4 the results of experiments with oysters in unfiltered water, carried out at Flødevigen, are parallised to the results obtained by other investigators. MITCHELL dealt with Ostrea virginica, NOZAWA with Ostrea circumpicta, and SPÄRCH with Ostrea edulis. The results obtained by MITCHELL and NOZAWA correspond to the Norwegian ones. The consumption found by SPÄRCH is much lower...|$|E
40|$|La toxicité du <b>phytoplancton</b> est un problème dont l'importance est grandissante en France comme en Europe. Cette toxicité se manifeste surtout lors de l'ingestion de cyanobactéries formant des fleurs d'eau superficielles liées à l'eutrophisation. Microcystis aeruginosa est l'espèce la plus fréquemment incriminée, mais 75 % des souches de cyanobactéries d'eau douce {{seraient}} des toxiques potentielles. Lorsque des clones sont isolés d'un plan d'eau dans lequel des manifestations de toxicité ont été observées, des souches toxiques et non toxiques sont obtenues. La connaissance des conditions d'expression de la toxicité représente un sujet important actuellement peu étudié. Un mammifère peut mourir s'il passe dans son sang 0, 07 mg de toxine de Microcystis par kg de son poids. En pratique, de nombreux cas de morts de bétail ont été recensés. Les toxines qui causent des accidents sont des endotoxines non rejetées par les cellules vivantes, mais libéré au cours de leur lyse. Ceci explique que des cas d'intoxication humaine par l'intermédiaire de l'eau de boisson ont pu être observés. On distingue principalement : des microcystines, hépatotoxines produites par diverses cyanobactéries dont Microcystis et Oscillatoria, et des anatoxines, neurotoxines produites par des Anabaena. Certaines cyanobactéries produiraient un mélange des deux formes. En sus du test de toxicité classique sur la souris, plusieurs autres tests existent. L'analyse est généralement réalisée par chromatographie liquide à haute pression. Des produits actifs synthétisés par des cyanobactéries possèdent une fonction antibiotique et sont susceptibles de jouer un rôle dans le comportement des espèces et leur dominance ou de les protéger contre le broutage. Ces produits seraient des exotoxines différentes des précédentes. The aim of {{the paper}} is to present in the French language the international knowledge related to freshwater cyanobacterial toxins, a problem of great significance in our European countries but largely unknown by people in France. An analytical review of a selection of works chosen from the extensive existing literature is presented. At the present time, the mains works come from : U. S. A., with CARMICHAEL and coworkers, continuing the researchs from CORHAM; Scotland, with CODD; Scandinavia with ERIKSSON, LINDHOLM; and Japan with WATANABE, HARADA, but also many others scientists. In freshwater, poisoning is typically associated with the ingestion of the cyanobacteria appearing in large amount, at the surface of some water bodies, and called water blooms. Many cases of livestock death (concerning sheeps, calves but also adult oxen and horses), associated with the consumption of such water blooms are reported, also, deaths of wild mammals (muskrats, and hogs), birds (ducks, geese), fishes, invertebrate, and human illness following bathing are known. But, because toxins are not destroyed by conventional sand filtration treatment, human illness may also arise from drinking water taken out from an impoundment with a cyanobacterial bloom. Cases are known from United States, Scandinavia and Sardinia. This tap water problem is serious because probabilities of long term diseases, such as tumors promotion, are now considered high. Seventy-five percent of fresh water cyanobacterial strains are potentially toxic, but, on the whole, only some clones from a single species, simultaneously isolated out of an unique body of water, are toxic. However, there are {{no evidence that the}} nontoxic strains could never become toxic. Cyanobacteria are also known as blue-green algae, Myxophyceae or Cyanophyta, and are typically microscopic prokaryotes, but with chlorophyll a. Toxic clones belong to : a) the Chroococcales, single coccoid cells embedded in a gelatinous matrix, represented by species of the genera Coelosphaerium, Gomphosphaeria, and Microcystis whose the species M. aeruginosa is the most frequently quotted toxic Cyanobacteria. b) the Nostocales, filamentous forms, some of them with exocellular sheath. Many are nitrogen fixing species belonging to the genera Nodularia, Anabaena, Aphanizomenon and Nostoc, others belong to the genera Oscillatoria, and are sot known as nitrogen fixers. Most often the mice toxicity test is used to identify toxic water blooms, it allows to define the lethal doses of the toxins or of the toxic organisms. But some others tests have been applied or suggested, they use others animals : fishes, zooplankton or microorganisms, and isolated organs or cells cultures, many are not specific. Currently the modern immunological tests are not yet adapted to identify fresh-water cyanobacterial toxins. The main toxins that can be distinguished are the microcystins and the anatoxins. The microcystins are hepatotoxins from various cyanobacteria belonging principally to the genera Microcystis and Oscilatoria; they promote liver haemorrhages. The anatoxins are neurotoxins from Anabaena and death occur by breath arrest. Some cyanobacteria simultaneously produce the two forms. A mammal may be killed by a blood level content of 0. 07 mg of Microcystis toxin per kg of body weight. Cyanobacterial toxins are endotoxins which diffuse during cell lysis. This explain why toxins can be found in water from impoundments with cyanobacterial blooms. In this case, the toxins can possibly originate in a thick metalimnic plankton layer, not seen from surface. Toxin analysis is usually performed using high pressure liquid chromatography but also thin layer chromatography, and particularly the high performance modem technique. Molecular structures are eluciated using, fast atoms bombardment spectrometry, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. The microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides of low molecular weight, they differed in amino-acids composition; a characteristic one, built up with 20 carbons, is called ADDA. Microcystins toxicity ensue as they act as strong inhibitors upon phosphatase activities. The anatoxins-a are alkaloids, others anatoxins are peptides or currently unknown. The causes of the expression of the toxicity remain to be elucidated. In the years to come, much progress can be achieved by using new genetic tools. Nevertheless, as the largest problems occur always associated with water-blooms, and rise under high sunlight in hot periods, toxicity appears in the whole, associated with eutrophication, and as many toxic species are nitrogen fixers which do not need inorganic nitrogen to grow, problems follow generally a plentiful phosphorous load of water bodies due to human operations. As toxins accumulate in the cells, they could be actives either only after cells consumption, or after toxins discharge during cell lysis. Cyanobacterial toxicity is not due to bacteria associated with the cyanobacteria and can appear in pure axeniccultures. Toxicity is not associated with the presence of cell plasmids. It was shows that optimal conditions for growth did sot coincide with those for toxin production and vary with the growth phase. On the whole, the optimum temperatures, for toxin maximum production, were at about 25 °C for different cultures. Light intensity would be the primary important factor for the production of the toxin, but, in cyanobacteria cultures, this production can occur at relatively low light intensity. Some related cyanobacterial products are not true toxins but are exotoxins acting as antibiotics and can affect species behaviour or dominance and help deter grazers. Since LEFEVRE and coworkers studies, and after a long quiescent period, ecologists take these products anew into account when studying plankton ecology and successions. Only some phytoplankton responds to cyanobacterial extracellular products. Among zooplankton there are species avoiding actively the cyanobacteria and insensitive ones. Chemists have already started search for antitoxins chemicals and found promising curative results. On the other band, biotechnology could take advantage of all these various cyanobacterial products to obtain new drags having pharmacological or agronomical uses. Some true toxins could be used as anti-neoplastics, and products, involved in allelopathic reactions, have antibiotic and antivirus activities. The use of toxins as commercial algicide for chlorophycean waterbloom control had been suggested, but the action spectra of the toxins must be precisely known before extensive implementation. From another point of view, « microalgal » by-products, used as food additives have to be carefully checked for possible toxins. As SKULBERG et al. could rite in 1984, toxic blue-green algal blooms is a growing problem in Europe. Scientists involved in health supervision had to be watchful to it in a way to prevent people from possible major accidents...|$|E
