50|$|Allen {{was awarded}} almost 300 patents {{for a wide}} range of farming machinery, {{including}} the fertilizer drill, seed drill, <b>potato</b> <b>digger,</b> cultivator, furrower, pulverizer, grass edger and numerous other farm implements. In order to provide year-round employment for his workers producing farm equipment, Mr. Allen sought to create a product that could be sold during the winter. His passion for sledding led him to develop a series of sleds and sled improvements. Allen was issued U.S. Patent number 408,681 on August 13, 1889 for the Flexible Flyer.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} lever action design, the {{operating}} lever lies under {{the rear of}} the gun, typically below the stock, and is hinged near the breech area. It is operated by rotating the lever down and forward, which causes the breechblock to slide rearward away from the barrel and eject the spent round. The <b>potato</b> <b>digger</b> mechanism bears some similarities to the basic lever action design, in effect it uses a lever that is powered by the expanding gasses that are propelling the bullet down the barrel, rather than the operator's hands.|$|E

5000|$|Following the 1929 {{merger of}} the four {{companies}} into the Oliver Farm Equipment Company, several other corporate acquisitions {{were made by the}} new company over a period of years. The first of these post-merger acquisitions occurred a mere year later, in 1930, when the Oliver Farm Equipment Company purchased the McKenzie Manufacturing Company of La Crosse, Wisconsin. [...] The McKenzie Manufacturing Company was a leading maker of potato planting and potato harvesting equipment. [...] Acquisition of the McKenzie Company broadened the line of farm equipment offered by Oliver to include <b>potato</b> <b>diggers</b> which were then sold under the [...] "Oliver" [...] name. However, following the 1930 merger production of the [...] "Oliver" [...] <b>potato</b> <b>diggers</b> moved out of La Crosse, Wisconsin to Chicago, Illinois.|$|R
40|$|Any {{mechanical}} force exerted on a potato tuber during the harvesting {{may result in}} mechanical damage. A few weeks prior to harvesting, haulm destruction could improve the rheological properties of the tuber and reduce its susceptibility to mechanical damage. The effects of elevator and oscillatory sieve diggers and haulm destruction on potato loss and mechanical damage were studied on a farmer field in Fereidan region of Isfahan. Two haulm management treatments (destruction and non-destruction) along with five <b>potato</b> <b>diggers</b> (elevator digger with a long main web and with agitator, elevator digger with primary and secondary webs and with agitator, elevator digger with a main web and with/without agitator, and reciprocating riddle digger) were {{laid out in a}} strip block design within a randomized complete block design with four replications. The main crop variety, namely Marfona, was planted in the field. The results showed that the percentages of undigged and soil-covered tubers were significantly different among the <b>potato</b> <b>diggers</b> tested. These losses were due to the dices located to the sides of shares or gage wheels and wrong adjustments on the diggers. Comparing the performance of reciprocating riddle with elevator diggers, its sieving capacity was low and the severity of the mechanical damage and the numbers of tubers covered with soil were high. Haulm destruction was effective in reducing the peeler type damage (the less than 3 mm deep damage to flesh). Although the elevator digger with a main web (elevator chain) and without agitator had the least mechanical damage index, the differences among the elevator diggers tested were not significant (5 %) ...|$|R
5000|$|Niland {{left school}} at 14 {{and two years}} later he briefly worked in Sydney as a copy boy for The Sun newspaper, hoping to become a reporter. His poem [...] "Old Folks' Christmas", was printed in December 1934 and was {{followed}} by [...] "My Country" [...] in March 1935 in The Sydney Morning Herald. In December 1935 he wrote an article, [...] "Lore and Legends of the Christmas Tree", for the same newspaper. The Great Depression ended this avenue of employment, however, and for some years he travelled the country, finding work {{in a wide variety of}} occupations including as a farm labourer, opal miner, circus hand, <b>potato</b> <b>digger,</b> and shearing shed rouseabout. In the late 1930s he returned to Sydney where he worked as a railway porter. During World War II, Niland was rejected for military service due to a cardiac condition - he worked as a shearer under the Manpower Directorate.|$|E
50|$|Small {{cars were}} at first {{packaged}} in both picture boxes and blister packs. Boxes were dropped entirely by the mid-1980s. Large models were mostly packed in window boxes, {{with a few}} exceptions. One unfortunate design element in this time period was the unrealistic and rather gaudy white-walled tires labeled with 'Siku' {{on opposite sides of}} each tire and with and white 'spoked' wheels that appeared on most vehicles in this series. Fortunately, by the late 1990s, realistic wheel designs were adopted, like accurate mini mags for the Mini Cooper seen on this page. This series is still produced today, and since the incorporation of the Club Series (see below) in the early 1990s, large trucks as well as military tanks and a few aircraft {{have been made in the}} small car size and put in blister packages. Of course, their scale varied greatly too. Hence, a unified scale of 1:55 (or 1:60 for cars from the V series) is not uniformly applied.Siku keeps up with odd German sports cars selections like the Gumpert Apollo or the Wiesmann GT. Occasionally Siku outdoes itself with a very odd model. Sixteen inch tall cranes have been produced, helicopters on flat bed semi trucks, forestry log loaders, piston bully snow tracked vehicles, an ultra-detailed stake bed Mercedes Unimog, <b>potato</b> <b>digger</b> truck, triple engined competition pulling tractor and modern tram and subway cars. Perhaps the most outrageous is the AIDA Aluna 10 story plus cruise ship in 1:1,400 scale (18 cm long).|$|E

Seven women had been digging potatoes in a field. There was no flour in their district, and they were desperate for food. Suddenly two German planes appeared from nowhere and dropped two bombs only two hundred yards away on a small home. Two women in the house were killed. The <b>potato</b> <b>diggers</b> dropped flat upon the ground, hoping to be unnoticed. After the bombers had gone, the women returned to their work. They had to have food.|$|R
40|$|After {{accession}} to the EU in 2004 {{the demand for}} tractors and agricultural implements has grown, followed by increasing supply of them. In 2012, the supply of brand-new agricultural tractors was by 185. 4 % higher than in 2003. In 2012 the value of renovation index of tractor fleet in agriculture was by 149. 3 % higher than in 2003. In spite of significant increase of demand for tractors, their production in 2012 was by 39. 2 % lower than in 2003. The downfall in number of tractors produced in Poland caused that imported tractors achieved more and more important share in supplies on Polish market. In 2003 the share of imports amounted to 64. 0 % and in 2012 – 91. 4 %. Production of most other means of agricultural mechanization was in 2012 higher than in 2003.

To reduce {{mechanical}} damage to potato caused by <b>potato</b> <b>digger</b> while it works, {{two kinds of}} Gansu potato were Researched in compression, moisture content of about 56. 8 %, 5 different loading rates, three different loading directions, and Experiment results were analyzed in significant difference. The significant results show that loading direction significantly affected on rupture force, the loading rate on the rupture force was extremely significant, varieties of potato significantly affected on compression deformation. Difference analysis results show that loading direction of different pairs not significantly affected on rupture forces, X amount of deformation of the potato was greater. Loading rate 15 mm/min, 25 mm/min and 35 mm/min on the rupture force were significantly affected, and loading rate of 45 mm/min and 55 mm/min on the rupture force of impact was consistent, and differences in varieties significantly affected on deformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} of spreading cysts of Globodera rostochiensis on farming equipment and potato tubers {{was investigated in}} naturally infested field plots. The number of cysts recovered from soil that adhered to equipment differed significantly between different pieces of equipment. These differences were related to initial nematode density and, in most cases, to the volume of soil that adhered to the equipment. At an initial density of 0. 04 egg/cm³ of soil, significantly more cysts were recovered from a <b>potato</b> <b>digger</b> than from a potato hiller, cultivator, or plow. At an initial density of 0. 90 egg/cm³ of soil, significantly more cysts were recovered from the plow than from the other equipment. Although the population density was 22 times greater, only 10 times more cysts adhered 3 to equipment used in soil with a density of 0. 90 egg/cm³ of soil than when used in soil infested at 0. 04 egg/cm³. The number of potato tuber samples (4. 5 kg) that contained cysts with viable eggs {{was positively correlated with}} the initial densities of G. rostochiensis in soil in which they were produced. The percentage of tuber samples with cysts containing viable eggs was 10 - 12 % for tubers harvested from soil with densities less than 1 egg/cm³ and 30 - 76 % for tubers harvested from soil with densities greater than 4 eggs/cm³ of soil...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the forward speed of a potato {{harvester}} on tubers damage was investigated. The potato harvester type is a two-row <b>potato</b> <b>digger</b> with riddle chain. The experiments were conducted in a potato field of Haradh Project of the National Agricultural Development Company (NADEC) east of Riyadh, in a sandy loam soil, and for a potato crop planted during the spring season of 2004. The potato type was Hermes (oval graded tubers). The degging depth was set to 22 cm, and the amplitudes of riddle chain of the implement were 17 and 25 mm. Results showed that the average values of tubers lifting percentage were in close agreement for all forward speed values (1. 5, 1. 7, and 2 km/h) of the potato harvester. However, it ranged between 96 % and 99 %. It was found {{that there is no}} significant {{effect of the}} forward speed on both total damaged tubers percentage and damage index.

The experiments were conducted in a potato field of Haradh Project of the National Agricultural Development Company (NADEC) east of Riyadh, in a sandy loam soil, and for a potato crop planted during the spring season of 2004. The potato type was Hermes (oval graded seed tubers). The forward speed was set to 2 km/h, and the amplitudes of the riddle chain of the implement were 17 and 25 mm. The study showed that average values of tubers lifting percentage were in close agreement for digging depths 17 and 22 cm. They were between 96. 9 % and 98. 0 %. But, the tubers lifting percentage was low for the depth of 12 cm (51. 3 % and 72. 8 % at the amplitudes of the riddle chain of 17 and 25 mm, respectively). At the amplitudes of 17 mm, total damaged tubers percentages ranged between 0. 76 % and 10. 96 % for the depths 22 and 12 cm, respectively, and ranged between 0. 04 % and 12. 01 % at the amplitude of 25 mm.
