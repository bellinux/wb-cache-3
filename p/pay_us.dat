5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to <b>pay</b> <b>US</b> tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to <b>pay</b> <b>us</b> a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E
25|$|The global {{chemicals}} {{industry was}} in a distinct recession, and the company faced difficult times. The company employed 23,000 and had £2 billion in annual revenue, with 30% from the United States, 40% from Europe and 15% from Asia-Pacific. CEO Sipko Huismans had focused the company on rationalisation and cost cutting: We have to cut costs. We can't count on sales growth to <b>pay</b> <b>us</b> more or {{to allow us to}} buy more of our favorite things. In 1991, the company closed its viscose plant in Calais, France, allowing its other plants to boost output to 93% capacity, compared with an industry average of 75%. This enabled the share price to double in the first three years following the demerger.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} the failure to <b>pay</b> <b>U.S.</b> federal income tax, some tax protesters miss the {{distinction}} between civil and criminal liability. A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can continue to seek money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, {{the amount of money}} due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, and not in a criminal trial. (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty verdict is reached in a criminal case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal in a criminal tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.|$|E
500|$|The Lieutenant Governor of Virginia at the time, Tim Kaine, joined Republican {{lawmakers in}} calling for a House Ethics Committee {{investigation}} into the loan, saying that Moran had made [...] "an error in judgment" [...] by accepting it. In his own defense, Moran said that {{the timing of the}} legislation's introduction was coincidental and {{had nothing to do with}} the loan. MBNA spokesman Brian Dalphon said that the bank had offered the mortgage package not knowing that Moran was a member of Congress, and that the loan [...] "made good business sense" [...] because with the mortgage loan, [...] "we improved our position by getting security for an unsecured loan.... He had credit cards with us, he was having financial difficulties; this put him in a better position to be able to <b>pay</b> <b>us</b> back from a cash-flow standpoint." ...|$|E

He appeared on the show from the first episode and stayed for eight years before his character was killed off in 1993. He found working on Neighbours [...] "exciting" [...] and it enabled him to provide for his sons, but he noted: [...] "You were a totally replaceable commodity; [...] didn't put any value {{on any of the}} people appearing in the show." [...] He expanded: [...] "I didn't like it there, they were not nice people.

500|$|The band {{booked a}} two-week tour with Spitalfield, but Pareskuwicz {{was unable to}} get time off from work and Kunasch {{was kicked out of}} the band as the group [...] "had all gotten sick of him." [...] Kunasch was {{temporarily}} replaced by friend Brandon Hamm on guitar, alongside drummer Chris Envy from the recently disbanded Showoff, but both quit prior to the kickoff of the tour. The band invited Hurley instead to fill-in once more, while Stump borrowed one of Trohman's guitars for the trek. While most shows were cancelled, the band played any show possible: [...] "Let's just get on whatever show we can. You can <b>pay</b> <b>us</b> in pizza," [...] remembered Wentz. As the tour concluded, the general consensus was that Hurley would be the band's new drummer, and the band began to shop around the three songs from the group's unreleased split as a demo to record labels. The band members set their sights on pop punk labels, and attempted with considerable effort to join Drive-Thru Records. A showcase for label co-founders went largely mediocre, and the band were offered to sign to side label Rushmore, an offer that the members of the band declined. They got particularly far in discussions with The Militia Group and Victory Records, and Bob McLynn of Crush Management became the band's first manager. The band re-entered the studio with O'Keefe to record several more tracks to create label interest. Wentz felt [...] "in the backseat" [...] in writing the songs and temporarily questioned his place in the group, but Stump argued in his favor: [...] "No! That's not fair! Don't leave me with this band! Don't make me kind of like this band and then leave it! That's bullshit!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Under U.S. tax law, U.S. persons (regardless {{of country}} of residence) are {{generally}} {{required to report}} and <b>pay</b> <b>U.S.</b> federal income tax on income from all sources. The U.S. is unique in taxing not only non-resident citizens but also non-resident [...] "U.S. Persons for tax purposes". The law requires U.S. citizens living abroad to <b>pay</b> <b>U.S.</b> taxes on foreign income if the foreign tax should be less than U.S. tax ("taxing up"), independently within each category of earned income and passive income. For this reason, the increased reporting requirements of FATCA have had extensive implications for U.S. citizens living abroad. Taxpayer identification numbers and source withholding are also now used to enforce asset reporting requirements upon non-resident U.S. citizens. For example, mandatory withholding can be required via FATCA when a U.S. payor cannot confirm the non-U.S. status of a foreign payee.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{powerful}} {{challenge to the}} mores of the antebellum South {{is presented in the}} fourth stanza, where the black soldiers demand social equality, and more: “They will have to bow their foreheads to their colored kith and kin.” White Southerners will have to acknowledge their actual blood relations among the former slaves. A heavy debt is owed: “They will have to <b>pay</b> <b>us</b> wages, the wages of their sin” (as Romans [...] notes, the “wages of sin is death”). The black soldiers demand reparations, or threaten retaliation: “They will have to give us house-room, or the roof shall tumble in!” ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 1786, {{during an}} inter–state {{convention}} {{to discuss and}} develop a consensus about reversing the protectionist trade barriers that each state had erected, James Madison angrily questioned whether the Articles of Confederation was a binding compact or even a viable government. Connecticut paid nothing and [...] "positively refused" [...] to <b>pay</b> <b>U.S.</b> assessments for two years. A rumor had it that a [...] "seditious party" [...] of New York legislators had opened {{a conversation with the}} Viceroy of Canada. To the south, the British were said to be openly funding Creek Indian raids on white settlers in Georgia and adjacent territory. Savannah (then-capital of Georgia) had been fortified, and the state of Georgia was under martial law. Additionally, during Shays' Rebellion (August 1786 – June 1787) in Massachusetts, Congress could provide no money to support an endangered constituent state. [...] General Benjamin Lincoln was obliged to raise funds from Boston merchants to pay for a volunteer army.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian Head (Buffalo) nickel was {{introduced}} in February 1913, replacing the Liberty Head design. These were the first official strikings of nickels in 1913, since the United States Mint's official records list no Liberty Head nickels produced in that year. But in 1920 the numismatic community learned of five Liberty Head nickels dated 1913, all owned by Samuel Brown, a numismatist who attended the American Numismatic Association's annual convention in 1920 and displayed the coins there. He had previously placed an advertisement in the December 1919 issue of The Numismatist soliciting information on these coins, offering to <b>pay</b> <b>US</b> $500 for each and ostensibly purchasing them as a result. But Brown had been a Mint employee in 1913, and many numismatic historians have concluded {{that he may have}} struck them himself (or had them struck) and taken them from the Mint. If true, this was not a unique occurrence; such clandestine strikes were actually quite common in the 19th century, with the Class II and III 1804 silver dollars perhaps the best-known instance. Other numismatic authorities, such as Q. David Bowers, have questioned this scenario, and pointed out that there are several methods by which the coins could have been legitimately produced; e.g., they may have been lawfully issued by the Mint's Medal Department [...] "for cabinet purposes," [...] or could have been struck as trial pieces in late 1912 to test the following year's new coinage dies. [...] But Bowers did not entirely discount the private minting theory.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, {{while still}} married to husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini, Callas was {{introduced}} to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis at a party given in her honor by Elsa Maxwell after a performance in Donizetti's Anna Bolena. The affair that followed received much publicity in the popular press, and in November 1959, Callas left her husband. Michael Scott asserts that Onassis was not why Callas largely abandoned her career, but that he offered her {{a way out of}} a career that was made increasingly difficult by scandals and by vocal resources that were diminishing at an alarming rate. Franco Zeffirelli, on the other hand, recalls asking Callas in 1963 why she had not practiced her singing, and Callas responding that [...] "I have been trying to fulfill my life as a woman." [...] According to one of her biographers, Nicholas Gage, Callas and Onassis had a child, a boy, who died hours after he was born on March 30, 1960. In his book about his wife, Meneghini states categorically that Maria Callas was unable to bear children. As well, various sources dismiss Gage's claim, as they note that the birth certificates Gage used to prove this [...] "secret child" [...] were issued in 1998, twenty-one years after Callas's death. Still other sources claim that Callas had at least one abortion while involved with Onassis. In 1966, Callas renounced her U.S. citizenship at the American Embassy in Paris, to facilitate the end of her marriage to Meneghini. This was because after her renunciation, she was only a Greek citizen, and under Greek law a Greek could only legally marry in a Greek Orthodox church. As she had married in a Roman Catholic church, this divorced her in every country except Italy. The renunciation also helped her finances, as she no longer had to <b>pay</b> <b>US</b> taxes on her income. The relationship ended two years later in 1968, when Onassis left Callas in favor of Jacqueline Kennedy. However, the Onassis family's private secretary, Kiki, writes in her memoir that even while Aristotle was with Jackie, he frequently met up with Maria in Paris, where they resumed what had now become a clandestine affair.|$|E
