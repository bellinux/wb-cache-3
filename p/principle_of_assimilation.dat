The relationship between how people become informed and LIS intermediation, the Basic Relationship, is fundamental to the theory, practice, and professional education of LIS. This Basic Relationship {{and how it is}} understood in the field is investigated through analysis of selected LIS texts according to criteria derived from <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Assimilation</b> Theory, grounded in educational psychology, integrated with complementary ideas from the cognate fields of ancient rhetoric, cognitive linguistics, philosophy, and communications studies. These criteria were applied in the analysis of 413 LIS texts. Distinct from the "interdisciplinary" trend in our field, to utilize ideas from other fields as LIS concepts, here, ideas from other fields are used to reveal LIS core concepts that are innate and uniquely central to LIS. The primary finding is that LIS texts express dissonance with Assimilation Theory to a small extent (5. 6 %), consonance with Assimilation Theory to a small extent (5. 6 %), and silence to most Assimilation Theory criteria (88. 8 %). Overall, LIS theory, practice, and education are found to be not consonant with <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Assimilation</b> Theory. This primary finding leads to recommendations (Part IV) for a path to an Assimilation Theory-consonant LIS comprised of: (1) conceptual indexing as a complement to present indexing and information service, (2) constructive retrieval (CR) as an alternative to information retrieval (IR), (3) an LIS curriculum and research program grounded upon a core concern of virtually all facets of the field of information: humans becoming informed (constructing meaning) via intermediation between inquirers and instrumented records, and (4) core concepts that differentiate the field from all others. A set of skills (5) common to researchers, service providers, students, and educators in the field is described. These recommendations can have a favorable impact in two ways: (1) inquirers have the benefit of a "retrieval" paradigm that takes into account their prior knowledge (as urged by Ausubel), and (2) important explanations never apparently known to any specific person might be discovered by detection of explanatory concept paths among disjunct literatures as shown through a worked example of conceptual indexing and constructive retrieval applied to Swanson's discovery of "undiscovered public knowledge" associated with dietary fish oil and Raynaud's disease...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to reconcile the}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilation</b> with the principle of mutual recognition with respect to third country goods entering the EU. It argues that third country goods in free circulation should benefit from the principle of mutual recognition when imported into other Member States if those goods are marketable {{in any one of}} the Member States. Following the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilation,</b> such goods should be able to rely on Article 34 TFEU "without distinction" between goods of EU origin and third country origin. Mutual recognition, on the other hand, allows traders to challenge indistinctly applicable product rules if goods are "lawfully produced and marketed in another Member State". This article assesses four different ways of reconciling these two principles. The article argues that the preferred option is to allow goods in free circulation that are "lawfully marketable" in another Member State to benefit from the presumption of equivalence that follows from mutual recognition when those goods are imported into another Member State. This is the least trade restrictive way to achieve the fundamental purpose of mutual recognition: subjecting goods within the EU internal market, as much as possible, to only one set of technical regulations, not two or zero. If goods of third country origin can be marketed in one Member State according its technical rules, those goods should be presumed to meet equivalent standards set by the Member State of importation. The burden of proof should be on the Member State seeking to apply its technical rules to the imported products in question to demonstrate their necessityin light of public interest requirements...|$|E

40|$|Evaluating the neutronic state (neutron flux, power…) of {{the whole}} nuclear core is a very {{important}} topic that has strong implication for nuclear core management and for security monitoring. The core state is evaluated using measurements and calculations. Usually, parts of the measurements are used, and only one kind of instrument is taken into account.

This difficulty can be overcome by Data Assimilation techniques. Such a method allows to combine in a coherent framework the information coming from numerical model and the one coming from various types of observations.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the political {{interaction between the}} Canadian {{federal government and the}} Indian Nations within Canada in the sphere of educational policy implementation from 1973 through 1978. In 1973, the federal government adopted a new educational policy for Indians which was based on the National Indian Brotherhood's policy document, Indian Control of Indian Education, and which incorporated the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> parental responsibility and local control. This new educational policy was a radical change from previous educational policy, which had incorporated <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilation</b> into mainstream Canadian society and widespread integration into provincial school systems. The first five years of implementation of the new educational policy transpired {{within the context of a}} mutually agreed upon process of "partnership" and "consultation". On the national level, the Joint Cabinet/National Indian Brotherhood Committee forum was utilized to raise the question of an Indian right to education. Legislative changes to the Indian Act regarding provision of educational services to Indians were sought through a joint consultative Indian Act revision process. In conjunction with the exploration of these long-range methods of policy implementation, a more immediate method of educational policy implementation occurred through the transfer of education programs or program aspects to Band Councils. Program transfer guidelines served as the primary instruments for effecting this method of policy implementation. The initiation of a Cultural/Educational Centres Program under the auspices of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development also provided an avenue for educational policy implementation. In spite of the intended mode of educational policy implementation, claims and counterclaims regarding the consultative/participatory nature of implementation of Indian control of Indian education resounded throughout 1973 - 1978. The culmination of misunderstandings, misinterpretations and frustrations regarding "consultation" in policy implementation was the unilateral withdrawal of the National Indian Brotherhood from the Joint Committee process in April of 1978. The value of jointly pursuing legislative change to the education sections of the Indian Act came into question as well among Indian leaders in 1978, in light of the perceived threat to aboriginal and Indian rights in general resulting from Prime Minister Trudeau's tabling of Bill C- 60, an Act to Amend the Canadian Constitution. The disconsonance during 1973 - 1978 between the Indian Nations and the federal government regarding the consultative/participatory nature of educational policy implementation can be partially understood in terms of a failure to clearly differentiate between the actual process of consultation and the unilaterally written products of consultative meetings. Organizational aspects of the National Indian Brotherhood also impinged on the manner in which it could participate in the consultative forums. Federal government - Indian Nation interaction in the sphere of educational policy implementation intermeshed with the overall political interaction between these two entities in the continual struggle to define the political relationship between Canada and the indigenous Indian Nations...|$|R

40|$|Non-stationarity {{represents}} one of the major challenges facing hydrologists. There exists a need to develop modelling systems that are capable of accounting for potential catchment changes, in order to provide useful predictions for the future. Such changes may be due to climatic temporal variations or human induced changes to land cover. Extensive research has been undertaken on the impacts of land-use change on hydrologic behaviour, however, few studies have examined this issue in a predictive modelling context. In this paper, we investigate whether a time varying model parameter estimation framework that uses the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> Data <b>Assimilation</b> can improve prediction for two pairs of experimental catchments in Western Australia. All catchments were initially forested, but after three years one catchment was fully cleared whilst another had only 50 % of its area cleared. Their adjacent catchments remained unchanged as a control. Temporal variations in parameters were detected for both treated catchments, with no comparable variations for the control catchments. Improved streamflow prediction and representation of soil moisture dynamics were also seen for the time varying parameter case, compared to when a time invariant parameter set from the calibration period was used. While we use the above mentioned catchments to illustrate the usefulness of the approach, the methods are generic and equally applicable in other settings. This study serves as an important validation step to demonstrate the potential for time varying model structures to improve both predictions and modelling of changing catchments...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} {{processing of}} the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based refractometric data performed {{by means of}} a space-borne GPS-receiver was based on the approximate derivation of the local vertical profiles of the atmospheric refractivity by means of the Abel transform. Being sufficient at the stage of a proof-of-concept experiment, this approach results in significant errors of the reconstruction of the tropospheric refractivity both due to its complicated spatial structure at heights below 10 km and due to the impossibility of separation of the effects of dry air and water vapor without use of additional information. As has been recognized, the most promising way of utilizing GNSS radio occultation data is their variational assimilation (3 D/ 4 DVar) into a Numerical Weather Prediction Model. Nevertheless practical implementation <b>of</b> variational <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> the radio occultation data has proved to be impossible without a careful theoretical investigation of the problem. The main difficulty arises due to the atmospheric refraction representing a complicated nonlinear integral functional of the global atmospheric fields. In this report, we describe the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the variational <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> GNSS data. The investigation of the problem is based on a model of radio occultation experiments that includes the physical model of the measurements, the model of the atmospheric refractivity, and the model of wave propagation in the atmosphere. The latter was designed in two variants: i) a model based on the scalar diffraction theory which allows for accurate simulation of the diffraction and multipath effects especially important in the lower troposphere; ii) a geometric optical model that allows for fast computations. Using the standard approach, we elaborate the linear tangent and linear adjoint model for the GNSS observations, creating thus all the necessary instrumentary for the implementation <b>of</b> variational data <b>assimilation</b> systems.
