5|$|During the First Austrian Republic, pan-Germanists were {{represented}} by the Greater German People's <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> agrarian Landbund. Although initially influential, these two groups soon lost most of their voters to the Christian Social <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Social Democratic Party. Both the Christian Socials and the Social Democrats accepted that unification between Austria and Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. A conflict would develop, however, between those who supported an Austrian national identity, such as the Christian Socials, and those rooted in German nationalism, such as the Social Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Erling Folkvord (born 15 June 1949) is a Norwegian {{politician}} for the Red party, and {{a former}} member of the Parliament of Norway. A revolutionary socialist, he was one of the leading members of the Workers' Communist <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Red Electoral Alliance before they merged to form Red. He sat as a member of the Parliament of Norway from 1993 to 1997, becoming the first socialist to the left of the Socialist Left <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Labour Party in parliament since 1961. He later lost his position in 1997, and has been a candidate for parliament ever since. He has been a member of the Oslo City Council from 1983 to 1993, and again since 1999. Folkvord has become one of the best-known Norwegian politicians on the left who is not connected with the Labour <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Socialist Left Party.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of the election was magnified due to Finland's capacity to influence the European Union's decision in regard to affecting a bailout for Portugal via the European Financial Stability Facility, as part of financial support systems for debt-laden European countries, and {{the fall of the}} Portuguese government.

5|$|A {{former member}} of the Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> libertarian {{organisation}} Libertas, Gjems-Onstad joined Anders Lange's Party when it was founded in 1973 and became the party's deputy leader. He was elected a Member of Parliament in the 1973 parliamentary election, and became the party's parliamentary leader following Anders Lange's death in 1974. Many of his views and proposals caused controversy, and he got in conflict with the new leadership of the party, which was eventually headed by Carl I. Hagen. Gjems-Onstad was expelled from the party in 1976, and finished his term as an independent. He also became known for criticising the Norwegian government's policy in Africa, and for defending the governments of countries such as Rhodesia and South Africa. In the 1980s he worked as a defender for several anti-immigration activists, and from the late 1980s he became involved in anti-immigration politics himself. He stood in election for the Stop Immigration party in 1989 and for the Fatherland Party in 1991, and he was later involved in the militant organisation Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring ("Peoples movement against immigration") and later Stop Islamisation of Norway. He was briefly active locally in the Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pensioners' Party in the late 2000s.|$|E

50|$|Likud's Menachem Begin {{formed the}} country's eighteenth {{government}} on 20 June 1977; the coalition initially included the National Religious <b>Party,</b> Agudat Yisrael <b>and</b> Shlomtzion, which soon merged into Likud. This ended the historic alliance between religious <b>parties</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> previously dominant left-wing bloc, and initiated {{a period of}} alliance between religious <b>parties</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right-wing bloc. The cabinet also included Moshe Dayan, formerly of the Alignment, as Foreign Minister; this resulted in Dayan's expulsion from <b>the</b> Labor <b>party</b> <b>and</b> he formed <b>the</b> short-lived Telem party.|$|R
