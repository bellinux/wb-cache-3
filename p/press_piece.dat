50|$|Serrano’s first {{work that}} drew {{national}} attention was his Houston <b>Press</b> <b>piece</b> on rapper Trae tha Truth's ban from a Houston radio {{station and the}} rapper’s subsequent lawsuit against the station. This piece allowed him to earn {{a place at the}} Houston Press’ sister publication, the LA Weekly. Serrano continued to earn national attention with his pieces about his children and stories about the songs played at his school dance and birthday party. While there, he wrote a piece describing having sex with his wife while listening to Drake. Grantland writer Molly Lambert saw the piece and passed it to her editors, who then invited Serrano to freelance for them. His first piece was about gift shopping with the rapper 2 Chainz. Serrano was hired full-time in July 2015.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Rosier founded V de V (which stands for Vêtements de Vacance, or 'Holiday Wear'). She also {{designed}} {{for at least}} two other lines: dresses for Chloe D'Alby, and a line of affordable furs called Monsieur Z which included pink and blue dyed rabbit fur coats. However, her V de V designs, including both fashionable sportswear and activewear such as swimwear and ski-wear, were very successful. She was noted as an early adopter of vinyl and stretch fabrics, with one New York reporter commenting in 1965 on the close similarity between her two-colour jersey dresses and Yves Saint Laurent's subsequent Mondrian dresses. Due to her love of plastics, she was nicknamed the [...] "Vinyl Girl," [...] and has been credited with introducing vinyl to Paris fashion before André Courrèges, to whom she was compared by the International Herald Tribune for her [...] "style without nostalgia." [...] She has also been credited with being the first designer to deliberately use outsize industrial zippers. A contemporary <b>press</b> <b>piece</b> in 1968 ranked Rosier alongside Emmanuelle Khanh and Christiane Bailly as part of a [...] "new race" [...] of innovative and exciting young French designers, described as [...] "stylists who work for ready-to-wear." ...|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} primary {{techniques}} used when foundation piecing: top pressed, under pressed and single template piecing. The technique used {{is dependent upon}} your preference and {{the pattern of the}} design being sewn. However, under <b>pressed</b> <b>piecing</b> allows for greater accuracy because the sewing is done right on the foundation with the fabric underneath, which allows the stitcher to view the marked seam line and sew directly on it.|$|R

30|$|Complementing the {{external}} buzz, I also made targeted appeals to my social networks – family, friends and followers. For example, when I posted links to <b>press</b> <b>pieces</b> about our project, I {{made a note}} of who “liked” or retweeted the news item, and then followed up by email. Our campaign {{would not have been}} successful without vigorous turnout from my social networks (Perlstein 2013 b). In my case, 17 % of my Facebook friends donated, and 10 % of my Twitter followers donated. Daniel and I also pounded the pavement in person. For example, I was a panelist at a science communication meeting that took place in London during the second month of our campaign. Incidentally, all of this campaign activity expanded my Twitter following and referred web traffic to my lab website, creating a virtuous cycle of community building and fundraising potential.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain high-precision {{three-dimensional}} pieces by dry pressing, two approaches were studied: modelling the material flow and strain during pressing; and evaluating the bulk density (Da) distribution in a <b>pressed</b> <b>piece</b> and using shrinkage models that allow the post-firing geometry to be predicted. It would thus become possible {{to act in the}} design phase (functional geometry and rear) and in the process. This paper describes the studies carried out to predict the final geometry of three-dimensional pieces of the sheet type obtained by conventional pressing techniques, from the Da distribution in each point of the piece. For this purpose, pieces were modelled using finite element method (FEM), applying simulation processes to obtain the strain at each point of the piece as a function of its Da. The experimental validation was performed using the X-ray absorption method for Da and a CMM (coordinate measuring machine) for the geometr...|$|R

40|$|A Dyna Technologies Inc. GP- 5000 HT {{precision}} glass {{molding machine}} {{has been found}} to be a capable tool for bridging the gap between research-level instruments and the higher volume production machines typically used in industry, providing a means to apply the results of rigorous instrumentation analysis performed in the lab to industrial PGM applications. The GP- 5000 HT's thermal and mechanical functionality is explained and characterized through the measurement baseline functionality and the associated error. These baseline measurements were used to determine the center thickness repeatability of pressed glass parts, which is the main metric used in industrial pressing settings. The baselines and the repeatability tests both confirmed the need for three warm-up pressing cycles before the press reaches a thermal steady state. The baselines used for pressing a 2 mm glass piece to a 1 mm target center thickness yielded an average center thickness of 1. 001 mm and a standard deviation of thickness of 0. 0055 mm for glass samples pressed over 3 consecutive days. The baseline tests were then used to deconvolve the sources of error of final <b>pressed</b> <b>piece</b> center thickness...|$|R

Then the artist draws a design, which is then covered by a fine layer of [...] "cera de Campeche," [...] a special type of beeswax. The straw is then cut down to workable sizes, sometimes as fine as a single millimeter in length. The artist then carefully <b>presses</b> the <b>pieces</b> of straw into the beeswax.

40|$|In {{the works}} of Jessica Hagedorn, R. Zamora Linmark, and Joi Barrios, Martial Law under the Marcos Regime (1965 - 1986) {{is as much a}} {{recurring}} trope that works to maintain the mythos of American exceptionalism and discrete national border as it is a material period of Philippine history. In the novels and poetry of these authors, I map the interlocking processes by which late 20 th century Filipino American literary objects alternately corroborate and challenge broadly conceived notions of American democratic pluralism. On either side of the Philippine- American dyad, the exilic figure remains recalcitrant, unsettles the logic of nationalism, and survives collective forgetting and historical erasure in a dynamic state of "nevertheless. " From the particular vantage point offered by the Filipino American context, the contemporary moment of crisis in local American as well as international and transnational (specifically in the so-called "third world") contexts exposes its genealogy in the modes of violent globalization and circulation of labor that continue to characterize the Philippine-American relationship. Collectively, these authors explore Martial Law as an inescapable past that bleeds into the present vis-á-vis globalized immigration conflict as well as the interrogation of both Filipino American identity formation and the institution of American citizenship at large. In re-thinking Martial Law, I supplement my analysis of these literary objects with research into films, protest performances, legal documents, and <b>press</b> <b>pieces</b> (from both Filipino and American contexts) ...|$|R
