40|$|When {{comparing}} alternate product formulations, or evaluating competitors' formulations, researchers often conduct blind, {{forced choice}} <b>product</b> <b>tests.</b> In this study, the authors present {{an approach to}} designing these tests and evaluating their results. Two types of tests are considered: repeat paired comparisons formats, and formats consisting of several triangle tests and a single paired comparison. The approach consists of psychophysical assumptions, discrimination and preference constructs, {{and a set of}} analytical techniques. Using this approach, a researcher can compare <b>product</b> <b>test</b> formats to see which one most efficiently estimates a given construct of interest. The approach {{can also be used to}} gauge sample size requirements for a particular <b>product</b> <b>test</b> format and to estimate confidence intervals for an observed <b>product</b> <b>test</b> result. To illustrate the approach the authors compare two popular <b>product</b> <b>test</b> formats—the Four Paired Comparisons, and the Double Triangle Single Preference. preferences, discrimination, fisher information...|$|R
25|$|Final <b>product</b> <b>testing</b> may {{actually}} be counterproductive if, for example, a solid lead button is tested {{as part of a}} larger product. When tested separately, the button would fail, but when mixed together with the other inputs, the final total lead content may fall below the standard. Thus, unit testing would result in certifying the safety of a product which has unsafe components that could be swallowed by a child.|$|E

40|$|Brass is a {{material}} {{widely used in}} drinking water applications such as faucets, mixers and fittings. Brass contains small amounts of lead (Pb) which may, under unfavourable circumstances, be released to the drinking water. The parameters which affect this release are many and not fully understood today. Among these parameters are water chemistry, operation time, stagnation time, material composition, product geometry, treatment and processing of the material. The {{aim of this study}} is to summarize current knowledge about Pb contamination from brass products to drinking water and to compare three methods for assessment of Pb release; a European material <b>test,</b> a Scandinavian <b>product</b> <b>test</b> and an American <b>product</b> <b>test.</b> This study shows that a product will perform differently depending on the test method, and that the results from a short-term <b>product</b> <b>test</b> are not related to the results in a long term material <b>test.</b> The two <b>product</b> <b>tests</b> proved to give very different results; while all samples passed the Scandinavian <b>product</b> <b>test,</b> no sample passed the American <b>product</b> <b>test.</b> Furthermore, the Scandinavian <b>product</b> <b>test</b> has been proved to be unreliable due to a number of reasons such as low repeatability, inconsistency with current drinking water parametric value and test water which does not represent a worst case. The conclusion is that the choice of test method influences the result and that short-term test cannot be used to predict the outcome of a long term test. The current Scandinavian product approval is not a reliable method for long term <b>testing</b> of <b>products.</b> Validerat; 20120703 (anonymous...|$|R

25|$|Pasteurization {{was first}} used in the United States in the 1890s after the {{discovery}} of germ theory to control the hazards of highly contagious bacterial diseases, including bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, that could be easily transmitted to humans through the drinking of raw milk. Initially after the scientific discovery of bacteria, no <b>product</b> <b>testing</b> was available {{to determine if a}} farmer's milk was safe or infected, so all milk had to be treated as potentially contagious. After the first test was developed, some farmers actively worked to prevent their infected animals from being killed and removed from food production, or would falsify the test results so that their animals would appear to be free of infection.|$|E

As of October, 2017, it is not offered for sale in the United States. During its testing phase in 1996–1997, it was originally called the Double Supreme and was configured similarly to the McDonald's Big Mac—including a three piece roll. It was later reformulated as a more standard double burger during the latter part of <b>product</b> <b>testing</b> in 1997. It was given its current name when the product was formally introduced in September 1997, but maintained the more conventional double cheeseburger format.|$|E
