60|$|One {{particular}} incident has {{a conspicuous}} {{place on the}} political side of Mr. Gladstone’s life. Among the elements in the scheme was {{the abolition of the}} practice of acquiring military rank by money purchase. Public opinion had been mainly roused by Mr. Trevelyan, who now first made his mark in that assembly where he was destined to do admirable work and achieve high eminence and popularity. An Act of George III. abolished selling of offices in other departments, but gave to the crown the discretion of retaining the practice in the army, if so it should seem fit. This discretion had been exercised by the issue of a warrant sanctioning and regulating that practice; commissions in the army were bought and sold for large sums of money, far in excess of the sums fixed by the royal warrant; and vested interests on a large scale grew up in consequence. The substitution, instead of this abusive system, of <b>promotion</b> <b>by</b> <b>selection,</b> {{was one of the first}} steps in army reform. No effective reorganisation was possible without it. As Mr. Gladstone put it, the nation must buy back its own army from its own officers. No other proceeding in the career of the ministry aroused a more determined and violent opposition. It offended a powerful profession with a host of parliamentary friends; the officers disliked liberal politics, they rather disdained a civilian master, and they fought with the vigour peculiar to irritated caste.|$|E
50|$|Once a {{sergeant}} was {{employed as a}} signals sergeant for approximately 4 years he/she could gain further <b>promotion</b> <b>by</b> <b>selection</b> from other competing signal sergeants. This {{was based on a}} scoring system derived from the confidential report forms that were annually completed since promotion to sergeant. They would also have to pass the Education for Promotion Certificate Level 2.|$|E
50|$|A typical career ladder would be: basic {{training}} {{followed by a}} basic radio communicators course of approximately 3 weeks duration. Progress to an advanced level of about 4 - 6 weeks duration followed after roughly 3 or more years field experience. The soldier {{would also have to}} attend a junior cadre course, which built on basic soldiering skills and was a necessary step for selection for their first promotion. As they were competing for their second promotion the soldier would be selected to attend an assistant regimental instructor's course of approximately 6-8 weeks duration. This would supply individual companies (or similar sub-units) with experienced training staff. The assistant regimental instructor's course was a pre-requisite to selection for their third promotion to the signal sergeant's post but not as a pre-requisite for promotion to sergeant which was justified by the completion of the Education for Promotion Certificate. They would also have to attend the crew commander's course which was a more thorough cadre and be selected for further <b>promotion</b> <b>by</b> <b>selection</b> from other competing corporals (or equivalent). This was based on a scoring system derived from the confidential report forms that were annually completed since promotion to corporal.|$|E
50|$|The career {{structure}} of a legal officer within DLS would commence with a short service commission as a Flight Lieutenant after a 3-month SERE course at RAF Cranwell. If the candidate is suitable then appointment to a permanent commission and subsequent <b>promotion</b> will be <b>by</b> <b>selection.</b>|$|R
40|$|A common {{observation}} is that individuals strive {{to neutralize the}} effect of procedural rules designed to drive choices away from their private optimum. An example of this phenomenon is offered by the reaction of Italian academia to two reforms that modified the procedures of recruitment and <b>promotion,</b> <b>by</b> introducing random <b>selection</b> of the examiners not appointed by the recruiting school and reducing from two to one the number of candidates to be qualified. We model the negotiation occurring within evaluation committees and test the decision rule implied by the theoretical model on the sample composed of all selections to associate and full professorship initiated by the Italian schools of economics between 2004 and 2011. Particularly, we investigate whether these reforms decreased the relative weight of the examiner appointed by the recruiting school on committee's decision. Empirical results suggest that both reforms had little if no effect on examiners' weights...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. The quality of decisions arrived at <b>by</b> <b>promotion</b> boards, <b>selection</b> boards, detailers, and placement officers will reflect, in part, the accuracy and thoroughness {{of the information}} available in fitness reports. Although "perfect" fitness reports will not guarantee faultless results, anything less than optimal performance evaluations will certainly degrade the quality of decisions accordingly. The purpose of this thesis is to provide reporting seniors and subordinate officers an insight into the Navy's fitness report system and propose relevant tools and techniques to officers preparing fitness reports {{to enable them to}} complete their task more objectively and in a manner fair to the officer being evaluated, yet providing the Navy with the information that it needs. The ph~losophy and importance of officer performance evaluations are reviewed, their many uses enumerated, and the present system is analyzed with problem areas identified and recommended solutions provided that could be initiated without revising the present fitness report directives or format. Finally, considerations for possible future use are suggested that are beyond the present report format or current implementing directives. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
