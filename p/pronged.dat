5|$|On 3 October, the troops, {{along with}} Colonel Alexander Evert Kawilarang, were tasked with {{capturing}} the rebel capital at New Victoria. Rijadi and Kawilarang led a three <b>pronged</b> assault, with forces approaching by {{land from the}} north and east, and naval forces pulling directly into Ambon harbour. Rijadi's forces approached the city through mangrove swamps, a journey which took a month. During the trip, RMS snipers armed with Jungle Carbines and Owen Guns shot constantly at the troops, often pinning them down.|$|E
5|$|In 498 BC, {{supported}} by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, and burnt Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they {{were followed by}} Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This campaign was the only offensive action by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three <b>pronged</b> attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellion, but {{the spread of the}} revolt to Caria meant that the largest army, under Daurises, relocated there. While initially campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was annihilated in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E
5|$|Finucane took {{leave in}} early September and his award {{for a second}} Bar was gazetted on 9 September. Circus 100B was flown on 20 September 1941. A three <b>pronged</b> attack was planned {{involving}} 23 squadrons and 270 Spitfires with bomber units acting as decoys. The Kenley wing was to provide escort for bombers hitting marshalling yards at Abbeville. 452 {{was one of three}} squadrons flying high cover. Immediately after crossing the coast at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme they were engaged by enemy aircraft. Finucane hit a Bf 109 which exploded forcing him to fly through the debris but within minutes 452 had lost three Spitfires. Finding himself and his wingman, Sergeant Chisholm alone he shot down a Bf 109 that attempted to attack his squadron-mate. He followed it briefly and it caught fire while emitting white smoke. Another Bf 109 turned in to attack Finucane but was shot down by Chisholm. Fighting their way back to the Channel Finucane dived and shot down a Bf 109 which went into a spin before he lost sight of it at approximately 500ft. Three successes had inflated Finucane's tally to 17.|$|E
5|$|They {{remained}} at Madang, undertaking garrison duties, until November 1944 when the 61st Battalion {{was transferred to}} Torokina on Bougainville Island as Australian troops took over responsibility of the island from the American garrison. Initial Allied intelligence estimates placed {{the size of the}} Japanese forces on Bougainville at around 18,000 men, however, it was later determined that the number was closer to 40,000. Nevertheless, it was decided that the Australians would go on the offensive and would pursue a three <b>pronged</b> advance across the island, with the main effort being an advance in the southern sector along the narrow coastal plain towards the Japanese stronghold at Buin. Initially, the 7th Brigade, to which the battalion was attached, was employed in the northern sector holding positions along the Numa Numa trail, however, in January 1945 they took over from the 29th Brigade which had been operating in the southern sector and from then until March, the 61st Battalion took part in the advance inland from the Jaba River through Mosina, Sisirua, and Mosigetta towards the Puriata River.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{still held}} {{the village of}} Bréville, between the 3rd Parachute and 1st Special Service Brigades, which gave them a vantage point to observe the {{airborne}} division's positions. On 8June the Germans launched a two <b>pronged</b> attack from Bréville, against the commandos and against the 9th Parachute Battalion. The German force, comprising elements of the 857th Grenadier Regiment, 346th Infantry Division, were only driven back by a counterattack led by the 9th Parachute Battalion's Regimental Sergeant Major. The next morning the 9th Parachute Battalion was the target for a heavy mortar bombardment, followed by two further infantry attacks. Later the same morning, the 3rd Parachute Brigade's headquarters was attacked by German troops who had infiltrated the lines. The brigade defence platoon managed to hold out until a counterattack by the 9th Parachute Battalion cleared the enemy away. On 10June, 31 men who had landed in the wrong locations joined the battalion, bringing their numbers up to 270 all ranks. The fighting was now concentrated around the Château Saint Come, which was occupied by a German infantry company supported by two self propelled guns. One of the self-propelled guns was blown up by Vickers machine gun fire, but the Germans then mounted a determined infantry assault, and the battalion had to call for support from HMS Arethusa. The leading German troops were undaunted by the naval bombardment, and reached the battalion's lines before they were stopped. One of the German prisoners was a battalion commander, who informed his captors that the 875th Grenadier Regiment had been virtually destroyed in the previous day's fighting. That evening the 9th Parachute Battalion captured the Château Saint Come, and was involved in skirmishes throughout the night. The following day, 11June, the 5th Battalion Black Watch {{was attached to the}} brigade to assist in their attempt to capture Bréville, but their attacks were repulsed by the Germans with heavy losses. They tried again on the 12th, and the German response was an attack by infantry supported by armour, which not only drove the Black Watch back, but almost overran the 9th Parachute Battalion's position. The situation was only saved by a counterattack by 'A' Company 1st Canadian Battalion under the command of Brigadier Hill.|$|E
25|$|By May, the North Vietnamese communists {{had moved}} in a {{battalion}} of troops from their People's Army of Vietnam 316th Brigade. This invasion did not go unnoticed by the Royal Lao Government. They planned a two <b>pronged</b> response.|$|E

25|$|Fighting {{was intense}} {{as the three}} <b>pronged</b> attack, {{consisting}} of the 2nd King's Own on the right flank, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch as the central force and the 2nd Queen's Own on the left flank, advanced to capture a series of prepared strongpoints leading to Ed Duda. Initially, the Italians were stunned by the massive fire and a company of the Pavia was overrun in the predawn darkness, but resistance in the Bologna gradually stiffened.|$|E
25|$|The Burmese {{battle plan}} was greatly shaped by their {{experience}} in the 1759–1760 war. First, they would avoid a single <b>pronged</b> attack route along the narrow Gulf of Siam coastline, which they discovered, could easily be clogged up by more numerous Siamese forces. In 1760, the Burmese were forced to spend nearly three months (January–March) to fight {{their way out of}} the coastline. This time, they planned a multi-pronged attack from all sides to stretch out the numerically superior Siamese defences.|$|E
25|$|The Hephthalites were {{a strong}} {{military}} power but they lacked {{the organization to}} fight on multiple fronts. The Persians and the Western Turkic Khaganate made an alliance and in 557 launched a two <b>pronged</b> attack on the Hephthalites, taking advantage of their disorganization and disunity. As a result, the Turkic tribes took the territory north of the Oxus river, while the Persians annexed land to the south. According to the medieval Arab historian al-Masudi, Khosrow had before this event campaigned deeply in Hephthalite territory, where he killed their king Khushnavaz (also known as Akhshunvar or Akhshunwar) at Khuttal.|$|E
25|$|In caucus states, {{most state}} parties use a two <b>pronged</b> process. A straw poll, often called a presidential {{preference}} poll, is conducted of the attendees at the caucus. The results are {{released to the}} media and published on the state party website. Delegates are then elected to the county conventions. It is at the county conventions that delegates are elected to state conventions, and from the state convention to the national convention. At each level, delegates may be bound or unbound to a candidate. If unbound, delegates are not obligated to follow the results of the presidential preference poll. Thus, all estimates of delegates from caucus states are dependent on state party by-laws.|$|E
25|$|The Chita {{offensive}} was resumed on 25 April, {{once again}} {{it took a}} three <b>pronged</b> form.

25|$|By {{capturing}} Ratchaburi, the Burmese had now fought {{their way}} out of the narrow isthmus, and made it to the mainland Siam. It was late March 1760 (early Tagu 1121 ME). As the invasion army approached Ayutthaya, the Siamese forces, which already suffered heavy losses in men, guns and ammunition, made another stand at Suphanburi, immediately to west of the capital. The defenses consisted of over 33,000 men (including 3000 cavalry), and their mission was to stop the Burmese from crossing the river that separates Ayutthaya from Suphanburi. The Burmese launched a three <b>pronged</b> attack (led by Hsinbyushin in the center flanked by generals Minkhaung Nawrahta and Minhla Thiri) on heavily fortified Siamese positions. The Burmese took heavy losses but ultimately prevailed, taking five senior Siamese commanders and their war elephants.|$|E
25|$|At {{a meeting}} on 23 June 1964, the Lao General Staff {{approved}} the upcoming operation. Operation Triangle (Lao name Sam Sone, Three Arrows) {{was designed as a}} three <b>pronged</b> attack by armed columns of the Royal Lao Armed Forces converging on enemy units occupying a vital road junction. Route 13 was the only road running northward between Vientiane and Luang Prabang. At its approximate midpoint, Route 7 branched to the east to cross the Plain of Jars into the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Royal Lao Government units were tasked to converge on Sala Phou Khoun at the 7/13 junction from their starting points at Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Muang Soui. The initial deployment of Royalist and Neutralist troops would begin on 1 July, with the offensive kicking off on the 7th. Notable was the airlifting of three battalions of troops numbering 1,800 soldiers into northern Laos from the south; Royal Lao Army battalions usually remained in their assigned Military Regions. A total of ten battalions were tasked for the operation.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{newspaper}} reported that {{never before had}} an Australian XI led by Ian Chappell been so humiliated in defeat. Australia had started well reducing the West Indies to 119–7. But Clive Lloyd {{as he had done}} so often before, resisted scoring a vital 56, aputting on 40 runs for the last wicket with the capable Wayne Daniel (17*). Chappell was delighted with his bowlers performance on a first day that closed with Australia 33/2, Ian out along with Bruce Laird and brother Trevor retired hurt. Twelve wickets would fall on the second day, Australia were bowled out for just 106, the four <b>pronged</b> West Indian attack making mince-meat of the Aussie batting card. With a lead of 76 the West Indies batted positively, compiling a total of 481 at a remarkable run rate of 4.39 runs per over. Clive Lloyd was again the star scoring a brilliant 197 before being the eighth batsman dismissed. Requiring an unlikely 558 runs to win in their second innings, the aggressive Ian Chappell chose to open the batting, protecting Trevor from the new ball. Ian made 41 but his side were only 83–4 at his dismissal and {{on the verge of a}} crushing defeat. Ray Bright made a good 47 not out, but the Australian tail were blown away by the four quicks, complemented by the medium pace of Richard Austin. The West Indies completed a 369 run win on the fourth day.|$|E
25|$|In {{the semifinals}} at the Eden Gardens in Calcutta on 13 March 1996, India played Sri Lanka in a match which became notorious for the {{extremely}} poor crowd behaviour. India won the toss and chose to field first. Both the openers Kaluwitharana and Jayasuriya were dismissed in Srinath's first over, uppercutting wide balls down to third man. Srinath then removed veteran Asanka Gurusinha {{to leave the}} score at 35/3. However half centuries from Aravinda de Silva and Roshan Mahanama helped Sri Lanka reach a formidable total of 251/8. India made a solid start, with Sachin Tendulkar (65 from 88 balls, 9 fours) scoring a half-century and taking India to 1/98. However, the pitch began to crumble and take more spin, and when Tendulkar was stumped, the remaining Indian batsmen were unable {{to cope with the}} four <b>pronged</b> spin-attack of Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralitharan and part timers de Silva and Kumar Dharmasena, who altogether took 6 wickets as India lost 7 wickets for 22 runs to slump to 120/8 in the 35th over, with still 132 runs to win. At this point, sections of the crowd began setting fire to the stands and throwing missiles onto the field. Play was stopped as the crowd's anger began to develop into a dangerous riot. The umpires and match referee Clive Lloyd decided to award the game to Sri Lanka because India had no chance of winning from their current position in the match even if the match were to resume, knocking them out of the World Cup.|$|E
25|$|The marches of Doriath {{became a}} battleground between Orcs and the Grey Elves. Orcs sent by Sauron came south in force, but the Men of Brethil, {{aided by the}} Sindar of Doriath led by Beleg, {{destroyed}} an Orc-legion at the crossing of Taeglin in 458. Thingol and the Sindar of Doriath defeated the Orc-army occupying East Beleriand on Radhrim, the East March, in 462 and crushed the Orc-host of Boldog on the North March, in 465. A sortie from Himring destroyed {{the remnants of the}} Orcs. The second assault on Hithlum would see Galdor, Lord of Dor-lómin, die defending Barad Eithel. Morgoth launched a two <b>pronged</b> assault in 462, one Orc-host lay siege to forts of the mountain passes of Ered Wethrin while the other came down from the north, crossing the ice and attacking Fingon on the plains of Hithlum. Húrin, son of Galdor and the new lord of Dor-lómin, routed the armies of Morgoth and drove them back at Barad Eithel. Fingon, outnumbered on the plains, was reinforced by Círdan and the Falathrim who sailed to his rescue in great strength, landing their warriors near the Gate of the Noldor. The Orc-host, caught between the armies of Hithlum and Falas, was destroyed. In 465 Lúthien with the help of Huan first overthrew Sauron and destroyed his fortress Tol-in-Gaurhoth and then in 466, with Beren, in the depths of Angband, they took a Silmaril from the Crown of Morgoth achieving what all the swords and armies and plans of the Noldor had failed to in nearly 500 years of war.|$|E

Allied intelligence of Japanese strengths on the island varied at the time, although it was believed that there were around 17,500 Japanese on Bougainville. Although this was later proved to be grossly incorrect, nevertheless the Allies believed that the Japanese formations in the area, despite being under strength, were still capable of carrying out effective combat operations. As a result, {{it was decided}} that II Corps would go on the offensive in order to clear the Japanese from the island and a three <b>pronged</b> campaign was planned in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island.|$|E

From Zanjan, Hudheifa marched to Ardabil which surrendered peacefully and Hudheifa continued his march north along the western coast of the Caspian Sea and captured Bab al-Abwab by force. At this point Hudheifa was recalled by Caliph Umar, with Bukair ibn Abdullah and Utba ibn Farqad succeeding him. They were sent to carry out a two <b>pronged</b> attack against Azerbaijan: Bukair was to march north along the western coast of the Caspian Sea while Uthba was to march directly into the heart of Azerbaijan.

[...] The dissenters believed that the Aguilar–Spinelli test was effective and should not have been replaced; that tests and laws that protect the rights of accused are too easily disregarded because the court and law enforcers are eager to prosecute suspects; and that the rights of the suspects also have to be protected. The dissenters stated,"By replacing Aguilar and Spinelli with a test that provides no assurance that magistrates, rather than the police, or informants, will make determinations of probable cause; imposes no structure on magistrates’ probable-cause inquiries; and invites the possibility that intrusions may be justified on less than reliable information from an honest or credible person, today’s decision threatens to obliterate one of the most fundamental distinctions between our form of government, where officers are under the law, and the police-state, where they are the law." [...] Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall also argued that the court did not show any persuasive reason for rejecting Aguilar and Spinelli, saying that the Court “reflects impatience with what it perceives to be overly technical rules governing searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment.” The dissenters supported their opinion by stating that, “Words such as practical, nontechnical, and common sense, as used in the Court’s opinion, are but code words for an overly permissive attitude towards police practices in derogation of the rights secured by the Fourth Amendment.” In other words, taking away suspects' rights is not a correct way to enforce drug laws, even though drug trafficking is reprehensible. The dissenters would have affirmed the Illinois court and excluded the evidence.|$|E
