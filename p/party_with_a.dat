5|$|At federal level, Hamersley {{is within}} the Division of Stirling, a {{marginal}} seat which historically has alternated between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of the Liberal Party. At polling place and subdivision level, Hamersley has supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972, the only exception being the 1983 election. In the 2001 election, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 0.3% two-party-preferred majority. Hamersley was in the Division of Cowan for elections held between 1984 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|At the 1906 election, Deakin {{remained}} Prime Minister {{even though}} Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher {{was considered to}} {{have a better understanding of}} economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was more in touch with party opinion. He did not share Hughes' passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). In political terms he was a radical, on the left-wing of his <b>party,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history.|$|E

5|$|Suffering {{synovitis}} to {{his right}} knee, Maxwell was hospitalised for two days and posted to a training battalion in England on 28 November 1916. He stayed there for five months before embarking for France on 9 May 1917 and rejoining the 18th Battalion five days later. Maxwell was only briefly in France before being selected for officer training. Shortly after arriving in England, he attended a boisterous <b>party</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group of soldiers. The military police raided the party and called the local police for assistance after confronting Maxwell's group. Maxwell was fined £20 and sent back to his unit for his actions.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} <b>party</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number of}} conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical revolution.|$|E
5|$|The Sainte-Laguë {{method is}} used for allocating {{parliamentary}} seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes. Still, a <b>party</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high number of votes in only one constituency can win a seat there even if the nationwide percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament is proportionally less {{than its share of}} votes, the party may seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. In 2005, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system.|$|E

40|$|LLM (Estate Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The trustee has a {{fiduciary}} responsibility {{towards the}} <b>parties</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{interest in the}} trust. The <b>parties</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interest in the trust may have certain expectations and requirements of the trustee. The main responsibility and accountability ascribed to and expected of the trustee are for the proper maintenance and administration of the trust and its assets. The <b>parties</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interest in the trust may be classified according to how closely involved or affected they are by {{the existence of the}} trust. The parties closest to the trust are listed as the founder, beneficiaries and co-trustees. <b>Parties</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> judiciary, legislative and administrative interest in the trust include the Master of the High Court, the High Court and the auditors as well as accountants of the trust. The <b>parties</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interest in the trust may not be satisfied with the actions or performance of the trustee. These parties may seek actions and remedies to hold the trustee accountable. These actions and remedies may be found in legislation, the literature, common law or court judgements. It would also be in the trustee’s interest to be informed of the different actions and remedies that could be utilised to hold him accountable. Different types of action are available to hold the trustee accountable, including civil and criminal remedies. The Trust Property Control Act 57 of 1988 does not provide for criminal remedies, but provides an array of civil remedies to hold trustees accountable. The Aquilian action is also available to parties to hold a trustee accountable who committed a breach of trust. The focus of the mini-dissertation is to determine the landscape of remedies and actions available to <b>parties</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interest in the trust in order to hold the trustee accountable.

5|$|When {{they reach}} the summit, they are confronted by Ronyx J. Kenny and Ilia Silvestri, two crew members of the Earth Federation (Terran Alliance in the PSP remake) {{starship}} Calnus. They inform them that the disease {{was sent to the}} planet by a foreign race called the Lezonians, whom the Earth Federation has been at war with. Roddick and Millie go with them on their spacecraft to help them find a cure. They learn that Fellpool blood could be used to process a special, invisible material which could give them a massive advantage in the war. Upon coming in contact with Lezonians, they reveal that they were being forced into war by a shadowy, powerful third <b>party</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disgust for the Federation.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{in a red}} dress moving across a screen of {{multiple}} changing colors and then moves to multiple shots of Elliott rapping in a white and red jersey and matching hat, Lyte in a blue dress, and a church choir group. Next, Elliott is shown on roller skates in a white and black outfit rollerskating throughout the mansion. Shots are shown of Elliott {{in bed with a}} man and Beyoncé at a <b>party</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> guy and singing to the people there. As the song moves to Beyoncé singing the chorus, she is shown sitting on a bed and dancing in a room in a golden top and black shorts, while back at the party, she is singing for her lover and blowing him kisses. The song then moves to a verse by Mc Lyte and we see her dancing {{in the middle of a}} semi-circle of men wearing orange prison jumpsuits. Scenes of the movie and of Mc Lyte in front of an ever-changing background are intercut throughout this.|$|E
5|$|The 47th Battalion's {{sector was}} also being heavily {{attacked}} by II/229 RIR, {{and apart from}} the initial penetration by the 6th Company, they also held the German assault, with assistance from the Lewis guns of the 48th Battalion on their left, who caught the advancing Germans in enfilade. On one occasion a party of the left forward company of the battalion charged over the embankment, chasing the Germans back across the flats into some buildings, and then forcing them out of that cover. Exposed to heavy fire, this small force withdrew back to the railway embankment by noon. When he received reports of the German assault, Imlay sent two platoons of his right support company forward to reinforce the right flank of the battalion front line. However, the exposed slope between the two positions was swept by German machine gun fire and shell fire, and the men could only be sent forward in rushes, well spread out, so this took some time and they suffered casualties. Soon after their arrival, the right forward company inflicted heavy casualties on another German attempt to rush the embankment. Imlay later sent another platoon to reinforce the left flank, and a carrying <b>party</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> resupply of hand grenades. In the meantime, Gellibrand placed the 45th Battalion at Imlay's disposal, although they did not immediately move forward from their position behind the 106th Brigade. German engineers attempted to place pontoon bridges across the Ancre north of Dernancourt to allow assembling troops to cross, but the pontoons were soon riddled and many engineers killed and wounded by guns of the 12th Machine Gun Company. When Imlay became aware of this concentration of German troops, he ordered a company of the 45th Battalion to move to his support lines. During the day, the 47th Battalion suffered 75 casualties.|$|E
