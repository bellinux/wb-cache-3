5|$|Bosman and Kolben's {{descriptions}} went largely unnoticed until 1771, {{when the}} Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant, in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, used the descriptions, {{as well as}} his <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> with a captive specimen, as a basis for consistently differentiating the spotted hyena from the striped. The description given by Pennant was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his Systema regni animalis by simply translating Pennant's text into Latin. Crocuta was finally recognised as a separate genus from Hyaena in 1828.|$|E

This paper provides a description of our use of this method, shows how it helped us in our design research, and presents lessons learned.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} male perceptions and <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> of ‘unwanted attention’ (UA), {{as well as}} possible associations between perceptions and <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> of UA. Ninety-one male college students, from five Portuguese universities, {{were asked to indicate}} which of a continuum of 47 behaviours represented UA. Although UA, stalking and harassment are rarely addressed in Portugal, male college students shared a clear understanding of what behaviours constituted UA, with the identification of four main categories of UA behaviours: ‘aggressive’, ‘threatening’, ‘classic’ and ‘dysfunctional attachment’. Almost all participants (96 %) reported <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> of at least one UA behaviour. There was a minimal relationship between perceptions and <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> of the individual behaviours. The findings highlight the widespread risk of male victimisation and the need to legitimise male complaints...|$|R
5|$|In the 1820s however, Tucker's {{views of}} slavery changed notably with <b>personal</b> <b>experience,</b> and profit, {{realized}} in his purchase {{and sale of}} slaves for his account {{and that of his}} father-in-law, Charles Carter. For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. Though he recounted the insipid benefits of slavery, he predicted its eventual death. Indeed, he freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years prior to his death.|$|E

5|$|Olivia Mary Manning CBE (2 March 1908– 23 July 1980) was a British novelist, poet, {{writer and}} reviewer.

She often wrote from her <b>personal</b> <b>experience,</b> though her books also demonstrate strengths in imaginative writing.

5|$|Swedish {{debate about}} America {{remained}} mostly theoretical before the 19th century, since very few Swedes had any <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of the nation. Emigration was illegal and population {{was seen as}} the wealth of nations. However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850, and as population growth outstripped economic development, it gave rise to fears of overpopulation based on the influential population theory of Thomas Malthus. In the 1830s, the laws against emigration were repealed.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} {{confusion}} appears through the transplantation of characters from one world to another, for example from the characters' childhood culture {{to the one}} imposed upon them as occurs in The Kingdom of This World. Often, the characters find that reality does not lie entirely in either world. It is possible that this theme is well-developed in Alejo Carpentier's work because of the author's own <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> with cultural transplantation (Carpentier grew up in Havana but later moved to France for six years and travelled extensively).|$|E
5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, {{and it may be that}} the cold weather held back its spread.|$|E

5|$|Gagged is an {{extended}} play (EP) recorded by American drag queen Violet Chachki, released on June 30, 2015, by Sidecar Records and Producer Entertainment Group. It was made available following her crowning {{as the winner}} of the seventh season of the reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race. Chachki was inspired to create the record in order to have her own music and visuals for her performances. Consisting of five dance-pop, electronic, and avant-garde tracks, Gagged was released as a digital EP, and was also made available via streaming services. Its lyrics emphasize sexual fetishism and gender identity, based in part on Chachki's <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> working as a dominatrix's assistant.|$|E
5|$|Having <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> with worker safety concerns, Lynch {{found himself}} with {{aspirations}} beyond his trade. When a 1979 blizzard forced his project in Wisconsin to shut down, {{he spent the}} extra time taking courses at the University of Wisconsin. Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston. In the early 1980s Lynch {{was elected to the}} executive board of the Iron Workers Local 7 union. At age 30 he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local's history. During this time he spent his nights and weekends attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology, from which he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in construction management in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Living a worldly {{life during}} the day, he {{reportedly}} spent his evenings in vigils and prayer, putting into practice {{the writings of}} two authors—Marcus Eremita and Diadochos of Photiki—that were {{given to him by}} his spiritual father. It was during this time that Symeon had his first experience of God as divine light, as he described later in one of his Discourses (Disc. 22.2–4). He attributed the experience to the prayers of Symeon the Studite. In spite of the experience, the young Symeon confessed that he still fell into worldly ways of living. Direct <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of God was to become one of Symeon's central teachings in his writings, and to the monks who followed him.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{wrote the}} words from <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b> He grew up without any {{particular}} religious conviction, but his life's path {{was formed by}} a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was pressed (conscripted) into service in the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked his spiritual conversion. He continued his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying Christian theology.|$|E
5|$|Other {{actions taken}} at the 1st General Council {{addressed}} women in ministry. The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry. The Pentecostal belief in <b>personal</b> <b>experience,</b> Spirit baptism as empowerment for service, {{and the need for}} evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry. What concerned some Pentecostal leaders, such as Bell, were women exercising independent authority over men. The council therefore approved of the granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor to men, and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings. By the fall of 1914, out of 512 credential holders, 142 were female missionaries and evangelists.|$|E

5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego {{chapter of}} JC's Girls {{is based at}} the Rock Church, a 10,000-member church with a {{majority}} of members {{under the age of}} 30. In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways. Scher said the former strippers were the most effective JC's Girls volunteers because they understand from <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> the situations of the women they are trying to help. By 2011, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls were visiting strip clubs twice each month. They pray before, during, and after each visit and a team of other members pray for them from another location.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
