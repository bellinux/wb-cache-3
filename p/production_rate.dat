40|$|The {{duration}} of a highway construction project depends {{primarily on the}} quantity or magnitude of the construction work and the productivity of the construction crew. In addition, many other factors may also affect the construction duration, such as the type of construction, traffic features, location (urban or rural site), and weather conditions. When a state highway construction project contract is bid, a reasonable time must set and specified in the contract documents for completion of the contracted project. The time for contract completion (often called “contract time”) is estimated based on the average completion times of individual construction items within a specific project. Through this study, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) highway construction <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated and two methods for contract time estimations were developed based on the recorded eight-year INDOT construction data. Various statistics of <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> were provided to capture the main features of the highway construction production.

Laboratory peat incubations were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to determine the influence of temperature, soil mois-ture, and peat depth on CO 2 <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> from peat samples taken from: (1) a natural peatland; (2) a 2 -year post-cutover peatland and; (3) a 7 -year post-cutover peatland.

Field data have suggested that group selection openings can have higher <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> than single-tree gaps, but whether this translates into higher <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> at the stand level is not clear. We used CANOPY, a crown-based northern hardwoods model calibrated with data from uneven-aged and even-aged stands, to simulate sustainable harvest volumes {{of a number of}} different group selection approaches over 300 years, and also compared results with those from single-tree selection and clearcutting. When a combination of single-tree and group selection was used with groups making up 3 % of the stand area per cutting cycle, net harvestable <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> were similar to those of single-tree selection, and opening size (100 - 4000 m 2) had little effect on <b>production</b> <b>rates.</b> As the percentage of the matrix in groups increased from 1 to 9 % per cutting cycle, production actually showed a small but consistent decline of about 6 to 7 %. When group selection was used alone with no cutting between the groups, <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> varied considerably depending on opening size and rotation age. Small group selection (200 m 2) had <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> similar to or slightly higher than single-tree selection, whereas 2000 m 2 openings resulted in a production declines of 30 to 35 %. Large patch sizes appear to have relatively low net production because of unsalvaged mortality.

Although our results confirmed that trees in even-aged stands are more efficient producers than those in uneven-aged stands, there appear to be countervailing tendencies that reduce <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> in large single-cohort patches, including a lag time during the first few decades when <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> of merchantable volume in large openings are very low...|$|R

In the field study, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations were significantly greater (p< 0. 05) in the maize sole crop and intercrops, whereas soil bulk density was significantly lower in the intercrops {{and as a consequence}} soil infiltration was higher. Soil total nitrogen (TN) concentrations were not significantly different between treatments.

5|$|The {{number of}} Hamilcars that the War Office {{required}} frequently fluctuated. In May 1942 the War Office asked GAL for 360 Hamilcars {{to be used}} in two major airborne operations, but this was found to be unrealistic; not only was the <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> for the glider far too slow to accommodate this large number, the same number of tugs needed to tow the gliders could not be found. In November 1943 the War Office issued another report in which it increased the number of required gliders to 800, an even more unrealistic number; by the time production of the Hamilcar ended, a total of 344 had been built. GAL produced an initial run of 22 Hamilcars, which included the two prototype models and ten pre-production aircraft required for evaluation trials. Subsequent production of parts was assigned to a series of sub-contractors called the 'Hamilcar Production Group', which included the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, the Co-operative Wholesale Society and AC Cars.

5|$|This process, {{developed}} by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211, {{which are then}} isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> of a particular isotope depends on {{the energy of the}} oxygen beam. An 18O beam from the Stony Brook LINAC creates 210Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5n. The production required some time to develop and understand. It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point {{and to make sure that}} its surface was very clean. The nuclear reaction embeds the francium atoms deep in the gold target, and they must be removed efficiently. The atoms quickly diffuse to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions, but this does not happen every time. The francium ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land in a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again. The francium is then injected into a glass bulb. A magnetic field and laser beams cool and confine the atoms. Although the atoms remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping (or decaying), a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost, keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer. Initially, about 1000 francium atoms were trapped in the experiment. This was gradually improved and the setup is capable of trapping over 300,000 neutral atoms of francium a time. These are neutral metallic atoms in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Enough francium is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. The atoms appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter. This was the first time that anyone had ever seen francium. The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms, providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.|$|E

By monitoring protein production in real-time in E. coli wild-type and an L-rhamnose catabolism deficient mutant, we demonstrate that the L-rhamnose concentration-dependent tunability of PrhaBAD-mediated protein production is actually due to L-rhamnose consumption rather than regulating <b>production</b> <b>rates.</b> Using this information, a RhaT-mediated L-rhamnose transport and L-rhamnose catabolism deficient double mutant was constructed.
