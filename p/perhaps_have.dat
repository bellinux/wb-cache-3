5|$|Charles Oman {{proposed}} that Beornred, who in 757 emerged {{for a short}} time as ruler of Mercia before being driven out by Offa, could be the same person as Beonna. An alternative theory suggests that Beonna and Beornred may <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> been kinsmen from the same dynasty with ambitions to rule in both Mercia and East Anglia. No known member of the Wuffingas dynasty had a name commencing with B, but several Mercian rulers, including Beornred, used the letter.|$|E
5|$|David may <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> had {{varying degrees}} of overlordship in parts of Dumfriesshire, Ayrshire, Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire. In the lands between Galloway and the Principality of Cumbria, David {{eventually}} set up large-scale marcher lordships, such as Annandale for Robert de Brus, Cunningham for Hugh de Morville, and possibly Strathgryfe for Walter Fitzalan.|$|E
5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce {{to bury the}} dead between the lines led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|Burial 21 was {{the first}} corbel-vaulted tomb to be {{constructed}} in the Mundo Perdido; it was placed within Structure 5D-86. The deceased was interred upon the east-west axis running through {{the centre of the}} E-Group during the transition between the Late Preclassic and the Early Classic periods. The tomb was elite-status and was perhaps the earliest royal burial in the Mundo Perdido. Any funerary offerings were removed during the 6th century AD during remodelling of the temple, at which time the offerings were redeposited under the third chamber of the shrine. The offerings included three polychrome plates with mammiform legs; the painted designs on the plates <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> astronomical significance.|$|E
5|$|If {{the green}} parrots Leguat {{referred}} to {{were not the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodericanus), they might <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> been a green colour morph of Newton's parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested. As A. Newton observed in his original description, some feathers of the female specimen display both blue and green tinges, depending on the light. This may {{explain some of the}} discrepancies. The green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of Psittacula species from other islands, that survived on Rodrigues for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Plants figure {{prominently}} in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, {{and may be}} more or less magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms.|$|E

5|$|Plants {{including}} {{trees are}} important in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, and may {{be more or less}} magical.

Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E
5|$|The Stonesfield Slate {{material}} {{contains no}} neck vertebrae; {{but a single}} broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests {{the presence of a}} crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing {{more than half of the}} total vertebral height.|$|E
5|$|While {{the general}} public were baffled {{that a man who}} just scored a century against Australia could be left out of the team, the English cricketing press were divided on the decision. Some journalists {{supported}} the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket correspondents of The Times and The Daily Telegraph. Others, prominently the former England captain Ted Dexter, the former Test player Trevor Bailey and E.W. Swanton, all of whom generally sided with the cricket establishment, contended that D'Oliveira deserved to be in the team on merit. Swanton said he had received no letters which actually agreed with the omission. Other commentators, such as the Worcestershire club secretary and the former West Indies Test player Learie Constantine, openly stated that D'Oliveira was omitted either because of his race or because the MCC supported apartheid. Some Labour politicians also expressed concern. John Arlott, while asserting that D'Oliveira deserved to be included, suggested that to demonstrate opposition to apartheid, the MCC should <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> selected him even if this were not the case. The general press took a wider view, with several newspaper columns reporting that the decision appeared to have been made to avoid offending the South African government. According to Williams, the public positions held by much of the MCC committee towards South Africa led to suspicions that D'Oliveira may have been left out simply to save the tour.|$|E

Domnall may <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> been the son of Brian's fourth known wife, Dub Choblaig, who died in 1009. She was a daughter of King Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg of Connacht.|$|E
25|$|It was {{considered}} {{at the time}} that Garter Cole, as the principal heraldic adviser to the Crown, should have tried to prevent this unnecessary diminution of the College's authority, but unfortunately, he was hampered by a lack of rapport with his Sovereign.

25|$|Stress {{is known}} to {{contribute}} to and trigger psychotic states. A history of psychologically traumatic events, and the recent experience of a stressful event, can both {{contribute to the development}} of psychosis. Short-lived psychosis triggered by stress is known as brief reactive psychosis, and patients may spontaneously recover normal functioning within two weeks. In some rare cases, individuals may remain in a state of full-blown psychosis for many years, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> attenuated psychotic symptoms (such as low intensity hallucinations) present at most times.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears to}} me that the {{developers}} have been completely indifferent to, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> even welcomed, this deterioration in the condition of the building, and have done virtually nothing to halt it. I feel the developers have shown a complete disregard for the moral obligations which arose from their course of dealing with the corporation or the planning applications; but I feel the corporation have also been extremely remiss to exercising whatever statutory powers were open to them to cope with the situation.|$|E
25|$|In 1533, Clement's {{refusal to}} annul the first {{marriage}} of King Henry VIII of England to Catherine of Aragon {{may have been}} partly or entirely motivated by his unwillingness to offend the emperor and <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> his capital sacked for a second time. The Peace of Barcelona, signed between Charles V and the Pope in 1529, established a more cordial {{relationship between the two}} leaders. Spain was effectively named the protector of the Catholic cause, and Charles was crowned as King of Italy (Lombardy) in return for Spanish intervention in overthrowing the rebellious Florentine Republic.|$|E

25|$|Literature from North East India {{refers to}} {{literature}} of Languages of North East India, {{and also the}} body of work by English-language writers from this region. North-East India is an under-represented region in many ways. The troubled political climate, the beautiful landscape and the confluence of various ethnic groups <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> {{given rise to a}} body of writing that is completely different from Indian English Literature. North-East India was a colonial construct and continues to be one by virtue of having a historically difficult relationship with the Indian nation state.|$|E
25|$|De Silva was in {{many ways}} unlucky - when Sri Lanka was finally awarded Test status, he was nearing his forties, which {{naturally}} shortened his career. However, he played all the first 12 Tests that Sri Lanka played, before retiring at 42. Had he been ten years younger, he would <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> been more recognised as Sri Lanka's first genuine all-rounder - that title instead went to Ravi Ratnayeke. De Silva also played minor county cricket for Lincolnshire and Shropshire, and later became a coach of the Sri Lankan cricket team. He is currently the interim chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket.|$|E
25|$|Australian-born Stuart Law stood tall at the crease, {{defying the}} Somerset bowlers to make 59 before being run {{out on the}} very last ball, but Somerset only needed 115 from 16 overs - a run rate of 7.19. Smith and Trescothick started positively, before Trescothick's England team-mate Andrew Flintoff had him edge behind to Warren Hegg for 10. With two more wickets falling, Lancashire would <b>perhaps</b> <b>have</b> fancied their chances with the Somerset score on 65 for 3, but Smith defied them with an unbeaten 64, adding 53 in a fourth-wicket stand with young James Hildreth to guide Somerset to the target with seven wickets and eleven balls to spare.|$|E
