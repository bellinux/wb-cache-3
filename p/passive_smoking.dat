40|$|Context: Electronic {{cigarettes}} (e-cigarettes) {{are becoming}} increasingly popular yet their effects on health remain unknown. Objective: To conduct the first comprehensive and standardized assessment of the acute impact of active and <b>passive</b> e-cigarette <b>smoking</b> on serum cotinine and lung function, as compared to active and <b>passive</b> tobacco cigarette <b>smoking.</b> Materials and methods: Fifteen smokers (>= 15 cigarettes/day; seven females; eight males) and 15 never-smokers (seven females; eight males) completed this repeated-measures controlled study. Smokers underwent a control session, an active tobacco cigarette (their favorite brand) smoking session and an active e-cigarette smoking session. Never-smokers underwent a control session, a <b>passive</b> tobacco cigarette <b>smoking</b> session and a <b>passive</b> e-cigarette <b>smoking</b> session. Serum cotinine, lung function, exhaled carbon monoxide and nitric oxide were assessed. The level of significance was set at p 0. 001) effects on serum cotinine levels after active (60. 6 +/- 34. 3 versus 61. 3 +/- 36. 6 ng/ml) and passive (2. 4 +/- 0. 9 versus 2. 6 +/- 0. 6 ng/ml) smoking. Neither a brief session of active e-cigarette smoking (indicative: 3 % reduction in FEV 1 /FVC) nor a 1 h <b>passive</b> e-cigarette <b>smoking</b> (indicative: 2. 3 % reduction in FEV 1 /FVC) significantly affected the lung function (p> 0. 001). In contrast, active (indicative: 7. 2 % reduction in FEV 1 /FVC; p< 0. 001) but not passive (indicative: 3. 4 % reduction in FEV 1 /FVC; p= 0. 005) tobacco cigarette smoking undermined lung function. Conclusion: Regarding short-term usage, the studied e-cigarettes generate smaller changes in lung function but similar nicotinergic impact to tobacco cigarettes. Future research should target {{the health effects of}} long-term e-cigarette usage, including the effects of nicotine dosage...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure of {{children}} to <b>passive</b> tobacco <b>smoking</b> in the household setting has been demonstrated to cause respiratory diseases. Early atherosclerosis has also been demonstrated in young people previously exposed to <b>passive</b> tobacco <b>smoking.</b> Functional damage can initiate at the fetal age due to maternal smoking, with a tendency towards over-time progress. To date only scant data are available about indoor parental smoking attitudes and their changes after campaigns against smoke and risk factors in exposed youths. Questionnaires are useful tools in order to search for information on cigarette smoking and parental household lifestyle. In this study, we asked pupils of primary schools for providing information on their relatives' every 5 years throughout the period 1994 - 2009. METHODS: A multiple-choice answer questionnaire about sharing household parental smoking was administered to all primary school children (mean age 10. 5 ± 0. 5 years) {{of the city of}} Agrigento (Sicily, Italy). RESULTS: A total of 2221 questionnaires were collected from 637 children in 1994, 687 in 1999, 516 in 2004, and 381 in 2009.

5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. <b>Passive</b> <b>smoking</b> causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted, using a stratified multistage cluster random sampling method to select {{a representative sample of}} 20, 242, among Beijing residents aged 18 â 79 years. Active and <b>passive</b> tobacco <b>smoking</b> information was collected by a standardized and validated questionnaire in a face-to-face interview. All estimates of prevalence and numbers were weighted by the 2010 Beijing Population Census data and the sampling scheme. Results: Among Beijing residents aged 18 â 79 years, the overall prevalence of ever smokers and current smokers were 33. 13 % and 30. 18 %, respectively. The prevalence in males was much higher than that in females (60. 75 % vs. 3. 75 % for ever smokers, and 55. 53 % vs. 3. 21 % for current smokers, respectively). For overall current smokers, 14. 12 cigarettes were consumed per day. However, only 8. 91 % of ever smokers quitted smoking {{at the time of the}} survey, and 2. 44 % of ever smokers quitted smoking in recent two years. Furthermore, 44. 74 % of overall nonsmokers and former smokers, with 47. 03 % of males and 43. 63 % of females, reported exposure to secondhand smoke for at least 15 minutes per day and at least one day per week. Conclusions: Tobacco smoking prevalence is still extremely high in Beijing. Nonsmokers do still suffer from secondhand smoke critically.

40|$|Abstract: Some Asian {{people believe}} that opium can protect the {{cardiovascular}} system. To assess this belief, we investigated the effect of <b>passive</b> opium <b>smoking</b> (POS) on cardiovascular indices in rabbits with ischemic and non-ischemic hearts. Rabbits (n = 43) were divided into control (CTL), short term opium (SO) and long term opium (LO) groups. SO and LO groups were exposed to opium smoking for 3 days and 4 weeks, respectively. ECG, blood pressure (BP), left ventricular pressure and cardiac troponin I levels were recorded. Isoproterenol (ISO) was injected to induce cardiac ischemia and after 4 h the above variables were measured along with cardiac histopathology assessment. All groups showed significant increments in troponin I level (P < 0. 05) except the CTL group. This trend was more obvious in ISO-treated groups. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) significantly decreased in all groups (p< 0. 05) except the LO group. Opium exposure attenuated ISO-induced myodegeneration but augmented tissue congestion and hemorrhage. In conclusion, higher troponin I serum level and ECG changes were found in <b>passive</b> opium <b>smoking</b> groups.

Participants were 15 266 pregnant women of the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children’s Health Cohort. Data were extracted from self-reported questionnaires and biochemical assay results. Demographic determinants of low folate status were younger maternal age (adjusted OR (AOR) 1 · 48; 95 % CI 1 · 32, 1 · 66), lower educational level (AOR 1 · 27; 95 % CI 1 · 17, 1 · 39) and lower annual income (AOR 1 · 11; 95 % CI 1 · 01, 1 · 22). Plasma cotinine concentrations of 1 · 19 - 65 · 21 nmol/l increased the risk of low folate status (AOR 1 · 20; 95 % CI 1 · 10, 1 · 31) and concentrations > 65 · 21 nmol/l further increased the risk (AOR 1 · 91; 95 % CI 1 · 70, 2 · 14).

However, the exact causes of the disease are still not clear. Previous studies have identified several risk factors associated with asthma among certain ethnic and age groups, but little research has been done among Asians. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to analyze the associations between several risk factors and asthma among Asian females in California using the 2011 - 2012 California Health Interview Survey. The two outcome variables were reported current and lifetime asthma, and the key predictor variable was the exposure to <b>passive</b> indoor <b>smoking.</b> In this study, obesity, as defined by the Asian BMI cut-off points, was the only significant risk factor associated with both current and lifetime asthma; the ORs of having current asthma were 2. 37 for people who were obese compared to people who were not (95 % CI, 1. 29 - 4. 36), and the ORs of having lifetime asthma were 2. 10 for people who were obese compared to people who were not (95 % CI, 1. 23 - 3. 60), after controlling for other variables. Other variables found {{to be associated with the}} two outcomes differed. For current asthma, the ORs of having current asthma were 3. 19 for people who were extremely depressed during the past 30 days compared to people who were not (95 % CI, 1. 01 - 10. 16). For lifetime asthma, subjects who lived in the rural areas were 64 % less likely to have lifetime asthma than those who lived in the urban areas, after adjusting for other variables (95 % CI, 0. 14 - 0. 91).

METHODS: In a sample of 58 case subjects and 105 control subjects, hair nicotine concentrations were measured by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: With women whose hair nicotine concentrations were in the lowest quartile as the reference group, the odds ratio (OR) for small-for-gestational-age birth was increased among women with concentrations in the upper and two middle quartiles (OR= 4. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI]= 1. 5, 11. 5, and OR = 3. 2, 95 % CI= 1. 3, 8. 0).
