50|$|J.I.S. (Japan) and CSTB (France) <b>preheat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> {{with the}} safe inside until the {{temperature}} reaches the desired setting (as {{opposed to a}} sustained temperature of the rating), then the safe is cooled artificially (as opposed to naturally). Also, J.I.S. and CSTB only drop their safes from 13-15 feet (as opposed to 30). Rarely are safes dropped 15 ft or more and they are usually artificially cooled by the fire department. UL also runs an indirect explosion test on all safes. Additionally UL-768 certifies the combination lock against tampering. UL-140 certifies a relocking mechanism that will permanently lock the safe bolts, in case an electronic lock fails or a UL-768 rated lock is compromised.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} both {{crossing}} point methods {{and that of}} adiabatic reactor, to {{be discussed in the}} next section, is to derive the kinetic parameters, E and A, which can then be applied to estimate the critical size of a material. The crossing point method of Chen, incorporates the following procedure: packing the solid particles into a steel mesh basket that has a steel mesh cover, followed by placing two thermocouples into the sample, one positioned at the centreline and the other at a small distance away, then situating the basket in <b>the</b> <b>preheated</b> <b>oven</b> and recording <b>the</b> temperature by a data logger. This test is completed when the temperature difference between the two thermocouples’ reading disappears (Wang et al. 2006; Chen & Chong 1998; Chen 1999). The reaction rate is expressed by first order kinetics and an Arrhenius expression for the rate constant. The analysis remains valid at temperature higher than 100 °C, since water evaporation is ignored in the energy balance (Wang et al. 2006).|$|R

30|$|Commercially {{available}} p-type GaN substrate {{was used}} {{in the development of the}} present p-n heterojunction. Prior to the growth of the n-type ZnO nanorods, a NiO buffer layer was deposited by the following sol-gel method. A sol-gel of nickel acetate was prepared in the 2 -methoxyethanol having a concentration of 0.35 M, and di-ethanolamine was added dropwise under vigorous stirring at 60 °C for 2 h by keeping the 1 : 1 molar ratio of nickel acetate and di-ethanolamine constant. After the synthesis of the sol-gel, cleaned GaN substrate was spin coated with the prepared sol-gel three to five times for the deposition of a thin NiO buffer layer; consequently, the substrate was annealed at 180 °C for 20 min. After the annealing, the sample was left in <b>the</b> <b>preheated</b> <b>oven</b> for 4 h at 450 °C in order to have a pure phase of NiO. After the deposition of the NiO buffer layer, the substrates were spin coated two to three times with a seed layer of zinc acetate for the growth of the ZnO nanorods and likewise annealed at 120 °C for 20 min. Then, the annealed substrates containing the NiO buffer layer were dipped vertically in an equimolar 0.075 M precursor's solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine for 4 to 6 h at 90 °C. After the growth of the ZnO nanorods, the nanotubes were obtained by chemical etching using 5 M potassium chloride solution at 85 °C for 14 to 16 h.|$|R
