40|$|Improving {{nutrition}} {{contributes to}} productivity, economic development, and poverty reduction by getting better cognitive development, school performance, physical work capacity, and maintaining health status by reducing morbidity and mortality. Poor nutrition perpetuate {{the cycle of}} poverty. Community-Based Nutrition (CBN) {{is an important component}} of the National Nutrition Program, designed to build upon the Health Extension Program packages to improve nutritional status of under-five children and pregnant and lactating women. As part of this <b>program</b> <b>shift,</b> CBN training modules have been shortened and incorporated into the Integrated Refresher Training (IRT). The nutrition components of Integrated Refresher Training have not been assessed so far. This study aims to assess the quality of CBN component of integrated refresher training, stakeholder perceptions on the quality of training and change in the knowledge of HEWs. Institutional based cross-sectional study with both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods was used. Four Woredas were chosen purposively from a listing of all woredas receiving IRT module II in Amhara region from June-July 2012.

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{branches}}, rachis branches (i. e. nonfloral) and spikelets (i. e. floral), are produced during rice (Oryza sativa) inflorescence development. We previously {{reported that the}} ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (APO 1) gene, encoding an F-box-containing protein orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, suppresses precocious conversion of rachis branch meristems to spikelets to ensure generation of certain number of spikelets. Here, we identified four dominant mutants producing an increased number of spikelets and found that they are gain-of-function alleles of APO 1. The APO 1 expression levels are elevated in all four mutants, suggesting that an increase of APO 1 activity caused the delay in the <b>program</b> <b>shift</b> to spikelet formation. In agreement with this result, ectopic overexpression of APO 1 accentuated the APO 1 gain-of-function phenotypes. In the apo 1 -D dominant alleles, the inflorescence meristem starts to increase in size more vigorously than the wild type when switching to the reproductive development phase. This alteration in growth rate is opposite to what is observed with the apo 1 mutants that have a smaller inflorescence meristem. The difference in meristem size is caused by different rates of cell proliferation. Collectively, {{these results suggest that}} the level of APO 1 activity regulates the inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on this subject reveals there is considerable confusion regarding {{the meaning of the word}} 2 ̆ 2 repellent 2 ̆ 2 as it relates to animal control. Some people make a liberal interpretation and include any material or device that will alter the pattern of activity of an animal through response to sight, sound, taste, odor, or touch. Although such an interpretation may be valid, for this paper I would like to confine my discussion to 2 ̆ 2 chemical repellents 2 ̆ 2 [...] materials that, when applied to seeds, plants, or other materials being damaged by animals, will reduce depredation through taste, odor, or possibly irritation. The idea of using distasteful or foul-smelling materials to prevent losses from animals is not new and probably goes back to antiquity. Since World War II, however, increased importance has been placed on this method of 2 ̆ 2 control 2 ̆ 2, and research has been stepped up in recent years in an effort to develop more effective and useful materials to reduce losses by rodents, deer, rabbits, birds, and other animals that damage orchards, agricultural crops, and forest seeds and seedlings, and by commensal rats and mice that damage food packages, textiles, and other materials of economic importance. As many of you know, the Denver Center has played an important part in this work. Much of this research has been made possible through continuing grants from the U. S. Army. The Army 2 ̆ 7 s Electronics Command recently increased its support to speed up research on protecting cable from rodents because of damage being experienced in Vietnam. The search for chemical repellents also gained ground as a result of the recommendations of the Leopold Report, which stated, 2 ̆ 2 We further recommend that the [Bureau 2 ̆ 7 s] research <b>program</b> <b>shift</b> some of its attention from methods of killing animals to ways of preventing depredations by repelling, excluding, or frightening animals. 2 ̆ 2 To accomplish this, major changes have been made in our chemical screening and development program, and the outlook for improved contact repellents looks promising (Kverno et al., 1965) ...|$|E
40|$|Dutch {{secondary}} school economics education was never at rest. It currently finds itself {{once more in}} an interesting phase of transition. New developments of behavioural economics have been incorpo-rated into the exam subject matter while the deletion of Keynesian model making from the corpus triggers public debate. In this paper its {{one and a half}} century old history is described with a focus on the development of views on educational aims and the tools used to achieve these aims. The nineteenth and twentieth century history of economics teaching in the Netherlands runs from the aim to prepare the pupils for offices in trade and industry (the social efficiency argument), entering into a phase in which the aim was to arm pupils with the necessary analytical skills as part of a Bildung orientation, to the eighties when the ‘pupil-centredness’ came to the fore. This latest development was a reaction to the very Dutch peculiarity that {{secondary school}} pupils had to swallow quite a big deal of mathematical analysis and economic modelling. In terms of educational aims this period can be char-acterised as a confusion of means and ends. A twenty-first century development places aims and tools back where they belong. The newest program chooses as its starting point the trouble that occurs whenever agents enter the market: how to coordinate the various individual intentions when markets often fail? This is a breach with the old fashioned approach, which started with perfect competition and continues with cases of imperfection. However, this strong focus on how markets really work has come at the cost of a coher-ing macroeconomic corpus. Yet another commission is working {{on the development of the}} syllabus towards a macroeconomic tool of theoretical analysis: the New Keynesian Phillips Curve. This content is to enable pupils to also understand the current troubles of the economy with low interest rates, risk asymmetry and deflation. This most recent change is a sizable <b>program</b> <b>shift,</b> both in economics content and in pedagogy. Two tools are in use: one that structures the subject matter around economic concepts and real life con-texts, and one that promotes classroom experiments. Meanwhile, this so called Teulings program has a clear aim. It seeks to empower pupils in developing an ‘economic outlook on social phenomena’. Notwithstanding the discontinuity in the history, this approach is consistent with the original aims of Bildung as well as social efficienc...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of preterm birth is increasing worldwide. Some {{of the survivors}} of preterm birth {{will be affected by}} varying degrees of disabilities like lower cognitive or respiratory function. Moreover, the survivors will encounter an increased risk of non-communicable diseases like hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes, later in life. More knowledge is needed in order to prevent these adverse outcomes. Physical activity (PA) and exercise have well-established positive effects on several non-communicable diseases. In addition, there is growing evidence that physical activity has a positive effect on cognitive function. In study I and II, we used information from the conscript register and linked it to birth characteristics in the medical birth register in order to associate preterm birth to later exercise capacity and cognitive function. The results revealed that young men born preterm have lower exercise capacity than men born at term, with a step-wise relation to gestational age. Furthermore, cognitive function was positively associated with increases in exercise capacity, across all gestational ages. Men born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks gestational age) with the lowest exercise capacity, exhibited the lowest results on the cognitive function test. To evaluate if a reduced exercise capacity in young adulthood could be a consequence of less physical activity in childhood, 71 children born extremely preterm and 87 controls born at term, wore an activity monitor on the wrist for seven days at 6. 5 years of age. Extremely preterm boys were less active than term boys, which could be linked to severe brain injury during infancy, which was more prevalent in preterm boys. There was no statistically significant difference in physical activity when comparing all preterm born children with controls. From study I-III we conclude that preterm birth and morbidities during infancy are associated with level of PA in childhood. Furthermore, prematurity can be correlated to lower exercise capacity in young adulthood and exercise capacity is related to cognitive function. Further studies need to reveal if increased PA could mitigate these late outcomes of preterm birth. Exercise capacity and physical activity could be affected by pulmonary function. Children born preterm may develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in infancy, a chronic lung disease which may affect respiratory function through childhood and into adult life. The diagnostic criteria for the disease lack objectivity and may not reflect the level of respiratory function. To test the utility of a physiological definition of BPD severity, 200 infants born very and extremely preterm had a modified oxygen reduction test at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Values of shift (kPa), ventilation:perfusion ratio, and shunt (%) were derived from analysis of the shape and position of the saturation (SpO 2) vs pressure of inspired oxygen curve, using a dedicated computer <b>program.</b> <b>Shift</b> was shown to be the most useful measure, approximately corresponding to the extra supplemental oxygen required for a sick infant to achieve the same SpO 2 as a respiratory healthy infant. We conclude that shift could provide a physiological based, continuous outcome measure of BPD severity, with the possibility to increase objectivity of BPD diagnostics. More studies are needed to evaluate short-term repeatability and to understand the prognostic value...|$|E
