We design, evaluate and compare different methods for constructing models for script event prediction: given a <b>partial</b> <b>chain</b> {{of events in}} a script, predict other events {{that are likely to}} belong to the script. Our work aims to answer key questions about how best to (1) identify representative event chains from a source text, (2) gather statistics from the event chains, and (3) choose ranking functions for predicting new script events.

40|$|Neutrophils kill invading {{microbes}} with lethal {{concentrations of}} oxygen metabolites. Generation of these metabolites {{is accompanied by}} a cyanide-insensitive oxygen burst during which the rate of oxygen consumption increases up to 20 -fold (1). The mechanism by which consumed oxygen is transformed into lethal concentrations of the oxygen metabolites, superoxide anion (O~-), t H 202, and. OH, is of current interest (2). On the basis of the preliminary studies, we have proposed that an electrontransport chain in the neutrophil is responsible for oxygen consumption (3). We suggested that the electron-transport chain may exist as two <b>partial</b> <b>chains</b> in resting neutrophils, one in the plasma membrane and the other in one of the cytoplasmic granule membranes.

40|$|To study protein nascent chain folding during biosynthesis, we {{investigate}} the folding behavior of models of hydrophobic and polar (HP) chains at growing length using both two-dimensional square lattice model and an optimized three-dimensional 4 -state discrete off-lattice model.

40|$|International audienceAutophobic {{dewetting}} of a thin polystyrene (PS) {{layer on}} a cross-linked PS film has been studied with optical microscopy and neutron reflection. For two different cross-linking densities, the increase in contact angle and the fast decrease of both dewetting velocity and slippage length {{as a function of}} dewetting time indicate that the dewetting dynamics is controlled by the penetration of free linear polymer chains into the cross-linked film and the concomitant stretching of the network mesh: the loss of entropy of the network favors dewetting, while <b>partial</b> <b>chain</b> interdiffusion between the layers increases friction and eventually stabilizes the top film. In a second series of experiment, we modified the entropy of the network by swelling it with linear chains from a reservoir of identical polymers prior to depositing the top PS film. Once equilibrated, a stable interface without considerable interdiffusion between network and top film was achieved. Without such interdiffusion, a constant contact angle and a constant slippage length were observed...|$|E

Results showed Avrami exponents appearing {{in a relatively}} narrow range (i. e., between 3. 76 and 2. 77), which suggested a three-dimensional spherulitic growth and instantaneous nucleation at high cooling rates. The nucleation mechanism changed to sporadic at low rates, with both crystallization processes being detected in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) cooling traces. Formation of crystals was hindered as the material crystallized because of {{a decrease in the}} motion of molecular chains. Two secondary nucleation constants were derived from calorimetric data by applying the methodology proposed by Vyazovkin and Sbirrazzuoli through the estimation of effective activation energies. In fact, typical non-isothermal crystallization analysis based on the determination of crystal growth by optical microscopy allowed secondary nucleation constants of 3. 07 × 105 K 2 and 1. 42 × 105 K 2 to be estimated. Microstructure of sutures was characterized by a stacking of lamellae perpendicularly oriented to the fiber axis and the presence of interlamellar and interfibrillar amorphous regions.

40|$|We {{report a}} new ribonucleic acid (RNA) base {{discrete}} state model, which was first developed in our lab {{and designed to}} provide an efficient and accurate way of representing RNA structures toward RNA three-dimensional structure predictions. Since RNA free energy is largely determined by base pairs and base stackings instead of backbone trajectories, we directly model the RNA base configurations with respect to its previous one along the sequence. This is in sharp contrast with all previous works where the backbone trace was represented. To test how faithfully the discrete model can reproduce the chain trace in continuous space, we randomly select <b>partial</b> <b>chains</b> from the native structure of 23 S ribosome RNA and re-grow them. The rms distance of the re-grown structures from the native ones is ∼ 1. 7 Å for an optimized 16 -state discrete model and gradually increases to ∼ 3. 3 Å for long chains of length 50. The efficiency is also good, e. g. the program will finish within several tens of second for long loops of length 50.

Even in the pure state, Cer and particularly SM exhibited complex endotherms, and their thermal properties did not vary in a predictable way with changes in structure. In some cases, e. g. C 18 : 0 SM, atomic force microscopy revealed coexisting lamellar domains made of a single lipid. <b>Partial</b> <b>chain</b> interdigitation and metastable crystalline states were deemed responsible for the complex behavior. SM:Cer mixtures (90 : 10 mol ratio) gave rise to bilayers containing separate SM-rich and Cer-rich domains. In vesicles made of more complex mixtures (SM:PE:Chol, 2 : 1 : 1), {{it is known that}} sphingomyelinase degradation of SM to Cer is accompanied by vesicle aggregation and release of aqueous contents. These vesicles did not reveal observable domain separation by confocal microscopy. Vesicle aggregation occurred at a faster rate for those bilayers that appeared to be more fluid according to differential scanning calorimetry. Content efflux rates measured by fluorescence spectroscopy were highest with C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1 SM, and in general those rates did not vary regularly with other physical {{properties of}} SM or Cer.

For energy production potential water energy is exploited with the use of useful volume of a reservoir during the day. During the power plant operation waves are created that cause a different speed of water level changes. When the discharge through turbines increases, it creates a negative wave above the power plant and a positive wave below the power plant. When the discharge through turbines is closing, it creates a positive wave above the hydro plant and a negative wave below the hydro plant. We simulated the operations on the hydro plant Brežice and hydro plant Mokrice and analysed the activity in the designed Brežice and Mokrice reservoir and also in the natural channel below the power plant Mokrice. We simulated three different types of operations: a parallel operation, when all power plants on {{the lower part of}} the Sava River open the discharge through the turbines at the same time; a sequential operation, when the lower hydro plant opens a discharge through turbines in the moment a wave from the upper hydro plant reaches it; and an optimal sequential operation, when the lower hydro plant opens a discharge through the turbines in the moment before the wave from the upper hydro plant reaches it and in the right moment that it does not create a rise of the water level.

DESIGN: Prospective study (April 1, 1997, through January 1, 2008). SETTING: Tertiary academic children's hospital. PATIENTS: Two hundred forty-eight children (268 ears) underwent <b>partial</b> ossicular <b>chain</b> reconstruction using a shaped block of tragal cartilage interposed between {{the head of the}} stapes and an underlay tympanic membrane reconstruction along with tragal cartilage and its perichondrium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anatomical and audiologic results were evaluated according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines. χ² Tests and multivariate analysis were used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 10. 9 years. Single-stage surgery was performed in 124 ears (46. 3 %) (62. 9 % for cholesteatomas and 32. 3 % for retraction pockets). Second-look patients (53. 7 %) included 93. 8 % of staged surgery. Audiometric results were available for 222 ears at 1 year and for 78 ears at 5 years. Closure of the average air-bone gap (ABG) to within 20 dB was achieved in 62. 2 % of ears at 1 year. The mean (SD) preoperative and 1 -year postoperative ABGs were 25 (11. 8) dB and 18. 9 (10. 3) dB, respectively. Anatomical results were satisfactory in 87. 3 %. No cases of extrusion, resorption, or displacement of the cartilage were encountered. No statistically significant difference was found between audiometric results at 1 and 5 years. Multivariate analysis showed a significant negative correlation between preoperative and postoperative ABGs and between postoperative otitis media with effusion and postoperative ABG (P <. 05).

40|$|Recently, charge {{balanced}} polyampholytes (PA) {{have been}} found to form tough and self-healing hydrogels. This class of physical hydrogels have a very high equilibrated polymer concentration in water (ca. 40 - 50 wt%), and are strongly viscoelastic. They are synthesized by random copolymerization of equal amounts of oppositely charged monomers at a high concentration, followed by a dialysis process of the small counter-ions and co-ions in water. The randomly distributed, opposite charges of the polymer form multiple ionic bonds of intra-and inter-chains with strength distribution. The strong interchain bonds, stabilized by topological entanglement, serve as quasi-permanent crosslinks, imparting the elasticity, while the weak bonds, both inter-and intra-chains, reversibly break and re-form to dissipate energy to toughen the materials. In this work, we intend to clarify the structure of the physical PA hydrogels from the tensile behaviors of the PA hydrogels. To clarify the structure and its formation mechanism, we analysed the tensile behaviors of the samples before and after the dialysis. We separated the quasi-permanent crosslinking of strong inter-chain bonds and the dynamic crosslinking of weak inter-chain bonds by using a combined model that consists of the Upper Convected Maxwell model and the Gent strain hardening model. The model fitting of the tensile behaviors extracts quantitative structural parameters, including the densities of weak and strong inter-chain bonds and the theoretical finite extensibility of polymer chains. Based on the fitting results of the combined model, the structural parameters of <b>partial</b> <b>chains</b> at a fixed observation time, including the Kuhn number, Kuhn length, and chain conformation, are determined using the scaling theory.

This study supports the use of HA ossicular prostheses and, in particular, the use of the malleus for ossicular chai...|$|R
40|$|Current {{approaches}} to partial scan {{may not necessarily}} cover all faults, in particular the faults introduced by the <b>partial</b> scan <b>chain</b> (or the test machine) itself. Typically, the user does not have complete control on the fault coverage achieved by the partial scan. In this paper, we introduce a new partial scan assignment algorithm that not only ensures user-specified coverage of all target faults in the object machine but also effectively addresses the complete coverage of faults in the test (or partial scan) machine. The algorithm allows a trade-off of increased test application time to reduce scan chain size, while maintaining a user-specified level of fault coverage. For a given scan chain, a single application of a test sequence may not detect a particular fault. We raise the probability of detecting the fault by repeating the test sequence. Experimental results on large sequential benchmark circuits demonstrate that the model we use predicts this trade-off consistently and accu [...] ...|$|R
