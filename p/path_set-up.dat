40|$|Supporting {{multiple}} applications {{is a critical}} feature of an NoC when several different applications are integrated into a single modern and complex multi-core system-on-chip or chip multiprocessor. In this paper, a novel reconfigurable architecture for networks-on-chip (NoC) on which arbitrary application-specific topologies can be implemented with backtracking which provides guaranteed throughput is presented. The proposed NoC supports {{multiple applications}} by configuring its topology to the topology which matches the input application and also supports a dead-and-live lock free dynamic <b>path</b> <b>set-up</b> scheme. The re-configurability {{can be achieved by}} changing the inter-router connections to some predefined configuration corresponding to the application. This increases the support for higher number of applications which further increases the traffic congestion leading to path blockages and substantially to data loss. To manage the blockages and to support a dead and live lock free dynamic <b>path</b> <b>set-up</b> scheme we go for back-tracking. This can be achieved with an efficient and proper design of on-chip switching nodes. This paper first introduces the proposed reconfigurable topology and then deals with the back-tracking feature.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new algorithms for {{dynamic routing}} of locally restorable bandwidth guaranteed paths. Dynamic routing implies routing of requests that arrive one-by-one with no a priori knowledge of future arrivals, and so necessitating use of on-line algorithms. Local restorability means that upon a link or node failure, the first node upstream from the failure {{must be able}} to switch the path to an alternate preset outgoing link so that path continuity with bandwidth guarantees is restored by a strictly local decision. The motivation for use of local restoration is that it is much faster than path restoration because failure information does not have to propagate to the source. Local restoration implies that to successfully route a <b>path</b> <b>set-up</b> request an active (primary) path, and a bypass backup path for every link and node used by the active path must be determined. This locally restorable on-line routing problem is becoming particularly important in optical networks and in MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) based networks due to the trend toward dynamic provisioning of bandwidth guaranteed or wavelength paths. To prevent excessive resource usage for backup paths, and to satisfy the implicit service provider requirement of optimizing network resource utilization so as {{to increase the number of}} potential future demands that can be routed, it is desirable to judiciously share backup paths while still maintaining local restorability. The best sharing performance is achieved if the routing of every path in progress in the network is known to the routing algorithm at the time of a new <b>path</b> <b>set-up.</b> However, this requires maintenance of non-aggregated or per-path information which is not often desirable particularly when distributed routing is preferred.

40|$|Goal {{of traffic}} {{engineering}} in packet networks {{is to improve}} the network performance by providing support for congestion management, higher bandwidth utilization (or throughput), and QoS or priority-based services. Open shortest path first with traffic engineering extensions (OSPF-TE) (J. Moy, April 1998) and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) protocols are commonly viewed as possible solutions. Both, the OSPF-TE with optimized link weights or MPLS with explicit optimal <b>path</b> <b>set-ups,</b> work ideally under static network conditions with a known demand-matrix. However, these methods do not provide scalability and flexibility to adapt to arbitrary, dynamic demand patterns in large networks. A novel traffic engineering scheme based on the virtual space (VS) routing (G. P. Saraph and P. Singh) is proposed here, which has the scalability, flexibility, and robustness to rapidly adapt to arbitrary, dynamic load conditions in large networks. Simulations are carried out on randomly constructed 40, 80, and 200 -node networks with arbitrary demand matrices, which demonstrate excellent capability of the VS routing in terms of load balancing, packet throughput, and congestion avoidance. The proposed VS scheme is used for path selection in MPLS and integrated with the signaling protocols for path establishment, such as the constraint based routing (CR-LDP) (J.

In this paper, we address the timing yield problem for sequential circuits and propose a statistical approach to handle it. In our approach, we consider the spatial and path reconvergence correlations between <b>path</b> delays, <b>set-up</b> time and hold time constraints, as well as clock skew due to process variations. We propose a method to get the timing yield based on the delay distributions of register-to-register paths in the circuit. On average, the timing yield results obtained by our approach have average errors of less than 1. 0 % in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results show that shortest path variations and clock skew due to process variations have considerable impact on circuit timing, which could bias the timing yield results. In addition, the correlation between longest and shortest path delays is not significant. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study {{a problem}} {{motivated}} by a scheme for supporting fast restoration in MPLS and optical networks. In this local restoration scheme detour <b>paths</b> are <b>set-up</b> a priori and network resources are pre-reserved exclusively for carrying rerouted traffic under network failures. (i. e. they do not carry any traffic under normal working conditions). The detours are such that failed links can be bypassed locally from the first node that is upstream from the failures. This local bypass activation from the first detection point for failures along with the dedication of network resources for handling failures permits very fast recovery times, a critical requirement for these networks. By allowing sharing of the dedicated resources among different detours the local restoration scheme results in efficient utilization of the pre-reserved network capacity. In this paper {{we are interested in}} the problem of dedicating the least amount of the currently available network capacity for protection, while guaranteeing fast restoration to the existing traffic along with any traffic that may be admitted in the future. We show that the problem is NP-hard, and give a 2 -approximation algorithm for the problem. We also show that the integrality gap of a natural relaxation of our problem is Ω(n), thus establishing that any LP-based approach using this relaxation cannot yield a better approximation algorithm for our problem. ...|$|R

Moreover, link residual bandwidth information, i. e., the link’s capability of routing future LSPs, is also incorporated.

Broadband access {{is supported by a}} range of wireless and wireline technologies. Well known representatives are WLAN and UMTS for wireless and xDSL for wireline access. However, the highly varying nature of wireless channels and the crosstalk behavior of the DSL channel are typical traits, and most challenging to combat. Moreover, the stringent requirements of real-time applications require enhancements in service delivery. The tremendous interest in communication has driven the deployment of new access systems. Hence, for the End-to-End point of view, the service delivery multifarious due to the heterogeneity of the underlying transport network.

We present new constructive designs for nonblocking multi-stage switching networks for realizing broadcast connections. Our nonblocking connecting capability is based on the adherence to a connection <b>path</b> <b>set-up</b> strategy as implemented by a network control algorithm. In three-stage versions of our designs wherein there are.,. switch modules in each of the first and third stages, n input ports on each-switch module in the first stage and n output ports on each switch module in the third stage, the strategy demands that any broadcast connection be realized using at most z middle switches, where 1 ~ z ~ min{n- I,.,. }. We prove that if the number of switch modules in the middle stage, m, satisfies m> min(n- l) (z +.,. 1 /,"), the resulting network is nonblocking for broadcast assignments. This condition on the number of switch modules in the middle stage represents an improvement from O (n.,.) to O (n log.,. /log log.,.) relative to previously known results. We present a linear algorithm for satisfying new broadcast connection requests which employs the strategy. Our results represent the best known explicit constructions with limited numbers of stages relative to both crosspoint and control algorithm complexity. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} feature of MPLS networks is local restoration where detour <b>paths</b> are <b>set-up</b> a priori. The detour is such that failed links or nodes can be bypassed locally from the first node that is upstream from the failures. This local bypass activation from the first detection point for failures permits much faster recovery than end-to-end path based mechanisms that require failure information to propagate to the network edges. However, local restoration of bandwidth guaranteed connections can be expensive in the additional network capacity needed. Hence, {{it is important to}} minimize and share restoration capacity. The problem of routing with local restoration requirements has been studied previously in a dynamic on-line setting. However, there are no satisfactory algorithms for the problem of preprovisioning fast restorable connections when the aggregate traffic demands are known (as would be the case when a set of routers are to be interconnected over an optical network or for pre-provisioned ATM over MPLS overlays). The contribution of this paper is a fast combinatorial approximation algorithm for maximizing throughput when the routed traffic is required to be locally restorable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first combinatorial algorithm for the problem with a performance guarantee. Our algorithm is a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS), i. e., for any given # > 0, it guarantees (1 + #) -factor closeness to the optimal solution, and runs in time polynomial in the network size and #.

With this <b>set-up,</b> <b>path</b> following (in space) and inter-vehicle coordination (in time) are essentially decoupled.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm for dynamic routing of bandwidth guaranteed multicast tunnels with failure backup. The multicast routing problem arises in many contexts {{such as the}} routing of point-to-multipoint label switched paths in Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Networks, {{and the provision of}} bandwidth guaranteed services under the “hose ” model [4]. Failure backup implies that when a multicast tree is <b>set-up</b> alternate backup <b>paths</b> be also <b>set-up</b> so that the multicast is unaffected by single link or node failures. For dynamic routing, the multicast routing requests arrive one-by-one and there is no a priori knowledge regarding future requests. We believe {{that this is the first}} paper that addresses the issue of multicast routing with failure backup. Each multicast request consists of a source, a set of receivers, and a bandwidth requirement �. Offline multicast routing algorithms cannot be used since they require a priori knowledge of all multicast tunnel requests that are to be routed. The newly developed algorithm is an on-line algorithm that generates a reservedbandwidth multicast tree with additional backup links that make the multicast tree resilient to single element failures in the network. It shares backup bandwidth when possible and only uses link usage information obtainable in a distributed manner. ...|$|R

Deformed nonconductive 3 Y–ZrO 2 samples were concave shaped, whereas the composite samples exhibited a different behaviour depending on the electrical current <b>path</b> within the <b>set-up.</b> A convex shape was obtained when the current was freely flowing through them, while they started to become concave shaped when the samples were separated from the graphite pressing punches by relatively low conductive silicon carbide disks. The secondary titanium carbonitride (TiCN) phase in the composite materials exhibited a grain boundary pinning effect, which limited coarsening of their microstructure. The influence of current flow on {{the shape of the}} deformed ceramic samples was interpreted in terms of the temperature distribution generated during hot deformation. Finite-element simulations, coupling thermal, electrical and mechanical fields, were used to explain the deformation behaviour of the different samples.
