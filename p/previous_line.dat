"Complexion" [...] in line six, {{can have}} two meanings: 1) The outward {{appearance}} of the face {{as compared with the}} sun ("the eye of heaven") in the <b>previous</b> <b>line,</b> or 2) the older sense of the word in relation to The four humours. [...] In Shakespeare's time, [...] "complexion" [...] carried both outward and inward meanings, as did the word [...] "temperate" [...] (externally, a weather condition; internally, a balance of humours). The second meaning of [...] "complexion" [...] would communicate that the beloved's inner, cheerful, and temperate disposition is constant, unlike the sun, which may be blotted out on a cloudy day. The first meaning is more obvious, meaning of a negative change in his outward appearance.|$|E

Taylor added that she is often the first one to record so she has to imagine how the <b>previous</b> <b>line</b> would be said.

500|$|In 2010, {{a student}} from Azerbaijan was {{verbally}} attacked {{by a group of}} other foreigners in a bar in Prague. The student left the bar and proceeded to his friend's car, being followed by the group who continued to verbally attack him and his family and stating that [...] "the issue needs to be solved immediately". The student recovered a knife from the car and took a stand. Thereafter one of the foreigners started punching him. The student stabbed one of the four attackers and then engaged in fight with another, whom he stabbed in the leg and who bled to death. The Municipal Court in Prague convicted the Azerbaijanian student of intentional infliction of bodily harm with excusable motive and sentenced him to two year in prison. The decision was overturned by the High Court in Prague who considered the death an outcome of legitimate self-defense. The Supreme State Attorney mounted an extraordinary appeal to the Supreme Court, which however confirmed the acquittal, noting that the verbal abuse continued even after the victim got into the car and he could thus legitimately perceive it as an ongoing attack. The Supreme Court also refused the Municipal Court's <b>previous</b> <b>line</b> of argumentation that the victim could have easily left the place once in the car (as there is no duty to retreat under Czech law) as well as its reasoning that the threat did not reach such an intensity as to justify a lethal defense.|$|E
