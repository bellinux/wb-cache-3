As {{a result}} of {{increasing}} cost, efficiency and environmental pressures ferrochrome producers strive towards lower overall energy consumption. Increases in local electricity prices have placed particular pressure on South African ferrochrome producers. Pelletised chromite pre–reduction is likely the currently applied ferrochrome production process option with the lowest specific electricity consumption. In this process fine chromite, together with a carbonaceous reductant and a clay binder is milled, pelletised and pre–reduced. In this dissertation it is demonstrated that {{the functioning of the}} clay binder in this process is not as straightforward as in conventional metallurgical pelletisation processes, since the cured <b>pre–reduced</b> <b>pellets</b> are characterised by an oxidised outer layer and a pre–reduced core. Conventional performance characteristics of clay binders (e. g. compressive strength and abrasion resistance) therefore have to be evaluated in both oxidative sintering and reducing environments. Two clay samples, i. e. attapulgite and bentonite, were obtained from a local ferrochrome producer and investigated within the context of this study. Results indicated that the compressive and abrasion resistance strengths of oxidative sintered pellets for both clays were substantially better than that of <b>pre–reduced</b> <b>pellets.</b> Thus, although the objective of the chromite pre–reduced process is to achieve maximum pre–reduction, the strength of pre–reduced chromite pellets is significantly enhanced by the thin oxidised outer layer. The strength of the bentonite–containing pellets was found to be superior in both pre–reducing and oxidative sintering environments. This is significant, since the attapulgite clay is currently the preferred option at both South African ferrochrome smelting plants applying the pelletised chromite pre–reduction process. Although not quantitatively investigated, thermo–mechanical analysis indicated that the hot strength of the attapulgite pellets could be weaker than the bentonite–containing pellets. The possible effects of clay binder selection on the level of pre–reduction were also investigated, since it could have substantial efficiency and economic implications. For both case study clays investigated, higher clay contents resulted in lower pre–reduction levels. This has relevance within the industrial process, since higher clay contents are on occasion utilised to achieve improved green strength. The average pre–reduction of the bentonite–containing pellets were also consistently higher than that of the attapulgite–containing pellets. Again, this is significant, since the attapulgite clay is currently the preferred option. In general the case study results presented in this dissertation indicated that {{it is unlikely that the}} performance of a specific clay binder in this relatively complex process can be predicted; based only on the chemical, surface chemical and mineralogical characterisation of the clay.

40|$|MSc (Engineering Sciences in Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Ferrochrome (FeCr) is a crude alloy {{containing}} chromium (Cr) {{and iron}} (Fe). FeCr is mainly {{used for the}} production of stainless steel, which is an important modern-day alloy. FeCr is produced from chromite ore through various smelting methods. In this study, the focus was on the pelletised chromite pre-reduction process, which is also referred to as the solid state reduction of chromite. In this process, fine chromite ore, a clay binder and a carbon reductant are dry milled, agglomerated (pelletised) and pre-reduced (solid state reduction) in a rotary kiln. The <b>pre-reduced</b> <b>pellets</b> are then charged hot, immediately after exiting the rotary kiln, into a closed submerged arc furnace (SAF). This production process option has the lowest specific energy consumption (SEC), i. e. MWh/ton FeCr produced, of all the FeCr production processes that are commercially applied. Other advantages associated with the application of the pelletised chromite pre-reduction process are that it eliminates the use of chromite fines, has a high Cr recovery, and produces low sulphur- (S) and silicon (Si) -containing FeCr. The main disadvantage of the pelletised chromite pre-reduction process is that it requires extensive metallurgical control due to the variances in the levels of pre-reduction achieved and carbon content of the pre-reduced pelletised furnace feed material. This implies that the metallurgical carbon balance has to be changed regularly to prevent the process from becoming carbon deficient (also referred to as ‘under coke’) or over carbon (also referred to as ‘over coke’). The analytical technique currently applied to determine the level of chromite pre-reduction is time consuming, making it difficult and expensive to deal with large numbers of samples. In an attempt to develop a technique that would be faster to determine the level of chromite pre-reduction, a new analytical method using a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), image processing and computational techniques was investigated in this study. Metallurgical grade chromite (< 1 mm), anthracite breeze (< 1 mm), and fine FeCr (< 1 mm) that were used to prepare pellets in the laboratory, as well as industrially produced <b>pre-reduced</b> <b>pellets</b> that had already been milled in preparation for the determination of the pre-reduction level with wet chemical analysis were received from a large South African FeCr producer. These laboratory prepared pellets and the industrially produced pellet mixtures were considered in this investigation. Samples were moulded in resin and polished in order to obtain SEM micrographs of the polished cross sections. Elements with higher molecular weights are indicated by lighter greyscale, while elements with lower molecular weights are indicated by darker greyscale in SEM micrographs. This basic principle was applied {{in the development of the}} new analytical technique to determine the level of chromite pre-reduction, with the hypothesis that the pixel count of white pixels (representing metallised particles), divided by the combined pixel count of white (representing metallised particles) and grey (representing chromite particles) pixels would be directly related to the level of chromite pre-reduction determined with the current wet chemical method. This hypothesis can be mathematically expressed as: The newly-developed analytical method was validated by correlating the white pixel% calculated with the chromite pre-reduction levels (%) determined with wet chemical analysis of laboratory prepared and industrially produced pellet mixtures, which had R 2 values of 0. 998 and 0. 919, respectively. This suggests that the method can be used to determine chromite pre-reduction accurately. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of ferrochrome is an energy intensive process. At present, the pelletised chromite pre-reduction process {{is most likely}} the ferrochrome production process with the lowest specific energy consumption, i. e. MW h/t ferrochrome produced. Higher chromite pre-reduction levels correspond to lower specific energy consumptions. It was previously proven that various compounds could enhance the level of chromite pre-reduction. In this paper the effect of CaCO 3 addition on pelletised chromite pre-reduction is presented. CaCO 3 (as limestone) is already used as a flux in some FeCr production processes, hence its use does not constitute the addition of an extra raw material. Results indicated that CaCO 3 addition enhance the level of chromite pre-reduction achieved significantly, which could results in substantial specific energy consumption improvements. However, CaCO 3 addition caused severe decreases in both compressive and abrasion strengths of <b>pre-reduced</b> <b>pellets,</b> which {{is unlikely to be}} negated by mitigation measures. The addition of CaCO 3 in the pelletised chromite pre-reduction process is therefore likely to result in the formation of excessively fine feed materials. In practise, this reduces the usefulness of this technique for submerged arc furnace ferrochrome production significantly, since excessive fines in the feed material are likely to result in increased operational instabilities, equipment damage and safety risks. TGA and thermochemical calculations also indicated that CO 2 released from the CaCO 3 will result in in situ carbon and energy consumption, which is an additional negative associated with its use as an additive during pre-reduction of composite chromite pellets. Although this paper was not specifically aimed at obtaining mechanistic information, thermo-mechanical analysis indicated that especially iron pre-reduction rates were enhanced by CaCO 3 addition.
