5|$|Small-scale wind <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> name {{given to}} wind {{generation}} systems {{with the capacity}} to produce up to 50kW of electrical power. Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint. Wind turbines {{have been used for}} household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas.|$|E
5|$|Solar <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated {{solar power systems}} use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.|$|E

5|$|Solar <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{conversion}} of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using {{concentrated solar power}} (CSP).

5|$|In {{international}} politics, food <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use {{of agriculture}} {{as a means}} of political control whereby one nation or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E

25|$|The {{commodities}} {{within an}} electric market generally consist of two types: power and energy. <b>Power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> metered net electrical transfer rate {{at any given}} moment and is measured in megawatts (MW). Energy is electricity that flows through a metered point for a given period and is measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).|$|E
25|$|It {{is because}} of these facts that proponents argue that nuclear fission <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> safest means {{currently}} available to entirely replace the use of fossil fuels, and pro-nuclear environmentalists argue {{that a combination of}} both nuclear energy and renewable energy would be the fastest, safest, and cheapest way forward.|$|E

25|$|Electrical loads {{consuming}} {{alternating current}} power consume both real power and reactive power. The vector sum of real and reactive <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> apparent power. The presence of reactive power causes {{the real power}} {{to be less than}} the apparent power, and so, the electric load has a power factor of less than 1.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{harvesting}} (also {{known as}} power harvesting or energy scavenging or ambient <b>power)</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{process by which}} energy is derived from external sources (e.g., solar power, thermal energy, wind energy, salinity gradients, and kinetic energy, also known as ambient energy), captured, and stored for small, wireless autonomous devices, like those used in wearable electronics and wireless sensor networks.|$|E

25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{the power}} factor of an AC {{electrical power system}} {{is defined as the}} ratio of the real power flowing to the load to the apparent power in the circuit, and is a dimensionless number in the closed interval of −1 to 1. A power factor of less than one means that the voltage and current waveforms are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous product of the two waveforms (V × I). Real <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time. Apparent <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> product of the current and voltage of the circuit. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power will be greater than the real power. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source, which is normally considered the generator.|$|E
