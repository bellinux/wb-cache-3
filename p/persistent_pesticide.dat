Pesticides have been widely distributed and their traces can be detected {{in all areas of}} the environment (air, water and soil). Despite the ban of DDT and HCH in India, they are still in use, both in domestic and agricultural settings. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the production and consumption of <b>persistent</b> organic <b>pesticides,</b> their maximum residual limit (MRL) and the presence of <b>persistent</b> organic <b>pesticides</b> in multicomponent environmental samples (air, water and soil) from India.

40|$|Abstract. Cores {{from two}} marshes along the {{southern}} shore of Lake Erie were 210 Pb age-dated and analyzed for <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticide</b> pollutants using column chromatographic separation and analysis with gas chromatography. Soils in both watersheds have {{low to very low}} permeability and are domin-ated by a very poorly drained silty clay. Land-use practices in the watersheds of either marsh changed little since 1950; however, both watersheds are marked by decreased area dedicated to orchards and concurrent increase in residential and road area. The increase in grain size in recent years may be associated with a period of high water in Lake Erie since the early 1970 s. The pesticide accumulation rates were calculated and indicate an airborne source for HCHs and endrin and possibly current illegal usage of DDT. The ratio of metabolite to parent molecule did not appear to change with sediment age. Also, there appeared to be a delay between pesticide application and deposition in the marshes...|$|E

Alaska Native (AN) {{women may be}} at higher risk of exposure to these endocrine disrupting chemicals, which may contribute to breast cancer in this population. Objective: To measure the association between exposure to select environmental chemicals and breast cancer among AN women. Design: A case–control study of 170 women (75 cases, 95 controls) recruited from the AN Medical Center from 1999 to 2002. Participants provided urine and serum samples. Serum was analyzed for 9 <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticides,</b> 34 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and 8 polybrominated diethyl ether (PBDE) congeners. Urine was analyzed for 10 phthalate metabolites. We calculated geometric means (GM) and compared cases and controls using logistic regression. Results: Serum concentrations of most pesticides and 3 indicator PCB congeners (PCB- 138 / 158; PCB- 153, PCB- 180) were lower in case women than controls. BDE- 47 was significantly higher in case women (GM= 38. 8 ng/g lipid) than controls (GM= 25. 1 ng/g lipid) (p= 0. 04). <b>Persistent</b> <b>pesticides,</b> PCBs, and most phthalate metabolites were not associated with case status in univariate logistic regression. The odds of being a case were higher for those with urinary mono-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) concentrations that were above the median; this relationship was seen in both univariate (OR 2. 16, 95 % CI 1. 16 – 4. 05, p= 0. 02) and multivariable (OR 2. 43, 95 % CI 1. 13 – 5. 25, p= 0. 02) logistic regression. Women with oestrogen receptor (ER) –/progesterone receptor (PR) -tumour types tended to have higher concentrations of <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticides</b> than did ER+/PR+ women, although these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Exposure to the parent compound of the phthalate metabolite MEHP {{may be associated with}} breast cancer.

In this study, we isolated an endosulfan-degrading fungus from the activated sludge from an industrial wastewater treatment plant. Through repetitive enrichment and successive subculture in media containing endosulfan as the sole carbon source, a fungus designated CHE 23 was isolated. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, strain CHE 23 {{was assigned to the}} genus Penicillium sp. In a mineral salt medium with 50  mg/l endosulfan as the sole source carbon, CHE 23 removed the added endosulfan in a period of six days. To verify the decrease in endosulfan toxicity due to the activity of the fungus, we performed genotoxicity tests trough the single cell gel electrophoresis assay or comet assay, with Eisenia fetida as the bioindicator species. This organism was exposed to the supernatants of the culture of the fungus and endosulfan. Our results indicated that the genotoxicity of endosulfan was completely reduced due the activity of this fungus. These results suggest that the Penicillium sp. CHE 23 strain can be used to degrade endosulfan residues and/or for water and soil bioremediation processes without causing toxicity problems, which are probably due to the generation of no-toxic metabolites during biodegradation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Food security, {{nutritional}} quality and safety vary widely around the world. Reaching these three goals {{is one of}} the major challenges for the near future. Up to now, industrialized production methods have clearly shown severe limitations such as a worldwide contamination of the food chain and water by <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues, and reduced nutrient and flavor contents through low-cost intensive food production and/or processing. In line with several published literature reviews, the French Agency for Food Safety (AFSSA) performed under my coordination an up-to-date exhaustive and critical evaluation of the nutritional and sanitary quality of organic food. This review is based on the AFSSA report issued and recently published studies. The major points are: 1 / organic plant products contain more dry matter and minerals (Fe, Mg); and contain more anti-oxidant micronutrients such as phenols and salicylic acid, 2 / organic animal products contain more polyunsaturated fatty acids, 3 / data on carbohydrate, protein and vitamin levels are insufficiently documented, 4 / 94 – 100 % of organic food does not contain any pesticide residues, 5 / organic vegetables contain far less nitrates, about 50 % less; and 6 / organic cereals contain overall similar levels of mycotoxins as conventional ones. Thus, organic agricultural systems have already proved able to produce food with high quality standards. I propose also improvements of organic production to achieve sustainable food production for humans in the near future...|$|E
40|$|In {{observational}} studies, {{estimation of}} a causal {{effect of a}} treatment on an outcome relies on proper adjustment for confounding. If {{the number of the}} potential confounders (p) is larger than the number of observations (n), then direct control for all potential confounders is infeasible. Existing approaches for dimension reduction and penalization are generally aimed at predicting the outcome, and are less suited for estimation of causal effects. Under standard penalization approaches (e. g. Lasso), if a variable X_j is strongly associated with the treatment T but weakly with the outcome Y, the coefficient β_j will be shrunk towards zero thus leading to confounding bias. Under the assumption of a linear model for the outcome and sparsity, we propose continuous spike and slab priors on the regression coefficients β_j corresponding to the potential confounders X_j. Specifically, we introduce a prior distribution that does not heavily shrink to zero the coefficients (β_js) of the X_js that are strongly associated with T but weakly associated with Y. We compare our proposed approach to several state of the art methods proposed in the literature. Our proposed approach has the following features: 1) it reduces confounding bias in high dimensional settings; 2) it shrinks towards zero coefficients of instrumental variables; and 3) it achieves good coverages even in small sample sizes. We apply our approach to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to estimate the causal effects of <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticide</b> exposure on triglyceride levels...|$|E

A good agreement between laboratory and field experiments was observed with a faster dissipation of penoxsulam and tricyclazole under field conditions. Profoxydim was the least persistent chemical (DT 50 soil < 1 d; DT 50 water 0. 5 - 1. 2 d), followed by penoxsulam which persisted for longer particularly in the water compartment (DT 50 water = 3. 8 - 5. 9 d).

As CLD transfers from soil to animals mainly via involuntary ingestion, the consumption of foodstuffs derived from animals raised in contaminated areas may significantly contribute to exposure of humans to CLD. The present {{study was designed to}} test the efficacy of two different activated carbons (ACs) sources in limiting CLD transfer from soil to animal. Three soils (ASs) were prepared according to the OECD guideline 207. One standard soil (SS) lacking AC, and two modified preparations of SS supplemented with 2 % coconut-based activated carbon (ORBO), SSO or with 2 % lignite-based one (DARCO), SSD. All three soils were spiked with 10 μg of kepone per g of dry matter and aged for three weeks. This study involved 15 goat kids randomly assigned to the 3 experimental groups (n = 5 /group), which were fed the experimental matrices at an exposure dose of 10 μg CLD per kg of body weight per day. After 21 d of oral exposure, CLD in adipose tissue and liver were analysed by LC-MS-MS. A significant decrease of 63. 7 % and 74. 7 % of CLD concentrations in adipose tissue and liver, respectively, were obtained from animals exposed using SS containing DARCO as compared to those receiving only SS.

The chromatographic PEARL model was tested against {{the results of a}} field leaching study on a cracking clay soil with a tracer (bromide), a mobile pesticide (bentazone) and a moderately sorbing, <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticide</b> (imidacloprid). Input parameters for water flow and solute transport were obtained from site-specific measurements and from literature. The model was tested using a stepwise approach in which each sub-model was sequentially and separately tested. Uncalibrated simulations for the water flow resulted in moisture profiles that were too wet. Calibration of the hydraulic relationships resulted in a good description of the moisture profiles. Calibration of the dispersion length was necessary to obtain a good description of bromide leaching. The calibrated dispersion length was 61 cm, which is very long and indicates a large non-uniformity of solute transport. The half-life of bentazone had to be calibrated to obtain a good description of its field persistence. The calibrated half-life was 2. 5 times shorter than the half-life derived from the laboratory studies. Concentrations of bentazone in drain water and groundwater were described reasonably well by PEARL. Although measured and simulated persistence of imidacloprid in soil corresponded well, the bulk of the imidacloprid movement was overestimated by PEARL. However, imidacloprid concentrations in drain water were underestimated. In spite of the extensive calibration of water flow and tracer movement, the behaviour of the moderately sorbing pesticide imidacloprid could not be simulated. This indicates that the convection-dispersion equation cannot be used for accurate simulation {{of pesticide}} transport in cracking clay soils (even if extremely long dispersion length is used).

40|$|Although dichlorodiphenyl {{trichloroethane}} (DDT) {{is being}} banned worldwide, countries in sub-Saharan Africa have sought exemptions for malaria control. Few studies show illness in {{children from the}} use of DDT, and the possibility of risks to them from DDT use has been minimized. However, plausible if inconclusive studies associate DDT with more preterm births and shorter duration of lactation, which raise the possibility that DDT does indeed have such toxicity. Assuming that these associations are causal, we estimated the increase in infant deaths that might result from DDT spraying. The estimated increases are of the same order of magnitude as the decreases from effective malaria control. Unintended consequences of DDT use need {{to be part of the}} discussion of modern vector control policy. After the Stockholm convention in 2001, which called for the gradual ban of the <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticide</b> dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), more than a dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa requested exemptions for DDT use to control malaria (1). Discussions on the health consequences of DDT use have focused on reducing infant illness and death from vector control. The possibility of observable toxicity has been minimized because only a few studies show that DDT may affect child health and development (2 – 5). In laboratory experiments, effects of DDT include hepatic and central nervous system toxicity, estrogenic and antiandrogenic effects, and possible carcinogenicity (6, 7). Some epidemiologic evidence suggests that DDT exposure increases preterm delivery and small-for-gestational-age births (8) and shortens the duration of lactation (9, 10); these conditions could increase the rate of infant deaths (11, 12) and thus attenuate any benefits on mortality rates from a reduction in malaria. While the observed associations between DDT and such outcomes might not be causal, the studies are not so flawed that the observations can be dismissed out of hand.

Although its use has been discontinued, humans are still exposed to it due to its high environmental persistence and because it accumulates in the adipose tissue of animals. Acute exposure to dieldrin provokes convulsions due to its antagonism on the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of low chronic exposure to this pollutant. In the present work, we use primary cultures of cortical neurons to study the mechanisms involved in the toxic action of dieldrin. We found that 2 and 6 days in vitro (DIV) exposure to a subcytotoxic concentration (60 nM) of dieldrin reduced the increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and the excitotoxicity caused by glutamate. Exposure to dieldrin for 6 DIV induced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) internalization and reduced metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGLUR 5) levels. Double immunostaining for NMDAR and mGLUR 5 showed that these receptors lose colocalization on the cell membrane in neurons treated with dieldrin. No changes were observed in receptor functionalities or receptor levels after 2 DIV of exposure to dieldrin. However, the increase in [Ca 2 +]i induced by coactivation of NMDAR and mGLUR 5 was significantly reduced. Thus, a functional interaction between the two receptors seems to play an important role in glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. We confirm that permanent blockade of the GABAA receptor by this <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticide</b> triggers adaptive neuronal changes consisting of a reduction of glutamatergic neurotransmission. This might explain the cognitive and learning deficits observed in animals after chronic treatment with dieldrin. © The Author 2009.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine if fish mortality would result directly from a wide-area application of 561 fluid grams, technical grade malathion per hectare. This cooperative study with the Department of Entomology, University of Nebraska, was conducted in Dawson County, near Lexington, Nebraska. Field tests were conducted on two adjoining 9. 94 -square-kilometer areas. The area receiving spray served as the experimental area; the other area served as a control. Mortality rates were determined both for captive bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and for fish populations native to Buffalo Creek. Data obtained throughout the course of this study indicated that malathion, when aerially applied at an ultra low volume rate over a wide area, did not result in direct mortality of fishes. INTRODUCTION The {{objective of this}} investigation was to determine if fish mortality would result directly from an application of 561 fluid grams, technical grade malathion, per hectare. The area treated measured 9. 94 km 2. In recent years a trend has developed towards greater use of nonpersistent insecticides with relatively low mammalian toxicity and a narrower spectrum of activity. These chemicals, the primary group of which are the organo-phosphates, have mitigated the problems of <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues being incorporated into food chains. However, the control of injurious insects has become more complex. With individual farmers applying insecticides at different times during the growing season, repeated applications may often be necessary to combat reinvasion by insects from adjacent untreated fields. To eliminate the necessity of repeated applications, research entomologists are studying the feasibility of treating large areas with the relatively nonpersistent organo-phosphates. However, the effect of such a wide-area treatment on the total environment is unknown.

Output supply equations were econometrically estimated and used in the simulation. A 25 percent tax on pesticide was estimated to have major impacts on cropping patterns and on pesticide use. Assuming other input and output prices were unaffected, the supply of one important crop would fall by more than half. Demand {{for some of the}} highly soluble and <b>persistent</b> <b>pesticides,</b> which present the greatest threat to groundwater quality, would also decrease substantially (some as much as 50 percent).
