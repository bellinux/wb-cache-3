Nor did they forget to apply to Forgier's leg some fat chenin grapes, and so handsomely dressed it and bound it up that he was quickly cured.|$|E

2500|$|The book named Lord (Victor) Rothschild, the Third Baron, as {{the fifth}} key {{member of the}} KGB-controlled Ring. The other four were Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby, and Sir Anthony Blunt, the Queen’s art curator. The media and press were split between {{positive}} and negative reaction to The Fifth Man. The Irish Times reviewer Kieran Fagan said: ‘This book by an Australian journalist is very unusual... Few writers on espionage achieve the page-turning fluency of Roland Perry.’ The Weekend Australian reviewer Richard Hall said ‘it only takes a couple of phone calls to establish that the Rothschild operation had been <b>pretty</b> <b>small</b> beer for a long time.’ In contrast, Norman Abjorensen in The Sunday Canberra Times wrote: Perry makes a plausible case that the Fifth Man was... Rothschild... even from the most critical viewpoint {{it has to be}} conceded that the circumstantial evidence pointing to Rothschild is compelling.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the abdication of the Tsar, the Yussupovs {{returned}} to the Moika Palace before going to Crimea. They later {{returned to}} the Palace to retrieve jewellery and two paintings by Rembrandt, the sale proceeds of which helped sustain the family in exile. In Crimea, the family boarded a British warship, HMS Marlborough, which took them from Yalta to Malta. Felix enjoyed boasting about killing Rasputin {{while he was on}} the ship. One of the British officers noted that Irina [...] "appeared shy and retiring at first, but it was only necessary to take a little notice of her <b>pretty,</b> <b>small</b> daughter to break through her reserve and discover that she was also very charming and spoke fluent English". From there, they traveled to Italy and by train to Paris. In Italy, lacking a visa, Felix bribed the officials with diamonds. In Paris, they stayed a few days in Hôtel de Vendôme before they went on to London.|$|E

2500|$|HIM {{is one of}} {{the most}} commercially {{successful}} Finnish bands of all time, with sales of over ten million albums worldwide. The band also holds the distinction of being the first Finnish group to receive a gold record in the United States. HIM is also seen as one of the first Finnish bands to achieve major international success. The band's manager Seppo Vesterinen recalled that before HIM [...] "the success of Finnish bands [...] was confined to <b>pretty</b> <b>small</b> circles, it wasn't a global phenomenon." [...] Juhani Merimaa, owner of the Tavastia Club, also heralded HIM as [...] "trailblazers", opening the doors for other Finnish bands to achieve international recognition, such as Children of Bodom and Sonata Arctica. In September 2015, HIM were one of six Finnish bands honored by the Finnish postal service by being featured on a new line of postage stamps designed by Klaus Welp. In 2017, Loudwire ranked HIM among their list of ten best Finnish metal bands.|$|E

60|$|I {{admired her}} {{appearance}} tremendously but--I can only express it by saying I didn't {{want to touch}} her. Her fair hair was always delectably done. It flowed beautifully over her <b>pretty</b> <b>small</b> ears, and she would tie its fair coilings with fillets of black or blue velvet that carried pretty buckles of silver and paste. The light, the faint down on her brow and cheek was delightful. And {{it was clear to}} me that I made her happy.|$|E
60|$|She was a <b>pretty</b> girl, <b>small</b> and trim. Tom was by way {{of being}} the strong, silent man with a career to think of and no time for bothering about girls, but he saw that.

40|$|The surface {{quadrupole}} mode of an harmonically trapped dipolar Fermi gas is {{studied in}} both the hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes. The anisotropy and long range effects of the dipolar force {{as well as the}} role of the trapping geometry are explicitly investigated. In the hydrodynamic regime the frequency is always slightly smaller than the √(2) ω_ value holding for gases interacting with contact interactions. In the collisionless regime the frequency can be either <b>pretty</b> <b>smaller</b> or larger than the non-interacting value 2 ω_, depending on the cloud aspect ratio. Our results suggest that the frequency of the surface quadrupole oscillation can provide a useful test for studying, at very low temperatures, the transition between the normal and the superfluid phase and, in the normal phase at higher temperatures, the crossover between the collisional and collisionless regimes. The consequences of the anisotropy of the dipolar force on the virial theorem are also discussed. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

60|$|Farther down, {{the river}} {{becoming}} deeper, broader, and more placid, little boats were seen moored along it, {{for the convenience}} of crossing. Sometimes, too, the well-beaten track of wheels and hoofs passed down to its verge, then vanished, and appeared on the other side, indicating a ford. We saw one house, <b>pretty,</b> <b>small,</b> with green blinds, and much quietness in its environments, {{on the other side of}} the river, with a flat-bottomed boat for communication. It was a pleasant idea that the world was kept off by the river.|$|E

Anyway, I {{remember}} Jeff telling me one day that he could take the whole lot of the hens and sell them off and crack the money into Chicago wheat on margin and turn it over in twenty-four hours. He did it too. Only somehow when it was turned over it came upside down on top of the hens.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} morning there came to her a letter bearing the Downham post-mark,--but at the first glance she {{knew that it was}} not from her cousin Will. Will wrote with a bold round hand, that was extremely plain and caligraphic when he allowed himself time for the work in hand, as he did with the commencement of his epistles, but which would become confused and altogether anti-caligraphic when he fell into a hurry towards the end of his performance,--as was his wont. But the address of this letter was written in a <b>pretty,</b> <b>small,</b> female hand,--very careful in the perfection of every letter, and very neat in every stroke. It was from Mary Belton, between whom and Clara there had never hitherto been occasion for correspondence. The letter was as follows:-- ...|$|E
