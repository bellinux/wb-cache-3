5|$|Tulsidas {{hints at}} several places in his works, {{that he had}} met {{face to face with}} Hanuman and Rama. The {{detailed}} account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the Bhaktirasbodhini of Priyadas. According to Priyadas' account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water <b>pot.</b> <b>On</b> his return to the city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a Preta (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon. Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama with his eyes, to which the Preta responded that it was beyond him. However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised in the mean attire of a leper to listen to his Katha, he is the first to arrive and last to leave.|$|E

25|$|The unique subgame perfect {{equilibrium}} (and every Nash equilibrium) {{of these}} games {{indicates that the}} first player take the <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> the very {{first round of the}} game; however, in empirical tests, relatively few players do so, and as a result, achieve a higher payoff than the payoff predicted by the equilibria analysis. These results are taken to show that subgame perfect equilibria and Nash equilibria fail to predict human play in some circumstances. The Centipede game is commonly used in introductory game theory courses and texts to highlight the concept of backward induction and the iterated elimination of dominated strategies, which show a standard way of providing a solution to the game.|$|E

The first of these was of Akina, released on March 31, 2012. A limited edition of the Akina figure was released the same day, sporting the same design, but a different colored uniform. Another figure of Akina was released by Milk <b>Pot</b> <b>on</b> April 22, 2014. PVC figures for Mafuyu and Natsumi were released November 30, 2012 and May 31, 2013. Another version of the Mafuyu figure was released on May 31, 2014. A painted polystone figure depicting Natsumi lying down is to be released by Blackberry on March 31, 2015. Dakimakura cases were produced, each featuring a different sister, various tapestry, and masturbation toys were also released.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly {{to a boil and}} then simmered in a covered <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} {{as to why}} {{the heads}} found at Cranley Gardens had been subjected to moist heat, Nilsen stated that he had frequently boiled the heads of his victims in a large cooking <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> his stove in order that the internal contents would evaporate, thus removing the need to dispose of the brain and flesh. The torsos and limbs of the three victims killed at this address would be dissected within a week or so of their murder before being wrapped in plastic bags and stowed in the three locations he had indicated to police; the internal organs and smaller bones he would flush down the toilet. This practice — which had led to his arrest — had been the only method he could consider to dispose of the internal organs and soft tissue as, unlike at Melrose Avenue, he had no exclusive usage of the garden of the property.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> top of a grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed {{on top of the}} grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E
25|$|Sephardi-style hamin {{typically}} includes whole {{eggs in the}} shell, {{which are}} placed {{on top of the}} mixture in the stewing pot and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The brown eggs, called haminados (güevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed {{on top of the other}} cooked ingredients. In a Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a Sabich sandwich.|$|E
25|$|The unorthodox play of Higgins was {{encapsulated}} in his {{break of}} 69, made under unusual pressure, against Jimmy White in the penultimate frame of their World Professional Snooker Championship semi-final in 1982. Higgins was 0–59 {{down in that}} frame, but managed to compile an extremely challenging clearance during which he was scarcely in position until the colours. In particular, former world champion Dennis Taylor considers a three-quarter-ball <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> a blue into the green pocket especially memorable, {{not only for its}} extreme degree of difficulty but for enabling Higgins to continue the break and keep White off the table and unable to clinch victory at that moment. In potting the blue, Higgins screwed the cue-ball on to the side cushion to bring it back towards the black/pink area with extreme left-hand sidespin, a shot Taylor believes could be played 100 times without coming close to the position Higgins reached with cue-ball. He went a little too far for ideal position on his next red but the match-saving break was still alive.|$|E
50|$|He uses {{stoneware}} clay thrown on a kick wheel. He does {{not worry about}} if a pot is perfect. He finds his aesthetics through imperfections. For example, he talks about how he {{had a crush on}} a girl because she had a large scar on her face. Collins way of throwing is added to through the way he decorates his pots. Through the woodfire process he creates imperfections by placing <b>pots</b> <b>on</b> their side on top of shells. Collins mentioned that through the process of putting <b>pots</b> <b>on</b> their sides and stacking them on their sides the interesting area of the pots will not be on the bottom but on the front. Through woodfire in anagama kilns decoration can be made by stacking <b>pots</b> <b>on</b> top of each other and Collins does so.|$|R

Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal, although many Cajun families provide a side dish of potato salad. Occasionally, gumbo is served {{as part of a larger}} menu.|$|E
500|$|Flower {{is divided}} up into six main levels and one credits level.

Once inside a level, the player controls the wind as it blows a single flower petal through the air. Changes in the pitch and roll of the floating petal are accomplished by tilting the PlayStation 3 controller. Pressing any button blows the wind harder, which in turn moves the petal faster. The camera generally follows just behind the petal, though it sometimes moves to show a new objective or consequence of the player's actions.|$|E

500|$|Following those incidents, both {{countries}} attempted {{to improve their}} diplomatic relations {{with a series of}} congratulatory messages and exchange visits.

Furthermore, the Vietnamese even denounced the alleged [...] "U.S. bombing" [...] of Siem Reap in February 1976, thereby reinforcing the Kampuchean’s fictitious claim over the incident. In response, in June 1976, the Kampuchean leadership sent a message to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, which had governed South Vietnam since the fall of Saigon, congratulating them on the seventh anniversary of their establishment.|$|E

500|$|Family feuds and {{conflicts}} ended the Kadamba {{rule in the}} middle of the 6th century when the last Kadamba ruler Krishna Varma II was subdued by Pulakeshin I of the Chalukya feudatory, ending their sovereign rule. The Kadambas would continue to rule parts of Karnataka and Goa for many centuries to come but never again as an independent kingdom. Some historians view the Kadambas as the originators of the Karnataka architectural tradition although there were elements in common with the structures [...] built by the contemporaneous Pallavas of Kanchi. The oldest surviving Kadamba structure is one dating to the late 5th century in Halsi in modern Belgaum district.
