25|$|New Orleans brass {{bands are}} a lasting influence, {{contributing}} horn players {{to the world}} of professional jazz with the distinct sound of the city whilst helping black children escape poverty. The leader of New Orleans' Camelia Brass Band, D'Jalma Ganier, taught Louis Armstrong to play trumpet; Armstrong would then popularize the New Orleans style of trumpet playing, and then expand it. Like Jelly Roll Morton, Armstrong is also credited with the abandonment of ragtime's stiffness in favor of swung notes. Armstrong, <b>perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other musician, codified the rhythmic technique of swing in jazz and broadened the jazz solo vocabulary.|$|E
25|$|Many {{sections}} of the country had reason to be dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy {{and a sense of}} duty to the country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people.|$|E

500|$|Yeezus {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 46 reviews. In The Guardian, lead critic Alexis Petridis found it [...] "noisy, gripping, maddening, potent", while Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph {{said it was}} [...] "the most exciting album" [...] she had heard in some time. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone called it a [...] "brilliant, obsessive-compulsive career auto-correct" [...] that made other abrasive records by [...] "mad geniuses", such as In Utero by Nirvana and Radiohead's Kid A, seem tame by comparison. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal viewed it as a [...] "razor-sharpened take" [...] on West's fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, concluding that [...] "cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on Yeezus, <b>perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other Kanye album. Each fluorescent strike of noise, incongruous tempo flip, and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the album's fast 40 minutes." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt it was his most ambitious piece of music yet, and Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said it was his most uninhibited record: [...] "Even {{by the standards of}} an artist who reinvents himself with each release, it's a drastic departure".|$|E

According to Stephen Hawking, [...] "Galileo, <b>perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other single person, was responsible for the birth of modern science." [...] As religious orthodoxy decreed a geocentric or Tychonic understanding of the Solar system, Galileo's support for heliocentrism provoked controversy and he was tried by the Inquisition.

But he must own that the thing was hopeless. ... France was now, in fact, established into a monarchy under republican forms. ... The die was cast—he must submit". Fitzwilliam had now rejoined the Foxite opposition after six years of independence, and the only issue that separated him from them was parliamentary reform.|$|E

He was subject to frequent speculation over corruption issues that plague him and his family. In addition, <b>perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other leader, Li's public image had become inextricably associated with memory of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, {{and as a result}} he continues to be a widely despised figure among a substantial segment of the Chinese population well into the 21st century. He is generally unpopular in China, where he [...] "has long been a figure of scorn and suspicion".|$|E

It is a copy of original source materials which are now lost, perhaps destroyed by the Spanish authorities who confiscated Sahagún's manuscripts. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other source, the Florentine Codex has been the major source of Aztec life in the years before the Spanish conquest. Charles Dibble and Arthur J.O. Anderson published English translations of the Nahuatl text of the twelve books in separate volumes, with redrawn illustrations.

2500|$|It is {{this sense}} of the {{building}} being sculptured, unified and [...] "pulled together" [...] by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led Eneide Mignacca {{to conclude that the}} ovoid profile, seen now in the end product, was an essential part of Michelangelo's first (and last) concept. The sculptor/architect has, figuratively speaking, taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay. The dome must appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building's angles and restraining its projections. If this explanation is the correct one, then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution, as perceived by Giacomo della Porta; {{it is part of the}} integrated design solution that is about visual tension and compression. In one sense, Michelangelo's dome may appear to look backward to the Gothic profile of Florence Cathedral and ignore the Classicism of the Renaissance, but on the other hand, <b>perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other building of the 16th century, it prefigures the architecture of the Baroque.|$|E
2500|$|The Criolla or [...] "Mission grape," [...] {{was first}} planted at San Juan Capistrano in 1779, and in 1783 the first wine {{produced}} in Alta California {{was from the}} Mission's winery. The Mission entered {{a long period of}} gradual decline after Mexican government secularization in 1833. After 1850 U.S. statehood, numerous efforts were made over the latter 19th century to restore the Mission to its former state, but none achieved much success until the arrival of O'Sullivan in 1910. Restoration efforts continue, and [...] "Serra's Chapel" [...] is still used for religious services. Over 500,000 visitors, including 80,000 school children, come to the Mission each year. And while the ruins of [...] "The Great Stone Church" [...] (which was all but leveled by an 1812 earthquake) are a renowned architectural wonder, the Mission is perhaps best known for the annual [...] "Return of the Swallows" [...] which is traditionally observed every March 19 (Saint Joseph's Day).

2500|$|... "A {{circumstance}} which has, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other, {{contributed to}} conceal this oscillation from common view, {{is the difference}} between the nominal and real price of labour. It very rarely happens that the nominal price of labour universally falls; but we well know that it frequently remains the same, while the nominal price of provisions has been gradually rising. This, indeed, will generally be the case, if the increase of manufactures and commerce be sufficient to employ the new labourers that are thrown into the market, and to prevent the increased supply from lowering the money-price. But an increased number of labourers receiving the same money-wages will necessarily, by their competition, increase the money-price of corn. This is, in fact, a real fall in the price of labour; and, during this period, the condition of the lower classes of the community must be gradually growing worse. But the farmers and capitalists are growing rich from the real cheapness of labour. Their increasing capitals enable them to employ a greater number of men; and, as the population had probably suffered some check from the greater difficulty of supporting a family, the demand for labour, after a certain period, would be great in proportion to the supply, and its price would of course rise, if left to find its natural level; and thus the wages of labour, and consequently the condition of the lower classes of society, might have progressive and retrograde movements, though the price of labour might never nominally fall.|$|E
