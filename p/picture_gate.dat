50|$|Dolby Digital data {{is printed}} in the spaces between the {{perforations}} on the soundtrack side of the film, 26 frames before the picture. Release prints with Dolby Digital always include an analog Dolby Stereo soundtrack with Dolby SR noise reduction, thus these prints are known as Dolby SR-D prints. Dolby Digital produces 6 discrete channels. In a variant called SR-D EX, {{the left and right}} surround channels can be dematrixed into left, right, and back surround, using a matrix system similar to Dolby Pro Logic. The audio data in a Dolby Digital track is compressed in the 16-bit AC-3 compression scheme at a ratio of about 12:1. The images between each perforation are read by a CCD located either above the projector or in the regular analog sound head below the film gate, a digital delay within the processor allowing correct lip-sync to be achieved regardless of the position of the reader relative to the <b>picture</b> <b>gate.</b> The information is then decoded, decompressed and converted to analog; this can happen either in a separate Dolby Digital processor that feeds signals to the cinema sound processor, or digital decoding can be built into the cinema processor.One disadvantage of this system is if the digital printing is not entirely within the space between the sprocket holes;if the track was off a bit on either the top or the bottom,the sound track would be unplayable,and a replacement reel would have to be ordered.|$|E

5000|$|With its creation, LVN Pictures {{offered a}} rival to then-newly {{established}} Sampaguita Pictures of the Vera-Perez family. LVN chose the {{big piece of}} land in P. Tuazon Boulevard, C. Benitez and St. Peter Street in Cubao, Quezon City as its home, {{and for the next}} seven decades, the lot would become the backlot and administration location of the studio. The LVN Gate, with the initials of the studio emblazoned in red letters and set in white beams, became as famous as the Paramount <b>Pictures</b> <b>gate,</b> and the big LVN Studios logo atop the Main Building became as famous as the MGM logo atop its main building. To oversee its production facilities, Doña Narcisa de Leon of the De Leon family took over the company as its president and [...] "Executive Producer". She was the first Filipina film mogul. Eventually, due to the uninvolvement of the Villonco and Navoa families, she bought their shares, which made LVN a De Leon family company.|$|R

40|$|Ion {{channels}} are signal transduction molecules that switch ion permeation pathways {{on and off}} (gating). Crystal structures of several kinds of potassium channels have revealed open and closed conformations, which provide static <b>pictures</b> of <b>gating</b> status. Here we studied KcsA potassium channels undergoing conformational changes at the single-molecule level. A KcsA channel with a gold nanocrystal attached was irradiated by white X-rays and motions of the diffraction spot from the nanocrystal were tracked in real time. Upon gating, the KcsA channels twisted around the axis of the pore. These conformational changes were prevented by an open-channel blocker, tetrabuthylammonium. Random clockwise and counterclockwise twisting {{in the range of}} several tens of degrees originated in the transmembrane domain and was transmitted to the cytoplasmic domain. This coupling suggests a mechanical interplay between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains...|$|R

50|$|As {{was common}} {{at the time}} Felton offered Barry a return match but {{with the proviso that}} it was to be raced in Sydney. Felton {{returned}} home to a hero’s welcome and after the usual festivities found himself challenged by Jim Paddon for a race on the Parramatta. The local rowing fraternity felt that Paddon had the right to a challenge but Felton declined and announced the agreement with Barry. It would appear that the two had made the arrangement with a view to maximising their financial returns. For example, motion <b>picture</b> rights, <b>gate</b> money, paid speaking engagements, and exhibitions were some of the ways the Champion and ex-Champion could reward themselves. The Sydney rowing people found that Barry had strong financial support from England and as they were keen to see the contest, support for the Paddon challenge evaporated.|$|R

50|$|An orillon was {{generally}} {{built at the}} flank of a bastion, close to the adjacent defensive wall. The position permitted the cannons to be set back into the bastion. The projecting masonry shielded the gun and soldiers. Additional protection was sometimes provided by lowering the gun platform in the bastion (link below). An orillon could also shield a city gate. An example is the Prince Edward's <b>Gate</b> (<b>pictured</b> in map at right) in the Charles V Wall in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar.|$|R

40|$|An early {{component}} of the gating current in Shaker K+ channels with a time constant of ≈ 12 μsec has been recorded with a high-speed patch–clamp setup. This fast component {{was found to be}} part of the gating current associated with the opening and closing of the channel. With regard to an energy-landscape interpretation of protein kinetics, the voltage and temperature dependence of the fast component may be explained by a combination of drift diffusion and barrier jumping in the initial stages of channel activation. The data were modeled by a gating particle undergoing Brownian motion in a one-dimensional diffusion landscape that featured diminishing electrical resistance and entropy in the direction of channel activation. The final open state of the channel was reasoned to be narrow and deep to account for successful subtraction of linear-charge displacements at positive potentials. The overall <b>picture</b> of <b>gating</b> that emerges from these studies is that the channel experiences incremental organization from a relaxed state in the early steps of activation to a rigidly structured open state...|$|R
