50|$|Although {{trained in}} {{evolutionary}} ecology, {{because of his}} fluency in Polynesian languages, Cox was encouraged by Harvard Professor Richard Evans Schultes to pursue ethnobotanical studies. He became increasingly focused on ethnomedicine after his mother died from breast cancer; he subsequently discovered with {{his colleagues at the}} National Cancer Institute the anti-HIV/AIDS properties of <b>prostratin.</b> He was elected as President of the Society for Economic Botany and President of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology.

50|$|Samoa {{has had a}} great {{influence}} on western medicine {{when it comes to}} finding a cure for HIV/AIDS. New research has shown that the isolation of <b>prostratin,</b> found in the bark of the Samoan mamala tree, from Homalanthus nutans has led to the extreme potency against HIV-1. Both the National Cancer Institute and Brigham Young University have guaranteed to return to the Samoan people a significant portion of any royalties. Paul Alan Cox, an American ethnobotanist, raised money based on awareness of environmental degradation due to logging, {{in order to protect the}} 30000 acre lowland forest of Falealupo village on the island of Savai'i. The Swedish Society for the Conservation of Nature established three new indigenously controlled preserves. Controlled preserves cause controversy because in traditional Polynesian societies, land, including the natural plant and animal populations, which occupied it, were viewed as sacred and an ancestral inheritance. Western approaches to conservation on indigenous land and within an indigenous community must collaborate and understand indigenous knowledge systems in order to conserve cultural identity. Paul Cox stated that, “the loss of these indigenous knowledge systems may yet prove to be one of the greatest tragedies of our age”. The U.S National Park Service officials, the American Samoan Government, and the traditional chiefs (matai) and orators of the villages of Tafua had agreed to lease their lands for 50 years to the U.S National Park Service in order to protect American Samoa’s rain forests. The Tafua rain forest received funding from the Swedish International Development Authority, which was used to secure water supply, improve roads, and used for assistance in the development of village-based environmental tourism in Tafua. Cox explains, “all parties to these agreements agree that any development of tourism must be village initiatives, rather than foreign initiatives, and must be carefully planned and controlled so that the Samoan culture in these areas is not jeopardized”.|$|E

40|$|<b>Prostratin</b> is {{an unusual}} non-tumour {{promoting}} phorbol ester with potential as an inductive adjuvant therapy for {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) due to its ability to up-regulate viral expression from latent provirus. In addition, <b>prostratin</b> is also able to inhibit de novo HIV infection most probably because it induces down-regulation of HIV receptors from the surface of target cells. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which <b>prostratin</b> down-regulates HIV receptor and co-receptor surface expression in lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines. Our results indicate that <b>prostratin</b> induces down-regulation of surface expression of CD 4 and CXCR 4, but not CCR 5, in various cell lines. Down-regulation of CD 4 and CXCR 4 by <b>prostratin</b> is achieved by internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis and/or macropinocytosis, which is then followed by degradation of these molecules. Because <b>prostratin</b> is a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, we next examined the potential contribution of distinct PKC isoforms to down-regulate CD 4 and CXCR 4 in response to <b>prostratin</b> stimulation. Although exposure of cells to <b>prostratin</b> or phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) induces the translocation of several PKC isoforms to the plasma membrane, the use of specific PKC inhibitors revealed that novel PKCs are the main mediators of the prostratin-induced CD 4 down-regulation, whereas both conventional and novel PKCs contribute to CXCR 4 down-regulation. Altogether these results showed that <b>prostratin,</b> through the activation of conventional and/or novel PKC isoforms, rapidly reduces cell surface expression of CD 4 and CXCR 4, but not CCR 5, by inducing their internalization and degradation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The latent {{reservoir}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) in resting CD 4 + T cells is a major obstacle to the clearance of infection by {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). Recent studies have focused on searches for adjuvant therapies to activate this reservoir under conditions of HAART. <b>Prostratin,</b> a non tumor-promoting phorbol ester, is a candidate for such a strategy. <b>Prostratin</b> has been shown to reactivate latent HIV- 1 and Tat-mediated transactivation may {{play an important role in}} this process. We examined resting CD 4 + T cells from healthy donors to determine if <b>prostratin</b> induces Cyclin T 1 /P-TEFb, a cellular kinase composed of Cyclin T 1 and Cyclin-dependent kinase- 9 (CDK 9) that mediates Tat function. We also examined effects of <b>prostratin</b> on Cyclin T 2 a, an alternative regulatory subunit for CDK 9, and 7 SK snRNA and the HEXIM 1 protein, two factors that associate with P-TEFb and repress its kinase activity. Results <b>Prostratin</b> up-regulated Cyclin T 1 protein expression, modestly induced CDK 9 protein expression, and did not affect Cyclin T 2 a protein expression. Although the kinase activity of CDK 9 in vitro was up-regulated by <b>prostratin,</b> we observed a large increase in the association of 7 SK snRNA and the HEXIM 1 protein with CDK 9. Using HIV- 1 reporter viruses with and without a functional Tat protein, we found that <b>prostratin</b> stimulation of HIV- 1 gene expression appears to require a functional Tat protein. Microarray analyses were performed and several genes related to HIV biology, including APOBEC 3 B, DEFA 1, and S 100 calcium-binding protein genes, were found to be regulated by <b>prostratin.</b> Conclusion <b>Prostratin</b> induces Cyclin T 1 expression and P-TEFb function and this is likely to be involved in <b>prostratin</b> reactivation of latent HIV- 1 proviruses. The large increase in association of 7 SK and HEXIM 1 with P-TEFb following <b>prostratin</b> treatment may reflect a requirement in CD 4 + T cells for a precise balance between active and catalytically inactive P-TEFb. Additionally, genes regulated by <b>prostratin</b> were identified that have the potential to regulate HIV- 1 replication both positively and negatively. </p...|$|E

However, the antiviral mechanism of <b>prostratin</b> is not well defined. In the present study, we report that <b>prostratin</b> exhibits potent antiviral activity against different strains of HIV- 1 (subtypes B and D), a clinical HIV isolate (L 1), HIV- 2 (ROD and EHO) and SIV (MAC 251) with EC 50 -values ranging from 0. 02 - 0. 09 microg/ml. <b>Prostratin</b> was equally active against HIV strains resistant to the polyanionic binding inhibitor dextran sulphate, the fusion inhibitor T- 20 (enfuvirtide), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs). In contrast, <b>prostratin</b> lost 4. 4 - and 6. 8 -fold of its effect against the HIV strains resistant to AMD 3100 and the quaternary ammonium salt QAS 10 +, respectively. As shown by time-of-addition experiments, <b>prostratin</b> needs to be present {{at the time of}} viral adsorption to exert its antiviral activity. We selected an HIV strain (NL 4. 3 /PROS) resistant to <b>prostratin</b> in MT- 4 cells. The sensitivity of NL 4. 3 /PROS towards <b>prostratin,</b> dextran sulphate and QAS 10 + was reduced by 3. 2, 4. 1 and > 50 -fold, respectively. However, NL 4. 3 / PROS was still sensitive to AMD 3100, T- 20, NRTIs (zidovudine and nevirapine) and a PI (ritonavir). Recombination of the gp 160 -gene of the NL 4. 3 /PROS strain in a NL 4. 3 wild-type molecular clone fully rescued its phenotypic resistance. DNA sequencing of the NL 4. 3 /PROS strain revealed mutations throughout the gp 120 gene previously associated with resistance towards other HIV entry inhibitors.

40|$|To design {{strategies}} to purge latent reservoirs of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1), we investigated mechanisms by which a non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester, <b>prostratin,</b> inhibits infection of CD 4 + T lymphocytes {{and at the same}} time reactivates virus from latency. CD 4 + T lymphocytes from primary blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in blocks of human lymphoid tissue were stimulated with <b>prostratin</b> and infected with HIV- 1 to investigate the effects of <b>prostratin</b> on cellular susceptibility to the virus. The capacity of <b>prostratin</b> to reactivate HIV from latency was tested in CD 4 + T cells harboring preintegrated and integrated latent provirus. <b>Prostratin</b> stimulated CD 4 + T cells in an aberrant way. It induced expression of the activation markers CD 25 and CD 69 but inhibited cell cycling. HIV- 1 uptake was reduced in prostratin-stimulated CD 4 + T PBMC and tissues in a manner consistent with a downregulation of CD 4 and CXCR 4 receptors in these systems. At the postentry level, <b>prostratin</b> inhibited completion of reverse transcription of the viral genome in lymphoid tissue. However, <b>prostratin</b> facilitated integration of the reverse-transcribed HIV- 1 genome in nondividing CD 4 + T cells and facilitated expression of already integrated HIV- 1, including latent forms.

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that <b>prostratin,</b> a non-tumor promoting phorbol ester, inhibits chikungunya virus (CHIKV) -induced cytopathic effects in vitro. <b>Prostratin</b> {{is a potent}} activator of protein kinases C (PKC), a family of related serine/threonine kinases that regulate many cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis.

The antiviral effect of the compound was cell-dependent, with potent antiviral activity observed in human skin fibroblasts cells, the primary target cells of CHIKV infection. The antiviral activity of <b>prostratin</b> was markedly reduced in the presence of PKC inhibitors, therefore confirming that the antiviral effect results from an activation of PKCs.

Fecha de lectura: 21 - 09 - 2004 This work studies {{a fundamental}} {{problem in the}} management of HIV infection: the search of new strategies to eliminate viral resewoirs. that represents a rnajor obstacle to erradicate HIV from the patient. It has been addresed in two parts. In the first part, we analize molecular mechanisms implicated in latency and reactivation of HIV in lymphocytes. The trafic of NF-KB and its inhibitor, Ida, between nucleus and cytoplasm has been analized in two models, human PBMC and T cell blasts denved from them. We have found that these proteins shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm of resting human lymphocytes. When we culture these cells with leptomycin B, an nuclear export inhibitor. p 65 and IKBa accumulates into the nucleus. In these circumstances, we have dernonstrated an physical interaction between them by immunoprecipitation. When we activate these cells with PMA, we see also l~Baaccumulationin to the nucleus, but it does not bind to NF-kB. When we add also leptomycin B. we can see a more evident accumulation of lkBa in the nucleus, but the binding to DNA does not dissapear by gel shiR assay. In transfecting experiments with luciferase gene under the control of LTR, we have obsewed an inhibition of leptomycin B of its transactivation with PMA. We have also demonstrated an increment in lKBu levels in human lymphocytes cultured with dexamethasone that wrrelated with an inhibition of NF-kB binding to DNA and HIV propagation in culture. In the sewnd part, we have analized the effecto of <b>Prostratin</b> in HIV replication. <b>Prostratin</b> is a non-tumorogenic phorbol ester that delays HIV replication in vitro. but paradoxically reactivates HIV in latently-infected cells. To get a better insight into the mechanisms of action of <b>prostratin</b> we have analysed the effect of <b>prostratin</b> on HIV reactivation and wreceptor expression in human lymphocytes. LTR vectors, KB- and SP- 1 - driven luciferase wnstructs transfected in human PBMC were transactivated by <b>prostratin.</b> In another set of experiments PBMCs were transfected with full-length infectious viral clones. <b>Prostratin</b> induced HIV transcription and viral expression as detected by luciferase activity in cellular extracts and p 24 levels in culture supematants. respectively. Expression of the HIV wreceptors CCR 5 and CXCR 4 was inhibited by <b>prostratin</b> and wnwmitantly. <b>prostratin</b> inhibited the infection of PBMC with R 5 and X 4 strains. However, infection with a pseudotyped viral clone that enter into the cells independently of HIV receptors was not inhibited by <b>prostratin.</b> These results contribute to explain the paradoxical effects of <b>prostratin.</b> On one hand, through the induction of NF-KB and Spl, <b>prostratin</b> induces HIV reactivation in latenly-infected cells. On the other hand, strong and persistent down-regulation of HIV receptors decreases reinfection of new targets and delays HIV propagation.

40|$|The common AMPK-activating {{diabetes}} drug Metformin {{has received}} considerable {{attention from the}} research community as a potential apoptosis causing agent for certain breast, prostate, pancreatic and colon cancers. Upon Metformin’s activation of the cell’s chief energy sensing factor, AMPK, many downstream pathways elicit apoptosis-favoring responses. In this study {{the goal was to}} investigate the relative contribution of AMPK’s inhibition of the inflammatory pathway to apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Specifically, Metformin prevents the inflammatory pathway’s chief transcription factor, NF-kB, from trans-locating into the nucleus. To test this a western blot was performed following differential centrifugation to determine if Metformin could prevent NF-kB translocation to the nucleus as well as testing whether the inflammatory activator <b>Prostratin</b> could preserve NF-kB’s translocation, despite Metformin treatment. Apoptosis was quantified via flow cytometry to determine if the combined treatment of <b>Prostratin</b> and Metformin was different from Metformin treatment alone. The combined treatment of Metformin and <b>Prostratin</b> displayed significantly greater translocation than Metformin treatment alone. However, Metformin or <b>Prostratin</b> treatment alone displayed no significant difference relative to the control. In addition there was a statistically greater extent of apoptosis in Metformin treatment alone than the combined Metformin and <b>Prostratin</b> treatment. Since there was no statistical difference between control and Metformin as well as <b>Prostratin</b> treatments in NF-kB translocation, the observed differences in apoptosis cannot be attributed to differences in inflammatory pathway activation. Additional pathways activated through Prostratin’s side activation of Protein kinase C could also be implicated in reducing apoptosis in cells that were also treated with Metformin...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} sequence, assemble and annotate the E. fischeriana transcriptome to better understand the potential biochemical pathways leading to the synthesis of <b>prostratin</b> and other related diterpene compounds. Results In this study we conducted a high throughput RNA-seq approach to sequence the root transcriptome of E. fischeriana. We assembled 18, 180 transcripts, of these the majority encoded protein-coding genes and only 17 transcripts corresponded to known RNA genes. Interestingly, we identified 5, 956 protein-coding transcripts with high similarity (> = 75 %) to Ricinus communis, a close relative to E. fischeriana. We also evaluated the conservation of E. fischeriana genes against EST datasets from the Euphorbeacea family, which included R. communis, Hevea brasiliensis and Euphorbia esula. We identified a core set of 1, 145 gene clusters conserved in all four species and 1, 487 E. fischeriana paralogous genes. Furthermore, we screened E. fischeriana transcripts against an in-house reference database for genes implicated in the biosynthesis of upstream precursors to <b>prostratin.</b> This identified 24 and 9 candidate transcripts involved in the terpenoid and diterpenoid biosyntehsis pathways, respectively. The majority of the candidate genes in these pathways presented relatively low expression levels except for 1 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 2 -(E) -butenyl 4 -diphosphate synthase (HDS) and isopentenyl diphosphate/dimethylallyl diphosphate synthase (IDS), which are required for multiple downstream pathways including synthesis of casbene, a proposed precursor to <b>prostratin.</b> Conclusion The resources generated in this study provide new insights into the upstream pathways to the synthesis of <b>prostratin</b> and will likely facilitate functional studies aiming to produce larger quantities of this compound for HIV research and/or treatment of patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, much {{emphasis}} {{has been put}} on the transcriptional activation of HIV- 1, which is proposed as a promised strategy for eradicating latent HIV- 1 provirus. Two drugs, <b>prostratin</b> and hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), have shown potent effects as inducers for releasing HIV- 1 latency when used alone or in combination, although their cellular target(s) are currently not well understood, especially under drug combination. Here, we have shown that HMBA and <b>prostratin</b> synergistically release HIV- 1 latency via different mechanisms. While <b>prostratin</b> strongly stimulates HMBA-induced HIV- 1 transcription via improved P-TEFb activation, HMBA is capable of boosting NF-κB-dependent transcription initiation by suppressing prostratin-induced expression of the deubiquitinase A 20, a negative feedback regulator in the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, HMBA was able to increase prostratin-induced phosphorylation and degradation of NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, thereby enhancing and prolonging prostratin-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB, a prerequisite for stimulation of transcription initiation. Thus, by blocking the negative feedback circuit, HMBA functions as a signaling enhancer of the NF-κB signaling pathway...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) replication {{is linked to}} cellular gene transcription and requires target cell activation. The latent reservoir of HIV- 1 in quiescent T cells {{is thought to be}} a major obstacle to clearance of infection by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Thus, identification of agents that can induce expression of latent virus may, in the presence of HAART, allow elimination of the infected cells by the immune response. We previously used the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) mouse model to establish that activation-inducible HIV can be generated at high frequency during thymopoiesis. Latently infected mature thymocytes can be exported into the periphery, providing an efficient primary cell model to determine cellular activation signals that induce renewed expression of latent virus. Here we characterized the effects of <b>prostratin,</b> a non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester, on primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and assessed its ability to reactivate latent HIV infection from thymocytes and PBLs in the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) model. <b>Prostratin</b> stimulation alone did not induce proliferation of quiescent PBLs; however, it could provide a secondary signal in the context of T-cell receptor stimulation or a primary activation signal in the presence of CD 28 stimulation to induce T-cell proliferation. While <b>prostratin</b> alone was not sufficient to allow de novo HIV infection, it efficiently reactivated HIV expression from latently infected cells generated in the SCID-hu mouse. Our data indicate that <b>prostratin</b> alone is able to specifically reactivate latent virus in the absence of cellular proliferation, making it an attractive candidate for further study as an adjunctive therapy for the elimination of the latent HIV reservoir...|$|E
40|$|Although {{antiretroviral}} therapies {{have been}} effective in decreasing active viral loads in AIDS patients, the persistence of latent viral reservoirs prevents eradication of the virus. <b>Prostratin</b> and DPP (12 - deoxyphorbol- 13 - phenylacetate) activate the latent virus and thus represent promising adjuvants for antiviral therapy. Their limited supply and the challenges of accessing related structures have, however, impeded therapeutic development {{and the search for}} clinically superior analogs. Here we report a practical synthesis of <b>prostratin</b> and DPP starting from phorbol or crotophorbolone, agents readily available from renewable sources, including a biodiesel candidate. This synthesis reliably supplies gram quantities of the therapeutically promising natural products, hitherto available only in low and variable amounts from natural sources, and opens access to a variety of new analogs. close 889...|$|E

The molecular mechanism of this activation, however, is far from clear. Here, we show that the protein kinase D 3 (PKD 3) is essential for prostratin-induced transcription activation of latent HIV- 1 provirus. First, silencing PKD 3, but not {{the other members of}} PKD family, blocked prostratin-induced transcription of HIV- 1. Second, overexpressing the constitutively active form of PKD 3, but not the wild-type or kinase-dead form of PKD 3, augmented the expression of HIV- 1. Consistent with this observation, we found that <b>prostratin</b> could trigger PKD 3 activation by inducing the phosphorylation of its activation loop. In addition, we identified PK...|$|E

40|$|<b>Prostratin</b> {{exhibits}} potent HIV- 1 latency reversing activity, yet its molecular {{mechanism of}} action has not been defined in detail. Here, we used a novel chemical biology approach which revealed that the protein kinase C-mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (PKC-Mel) pathway is essential for prostratin-induced reactivation of latent HIV- 1 provirus. We identified 7 different Mek inhibitors using our approach that constantly impaired prostratin-induced reactivation. We also identified PKC inhibitors, Raf kinase inhibitors, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) inhibitors that blocked prostratin-induced reversal of HIV- 1 latency. Consistent with these observations, the PKC-Ras-Mek-Erk pathway plays {{an essential role in}} the mechanism by which <b>prostratin</b> reactivates latent HIV- 1. In addition, we identified several kinase inhibitors that activated HIV- 1 latent genes in a significant level individually, including CUDC- 101, XMD 8 - 92, PD 173074, Quizartinib, and CUDC- 907. Therefore, this chemical biology approach provides new methods of revealing the molecular mechanism of LRAs into the HIV- 1 eradication research. The work represented by this thesis holds public health significances lying mainly in enriching the knowledge of HIV- 1 latency reversing agents, contributing to the translational study, and the overall advancement of HIV eradication in public health...|$|E
