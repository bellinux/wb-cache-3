An increase of approximately 1. 58 million tons/decade in <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> correlated with climate change. Regions with increased <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> were located mainly in the Northeast China Plain, the northern arid and semiarid region, and the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain.

40|$|The <b>potential</b> soil <b>production</b> rate, i. e., {{the upper}} limit at which bedrock can be {{converted}} into transportable material, limits how fast erosion can occur in mountain ranges {{in the absence of}} widespread landsliding in bedrock or intact regolith. Traditionally, the <b>potential</b> soil <b>production</b> rate has been considered to be solely dependent on climate and rock characteristics. Data from the San Gabriel Mountains of California, however, suggest that topographic steepness may also influence <b>potential</b> soil <b>production</b> rates. In this paper I test the hypothesis that topographically induced stress opening of preexisting fractures in the bedrock or intact regolith beneath hillslopes of the San Gabriel Mountains increases <b>potential</b> soil <b>production</b> rates in steep portions of the range. A mathematical model for this process predicts a relationship between <b>potential</b> soil <b>production</b> rates and average slope consistent with published data. Once the effects of average slope are accounted for, a small subset of the data suggests that cold temperatures may limit soil production rates at the highest elevations of the range due to the influence of temperature on vegetation growth. These results suggest that climate and rock characteristics may be the sole controls on <b>potential</b> soil <b>production</b> rates as traditionally assumed but that the porosity of bedrock or intact regolith may evolve with topographic steepness in a way that enhances the persistence of soil cover in compressive-stress environments. I develop an empirical equation that relates <b>potential</b> soil <b>production</b> rates in the San Gabriel Mountains to the average slope and a climatic index that accounts for temperature limitations on soil production rates at high elevations. Assuming a balance between soil production and erosion rates on the hillslope scale, I illustrate the interrelationships among <b>potential</b> soil <b>production</b> rates, soil thickness, erosion rates, and topographic steepness that result from the feedbacks among geomorphic, geophysical, and pedogenic processes in the San Gabriel Mountains...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Land {{suitability}} {{evaluation and}} land <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> estimation are considered as prerequisites for land use planning. In quantitative land suitability evaluation, land suitability is evaluated based on production per surface area unit. In {{this kind of}} evaluation, first, radiation thermal <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> is calculated, using different models such as FAO model. This potential is a genetical one which is not under influence of water, soil and management limitations. If soil limitations are exerted in the radiation thermal <b>production</b> <b>potential,</b> land <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> is resulted. The difference between the land <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> and the farmer yield {{is that the first}} one is not under influence of management limitation but the second one is under influence of management.

25|$|Predators are {{commonly}} believed to reduce greater sage-grouse populations and of most importance is timing of death. Nest loss to predators {{is most important}} when <b>potential</b> <b>production</b> of young and recruitment are seriously impacted. Lack of adequate nesting and brooding cover may account for high juvenile losses in many regions. Nest success is related to herbaceous cover near the nest site. Taller, more dense herbaceous cover apparently reduces nest predation and likely increases early brood survival. Although predators were the proximate factor influencing nest loss, the ultimate cause may relate to the vegetation available to nesting grouse. Tall, dense vegetation may provide visual, scent, and physical barriers between predators and nests of ground-nesting birds. Greater amounts of both tall grass and medium-height shrub cover were associated collectively with a lower probability of nest predation. In a series of Nevada studies, artificial nest predation experiments were conducted. Artificial nests experienced 100% mortality {{with the loss of}} 1,400 eggs in 200 simulated nests in two weeks in one study, 84% of the nests were destroyed in three days in another study, while just 3% of the nests were destroyed in 10 days in an area of significantly better cover.|$|E

40|$|The {{quantity}} and spatial pattern of farmland {{has changed in}} China, {{which has led to}} a major change in the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> {{under the influence of the}} national project of ecological environmental protection and rapid economic growth during 1990 - 2010. In this study, the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> in China was calculated based on meteorological, terrain elevation, soil and land-use data from 1990, 2000 and 2010 using the Global Agro-ecological Zones model. Then, changes in the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> in response to farmland changes from 1990 to 2010 were subsequently analyzed. The main conclusions were the following. First, the total <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> was 1. 055 billion tons in China in 2010. Moreover, the average <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> was 7614 kg/ha and showed tremendous heterogeneity in spatial pattern. Total production in eastern China was high, whereas that in northwestern China was low. The regions with high per unit <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> were mainly distributed over southern China and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Second, the obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity in farmland changes from 1990 to 2010 had a significant influence on the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> in China. The total <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> decreased in southern China and increased in northern China. Furthermore, the center of growth of the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> moved gradually from northeastern China to northwestern China. The net decrease in the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> was 2. 97 million tons, which occupied 0. 29 % of the national total actual production in 2010. Third, obvious differences in the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> in response to farmland changes from 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2010 were detected. The net increase in the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> during the first decade was 10. 11 million tons and mainly distributed in the Northeast China Plain and the arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. The net decrease in the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> during the next decade was 13. 08 million tons and primarily distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River region and the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. In general, the reason for the increase in the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> during the past two decades might be due to the reclamation of grasslands, woodlands and unused land, and the reason for the decrease in the <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> might be urbanization that occupied the farmland and Green for Grain Project, which returned farmland to forests and grasslands...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of annual <b>potential</b> new <b>production</b> at a regional scale for {{the decade of}} the 1980 s provides the main focus of this thesis. New production is the proportion of total primary production which relies on the uptake of NO₃-N by the phytoplankton while <b>potential</b> new <b>production</b> assumes that all the NO₃-N available to primary producers is assimilated. The Redfield ratio between carbon and nitrogen in the marine environment was used to express rates of <b>potential</b> new <b>production</b> in terms of carbon. In order to arrive at annual estimates of <b>potential</b> new <b>production</b> it was necessary to progress from the event-scale to the annual scale. This was achieved by the adoption of two novel methods of approach. Event-scale estimates of <b>potential</b> new <b>production</b> were made by assessing the amount of NO₃-N present in the nominal euphotic zone as a result of upwelling. Remotely-sensed images of sea surface temperature (SST) coincident with or shortly after upwelling events were used in combination with a derived relationship between SST and NO₃-N concentrations integrated over the depth range of the productive surface layer in the southern Benguela region. In this way it was possible to overcome the main shortcoming of passive satellite imagery by quantifying a sub-surface variable. The event-scale estimates of <b>potential</b> new <b>production</b> were extrapolated to the annual-scale by taking into account the dynamics of the system. Sea level fluctuation at the coast preceding upwelling events was found {{to be related to the}} event-scale estimates of introduced NO₃-N and hence used as a proxy for upwelling. Using a ten year record of sea level, estimates of annual <b>potential</b> new <b>production,</b> spanning the period June to May inclusive, were made for the period 1980 / 81 to 1989 / 90.

However, {{whether or not the}} gas hydrate will play a part in our energy strategy lies in whether or not it can be effectively extracted. Such real production will mostly rely on the full assessment of gas <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> from the marine hydrate deposits. Unfortunately, the relevant research costs are surprisingly high in the field tests alone, while the experimental simulation of hydrate production under high pressures is limited to a small scale presently, and can not fully characterize the gas <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> on a substantial reservoir scale. Thus {{it is the only way}} for hydrate production engineers to establish mining plans and calculate gas <b>production</b> <b>potentials</b> through numerical simulation. Because the gas <b>production</b> <b>potential,</b> however, is closely related to the complexity and dissimilarities of the hydrate reservoir characteristics, the production capacities must be evaluated by using different production methods for different types of hydrate reservoirs, which will inevitably raise the research cost.
