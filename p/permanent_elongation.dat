50|$|Aluminium-conductor steel {{supported}} (ACSS) conductor visually {{appears to}} be similar to standard ACSR but the aluminium strands are fully annealed. Annealing the aluminium strands reduces the composite conductor strength, but after installation, <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation</b> of the aluminium strands results in a much larger percentage of the conductor tension being carried in the steel core than is true for standard ACSR. This in turn yields reduced composite thermal elongation and increased self-damping.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium {{conductor}} steel-reinforced cable (ACSR) {{is a type}} of high-capacity, high-strength {{stranded conductor}} typically used in overhead power lines. The outer strands are high-purity aluminium, chosen for its excellent conductivity, low weight and low cost. The center strand is steel for additional strength to help support the weight of the conductor. Steel is higher strength than aluminium which allows for increased mechanical tension to be applied on the conductor. Steel also has lower elastic and inelastic deformation (<b>permanent</b> <b>elongation)</b> due to mechanical loading (e.g. wind and ice) as well as a lower coefficient of thermal expansion under current loading. These properties allow ACSR to sag significantly less than all-aluminium conductors. Per the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and The CSA Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association or CSA) naming convention, ACSR is designated A1/S1A.|$|E

40|$|Reduced {{weight and}} fuel consumption, {{improved}} reliability and engine performance {{are the main}} requirements in the automotive industry of today. These requirements demand robust and optimized bolted joints, where a high amount of preload obtained by effective utilisation of the bolt is essential. This work presents a method, based on probabilistic design engineering, of tightening a bolt over its yield point. The bolt is utilised to its maximum in a controlled fashion. The proposed torque and angle control method {{can be used in}} modern assembly plants as well as in small workshops with less sophisticated tightening tools. This study determines an appropriate combination of snug torque and tightening angle to exceed the yield point of a bolt. Previously underestimated, or in some cases undetermined, deformations resulting in a non-elongating effect on the bolt are here covered and studied in detail. These deformations include the plastic deformation of the bearing surfaces of the fasteners and clamped parts, plastic and elastic twisting of the bolt, and plastic deformation of the nut threads. The total sum of these non-elongating parameters constitutes 16  35 % of the total deformation of the studied bolted joint, depending on how far into the plastic range the bolt is tightened. Two theoretical models for torque and angle controlled tightening, the elastic ideal-plastic and elastic-plastic models, respectively, are developed and studied. The main difference between the models is the bolted-joint behaviour after reaching the plastic region of the bolt. Both models determine the momentary and <b>permanent</b> <b>elongations,</b> final preload and torque, etc., with an excellent agreement with experimental findings. This important information on the joint behaviour has been neglected in previous research work. It is proposed that a split of the bolted joint into groups of sections exposed to tensile and compressive forces during tightening is necessary when measuring bolt elongation by means of having the measurement points at the unengaged and tension free sections of the bolt. This leads to a new definition of the spring constants and characteristics of the bolted joint, which is presented in this thesis. In addition, the spring characteristic of an M 10 bolt with external hexalobular drive (Torx) with a conical shaped flange is also covered. Additionally, a retightening model is also presented, where the bolted joint behaviour is described for reusing the fasteners...|$|R
40|$|A 15, 000 -ft {{string of}} Grade E drill pipe {{is capable of}} {{stretching}} 37 ft without yielding. If the pipe were infinitely rigid so it would not stretch, it would break at the slips {{as soon as they}} were set. Fortunately, the pipe is not rigid, but is capable of stretching without <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation</b> provided the stress developed does not exceed the yield point of the pipe material. This ability to stretch allows the top of the pipe to be stopped suddenly while the bottom of the pipe continues to move. Whenever slips are set on moving drill pipe, dynamic stresses are added to the stresses already in the string. Parting or <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation</b> could result from these stresses depending upon the string length and upon the velocity of the pipe when the slips are set. An investigation into these stresses shows what are the critical slip setting velocities and how much effect slowing down the pipe velocity can have on the magnitude of these stresses. This study also reveals that the expense and inconvenience of shock-absorbing devices can hardly be justified for protection of drill pipe since only relatively small shock reduction is practical...|$|E

This increase of resistance of Sample A 1 and B 1 is related to the <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation</b> of the copper wire caused by the draft in the delivery zone of the hollow spindle-spinning machine that eventually increased its resistance.|$|E

50|$|Ultimate tensile {{strength}} is the {{tensile stress at}} which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a <b>permanent</b> set (an <b>elongation</b> from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener {{is said to be}} operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{elongation}} characteristics of a double braid nylon rope is presented {{as an aid to}} sizing a marine towline.

The loading range of practical interest is examined and a design factor of safety, with both an upper and lower bound, is established. The lower bound is incorporated to limit relative movement between structural elements in an attempt to control internal abrasion.

The governing equations for the towline are then solved within these constraints for a typical submarine towing system to provide a towline capable of sustaining th...|$|E
40|$|For {{some years}} press-hardening {{has been a}} fixed {{variable}} {{in the manufacture of}} high-strength structural components. Advantages to be derived from the press-hardening of components include, for example, high strength with low sheet thicknesses; this offers the potential for weight saving and has finally been successful in convincing automotive manufacturers. Bodywork concepts designed to take into account crash requirements, in addition to a general increase in strength characteristics, are also increasingly calling for zones of various characteristics to be embodied within the relevant structural components. In the present work essential aspects of heat treatment for implementation into the press hardening and roll forming processes are analysed and discussed. By adopting a specific temperature regime in the tool, characteristics zones can be set that demonstrate different tensile strengths and degrees of <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Owing {{to growing}} demand for {{comfortable}} clothes, elastane filament yarns are being used in fabrics for several garments. In this study, core spun yarns were produced with cotton fibres and PBT/elastane filament yarns (cotton as sheath material, PBT yarn and elastane as core yarns). Twill woven (1 / 3 Z) fabrics were produced by using core spun yarns (30 tex) and cotton yarns (30 tex) as weft, and 100 % cotton yarn (59 tex) as warp yarns. The fabrics consisting of PBT were washed at 100 °C for 30 minutes to gain the elasticity. The woven fabrics’ weight, thickness, elongation, <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation,</b> dimensional stability, air permeability, thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity characteristics were tested and statistically evaluated. According to the results, the fabrics containing PBT and elastane filaments had similar elongation and shrinkage values.

40|$|Abstract Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{anterior}} tibial translation (ATT) of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructed-knee between single-bundle and double-bundle ACL reconstruction under cyclic loading. Methods Single-bundle and double-bundle reconstructions of the knee were performed sequentially in randomized order on the same side using eight human amputated knees. After each reconstruction, the reconstructed-knee was subjected to 500 -cycles of 0 to 100 -N anterior tibial loads using a material testing machine. The ATT before and after cyclic loading and “laxity increase”, which indicated a <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation</b> of the graft construct, was also determined. Results The ATT after cyclic loading increased in both single-bundle and double-bundle reconstruction techniques compared to that without cyclic loading. Changes in ATT before and after cyclic loading were 3. 9 [*]±[*] 0. 9 mm and 2. 9 [*]±[*] 0. 6 mm respectively, and were significantly different. Laxity increase was also significantly different (4. 3 [*]±[*] 0. 9 mm and 3. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 8 mm respectively). Although no graft rupture or graft fixation failure was found during cyclic loading, the graft deviated into an eccentric position within the tunnel. Conclusions Although ATT was significantly increased in both single-bundle and double-bundle reconstruction with hamstring tendon after cyclic loading test, there was significant difference. Double-bundle reconstruction might be superior to prevent increasing ATT under cyclic loading. Deformation of hamstring tendon after cyclic loading might result in deterioration of knee stability after ACL reconstruction, and is one of disadvantages of soft tissue graft. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{high voltage}} power network in Sweden {{consists}} mainly of overhead power lines, that is conductors {{suspended in the}} air by supports. Ideally when projecting a power line, all supports should be placed equidistantly and the conductors should be suspended at equal height. When this is not applied, the support placement may have consequences, such as uplifting forces in a support, which should be avoided. The objective of this thesis was to investigate both what in　uences the support placement, and what consequences that may come out of it. This was investigated using mainly analytical calculations on poles and conductors, but was also implemented on a specic case. When solving the case, support placement and FEM software were also used and compared with the analytical calculations. It {{was found that the}} support placement is in　uenced by both environmental factors; such as terrain, obstacles and solidity of the ground, as well as how long spans that are possible to construct. The span length is the distance between two nearby supports and is limited by sag, that is the de　ection of the conductors, and the strength of the supports. The sag is dependent on the tension in the conductor, which is dependent on wind and ice loads, temperature and creep; a <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation</b> that for certain materials occur over time even if the load is constant. Since the sag will increase over time, and especially at high temperatures, the distance between the conductors and the ground will decrease. This extra de　ection must be accounted for when designing the power line and determining the span length. When it comes to support designing, both bending and buckling should be accounted for. The greatest loads the supports are in　uenced by are transferred from the conductors, and therefore are dependent of the span length. An analysis of buckling and bending as function of span length was therefore conducted on non-guyed timber pole supports. It was concluded that bending stresses; due to wind loads on the support and especially on the conductors, are usually the critical aspect when designing standard power line supports...|$|E
40|$|Several {{experimental}} {{studies have shown}} that bone–tendon p 0310 graft healing in ACL reconstruction occurs in a period varying from 3 to 12 weeks. The quality and rate of healing depend on many variables, predominantly the type of graft. Soft tissue grafts such as hamstring tendon grafts heal within a bone tunnel by formation of a fibrous transitional layer between the tendon and bone, which contains penetrating Sharpey-like fibers. This newly formed bone– tendon interface matures with time and resembles the indirect-type insertion observed in tendons and ligaments. Bone plug tendon grafts, such as patellar tendon, heal within bone tunnel by incorporation of the bone plug to the surrounding bone and formation of an indirect-type insertion at the interface between bone and the intraosseous fibrous portion of the graft. Bone–bone healing occurs more rapidly than tendon—bone healing. Resistance to pullout force appears to be similar between the two types of grafts by 8 to 12 weeks after surgery. Therefore soft tissue grafts need high primary fixation strength and stiffness because of the consistent risk of failure due to pullout from the tunnel during the first 2 months. Mechanical stresses can affect maturation and differentiation of the bone–tendon graft junction depending on many factors such as bone density, fixation, placement and tensioning of the graft, gap size, and postoperative immobilization. Compression of the graft within the tunnel can enhance healing for both the bone plug and soft tissue. However, during the first 3 months after an ACL reconstruction, regardless of the type of graft used, the strength of the bone–tendon graft junction does not influence the mechanical behavior of the femur–ACL graft–tibia complex because the weak link of the ligament replacement rapidly shifts from the fixation site to the midsubstance of the graft. Therefore the application of excessive loads during this period, such as a too-aggressive rehabilitation and early return to sport activities, may cause a <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation</b> of the graft, thus compromising the result of the reconstruction. Many efforts have been made to improve the quality and rate of bone–tendon healing. Tissue engineering and gene transfer techniques have been applied to obtain a direct-type fibrocartilaginous insertion of the ACL graft, {{similar to that of the}} native ligament, and to accelerate the healing process of tendon grafts within bone tunnel. However, more investigations will be necessary in the near future to evaluate the possible employment of these biological techniques in the clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{assembly}} of the PWR nuclear power plant is a long and flexible structure. This study {{has been made in}} an attempt to find the structural integrity of the fuel assembly (FA) of Chashma Nuclear Power Plant- 1 (CHASNUPP- 1) at room temperature in air. The non-linear contact and structural tensile analysis have been performed using ANSYS 13. 0, {{in order to determine the}} fuel assembly (FA) elongation behaviour as well as the location and values of the stress intensity and stresses developed in axial direction under applied tensile load of 9800 [*]N or 2 [*]g being the fuel assembly handling or lifting load [Y.  Zhang et al., Fuel assembly design report, SNERDI, China, 1994]. The finite element (FE) model comprises spacer grids, fuel rods, flexible contacts between the fuel rods and grid's supports system and guide thimbles with dash-pots and flow holes, in addition to the spot welds between spacer grids and guide thimbles, has been developed using Shell 181, Conta 174 and Targe 170 elements. FA is a non-straight structure. The actual behavior of the geometry is non-linear due to its curvature or design tolerance. It has been observed that fuel assembly elongation values obtained through FE analysis and experiment [SNERDI Tech. Doc., Mechanical strength and calculation for fuel assembly, Technical Report, F 3. 2. 1, China, 1994] under applied tensile load are comparable and show approximately linear behaviors. Therefore, it seems that the <b>permanent</b> <b>elongation</b> of fuel assembly may not occur at the specified load. Moreover, the values of stresses obtained at different locations of the fuel assembly are also comparable with the stress values of the experiment determined at the same locations through strain gauges. Since the results of both studies (analytical and experimental) are comparable, therefore, validation of the FE methodology is confirmed. The stress intensity of the FE model and maximum stresses developed along the guide thimbles in axial direction are less than the design stress limit of the materials used for the grid [ASTM, Standard specification for precipitation hardening nickel alloy (UNSN 07718) plate, sheet, and strip for high temperature service, B 670 - 80, USA, 2013], fuel rod [ASTM, Standard specification for wrought zirconium alloy seamless tubes for nuclear reactor fuel cladding, B 811 - 02, USA, 2002] and the guide thimble [ASTM, Standard specification for seamless stainless steel mechanical tubing, A 511 - 04, USA, 2004]. Therefore, the structural integrity criterion of CHASNUPP- 1 fuel assembly is fulfilled safely at the specified tensile load...|$|E
