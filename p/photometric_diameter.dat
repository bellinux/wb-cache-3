The detections before break-up indicate a <b>photometric</b> <b>diameter</b> of 4. 7 km, {{from which we}} estimate that the nuclear diameter was about 0. 9 km. We derive a dust production rate of similar to 9 x 10 (4) g s(- 1), corresponding to 0. 03 g s(- 1) per square meter of the nuclear surface area, which {{is comparable to the}} values found for comets 1 P/Halley and C/ 1995 O 1 (Hale-Bopp). The implied gas-to-dust mass production ratio was between 2 and 5. The high daily erosion rate and the continuous fragmentation over months, as derived from water production rates, could not be confirmed. The low radio emission of the fragments directly after the break-up and their low cometary activity may be explained by their low surface temperatures. The published optical and most radio data support that the main nuclear decay started July 23, 2000. Our upper limits on the flux density obtained after the nuclear disintegration put an upper bound on the particulate dust mass released during that event. A scenario in which most of the nucleus disintegrated into many big boulders and part of it into a dust cloud is consistent with our observations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{morphology}} of early-type galaxies in two rich clusters using 2 D surface photometry. In particular, {{the amount of}} light in the 'disk' component is focussed upon, as the presence of a disk is the main morphological criterion in distinguishing between the traditional 'elliptical' and 'S 0 ' classes. Extensive and photometric E-band CCD observations of continuous areas of the Coma and Abell 1367 clusters were obtained at the 2. 5 m Isaac Newton telescope, La Palma during March 1994. A subset of this large data-set has been used in this study, comprising a magnitude-limited (to R = 15. 6) sample of 153 galaxies in the two clusters. Surface photometry measurements, including surface brightness profiles and isophotal shapes, have been made for the sample. Atmospheric seeing is a major problem when measuring light profiles at the distance of Coma from ground-based telescopes. Typical seeing at La Palma (FWHM 1. 2 ") is a significant fraction of the effective radius of many Coma/Abell 1367 galaxies (r(_e) 3 " for small ellipticals). An iterative algorithm was developed to deconvolve the effects of seeing from surface brightness profiles. The result of the algorithm is to extend the range of useful surface photometry inwards to within 2 times the FWHM. In order to parametrise the surface brightness profiles and discriminate between different profile-types, further software was developed to fit one- and two-component model profiles to the seeing-corrected data. The following parameters were measured and tabulated for each of the 153 galaxies: total magnitude M(_t); half-light parameters r (_ 1 / 2) and (μ) (_ 1 / 2); SB at half-light radius μ(r(_ 1 / 2)); <b>photometric</b> <b>diameter</b> D(_ 19. 23) (equivalent to D(_n)); ellipticity at R = 21. 5 isophote ϵ(_ 21. 5); averaged isophote high-order terms (C(_ 3)), (S(_ 3)), (C(_ 4)) and (S(_ 4)); effective radii and surface brightnesses of 5 single power-law r(^ 1) (_n) models, r"e and (^) "^ (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5); best-fitting power-law index n; bulge effective radii and surface brightnesses from the two-component fit and (/^) disk effective parameters r'^e and nY^] and disk-to-bulge luminosity ratio DjB. The measured parameters have been used to investigate various aspects of early-type galaxy morphology. The conclusions are outlined below. Firstly, a two-component r? plus exponential model is a better fit to most galaxies than a single component law fit. Secondly, the traditional division of early-type galaxies into 'elliptical' and 'SO' classes is severely biased by the viewing angle. In fact, it appears that early-type galaxies comprise a population of objects with smoothly varying bulge-to-disk ratio - although a few ellipticals (less than 13...|$|E

40|$|The {{calibration}} {{process of}} long baseline stellar interferometers requires {{the use of}} reference stars with accurately determined angular diameters. We present a catalog of 374 carefully chosen stars among the all-sky network of infrared sources provided by Cohen et al. 1999. The catalog benefits from a very good sky coverage and a median formal error on the angular diameters of only 1. 2 %. Besides, its groups together in a homogeneous handy set stellar coordinates, uniform and limb-darkened angular <b>diameters,</b> <b>photometric</b> measurements, and other parameters relevant to optical interferometry. In this paper, we describe the selection criteria applied to qualify stars as reference sources. Then, we discuss the catalog's statistical properties such as the sky coverage or the distributions of magnitudes and angular diameters. We study the number of available reference stars {{as a function of the}} baseline and the precision needed on the visibility measurements. Finally, we compare the angular diameters predicted in Cohen et al. 1999 with existing determinations in the literature, and find a very good agreement.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{reliability}} of the D - σ and D - Mg(_ 2) distance indicators for elliptical galaxies. In particular, we test whether these empirical correlations are affected by differences in the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies associated with their environment. Our final goal is to assess the reality of the large peculiar velocities measured in the local universe as derived using these relations. Our galaxy sample includes ellipticals located in high and low galaxian density regions. The cluster sample is mainly based on new observations of ellipticals in Coma, Abell 2199 and Abell 2634, while the field sample is selected from the literature. For each galaxy we list measurements of the effective radius, effective surface brightness, <b>photometric</b> <b>diameter,</b> velocity dispersion and magnesium index. We first develop a phenomenological framework of galaxy properties that describes all empirical correlations for spheroidal systems, including both giant and dwarf ellipticals. Despite the wide variety of observed correlations, we show that only three provide independent information on the overall structure and metal abundamce of these systems. These three 'fundamental relations' can be expressed in terms of physical variables assuming that both the galaxy mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and the ratio between the effective radii of the dark and luminous matter distributions (R/R(_e)) depend on the mass of the galaxy. The structure of elliptical galaxies is then determined by both the virial theorem and aa intrinsic mass-radius relation. The metallicity of their stellar populations in turn {{is a function of the}} galaxy velocity dispersion alone. We compare this framework with a theoretical scenario of galaxy formation that combines the hierarchical clustering and the galactic wind models. This picture provides a consistent explanation of the fundamental relations of all elliptical galaxies assuming R/R(_e) ~ constant for dwarf ellipticals while, for giant ellipticals, we find that R/R(_e) must be a decreasing function of galaxy mass. Our framework strongly suggests that this dependence of R/Re on galaxy mass is the only difference between the two galaxy families. We then study the effect of the environment on the D - σ and D - Mg(_ 2) distance indicators by comparing ellipticals that reside in the core of the Coma cluster with those in the cluster halo. By studying the variations within one cluster, we avoid the difficulty of decoupling effects induced by distance errors from those due to real environmental differences. We find that ellipticals located in the outer, low-density areas of the Coma cluster have D diameters that are, on average at a given σ or Mg(_ 2), 10 % or 30 % larger than their counterparts in the cluster core. Using galaxy evolution models we demonstrate that this effect is consistent with the presence of an intermediate age stellar component in some halo ellipticals. We use the framework of galaxy properties in combination with galaxy evolution models to design a new age-independent distance indicator for ellipticals. This relation allows distances to be estimated with an uncertainty of ~ 20 % and is independent of age/environmental effects. We also offer a simple explanation of the trends observed in the D - σ versus D -Mg(_ 2) residuals plot. Finally, we use our new distance indicator to readdress previous measurements of peculiar velocities in both the cluster and field environments. For Abell 2199 and Abell 2634 ellipticals, we show that the new distance estimates are in good agreement with those derived using the D - σ and D - Mg(_ 2) relations. Both clusters are found to have peculiar velocities which are not significantly different from zero. However, when the new distance indicator is applied to field ellipticals we find that the age/environmental effect translates into a spurious positive component of the local peculiar velocity field as derived from D - σ and D - Mg(_ 2). This effect may provide a simple explanation of the large positive peculiar motions observed towards the Great Attractor...|$|E
40|$|Streaming {{motions of}} galaxies and {{clusters}} provide the only method for probing {{the distribution of}} mass, as opposed to light, on scales of 20 - 100 h(^- 1) Mpc. This thesis presents a new survey of the local peculiar velocity field, based upon Fundamental Plane (FP) distances for an all-sky sample of 56 clusters to cz = 12000 km s(^- 1). Central velocity dispersions have been determined from new spectroscopic data for 429 galaxies. From new R-band imaging data the FP <b>photometric</b> parameters (effective <b>diameter</b> and effective surface brightness) have been measured for 324 galaxies. The new spectroscopic and photometric data have been carefully combined with an extensive body of measurements compiled from the literature, to yield a closely homogeneous catalogue of FP data for 725 early type galaxies. Fitting the inverse FP relation to the merged catalogue yields distance estimates with a scatter of 22 % per galaxy, resulting in cluster distance errors of 2 - 13 %. The distances are consistent, on a cluster-by-cluster basis, with those determined from Tully-Fisher-Fisher studies and from earlier FP determinations. The distances are marginally inconsistent with distance estimates based on brightest cluster galaxies, but this disagreement {{can be traced to}} a few highly discrepant clusters. The resulting peculiar velocity field is dominated by a bulk streaming component, with amplitude of 810 ± 180 km s(^- 1) (directed towards l = 260,b = - 5), a result which is robust against a range of potential systematic effects. The flow direction is ~ 35 from the CMB dipole and ~ 15 from the X-ray cluster dipole direction. Two prominent superclusters (the Shapley Concentration and the Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster) may contribute significantly to the generation of this flow. More locally, there is no far- side infall into the 'Great Attractor' (GA), apparently due to the opposing pull of the Shapley Concentration. A simple model of the flow in this direction suggests that the GA region generates no more than ~ 60 % of the Local Group's motion in this direction. Contrary to some previous studies, the Perseus-Pisces supercluster is found to exhibit no net streaming motion. On small scales the velocity field is extremely quiet, with an rms cluster peculiar velocity of < 270 km s(^- 1) in the frame defined by the bulk-flow. The results of this survey suggest that very distant mass concentrations contribute significantly to the local peculiar velocity field. This result is difficult to accommodate within currently popular cosmological models, which have too little large-scale power to generate the observed flow. The results may instead favour models with excess fluctuation power on 60 - 150 h(^- 1) Mpc scales...|$|R
