5|$|Pig iron: The {{earliest}} <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> {{dates to}} the Zhou Dynasty. By the 5th century, archaeological evidence indicates that <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was melted to produce cast iron. In Europe, the process was not invented until the late medieval ages.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon {{dissolved}} {{in it with}} small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (<b>pig</b> <b>iron)</b> becomes brittle and hard. Removing the other impurities results in cast iron, {{which is used to}} cast articles in foundries such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.|$|E

40|$|Sorelmetal ® (high purity iron ingots {{produced}} by QIT- Fer et Titane Inc); {{is the most}} common charge material of ductile iron production used in worldwide range. In this study, high purity <b>pig</b> <b>irons</b> with different compositions were produced from steel scrap instead of iron ore by using electrical arc furnace. These products were compared with Sorelmetal®, according to their chemical compositions and microstructure observation. Experimental studies were performed on <b>pig</b> <b>irons</b> to examine the similarities to Sorelmetal®. For chemical analyses optical emission spectrometry, for microstructural observation optical light microscope have been used. In addition, graphite sizes of the ductile iron were measured by using image analyzer. Depending on the obtained results, both structure and size distribution of graphites resemblances to Sorelmetal®. Therefore this method {{can be used as a}} promising of Sorelmetal...|$|R

5|$|The {{production}} of iron or steel {{is a process}} consisting of two main stages. In the first stage <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is produced in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. In the second stage, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is converted to wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the <b>pig</b> <b>iron.</b> The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron.</b> The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
5|$|Coke iron was {{initially}} only used for foundry work, making pots and other cast iron goods. Foundry work {{was a minor}} branch of the industry, but Darby's son built a new furnace at nearby Horsehay, and began to supply the owners of finery forges with coke <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> {{for the production of}} bar iron. Coke <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was by this time cheaper to produce than charcoal <b>pig</b> <b>iron.</b> The use of a coal-derived fuel in the iron industry was a key factor in the British Industrial Revolution. Darby's original blast furnace has been archaeologically excavated and can be seen in situ at Coalbrookdale, part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Cast iron from the furnace was used to make girders for the world's first iron bridge in 1779. The Iron Bridge crosses the River Severn at Coalbrookdale and remains in use for pedestrians.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E
5|$|In these {{processes}} <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was refined (fined) in a finery forge to produce bar iron, {{which was then}} used in steel-making.|$|E
5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond the lake, a weir with a track over {{it drops}} the level to Carburton Forge Dam, built to provide power for a forge. In 1695 10 acre of land were leased to John Wheeler of Worcester by the duke, {{on which he}} built the forge, a dam pool and floodgates. Deeds held by the Nottinghamshire Archive Service record an {{agreement}} between Wheeler and the duke to pay compensation annually {{as a result of}} the stream supplying the forge flooding the duke's land. The forge flourished until the 1770s. A writer called Pococke described how [...] "the <b>pigs</b> <b>iron</b> were brought from Derbyshire to be melted into bars for use" [...] in 1751. The fifth duke removed all traces of the forge. Beyond Carburton Forge Dam, another weir drops the level to Carburton Dam.

5|$|Since the 17th {{century the}} first step in European steel {{production}} has been the smelting of iron ore into <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> in a blast furnace. Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which has proven more economical.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Henry Cort began {{refining}} iron from <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to {{wrought iron}} (or bar iron) using innovative production systems.

5|$|Puddling process: The {{puddling}} process was known the ancient Chinese during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD. The improvement of steelmaking processes improved {{the overall quality}} of steel by repeated forging, folding, and stacking of wrought iron from <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to make swords.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{temperatures}} {{could be reached}} with ancient methods used since the Bronze Age. Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond , {{it is important that}} smelting take place in a low-oxygen environment. Smelting, using carbon to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy (<b>pig</b> <b>iron)</b> that retains too much carbon to be called steel. The excess carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.|$|E
