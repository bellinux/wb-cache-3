25|$|Furfural is an {{important}} renewable, non-petroleum based, chemical feedstock. Hydrogenation of furfural provides furfuryl alcohol (FA) which is a useful chemical intermediate in for example the manufacture of furan resin prepolymers exploited in thermoset <b>polymer</b> <b>matrix</b> composites, cements, adhesives, casting resins and coatings. Further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol leads to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) which {{is used as a}} nonhazardous solvent in agricultural formulations and as an adjuvant to help herbicides penetrate the leaf structure. Furfural is used to make other furan chemicals, such as furoic acid, via oxidation, and furan itself via palladium catalyzed vapor phase decarbonylation.

25|$|To {{overcome}} {{the need to}} use organic solvents and solid porogens, a technique using gas as a porogen has been developed. First, disc-shaped structures made of the desired polymer are prepared by means of compression molding using a heated mold. The discs are then placed in a chamber where {{they are exposed to}} high pressure CO2 for several days. The pressure inside the chamber is gradually restored to atmospheric levels. During this procedure the pores are formed by the carbon dioxide molecules that abandon the polymer, resulting in a sponge-like structure. The main problems resulting from such a technique are caused by the excessive heat used during compression molding (which prohibits the incorporation of any temperature labile material into the <b>polymer</b> <b>matrix)</b> and {{by the fact that the}} pores do not form an interconnected structure.|$|E
25|$|Phthalates, {{which are}} {{incorporated}} into plastics as plasticizers, comprise approximately 70% of the U.S. plasticizer market; phthalates are by design not covalently bound to the <b>polymer</b> <b>matrix,</b> which makes them highly susceptible to leaching. Phthalates are contained in plastics at high percentages. For example, they can contribute up to 40% by weight to intravenous medical bags and up to 80% by weight in medical tubing. Vinyl products are pervasive—including toys, car interiors, shower curtains, and flooring—and initially release chemical gases into the air. Some studies indicate that this outgassing of additives may contribute to health complications, and {{have resulted in a}} call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. Japanese car companies Toyota, Nissan, and Honda eliminated the use of PVC in car interiors since 2007.|$|E

40|$|Metal-free organic {{phosphorescent}} {{materials are}} attractive {{alternatives to the}} predominantly used organometallic phosphors but are generally dimmer and are relatively rare, as, without heavy-metal atoms, spin-orbit coupling is less efficient and phosphorescence usually cannot compete with radiationless relaxation processes.

2500|$|The {{majority}} of these sensors, however, rely on entrapping the protein in hydrogels, as these are more sturdy and [...] protect the protein {{more than a simple}} coating or membrane. A hydrogel is a porous crosslinked <b>polymer</b> <b>matrix</b> filled with water. Several types of hydrogel exist and have been used to entrap small molecules such as dyes, biomolecules, such as enzymes or whole cells. In the case of protein, they can work either by physically entrapping the protein having pores smaller than the proteins or by chemical linkage of the protein to the matrix. In physically entrapping gels, the protein has to be added when the gel is crosslinked, so the conditions used must not damage the protein, excluding the hydrogel, which requires non-aqueous solvents or harsh chemicals, an example being TEMED-persulphate-catalysed (peroxide radical initiation) acrylamide or acrylate, which is used for SDS PAGE but for not protein encapsulation.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{industrial}} and medical applications exist for silane and functionalized silanes. For instance, silanes {{are used as}} coupling agents to adhere fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers to certain polymer matrices, stabilizing the composite material. In other words, silane coats the glass fibers to create better adhesion to the <b>polymer</b> <b>matrix.</b> They {{can also be used}} to couple a bio-inert layer on a titanium implant. Other applications include water repellents, masonry protection, control of graffiti, applying polycrystalline silicon layers on silicon wafers when manufacturing semiconductors, and sealants. The semiconductor industry used about 300 metric tons per year of silane in the late 1990s. More recently, a growth in low-cost solar photovoltaic module manufacturing has led to substantial consumption of silane for depositing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on glass and other substrates like metal and plastic. The PECVD process is relatively inefficient at materials utilization with approximately 85% of the silane being wasted. To reduce that waste and the ecological footprint of a-Si:H-based solar cells further several recycling efforts have been developed.)". , [...]|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Three commercial clays: Cloisite Na+, Cloisite 30 B and Cloisite 15 A were used to melt compound {{with a number of}} <b>polymer</b> <b>matrices,</b> including polypropylene (PP), poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) and polyamides (PA). X-ray diffraction (XRD), contact angle measurement and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed small interlayer space, poor compatibility and low thermal stability of these nanocomposites, resulting in poor mechanical properties in composites. A number of modifications of commercial clays were carried out, including silylation and introduction of thermally stable surfactants, e. g. alkyl quaternary phosphonium cations and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). It was found that poor compatibility between <b>polymer</b> <b>matrices</b> and organically modified clays, especially in those POSS modified clays, again restricted the formation of exfoliated structure in <b>polymer</b> <b>matrices.</b> A mode of dual-surfactant modification for clay was developed, and large interlayer spacing (> 3. 2 nm), good thermal stability (decomposed at 300 ºC) and improved surface properties for those dual-surfactant modified clays promoted a better dispersion of clays in <b>polymer</b> <b>matrices</b> and consequently better mechanical properties.
