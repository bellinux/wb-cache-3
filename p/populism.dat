5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of <b>populism,</b> other scholars have however found that <b>populism</b> is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the Progress Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that <b>populism</b> could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress Party may.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s green {{became the}} color of the third biggest Swiss Federal Council {{political}} party, the Swiss People's Party SVP. The ideology is Swiss nationalism, national conservatism, right-wing <b>populism,</b> economic liberalism, agrarianism, isolationism, euroscepticism. The SVP was founded on September 22, 1971 and has 90,000 members.|$|E
5|$|Cimon, on {{the other}} hand, {{apparently}} believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles' reforms were leading to the stalemate of <b>populism.</b> According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished {{as a result of}} Pericles' populist policies.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for a {{politically}} active citizenry, and <b>populism</b> has been a longstanding force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout (due in part to its liberal voter registration laws) with virtually no evidence of unlawful voting. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2 percent of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus {{the national average of}} 61.2 percent. Previously unregistered voters can register on election day at their polls with evidence of residency.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death might result in repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including <b>populism</b> and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, <b>populism,</b> and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|More or {{less the}} Scottish answer to American bands like Interpol and the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, with their du-jour cool and deft {{combination}} of insular art flair and dance-floor <b>populism,</b> was hailed by British hype machine New Musical Express as {{the dawn of a}} new rock revolution. The band's blue-blazered appeal, however, started to slip after 2009's overly serious concept album Tonight: Franz Ferdinand. Four years later, the zeitgeist may prefer its rock stars with suspenders and banjos, but Franz Ferdinand's Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is an unapologetically swaggering disco-rock album that refuses to overstay its welcome.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning {{at a time when}} other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward <b>populism,</b> which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} of Berlet's two books, co-authored with Matthew N. Lyons, is Right-Wing <b>Populism</b> in America: Too Close for Comfort, {{published}} in 2000 by The Guilford Press. It {{is a broad}} historical overview of right-wing <b>populism</b> in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Kemalist <b>populism</b> is an {{extension}} of the Kemalist modernization movement. In Kemalist <b>populism,</b> in the ideal society, individuals (citizens of the Republic) would be able to read religious texts by themselves or have them freely translated. The literacy drive and translation of the Quran (originally in Arabic text) to Turkish, for instance, both occurred very early in Atatürk's reformation. Atatürk stated {{on a number of occasions}} that the legitimate rulers of Turkey were common citizens, such as villagers and workers.|$|E
25|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the party's existence, the party was accused of <b>populism</b> or personalism, still lacking stances on many topics and based on the popularity of Naser Khader.|$|E
25|$|Herzen {{opposed the}} {{aristocracy}} that ruled 19th century Russia and supported an agrarian collectivist model of social structure. A rise in <b>populism</b> by 1880 {{led to a}} favorable re-evaluation of his writings.|$|E
25|$|Some ideologists, such as Kingoro Hashimoto, {{proposed}} a single party dictatorship, based on egalitarian <b>populism,</b> patterned after the European fascist movements. An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus shows the influence clearly.|$|E
25|$|Sarkozy is {{generally}} disliked {{by the left}} and has been criticised by some on the right, most vocally by moderate Gaullist supporters of Jacques Chirac and Dominique de Villepin. The communist-leaning magazine L'Humanité accused Sarkozy of <b>populism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Contrary to Iranian traditionalists, neo-fundamentalists {{as well as}} Iranian {{liberals have}} been under the {{influence}} of western thinkers. The Islamic neo-fundamentalists have also borrowed from Western countercurrents of <b>populism,</b> fascism, anarchism, Jacobism, and Marxism without the welfare state.|$|E
25|$|John Lukacs, Hungarian-American {{historian}} and Holocaust survivor, argues {{that there is}} no such thing as generic fascism. He claims that National Socialism and communism are essentially manifestations of <b>populism</b> and that states such as National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy are more different than similar.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{students}} of Hrushevsky, Krypiakevych never politically or intellectually rebelled against {{the authority of}} his mentor, Mykhailo Hrushevsky. Although he did turn away from Hrushevsky's <b>populism</b> to a pro-state interpretation of Ukrainian history, he revered his mentor's memory and in 1935 published a short biography of him.|$|E
25|$|Under Haider's leadership, the FPÖ {{moved to}} the right, {{reflecting}} Haider's nationalist, anti-immigration, and anti-EU views. Haider relied primarily on <b>populism</b> (see below) to advance his interests. From 1986 when Haider became the FPÖ's chairman the party's share in elections rose from 5% in the 1983 elections to almost 27% in 1999.|$|E
25|$|During 1966, Seeger and Malvina Reynolds {{took part}} in {{environmental}} activism. The album God Bless the Grass was released on January of that year {{and became the first}} album in history wholly dedicated to songs about environmental issues. Their politics were informed by the same ideologies of nationalism, <b>populism,</b> and criticism of big business.|$|E
25|$|Turkey is {{a secular}} country in {{accordance}} with Article 24 of its constitution. Secularism in Turkey derives from Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's Six Arrows: republicanism, <b>populism,</b> laïcité, reformism, nationalism and statism. The Turkish government imposes some restrictions on Muslims and other religious groups, as well as Muslim religious expression in government offices and state-run institutions, including universities.|$|E
25|$|Two factions {{were active}} during this debate. On one side were anti-foreigners who viewed foreigners as {{invasive}} and imperialistic and evoked a nativist <b>populism.</b> They advocated {{taking advantage of}} the Boxers to achieve the expulsion of foreign troops and foreign influences. The pro-foreigners on the other hand advanced rapprochement with foreign governments, seeing the Boxers as superstitious and ignorant.|$|E
25|$|The party's {{mixture of}} <b>populism,</b> anti-establishment and {{nationalist}} themes steadily gained support over the years. In addition to far-right voters, the FPÖ {{was able to}} attract voters from both the Social Democrats and the Conservatives in both the national and regional elections of the 1990s, mostly those who were fed up with decades of government by the 'Great Coalition' (see also: Proporz).|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} the first {{successful}} parliamentary party in the Nordic countries to relate philosophically more closely to the French Nouvelle Droite, than to the previous Nordic form of right-wing <b>populism.</b> DPP represented a synthesis of several political currents: the Lutheran movement Tidehverv and its related journal, an intellectual nationalist right from the Danish Association (Den Danske Forening) and conservative populists from the Progress Party.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Orthodox Church held {{a privileged}} {{position}} in the Russian Empire, expressed in the motto Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and <b>Populism,</b> of the late Russian Empire. At the same time, it was placed {{under the control of}} the tsar by the Church reform of Peter I in the 18th century. Its governing body was the Most Holy Synod, which was run by an official (titled Ober-Procurator) appointed by the tsar.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Islamic Principlism in Iran covers {{the history of}} Islamic revivalism {{and the rise of}} {{political}} Islam in modern Iran. Today, there are basically three types of Islam in Iran: traditionalism, modernism, and a variety of forms of revivalism usually brought together as fundamentalism. Neo-fundamentalists in Iran are a subgroup of fundamentalists who have also borrowed from Western countercurrents of <b>populism,</b> fascism, anarchism, Jacobism and Marxism.|$|E
25|$|By the 1870s, {{alongside}} these {{conservative and}} liberal nationalist trends, a third, more radical political force had emerged in Georgia. Its members focused on social problems {{and tended to}} ally themselves with movements {{in the rest of}} Russia. The first stirrings were seen in the attempt to spread Russian <b>populism</b> to the region, though the populists had little practical effect. Socialism, particularly Marxism, proved far more influential in the long run.|$|E
25|$|As a scholar, Mencken {{is known}} for The American Language, a multi-volume study of how the English {{language}} is spoken in the United States. As an admirer of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, he was a detractor of religion, <b>populism</b> and representative democracy, which he {{believed to be a}} system in which inferior men dominated their superiors. Mencken was a supporter of scientific progress, skeptical of economic theories and critical of osteopathic and chiropractic medicine.|$|E
25|$|According to Berlusconi's {{political}} and entrepreneurial opponents, Berlusconismo {{is only a}} form of demagogic <b>populism,</b> comparable to Fascism, in part because Berlusconi has defended aspects of the regime of Benito Mussolini, {{even though he has}} criticised the racial Fascist laws and the alliance with Nazi Germany, referring to himself as pro-Israel. In 2013, he returned to calling Mussolini a good leader whose biggest mistake was signing up to exterminate the Jews. Conrastingly his supporters compare Berlusconismo to French Gaullism and Argentinian Peronism.|$|E
25|$|During {{this entire}} period, he {{was shown to}} be one of Sulla’s best subordinates. A traditionalist {{supporter}} of the Senate’s prerogatives, he had no other objective apart from fighting the <b>populism</b> of Marius and Cinna, and did not participate in the atrocious violence that marked the arrival of the dictatorship of Sulla. Finally in 80 BC, he was appointed consul alongside Sulla, Metellus Pius used his position to reward Quintus Calidius, who had helped bring his father back, by supporting his bid for the praetorship.|$|E
25|$|Prof Pratt {{argues that}} {{the way in which}} penal <b>populism</b> takes hold is through an array of law and order lobby groups making use of {{high-profile}} murders like these to generate fear and push for tougher sentences. The outcome is that the tabloid press, talkback radio hosts and callers, right-wing think-tanks, victims groups and some evangelising police chiefs spread the message that the solution to crime is 'zero tolerance'. As these groups gain access in the media, they have become increasingly influential on government policy.|$|E
