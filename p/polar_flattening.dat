40|$|A planet's {{magnetosheath}} {{extends from}} downstream of its bow shock {{up to the}} magnetopause where the solar wind flow is deflected around the magnetosphere and the solar wind embedded magnetic field lines are draped. This makes the region an important site for plasma turbulence, instabilities, reconnection and plasma depletion layers. A relatively high Alfvén Mach number solar wind and a polar-flattened magnetosphere make the magnetosheath of Saturn both physically and geometrically distinct from the Earth's.

40|$|The {{majority}} of splenic lymphocytes were motile, showing lamellipodial activity {{almost immediately after}} purification. In contrast, fresh blood lymphocytes were non-motile and maintained their spherical suspension morphology. The number of motile blood lymphocytes increased markedly during a 2 -day in vitro culture period. This increase was enhanced by high cell density and required a metabolically active cell with protein synthesis but not exogenous mitogens. The spontaneous development of motility in different subpopulations of blood lymphocytes was analysed by means of monoclonal antibodies. The results indicated that cells which were motile immediately after purification were almost exclusively non-T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes which became motile during in vitro culture included both T and non-T cells. Substrate adhesion mediated by concanavalin A (Con A) changed the morphology of motile T lymphocytes and instead of being <b>polar,</b> the cells <b>flattened</b> over the substratum and acquired a non-polar shape. Furthermore, the morphogenetic response induced by Con A-mediated substrate adhesion appeared to distinguish T and non-T lymphocytes.

40|$|The GEOS- 1 general {{circulation}} {{model has been}} used to compute atmospheric torques on the oceans and solid Earth for the period 1980 - 1995. The time series for the various torque components have been analyzed by means of Fourier transform techniques. It was determined that the wind stress torque over land is more powerful than the wind stress torque over water by 55 %, 42 %, and 80 % for the x, y, and z components respectively. This is mainly the result of power in the high frequency range. The pressure torques due to <b>polar</b> <b>flattening,</b> equatorial ellipticity, marine geoid, and continental orography were computed. The orographic or "mountain torque" components are more powerful than their wind stress counterparts (land plus ocean) by 231 % (x), 191 % (y), and 77 % (z). The marine pressure torques due to geoidal undulations are much smaller than the orographic ones, as expected. They are only 3 % (x), 4 % (y), and 5 % (z) of the corresponding mountain torques. The geoidal pressure torques are approximately equal in magnitude to those produced by the equatorial ellipticity of the Earth. The pressure torque due to <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> makes the largest contributions to the atmospheric torque budget. It has no zonal component, only equatorial ones. Most {{of the power of the}} latter, between 68 % and 69 %, is found in modes with periods under 15 days. The single most powerful mode has a period of 361 days. The gravitational torque ranks second in power only to the <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> pressure torque. Unlike the former, it does produce a zonal component, albeit much smaller (1 %) than the equatorial ones. The gravitational and pressure torques have opposite signs, therefore, the gravitational torque nullifies 42 % of the total pressure torque. Zonally, however, the gravitational torque amounts to only 6 % of the total pressure torque. The power budget for the total atmospheric torque yields 7595 and 7120 Hadleys for the equatorial components and 966 Hadleys for the zonal. The x-component exhibits a large mean value (1811 H), mainly the result of <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> pressure torque acting on the ocean surfaces. Atmospheric torque modes with periods of 408, 440, and 476 days appear in the spectrum of the equatorial components...|$|E

We show that, even without orbital eccentricity, the system can have complex behaviors, in particular when the core is highly flattened. In such a case, the polar motion is forced by several degrees and longitudinal librations appear. This is due to splitting of the equilibrium position of the polar motion. We also get a shift of the obliquity when the <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> of the core is small...|$|E

Contrary to species living in {{temperate}} sea water, the thymus of <b>polar</b> fishes were <b>flattened,</b> incompletely lobated and scarcely distinguishable by normal histology into cortical and medullary regions. Functional regionalisation, however, was suggested by {{differences in the}} sizes of thymocytes from the outer to the inner thymus zone. Another particularity was observed in the thymus of Trematomus species: next to lymphocytes, numerous erythroid cells circulated and differentiated in the parenchyma. Only two main types of epithelial cells could be found by cytological analysis: (i) limiting cells that surround the haematopoietic tissue and (ii) reticular cells that constitute the frame where the lymphoid and erythroid cells can proliferate and differentiate. The reticular cells could not be distinguished in cortical and medullary subtypes as observed in temperate-water fish. Numerous Hassall’s corpuscles, probably with a scavenging role, were also observed in the thymus. The head kidney housed haematopoietic tissue, lacked any excretory tubules, and had a huge blood supply, characteristic of polar fish species. It appeared mainly lymphopoietic in C. hamatus but contemporary erythropoietic and lymphopoietic in Trematomus species. The ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of both reticular and limiting epithelial cells. Reticular epithelial cells (REC) characteristically showed numerous vesicles with a granular content and cell debris. Numerous lymphoblasts, lymphocytes and plasma cells were observed among the REC. Erythropoiesis occurred in all polar species analysed, but in C. hamatus the erythroblasts did not differentiate {{because they had a}} fast senescence. The spleen appeared mainly erythropoietic, with scarcely developed areas of white pulp, in Trematomus species; the erythropoiesis was scarcely evident in C. hamatus. Small vascular ellipsoids showed numerous melano-macrophages in Trematomus, while large haematopoietic areas were organised around the capillaries in C. hamatus. Utrastructural analysis revealed, in all species examined, two main types of epithelial cells: reticular, close to the ellipsoids, and limiting-subcapsular, which surround the organ.

The article also considers the influence of these models on the motion of the selected aircraft. To date, there is technical equipment to provide highly accurate description of the Earthshape, gravitational field, etc. The improved accuracy of the Earth model description results in more correct description of the trajectory and motion parameters of a ballistic missile. However, for short ranges (10 - 20 km) this accuracy is not essential, and, furthermore, it increases time of calculation. Therefore, there is a problem of choosing the optimal description of the Earth parameters. The motion in the model of the Earth, which takes into account a daily rotation of the planet and <b>polar</b> <b>flattening,</b> is discussed in more detail, and the geographical latitude impact on coordinates of the points of fall of a ballistic missile is analyzed on the basis of obtained graphs. The article individually considers a problem of the wind effect on the aircraft motion and defines dependences of the missile motion on the parameters of different wind loads, such as wind speed and height of its action. A mathematical model of the missile motion was built and numerically integrated, using the Runge-Kutta 4 th order method, for implementation and subsequent analysis. Based on the analysis of the calculation results in the abovementioned models of the Earth, differences in impact of these models on the parameters of the aircraft motion are revealed.

MHD simulations in which the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was set to zero were used to define the boundary shapes and positions and how they depend on solar wind dynamic pressure. Polynomial fits to the simulated boundaries along with spacecraft observations {{were used to determine}} the probability of a given position being outside of the bow shock or inside of the magnetopause. The magnetopause and possibly the bow shock have two preferred locations, one representing a compressed magnetosphere and the other an expanded magnetosphere. Variations in the solar wind parameters near Jupiter also show a bimodal distribution but the changes in the solar wind dynamic pressure are not sufficient to account for the observed bimodal distribution of observed magnetopause positions. Internal pressure changes at Jupiter are required. The interplanetary magnetic field also influences the location and shape of the boundaries. In particular, when the IMF is in the By direction or northward magnetopause reconnection acts to reduce <b>polar</b> <b>flattening.</b> Higher internal pressure at dusk leads to a dawn-dusk asymmetry in the magnetopause position with the boundary being farther from Jupiter on the dusk side.

Their instruments will observe {{the surface of the}} planet with a high accuracy (about 1 arcsec for BepiColombo), what motivates studying its rotation. Mercury is assumed to be composed of a rigid mantle and an at least partially molten core. We here study the influence of the core-mantle interactions on the rotation perturbed by the solar gravitational interaction, by modeling the core as an ellipsoidal cavity filled with inviscid fluid of constant uniform density and vorticity. We use both analytical (Lie transforms) and numerical tools to study this rotation, with different shapes of the core. We express in particular the proper frequencies of the system, because they characterize the response of Mercury to the different solicitations, due to the orbital motion of Mercury around the Sun. We show that, contrary to its size, the shape of the core cannot be determined from observations of either longitudinal or polar motions. However, we highlight the strong influence of a resonance between the proper frequency of the core and the spin of Mercury that raises the velocity field inside the core. We show that the key parameter is the <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> of the core.

An early physical characterization is needed to optimize the flyby parameters and the science operations, and to maximize the scientific return. The aim {{of this article is}} to characterize the shape and rotational state of this asteroid. Methods. We compile a set of 26 visible light curves whose phase angle coverage extends from 7. 5 degs to 41. 7 degs, and perform their simultaneous inversion relying on convex modeling. Results. The full three-dimensional solution for asteroid 2867 Steins is rather spherical with axial ratios a/b = 1. 17 and a/c = 1. 25. The rotational state is characterized by a sidereal period of 6. 04681 ± 0. 00002 h, and the pole direction defined by its ecliptic coordinates lambda ~ 250 degs and beta ~ - 89 degs has an uncertainty of about 5 degs. It is therefore almost exactly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, and the viewing geometries are thus restricted to only ± 20 degs about Steins' equator. Consequently, the shape model is not strongly constrained, and the <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> has an uncertainty of about 10 %.

In this study, we attempted to explain the difference by applying a density-contrast stripping process to the crust in the second method. We use the CRUST 2. 0 model to estimate the inertia-moment contribution resulted from the density-contrast structure in the crust to a tri-axial Earth. The contribution of the density contrast in the crust was removed layer by layer. The layers include topography, bathymetry, ice, soft sediment, hard sediment, upper crust, middle crust, lower crust and the reference crust. For the boundaries of the topography and bathymetry layers, we used ETOPO 5 values with a resolution of 5 '. For boundaries of other layers, we used values from the CRUST 2. 0 model with a resolution of 2 °. After the contribution of density contrast is stripped, the equatorial flattening of the core was found to be 6. 544 × 10 − 5, which is still one order of magnitude smaller than the result given by the first method. This suggests that at least one of the methods is not correct. The influence of the uncertainty in the equatorial flattening of the core on the Free Core Nutation frequency is small, but its effect on the gravitational torque acting on the tri-axial inner core cannot be ignored. So an accurate determination of the equatorial flattening of the core is still necessary...|$|E
40|$|We perform global {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) radiation-hydrodynamics {{calculations of}} the envelopes surrounding young planetary cores of 5, 10, and 15 Earth masses, {{located in a}} protoplanetary disk at 5 and 10 AU from a solar-mass star. We apply a nested-grid technique to resolve the thermodynamics of the disk at the orbital-radius length scale {{and that of the}} envelope at the core-radius length scale. The gas is modeled as a solar mixture of molecular and atomic hydrogen, helium, and their ions. The equation of state accounts for both gas and radiation, and gas energy includes contributions from rotational and vibrational states of molecular hydrogen and from ionization of atomic species. Dust opacities are computed from first principles, applying the full Mie theory. One-dimensional (1 D) calculations of planet formation are used to supplement the 3 D calculations by providing energy deposition rates in the envelope due to solids accretion. We compare 1 D and 3 D envelopes and find that masses and gas accretion rates agree within factors of 2, and so do envelope temperatures. The trajectories of passive tracers are used to define the size of 3 D envelopes, resulting in radii much smaller than the Hill radius and smaller than the Bondi radius. The moments of inertia and angular momentum of the envelopes are determined and the rotation rates are derived from the rigid-body approximation, resulting in slow bulk rotation. We find that the <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> is < ~ 0. 05. The dynamics of the accretion flow is examined by tracking the motion of tracers that move into the envelope. The anisotropy of this flow is characterized in terms of both its origin and impact site at the envelope surface. Gas merges with the envelope preferentially at mid- to high latitudes.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{geodetic}} results that {{has come out of}} the satellite tracking program, in addition to the revision of the degree of <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> for the Earth, is that the Earth is characterized by a series of previously undefined geoidal highs and lows. As these cannot be correlated with the surface mass distribution defined by the continents and ocean basins, they presumably are related to regional variations in gravity resulting from the mass distributions within the Earth. That they may have other geophysical as well as geological significance has been proposed by various investigators (Lee and MacDonald, 1963; Wang, 1963; Runcorn, 1964; Baussus, 1960; Vogel, 1960; Scheffer, 1966; Strange, 1966). However, the geoidal pattern defined by different investigators has not been totally consistent in that there are differences both in basic pattern and in magnitude of the geoidal undulations. There has also been an evolutionary trend in the complexity of the geoidal pattern defined. This change in overall pattern, as well as the differences in pattern obtained by different investigators, can be related to the sampling of data used (number of satellites and their orbital elements as well as number and distribution of tracking stations); the type of tracking data used (optical versus electronic doppler observations); the parameters of the reference ellipsoid used (particularly the degree of polar flattening); the degree of fit as represented by the order and degree of the coefficient terms and their derived values; and the combinations of data used, such as satellite plus surface gravity observations. There have also been studies based entirely on surface gravity observations which have been influenced in various degrees by the assumptions made by different investigators for the surface gravity field where there are no observational data...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotational}} behaviour of a stratified visco-elastic planet submitted {{to changes in}} its inertia tensor is studied in a viscous quasi-fluid approximation. This approxima-tion allows for large displacements of the Earth rotation axis {{with respect to the}} entire mantle but is only valid for mass redistribution within the planet occurring on the time scale of a few million years. Such a motion, called true polar wander (TPW), is detected by palaeomagneticiens assuming that the Earth's magnetic field remains on average aligned with the spin axis. Our model shows that a downgoing cold slab induces a TPW which quickly brings this slab to the pole for a mantle of uniform viscosity. The same slab is slowly moved toward the equator when a large viscosity increase with depth takes place in the mantle. Our model is also suitable to investigate the effects of a non-steady-state convection on the Earth's rotation. We discuss these effects using a simple mass redistribution model inspired by the pioneering paper of Goldreich & Toomre (1969). It consists of studying the TPW induced by a random distribution of slabs sinking into the mantle. For such a mass redistribution, only a strongly stratified mantle can reduce the Earth's pole velocity below l"Ma-', which is the upper bound value observed by palaeomagnetic investigations for the last 200 Ma. Our model also shows that when corrected for the hydrostatic flattening, the Earth's polar inertia generally corresponds to the maximum inertia, as it is presently observed. However, {{this may not be the}} case during some short time periods. We also discuss The amount of excess <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> that can be related to tidal deceleration. This frozen component is found to be negligible...|$|E
40|$|On 14 January and 6 October 2008 the MESSENGER {{spacecraft}} passed within 200 km of {{the surface}} of Mercury. These flybys by MESSENGER provided the first observations of Mercury from a spacecraft since the Mariner 10 flybys in 1974 and 1975. Data from the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) provided new information on the equatorial shape of Mercury, and Doppler tracking of the spacecraft through the flybys provided new data on the planet’s gravity field. The MLA passes were on opposite hemispheres of the planet and span collectively ˜ 40 % of the equatorial circumference. The mean elevation of topography observed during flyby 1, in the longitude range 0 - 90 °E, is greater than that seen during flyby 2 in the longitude range 180 - 270 °E, indicating an offset between centers of mass and figure having a magnitude and phase in general agreement with topography determined by Earth-based radar. Both MLA profiles are characterized by slopes of ˜ 0. 015 ° downward to the east, {{which is consistent with}} a long-wavelength equatorial shape defined by a best-fitting ellipse. The Doppler tracking data show sensitivity to the gravitational structure of Mercury. The equatorial ellipticity of the gravitational field, C 2, 2, is well determined and correlates with the equatorial shape. The S 2, 2 coefficient is ˜ 0, as would be expected if Mercury’s coordinate system, defined by its rotational state, is aligned along its principal axes of inertia. The recovered value of the <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> of the gravitational potential, J 2, is considerably lower in magnitude than the value obtained from Mariner 10 tracking, a result that is problematic for internal structure models. This parameter is not as well constrained as the equatorial ellipticity because the flyby trajectories were nearly in the planet’s equatorial plane. The residuals from the Doppler tracking data suggest the possibility of mascons on Mercury, but flyby observations are of insufficient resolution for confident recovery. For a range of assumptions on degree of compensation and crustal and mantle densities, the allowable crustal thickness is consistent with the upper limit of about 100 km estimated from the inferred depth of faulting beneath a prominent lobate scarp, an assumed ductile flow law for crustal material, and the condition that temperature {{at the base of the}} crust does not exceed the solidus temperature. The MESSENGER value of C 2, 2 has allowed an improved estimate of the ratio of the polar moment of inertia of the mantle and crust to the full polar moment (Cm/C), a refinement that strengthens the conclusion that Mercury has at present a fluid outer core...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} “Exploring Intermolecular Space by Charge Density Analysis in Molecular Crystals” {{consists of}} five chapters. A short introductory note {{highlights the importance}} of intermolecular interactions and presents the current status of charge density analysis to obtain insights into such interactions. Charge density analysis of crystalline materials by using high resolution X-ray diffraction data has become routine and enables derivation of reliable one electron properties associated with the electron density. The results obtained from single crystal X-ray diffraction data at low temperature have been compared with periodic theoretical calculations using B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G** methods to unequivocally establish the nature of weak interactions. Chapter 1 describes the quantitative analysis of Cl∙∙∙Cl intermolecular interactions in compounds 2 -chloro- 3 -quinolinyl methanol, 2 -chloro- 3 -hydroxypyridine and 2 -chloro- 3 -chloromethyl- 8 -methylquinoline, which are corresponding to type I (trans and cis) and type II (L) geometries of Cl∙∙∙Cl interactions respectively. The 3 D static deformation density plots from charge density analysis unequivocally suggest that both ‘cis’ and ‘trans’ type I geometries show decreased repulsion whereas type II geometry is attractive based on the nature of “polar flattening” of the electron density around the Cl atom. The topological features derived at bond critical point (BCP) of Cl∙∙∙Cl interactions also support the observed results. Chapter 2 discusses hetero-halogen (Cl∙∙∙F) and homo-halogen (F∙∙∙F) intermolecular interactions involving “organic fluorine” in compounds 2 -chloro- 4 -fluorobenzoic acid and 4 -flurobenzamide respectively. Charge density distributions show <b>polar</b> <b>flattening</b> effects at both atoms Cl and F, however the extent of polarization is small on F in comparison with that of the Cl atom. 3 D static deformation density plots depict δ+ ∙∙∙δ− interactions for Cl∙∙∙F intermolecular interactions while F∙∙∙F interactions show small decreased repulsion features. The topological properties of F∙∙∙F interactions bring out the similarity between F∙∙∙F and Cl∙∙∙Cl interactions. Chapter 3 describes the nature of C−Cl∙∙∙O=C halogen bond in 2, 5 -dichloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone, a molecule specifically chosen to depict this interaction dominantly. The topological values at bond critical point, three dimensional static deformation density features and electrostatic potential isosurfaces unequivocally establish the attractive nature of C−Cl∙∙∙O=C halogen bond in the crystalline lattice. Chapter 4 discusses the generation of multi-component systems (for example cocrystals and salts) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Two systems associated with nicotinamide, one with salicylic acid and the other with oxalic acid as coformers resulting in 1 : 1 molecular complexes have been analyzed. The charge density analysis, particularly at the proton transfer region clearly bring out the differences between cocrystal and salt thus providing insights into the continuum in the proton transfer pathways in molecular crystals. Chapter 5 describes a new methodology [supramolecular synthon based fragment approach (SBFA) ] concerning transferability of experimental charge density multipole parameters and building a database using well defined supramolecular synthons. The modularity and robustness of supramolecular synthons are used to transfer experimental charge density multipole parameters of synthons derived from a high resolution X-ray diffraction study to target molecules possessing these synthons as fragments in the crystalline lattice. The synthesized charge density and derived topological properties on target molecules using routine single crystal diffraction data are comparable with both experimental and theoretical charge density results. SBFA thus is expected to provide an additional database which can be applied to include intermolecular interactions space in the modeling directly unlike the available ones such as ELMAM, INVARIOM and UBDB. Further, SBFA approach can be extended to the determination and synthesis of charge density properties in macromolecules such as polypeptides, nucleic acids and proteins.
