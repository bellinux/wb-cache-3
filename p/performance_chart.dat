The no-load speed is the number of rotations per minute of the motor shaft when voltage is applied between the terminals with no load to the motor.

Stall torque is when the motor rotation stalls upon increasing the load to the rotating motor, while stall current is when the motor rotation stalls upon increasing the load to the rotating motor. The physics formula E = M (electrical energy input equals mechanical energy output) demonstrates the conservation of energy principle at work in a Mabuchi motor (voltage x current) divided by (efficiency expressed as a percentage) equals (speed in revolutions per minute x torque mN.m g.cm).|$|E

50|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>charts</b> allow a {{pilot to}} predict the takeoff, climb, cruise, and landing {{performance}} of an aircraft. These charts, provided by the manufacturer, {{are included in the}} AFM/POH. Information the manufacturer provides on these charts has been gathered from test flights conducted in a new aircraft, under normal operating conditions while using average piloting skills, and with the aircraft and engine in good working order. Engineers record the flight data and create <b>performance</b> <b>charts</b> based on the behavior of the aircraft during the test flights. By using these <b>performance</b> <b>charts,</b> a pilot can determine the runway length needed to take off and land, the amount of fuel to be used during flight, and the time required to arrive at the destination. It {{is important to remember that}} the data from the charts will not be accurate if the aircraft is not in good working order or when operating under adverse conditions. Always consider the necessity to compensate for the performance numbers if the aircraft is not in good working order or piloting skills are below average. Each aircraft performs differently and, therefore, has different performance numbers. Compute the performance of the aircraft prior to every flight, as every flight is different.|$|R

40|$|With {{more and}} more {{political}} candidates using social media for campaigning, researchers are looking at measuring {{the effectiveness of this}} medium. Most research, however, concentrates on the bare count of likes (or twitter mentions) in an attempt to correlate social media presence and winning. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Interaction Strength Plot (IntS) to measure the passive interactions between a candidate's posts on Facebook and the users (liking the posts). Using this method on original Malaysian General Election (MGE 13) and Australian Federal Elections (AFE 13) Facebook Pages (FP) campaign data, we label an FP as performing well if both the posting frequency and the likes gathered are above average. Our method shows that over 60 % of the MGE 13 candidates and 85 % of the AFE 13 candidates studied in this paper had under-performing FP. Some of these FP owners would have been identified as popular based on bare count.
