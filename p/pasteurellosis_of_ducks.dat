40|$|Iron plays {{a central}} role in {{bacterial}} infections, influencing both bacterial virulence and host cellular defense mechanisms. We investigated whether iron chelation might be of benefit in the treatment <b>of</b> pneumonic <b>pasteurellosis</b> <b>of</b> calves. Neutrophils obtained from calves previously treated with the iron chelator, deferoxamine, were studied for their responses to latex and opsonized zymosan by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and to phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan by superoxide generation. Treatment with deferoxamine in vivo failed to influence these in vitro measures of neutrophil oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, iron depletion with deferoxamine failed to modify the pathophysiological derangements that occurred in calves following experimental induction of pneumonia by intratracheal inoculation with Pasteurella haemolytica. These data indicate that iron chelation using deferoxamine cannot be recommended as an adjunct to conventional therapy in the treatment <b>of</b> pneumonic <b>pasteurellosis</b> <b>of</b> cattle...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the conservation of expression of a 31 -kDa iron-regulated protein by serotypes of Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella trehalosi associated with <b>pasteurellosis</b> <b>of</b> cattle and sheep. A polyclonal antibody prepared against the purified 31 -kDa periplasmic iron-regulated protein from P. haemolytica serotype A 1 showed that all P. haemolytica serotypes expressed similar 31 -kDa proteins with identical N-terminal sequences, whereas P. trehalosi serotypes expressed immunologically different 29 -kDa proteins with a different N-terminal sequence. Antibody to the 31 -kDa iron-regulated protein was a useful tool to distinguish similarities and differences of the iron-regulated proteins of P. haemolytica and P. trehalosi...|$|R

40|$|Duck {{lymphocytes}} {{have not}} been classified into cells resembling B or T cells of mammals. Reagents {{used in the past}} to identify lymphocyte populations in other species {{have not been}} useful for this purpose and antibodies raised to duck immunoglobulin bind in high proportions to blood and organ lymphocytes <b>of</b> <b>ducks</b> as well as to their red blood cells. Here we report that a polyclonal rabbit antiserum reacting to the CD 3 marker on human T cells has been used to identify duck T lymphocytes. These antibodies react with the intracytoplasmic portion of the human CD 3 epsilon chain (amino acids 156 - 168), an epitope highly conserved between mammals. Immunohistochemical staining with this antiserum <b>of</b> sections <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> lymphoid organs and FACScan analysis <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> lymphoid cell suspensions identified a population <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> lymphocytes with a staining pattern similar to that seen for mammalian T cells.

40|$|Poultry meat, {{particularly}} that <b>of</b> <b>duck,</b> has relatively {{high levels of}} unsaturated fatty acids and low levels <b>of</b> antioxidants. <b>Ducks</b> consume twice as much feed as broilers during growth, therefore, duck meat {{is more likely to}} be influenced by diet than chicken meat. The effects of dietary fat differing in unsaturation level (2. 5 % tallow or olive, sunflower or linseed oils) together with α-tocopheryl acetate (α-TA) at either a control (20 mg α-TA/kg feed) or a supplemented level (400 mg α-TA/kg feed) on α-tocopherol content, fatty acid composition and lipid oxidation <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> muscle in 7 week old birds were investigated. Fat source influenced fatty acid composition <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> meat. Ducks fed tallow had a higher percentage saturated fats, while ducks fed olive oil had a higher percentage monounsaturated fats than other dietary groups. In the absence <b>of</b> supplemental α-TA, <b>duck</b> muscle stability to lipid oxidation was greatest for those receiving diets containing sunflower oil and lowest for those receiving tallow. α-Tocopherol content and oxidative stability <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> muscle were increased (p < 0. 05) by α-TA supplementation irrespective of fat source. Interestingly oxidative changes were much more extensive in duck breast meat than corresponding thigh meat for all treatment groups. This finding is in contrast when compared with similar dietary trials for chicken and turkey. Therefore, oxidative stability <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> meat differs from that of other poultry meats...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} integrated farming <b>of</b> rice and <b>duck</b> on rice grain yield, an experiment {{was performed on}} Oryza sativa L. in Gilan, Iran in 2013.

In this experiment the main factor <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> was between two levels (by presence <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> and without presence <b>of</b> <b>duck)</b> and the minor factor was the factorial combination of weeding levels (weeding on the releasing day <b>of</b> <b>ducks</b> and not weeding on the releasing day of ducks); and also the planting spaces were 20 × 20 [*]cm, 25 × 25 [*]cm, 30 × 30 [*]cm. The results of the analysis of variance show that the presence <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> in a rice field causes increasing in plant height, the number of grains per panicle, the number of filled grains per panicle, weight of thousands grains, harvest index (HI) and grain yield. In total, results and statistics show that using duck in rice fields causes increasing in grain yield and consequently it increases farmer’s income and also reduction of using agricultural pesticides and protecting the environment...|$|R

5|$|Until the mid-19thcentury {{duck rearing}} was {{concentrated}} on the Duck End, but by the 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in the area, particularly Weston Turville and Haddenham. Contamination of Aylesbury's soil by years <b>of</b> <b>duck</b> rearing, and new public health legislation which ended many traditional practices, caused the decline <b>of</b> the <b>duck</b> rearing industry in the Duck End, and by the 1890s the majority <b>of</b> Aylesbury <b>ducks</b> were raised in the villages rather than the town itself. Population shifts and the improved national rail network reduced the need to rear ducks near London, and large duck farms opened in Lancashire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Although the number <b>of</b> <b>ducks</b> raised nationwide continued to grow, between 1890 and 1900 the number <b>of</b> <b>ducks</b> raised in the Aylesbury area remained static, and from 1900 it began to drop.|$|R
