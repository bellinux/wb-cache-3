40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> can be used directly as inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> {{and the development of a}} new type of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R
