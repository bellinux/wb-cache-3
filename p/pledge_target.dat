5000|$|Devlin's {{debut album}} was {{launched}} on Pledge Music {{where it is}} available to pre-order along with several other exclusives including a chance to record backing vocals with her (although that never happened). In December 2012, it was stated that the album would be released in 2013, having reached 45% of the <b>pledge</b> <b>target</b> within the first two weeks. Having reached 100% on New Year's Eve 2012, Devlin began the recording of her album in early 2013. On 26 June 2013, she finished recording the limited release version of her debut album. Hide & Seek was released to pledgers on 1 July 2013. Janet released an exclusive bonus acoustic EP, Nothing Lost, to pledgers on 14 August 2013.

40|$|Many {{countries}} have <b>pledged</b> <b>targets</b> or actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; {{these have been}} listed in the Appendices to the Copenhagen Accord and, {{at the time of}} writing, are being transferred to the UNFCCC Cancún Agreements. This analysis examines the costs and effectiveness of these pledges, as well as the potential for fiscal revenue, using a computable general equilibrium model. The results show that while the pledges are an important and welcome start to a global solution, they are not ambitious enough for a pathway to limit average global temperature increase to below 2 °C. This paper estimates the costs of action at around 0. 3 % of GDP for both Annex I and non-Annex I countries and 0. 5 – 0. 6 % of global real income. Furthermore, the fiscal revenue potential can exceed 1 % of GDP for the Annex I countries if market-based instruments are used. Sensitivity analysis shows that allowing more offsets can reduce the costs of actions substantially, as can direct linking of carbon markets across Annex I countries.

40|$|International audienceChallenges {{for climate}} change {{consideration}} involve {{evolution of the}} world energy system, especially, of the energy and technological mix permitting to satisfy the energy service demands. Different pathways to achieve a low-carbon economy are analyzed {{in the line of}} the climate goals expressed in the context of Copenhagen Accord, and according to several assumptions about technologies availability, energy sources potential, etc. The analysis of these possible futures brings information concerning the impact of climate policies in a world and regional view and, their effectiveness to reduce emissions in the line of the global warming objective. It also allows us to discuss the more plausible strategies to reduce GHG according to economic and technological considerations. Stabilize the atmospheric concentrations of GHG at the level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system is the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC. Significant GHG emissions mitigation is necessary to reach this long-term collective goal for climate change mitigation requiring limiting global average temperature increases to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. All major developed and developing countries have <b>pledged</b> <b>targets</b> under the Copenhagen Accord but the question is to determine if these promising emissions reductions will be sufficient and if a wider participation will be necessary for the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC. Also, what is interesting and important to analyze is the different impact of these climate policies according to developed and developing regions, in term of level of their contribution in the global effort of GHG emissions reductions, technological potentials and investments to reach their target. Such is the aim of this study...|$|R
50|$|The {{focus is}} on solar power utilization. The {{launching}} of such an alliance in Paris also sends a strong signal to the global communities about the sincerity of the developing nations towards their concern about climate change and {{to switch to a}} low-carbon growth path. India has <b>pledged</b> a <b>target</b> of installing 100GW by 2022 and reduction in emission intensity by 33-35% by 2030 to let solar energy reach to the most unconnected villages and communities and also towards creating a clean planet. India's pledge to the Paris summit offered to bring 40% of its electricity generation capacity (not actual production) from non-fossil sources (renewable, large hydro, and nuclear) by 2030.it is based on world co operation.|$|R
40|$|With {{more than}} 17, 000 {{institutions}} worldwide, {{the carbon dioxide}} emissions produced by the higher education (HE) sector are globally significant {{and the need for}} reduction is apparent. Recent decades have seen the demand for HE expand rapidly. The United Kingdom HE sector, where emission reduction targets have been set, is used to demonstrate that appropriate target setting and legitimate emission reduction strategies are essential for meaningful change on a global scale. This study compares the carbon performance of 20 institutions in the English ‘Russell Group’ of research-intensive universities to their self-set targets, using three key performance indicators: full-time equivalent staff/student numbers, gross internal area and income. It was found that emissions increased for all but two institutions and consequently, targets are extremely ambitious and almost certainly unachievable owing to very high emission growth rates that inhibit future success i. e. London School of Economics’ emissions grew 143 % since 2005 / 06. Observations are supported by a 10 -point appraisal that measures the environmental value of each carbon management plan and the ‘reality check’ equation x- 10, where x is institutional target and - 10 represents a more realistic 2020 institutional target of 10 %, to classify them as either pragmatic or ambitious by comparison. A paradox is highlighted: institutions that set realistic but relatively low targets can be penalised in league tables and lambasted for apparent lack of ambition even when they {{may be more likely to}} succeed in delivering environmental improvements. Although targets promote environmental measures, the results show that action should be favoured over rhetoric. The University of Southampton is used as a case study and forms the focus of a snapshot staff and student questionnaire, highlighting the range of electricity consuming activities (i. e. computer/laptop usage) increasing electricity demand and subsequent emissions. Increasing staff and student awareness on impacts of energy usage will promote a cultural shift in becoming more energy efficient to reduce emissions. It is clear that current carbon management plans are not a good indicator of future performance and that the English HE sector has underestimated the challenge of carbon emissions reduction. Given current trends, <b>pledged</b> <b>targets</b> seem unlikely to be met by English universities and the likely environmental costs may jeopardise the competitiveness of the sector on the global stage if it is not addressed. Methods for assessing Scope 3 emissions need refining and standardizing given they are likely to the most significant portion of a typical university’s carbon footprint. The use of appropriate key performance indicators to foster action and promote realistic target-setting is required at sector-level to achieve the 2020 goa...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the potential for}} using border carbon adjustments (BCAs) and welfare-maximizing tariffs to compel non-compliant countries to meet emissions reduction <b>targets</b> <b>pledged</b> under the Paris Climate Agreement. Our analysis employs a numerical economy-wide model with energy sector detail and, given recent actions by the new US administration, considers BCAs on US exports. We find that BCAs result in small reductions in US emissions and welfare. Consequently, the US is better off when it does not restrict emissions and faces BCAs on its exports than when it implements policies consistent with the Paris Agreement. However, targeted welfare-maximizing tariffs could inflict greater cost on the US than if it complied with its pledged emissions reductions. We conclude that BCAs are an ineffective enforcement mechanism but carefully chosen tariffs could be a mechanism to enforce the Paris Agreement...|$|R
40|$|Each country’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) <b>pledges</b> an {{emission}} <b>target</b> for 2025 or 2030. Here, {{we evaluated}} the INDC intergenerational and interregional equity by comparing scenarios with INDC emission target in 2030 {{and with an}} immediate emission reduction associated with a global uniform carbon price using AIM/CGE (Asian-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium). Both scenarios eventually achieve 2 °C target. The results showed that, as compared with an immediate emission reduction scenario, the intergenerational equity status is not favorable for INDC scenario and the future generation suffers more from delayed mitigation. Moreover, this conclusion was robust to {{the wide range of}} inequality aversion parameter that determines discount rate. On the other hand, the INDC scenario has better interregional equity {{in the early part of}} the century than does the immediate emission reduction scenario in which we assume a global carbon price during the period up to 2030. However, interregional equity worsens later in the century. The additional emission reduction to the INDC in 2030 would improve both inter- and interregional equity as compared to the current INDC. We also suggest that countries should commit to more emission reductions in the follow-up INDC communications and that continuous consideration for low-income countries is needed for global climate change cooperation after 2030...|$|R
40|$|Through an {{increasingly}} globalized supply chain, local consumption {{of goods and}} services has impacts around the world. The carbon footprint can be used to link local consumption to global greenhouse gas emissions. This study describes the development and use of REAP Petite, a household-level footprint calculator. We describe how the tool integrates geodemographic information with user-inputted data; allows users to compare their footprint with others in their community; and presents them with <b>targeted</b> <b>pledges</b> to help them reduce their impact. Such tools can help individuals to see the impact their consumption has on emissions and help promote alternative behaviors. Based on the lessons learned during tool development and through using the tool with individuals in the UK and Sweden, we make recommendations for the development of new footprinting tools for use in the public domain. We highlight the benefits of using bottom-up methods for calculating footprints; recommend that designers consider future-proofing their tools; discuss the trade-off between complexity and usability; and recommend that designers consider going “beyond carbon” to increase the appeal of tools to a wider audience. We also highlight the importance of providing opportunity for users to compare their footprints with those of others and of monitoring and evaluating user engagement with the tool...|$|R
5000|$|On December 14, 2010, O'Connell {{announced}} that she was raising money to record a new album and was working with Pledgemusic {{in order to give}} fans an opportunity to help fund studio time, with the goal of being in the studio sometime in January 2011. In return for pledging O'Connell decided to include personalized merchandise ranging from autographed CDs and T-shirts, handwritten lyrics, and hand-drawn artwork to house concerts, her personal iPod filled with music, and even grocery shopping or mini-golf with the pledger when she comes to their city for a show. The project was set for a sixty-day pledge period, however, fan <b>pledges</b> exceeded the <b>target</b> amount in the first 24 hours, making it the fastest Pledgemusic project ever to reach its goal. One week later she added more of the incentives that sold out quickly as well as new incentives like the harmonicas she uses for her videos and albums, a Photoshop vacation photo with the pledger, and a volleyball painted with the pledger's face in the style of [...] "Wilson" [...] from the movie Cast Away, joking that her New Year's resolution was to make progressively weirder arts and crafts.

40|$|This study {{provides}} alternative {{estimates of the}} costs of greenhouse gas abatement through 2050 that would be necessary to limit CO 2 atmospheric concentrations to approximately 450 parts per million and limiting warming to 2 °C. Specific estimates are provided for 25 major economies (with the European Union as a single economy). Business as usual baselines are first developed, based on US Department of Energy projections through 2030 and on maintenance of country-specific trends in GDP growth, energy efficiency growth, and carbon-efficiency of energy growth thereafter. The central policy simulation then involves a "Copenhagen Convergence" path, in which major economies meet their Copenhagen (December 2009) pledges for 2020, and thereafter emissions per capita decline along a path that by 2050 results in equal per capita emissions in all countries. Three abatement cost functions are used for calculating the resulting abatement costs: a model based on McKinsey & Co. estimates for 2030; the Nordhaus RICE model cost functions; and a set of summary cost regressions calculated from the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF- 22) survey of abatement models. It is found that abatement costs should be moderate, reaching about one-fourth to two-thirds of one percent of GDP by 2030 and 1 to 2 percent of GDP by 2050. Costs can be reduced by international trading, but by less than generally perceived. A more ambitious early start on abatement than pledged at Copenhagen could reduce full-period costs. The study calculates corresponding magnitudes of investment for abatement as well as adaptation costs for developing countries, and identifies a benchmark of about $ 80 billion annually (excluding China) by 2020, lending support to the $ 100 billion <b>target</b> <b>pledged</b> for industrial country financial support by that year. ...|$|R
40|$|The central {{concept of}} the Russian agro-industrial {{production}} stabilization programme {{is a combination of}} market relations with government protectionist policy. The results achieved in the course of agrarian reforms in Russian regions indicate that there have been provided important legal and organizational conditions for successful functioning of multi-layer agriculture and formation of land market. However, as the paper shows, the agrarian reform still fails to bring about any growth in production. The present situation is such that if the current trends in AIC remain the downswing in production may make another 15 % in the nearest years. This requires immediate measures to be taken in order to increase food supply and protect the domestic commodity producers. For the purpose of planning a strategy of further reforms in AIC there have been identified the basic factors of stabilization of regional food markets. The paper contains the results of correlation-regression analysis and the typology of Russian regions based on the evaluation of the factors that govern the food demand and supply and the complex indicator of the level and structure of nourishment. It is shown that if the Russian food market is localized within the bounds of individual regions then the principal factors restraining food consumption are the low level of quality ecologically pure products. The paper also contains suggestions associated with improvement of the taxation system in part it is applied to agricultural commodity producers. principal factors restraining food consumption are the low level of development of the agrarian sector in the region and the insufficient provision of the local processing enterprises with raw agricultural produce. It is proven that the regional agrarian policy must pay due respect for the specific natural and climatic features {{as well as for the}} resource potential of the region. Along with this it is clear that food self-provision of regions must not in any way neutralize the production specialization and hamper the development of inter-regional ties. The research shows that the existing underdeveloped market environment is the cause for the low effectiveness of market means of regulation like interest rates and tax privileges. The application of direct economic instruments of regulation such as compensations for the agricultural producers' expenses, intervention purchases, subsidies and budget allocations for realization of investment programmes seems more reasonable in this situation. It is important that the agricultural commodity producers be supported selectively, the most effective ones having the priority. The authors outline some fundamental principles of a flexible price mechanism. The latter allows for the prices adjusted on federal and regional levels, <b>pledge</b> and <b>target</b> prices and price differentials for high quality ecologically pure products. The paper also contains suggestions associated with improvement of the taxation system in part it is applied to agricultural commodity producers. ...|$|R
