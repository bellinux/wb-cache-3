The paper presents the particle size-distribution of wheat going through each break, in a five-break roller mill system with a capacity of 4. 2 t/h and equipped with a semolina sorting compartment (divisor).

40|$|Industrial wheat milling {{processes}} {{are based on}} a gradual size reduction approach, with repeated milling and sieving steps to achieve appropriate breakage of the wheat kernel and its effective reduction into flour. This approach greatly increases the flour yield, but makes the process more difficult to understand and operate. In this respect, mathematical modeling can be very useful to optimize industrial milling operations by relating the operating variables to the final product quality and quantity. As a first step toward the modeling of an entire wheat milling process, in this study experimental data were generated from roller mills and plansifters, and the data were used to build multivariate statistical models enabling one to improve process understanding and to predict the particle size distribution of the milled material and of the sieved material, as well as the amount of material remaining on each sieve, from the known operating conditions and wheat moisture. The unit operation models were then concatenated, and the propagation of prediction errors was analyzed. The results are very satisfactory, in that a comprehension of the breakage mechanism was obtained with a single modeling framework that unifies the modeling results obtained in existing studies, and the product quality and amount were predicted with good accuracy. The results on prediction error propagation show that, although the models are data-driven, the design of the <b>plansifter</b> model can be done independently of that of the roller mill model, since the prediction error did not propagate across the models strongly...|$|E

40|$|Wheat milling is {{a complex}} process, in terms of plant layout, {{interactions}} between processing units and high variability of feed materials. Despite the rapidly increasing diffusion of analytical instruments to characterize important wheat and flour properties (e. g., near-infrared spectrometers and image analysis sensors), current wheat milling processes are still poorly instrumented. Therefore, process operation is mostly based on the operators’ experience, {{and in most cases}} even the design of the process is based on experience only. On the other hand, severe quality requirements are usually set on the final product. The development of science-driven (as opposed to experience-driven) tools to support process understanding, design and operation can be very beneficial for those industries that require wheat milling as a part of their manufacturing process. Intelligent manufacturing through digitalization is a trend in current manufacturing systems. This Dissertation moves along this trend by proposing an integrated, model-based approach to the optimization of wheat milling processes. In particular, two complementary approaches are investigated: development of data-driven models for single processing units, and simulation of entire milling processes. The models of single units are used to tackle different issues that arise in the wheat milling operation: i) wheat classification, ii) process understanding, iii) prediction of product quality and iv) process design and scale-up. Regarding wheat classification, a methodology based on the analysis of near-infrared (NIR) spectra in combination with latent variable modeling is developed. The objective is checking the ability of NIR spectra to discriminate different wheat varieties, an important aspect of the wheat milling operation, given the high intrinsic variability showed by natural products as wheat. Wheat milling {{is a complex}} process which needs profound understanding to be operated in a satisfactory way. The analysis of the model parameters allows for a better comprehension of the breakage mechanism occurring in wheat milling, thus improving process understanding. The effect of the most influential process parameters and of the wheat properties onto the milled product characteristics is studied for different “passages” (i. e., combinations of processing units) of the process. Expensive and time-consuming experiments can be partly avoided exploiting the predictive ability of data-driven models, which can be used to predict the product quality (i. e., the particle size distribution or the mass fraction of the milled or sieved material), thus supporting the operators in process operation. In this Dissertation, data-driven models are used to predict the product quality both for roller mills and for <b>plansifters.</b> The problem of process design is related to the estimation of the process parameters to be used to obtain a product with a desired characteristic. Data-driven models provide a useful tool to this purpose, through the implementation of appropriate model inversion techniques. In this Dissertation, a latent variable model inversion methodology, that relies on an optimization framework and on data coming from different plant scales, is developed. The framework aims at suggesting the optimal process parameters to be used to obtain a product with desired properties, with the ultimate scope of accelerating the scale-up from the laboratory to the commercial plant. The development of a platform for the simulation of the whole milling process is started in this Dissertation. Due to the complexity of the wheat milling operation, the process is still open to optimization, in terms of both layout and power consumption. The objective is developing a simulator of the whole milling process, that aims at modeling the pneumatic transport, pressure drops and power consumption. This tool can be used to get a better comprehension of the energy consumed throughout the mill and to optimize the process layout, minimizing the overall power consumption. ...|$|R
