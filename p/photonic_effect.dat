50|$|The {{instrumentation}} of conductive AFM (c-AFM) {{has evolved}} {{with the desire}} to measure local electrical properties of materials with high resolutions. The essential components are: the piezo-tube, the guide laser, the conducting tip, and cantilever. Although these components are identical to traditional AFM their configuration is tailored to measuring surface currents on the local scale. As mentioned previously, the piezo-tube can be placed either above or below the sample, depending on the application of the instrumentation. In the case of c-AFM, repulsive contact mode is the predominantly used to obtain electric current images from the surface as the sample moves in the x and y direction. Placing the z-piezo above the cantilever allows for better control of the cantilever and tip during analysis.The material that comprises the conductive tip and cantilever can be customized for a particular application. Metal-coated cantilevers, gold wires, all-metal cantilevers and diamond cantilevers are used. In many cases diamond is the preferred material for cantilever and/or tip because it is an extremely hard material that does not oxidize in ambient conditions. The main difference between the instrumentation of c-AFM and STM is that in c-AFM the bias voltage can be directly applied to the nanostructure (tip and substrate). In STM, on the other hand, the applied voltage must be supported within the vacuum tunneling gap between the STM probe and surface. When the tip is in close contact with the sample surface the application of bias voltage to the tip creates a vacuum gap between the tip and the sample that enables the investigation of electron transport through nanostructures.The main components and instrumentation of c-AFM instrumentation are identical to that required for a pc-AFM module. The only modifications are the illumination source, filter and inverted microscope objective that are located beneath the sample substrate. In fact, most pc-AFM instruments are simply modified from existing cp-AFM instrumentation. The first report of this instrumental modification came in 2008. In that paper, Lee and coworkers implemented the aforementioned modifications to examine the resolution of photocurrent imaging. Their design consisted of three main units: a conductive mirror plate, steering mirror and laser source.The main difficulty with the previously existing c-AFM instrumentation is the inability of the technique for characterizing photonic devices. Specifically, it is difficult to measure changes in local and nano-scale electrical properties that result from the <b>photonic</b> <b>effect.</b> The optical illumination component (laser) was added to the c-AFM module in order to make such properties visible. Early in development, the main concerns regarding pc-AFM include: physical configuration, laser disturbance and laser alignment. Although many of these concerns have been resolved pc-AFM modules are still widely modified from c-AFM and traditional AFM instruments.|$|E

It is shown that the local electromagnetic enhancement can be as high as similar to 4. 5 x 10 (13) for nanoshell dimer arrays with optimal geometry, and sensitive tunability in the resonant frequency can be gained by varying the geometrical parameters, making such structures appealing templates for SERS measurements with single molecule sensitivity. The extraordinarily high enhancement is attributed to a collective <b>photonic</b> <b>effect</b> constructively superposed onto the intrinsic enhancement associated with an isolated nanoshell dimer.

In contrast to excitonic transitions in semiconductor NCs, the optical transitions are localized and {{not affected by}} quantum confinement. The radiative decay rates of the dopant emission in NCs are nevertheless different from their bulk analogues due to <b>photonic</b> <b>effects,</b> and also the luminescence quantum yield (QY, important for applications) is affected. In the past, different theoretical models have been proposed to describe the <b>photonic</b> <b>effects</b> for dopant emission in NCs, with little experimental validation.

30|$|For the {{emission}} enhancement in organic light emitting devices, previous papers have achieved around 50 % improvement [28, 29] and 56 % [30] by the <b>photonic</b> crystal <b>effect</b> only. In these studies, the high-refractive index dielectric oxide filled the photonic crystal structure {{to increase the}} out-of-domain light directionality, and for planarization to reduce the current leakage during the electroluminescence operation. As a result, they produced a larger <b>photonic</b> crystal <b>effect</b> than in the present study, 33 %, where the oxide fill-deposition of dielectric oxide for planarization was not applied. Therefore, direct comparison of the <b>photonic</b> crystal <b>effect</b> between this and previous studies is meaningless. Rather, {{it should be noted}} that the present approach of filling nanoimprinted hole arrays with nanosilver colloids creates LSPR coupling as well as simultaneously providing the planarization effect that otherwise ultimately gives rise to current leakage and efficiency degradation.

40|$|A {{distributed}} parameter {{model for}} photocatalytic oxidation of air contaminants in monolith reactors is presented. Heat and mass balance equations for monolith structure are {{combined with a}} model of irradiation from a light source and a kinetic model for photon adsorption and chemical reaction to describe the processes of heat, mass and photon transfer within the system and the heterogeneous chemistry at the catalyst surface. The model accounts for interaction between light and matter at the catalyst surface, convective and interphase gas-solid heat and mass transfer, reaction at the catalyst surface and heat conduction within the solid structure. Together with detailed axial profile of temperature and conversion in the gas phase and at the catalyst surface under different operating conditions (inlet gas temperature, composition and flow rate, light source power, monolith geometry), the model provides the distribution of photon flux along the channels and allows the discrimination between thermal and pure <b>photonic</b> <b>effect</b> on the overall rate of conversion.

40|$|The {{photonic}} {{structure of}} cut muscle tissues {{reveals that the}} well-ordered gratings diffract light, producing iridescent colours. Cut fibrils protruding from the muscle surface create a two-dimensional periodic array, which diffract light at specific wavelengths upon illumination. However, this <b>photonic</b> <b>effect</b> misleads consumers {{in a negative way}} to relate the optical phenomenon with the quality of the product. Here we discuss the fundamentals of this optical phenomenon and demonstrate a methodology for quantitatively measuring iridescence caused by diffraction gratings of muscle tissue surface of pork (Sus scrofa domesticus) using reflection spectrophotometry. Iridescence was discussed theoretically as a light phenomenon and spectral measurements were taken from the gratings and monitored in real time during controlled drying. The findings show that the intensity of diffraction diminishes as the surface grating was dried with an air flow at 50 °C for 2 min while the diffracted light wavelength was at 585 ± 9 nm. Our findings indicate that the diffraction may be caused by a blazed surface grating. The implications of the study include providing guidelines to minimise the iridescence by altering the surface microstructure, and in consequence, removing the optical effect...|$|E
40|$|This two-part thesis {{focuses on}} biointerfaces of two {{different}} biological systems. It specifically examines the interplay of structure and functionality in these biointerfaces. Part one studies photo-bio-electrochemically active bacteria and the strong dependence of their electrical current generation on electrode structure and pigment organisation. Part two uncovers surprising design principles of photonic structures on flower petals and presents research tools to study disordered optical systems. Biophotovoltaics (BPV) is a newly described biophysical effect in which a biofilm of photosynthetic microorganisms associated with an anode produces electrical current that can be harvested and passed through an external circuit. In this thesis-part, an experimental set-up is presented to quantitatively measure photo-electric activity of cyanobacteria in BPVs. Using this set-up, a systematic study of anode morphologies reveals that large electrode surface areas enhance photocurrents by two orders of magnitude, identifying structuration as key design criterion for bioelectrochemical interfaces. Electrodes with micrometer-sized pores allow enhanced direct contact area with bacteria, but with tested cyanobacteria this {{did not result in}} a photocurrent increase, disproving recent speculations in the literature. Furthermore, a theoretic-mathematical framework is presented to estimate light-energy utilisation in biofilms. It is detailed how pigment concentration and distribution affects the light-level dependent saturation of electron harvesting biofilms. This study brings the theory together with experiments, such as genetic modification and photo-current measurements. Part two of this thesis approaches the interaction of light and biointerface structuration from a different angle. In a significant extension of the candidate’s MPhil project, it was discovered that the disorder in natural photonic structures can be an advantage rather than a limitation in biology. With biological image analysis, optics simulations and nano-manufacturing a new <b>photonic</b> <b>effect</b> is uncovered which is iridescent but surprisingly constant in chroma.

40|$|A growing {{population}} along with developing nations are increasing {{the demand for}} energy. The International Energy Agency forecasts a global electricity demand increase of 70 percent by 2040. This is an increase from nearly 18 TW to over 30 TW. The sun {{can be a great}} clean source of achieving this energy demand. Despite the large solar industry development, the market is still growing as solar energy only accounted for 0. 87 % of the global energy production in 2013. The opportunity exists to manufacture more affordable solar energy that can penetrate more of the global energy market. In this dissertation, a photonic-based manufacturing technique called intense pulsed light (IPL) was investigated to enhance the photovoltaic properties of CdTe, better understand the CdCl 2 treatment used to create higher efficiency CdTe solar devices, enable the first sintering and efficiency enhancement of perovskite solar cell (PSC), and study the possible conversion of a stable 2 D perovskite to a 3 D perovskite. CdTe thin films grown by low temperature electrodeposition were treated {{for the first time with}} IPL. The low temperature electrodeposition growth resulted in films consisting of nanoparticles, with reduced melting point temperatures. In combination with the high temperature rise produced by the pulses of light, the lower melting temperature resulted in pores/voids being filled as well as enhanced grain growth. As a result, pin-holes and grain boundary recombination were diminished. Subsequently the fill factors of PV devices created using this technology significantly increased. In addition, the IPL also successfully improved the crystallinity in the CdTe films by photonically initiating the popular CdCl 2 treatment. To understand the mystery behind the mechanism of the CdCl 2 treatment, low temperature PL was utilized and new electrodeposition precursors resulting from the study improved device efficiencies. Photoactive perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 layers were successfully sintered with a novel IPL treatment with efficiencies exceeding 12 %. The processing time was reduced to 2 ms, which was significantly faster than those from previous reports. Additionally, the average performance of the IPL-processed samples showed an improvement compared to the hot- plate-processed samples. This advance creates an exciting new method to quickly create dense layers of perovskite, eliminating the rate-limiting annealing step detrimental to industry adoption, and shows the first known occurrence of sintering in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite particles. Lastly, the fast photonic processing of the IPL enabled the first conversion of a stable 2 D perovskite structure into a 3 D structure. This caused an band gap shift from 2. 0 eV to 1. 6 eV and showed the capabilities of band gap tuning enabled by the IPL. While this work is the first documentation of band gap tuning enabled by a <b>photonic</b> <b>effect,</b> it presents a possible inexpensive manufacturing technique that could use one material to create several different colors for the future development of pixel-based LED displays...|$|E
40|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are two {{promising}} alternative, cost-effective concepts for solar-to-electric energy conversion {{that have been}} offered to challenge conventional Si solar cells over the past decade. The configuration of a DSSC or a QDSSC consists of sintered TiO 2 nanoparticle films, ruthenium-based dyes or quantum dots (QDs) (i. e., sensitizers), and electrolytes. Upon the absorption of photons, the dyes or QDs generate excitons (i. e., electron-hole pairs). Subsequently, the electrons inject into the TiO 2 photoanode to generate photocurrent; scavenged by a redox couple, holes transport to the cathode. The overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a DSSC or QDSSC is dictated by the light harvest efficiency, quantum yield for charge injection, and charge collection efficiency at the electrodes. The goal of our research is to understand the fundamental physics and performance of DSSCs and QDSSCs with improved PCE at the low cost based on rational engineering of TiO 2 nanostructures, sensitizers, and electrodes through an integrated experimental and modeling study. In this presentation, I will discuss three aspects that I have accomplished {{over the last several}} years. (1) Effects of surface treatment and structural modification of photoanode on the performance of DSSCs. First, our research indicates that the surface treatment with both TiCl 4 and oxygen plasma yields the most efficient dye-sensitized TiO 2 -nanoparticle solar cells. A maximum PCE is achieved with a 21 µm thick TiO 2 film; the PCE further increases to 8. 35 % after TiCl 4 and O 2 plasma treatments, compared to the untreated TiO 2 (PCE = 3. 86 %). Second, we used a layer of TiO 2 nanoparticle film coated on the FTO glass, and a bilayer of TiO 2 nanoparticle/freestanding TiO 2 nanotube film deposited on the FTO glass as photoanodes. The J~V parameter analysis acquired by equivalent circuit model simulation reveals that nanotubular structures are advantageous and impart better charge transport in nanotubes. However, the photocurrent generation is reduced due to the small surface area, which in turn results in low dye loading. Third, we fabricate ZnO and TiO 2 nanoflowers by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The PCEs of DSSCs crafted with ZnO and TiO 2 nanoflowers are low comparing to those with TiO 2 nanoparticles. (2) The use of earth abundant, environmentally friendly quaternary Copper Zinc Tin Sulfide (CZTS) as a low-cost alternative to noble metal Pt as the counter electrode (CE). With a simple wet chemistry synthesis of CZTS and a viable spin-coating fabrication of CE, the resulting CZTS film after selenization exhibits an impressive electrocatalytic performance as CEs to promote the regeneration of iodide from triiodide in electrolyte, yielding an impressive PCE of 7. 37 %, remarkably comparable to that with the Pt CE (PCE = 7. 04 %). The use of CZTS as CE may expand the possibilities for developing low-cost and scalable DSSCs, thereby dispensing with the need for expensive and rare Pt. (3) Simulation of the light harvesting ability of TiO 2 nanotube solar cells coated with CdSe and PbSe QDs and the charge injection at the interfaces of TiO 2 substrate and quantum dots. We find that for short nanotubes, there is a diffractive <b>photonic</b> <b>effect</b> where the absorption is maximized for the lattice pitch close to the wavelength of light being absorbed. The ab initio simulation results reveal appreciable overlaps of the wave-functions in the QDs and the TiO 2 substrate, which render the electron transfer on a time scale shorter than the electron-hole recombination time in the QDs...|$|E

40|$|Photonic {{crystals}} {{can affect}} the behavior of visible light, and other electromagnetic waves, {{in ways that are}} not possible by other means. The propagation of photons can be completely forbidden or the the light can be made to follow a well- defined path. Fluorescent emission can be enhanced for some wavelengths or completely shut off for others, and it is possible to do all this simultaneously in a single structure. However, photonic crystals are very difficult to fabricate as they require precision patterning at sub-micron length scales. This fabrication difficulty has resulted in many of the potential applications for photonic crystals to currently be unrealized. Similarly, there is an abundance of opportunities to explore the workings of photonic crystals and also to develop exciting new methods for their fabrication. The content of this dissertation explores some methods for fabricating photonic crystals, including direct laser writing, interference lithography, colloidal deposition, and chemical vapor deposition. The angle-resolved characterization of photonic crystals is performed on fluorescent photonic crystals that exhibit uniquely <b>photonic</b> <b>effects,</b> which are explained with a simplified model of the electromagnetic wave-functions. Another model is shown to well-explain the emission from fluorescent photonic crystals that are not of sufficient quality to exhibit truly <b>photonic</b> <b>effects.</b> The ability to perform angle- resolved optical characterization is improved with a commercial 4 -circle diffractometer. A method to determination the resulting structure of conformal deposition processes proves useful as a tool for the design, modeling, and characterization of photonic crystals.

40|$|Upconversion (UC) {{presents}} a possibility to exploit sub-bandgap photons for current generation in solar cells by creating one high-energy photon out {{of at least}} two lower-energy photons. Photonic structures can enhance UC by two effects: a locally increased irradiance and a modified local density of photon states (LDOS). Bragg stacks are promising photonic structures for this application, because they are straightforward to optimize and overall absorption can be increased by adding more layers. In this work, we present a comprehensive simulation-based analysis of the <b>photonic</b> <b>effects</b> of a Bragg stack on UC luminescence. The investigated organic-inorganic hybrid Bragg stack consists of alternating layers of Poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), containing purpose-built β-NaYF 4 : 25 % Er 3 + core-shell nanoparticles and titanium dioxide (TiO 2). From optical characterization of single thin layers, input parameters for simulations of the <b>photonic</b> <b>effects</b> are generated. The local irradiance enhancement and modulated LDOS are first simulated separately. Subsequently they are coupled in a rate equation model of the upconversion dynamics. Using the integrated model, UC luminescence is maximized by adapting the Bragg stack design. For a Bragg stack of only 5 bilayers, UC luminescence is enhanced by a factor of 3. 8 at an incident irradiance of 2000 W/m 2. Our results identify the Bragg stack as promising for enhancing UC, especially in the low-irradiance regime, relevant for the application in photovoltaics. Therefore, we experimentally realized optimized Bragg stack designs. The PMMA layers, containing UC nanoparticles, are produced via spin-coating from a toluene based solution. The TiO 2 layers are produced by atomic layer deposition from molecular precursors. The reflectance measurements show that the realized Bragg stacks are in good agreement with predictions from simulation...|$|R

40|$|Various {{combinations}} of periodically assembled nanoporous silicon layers with different refractive indices and thicknesses {{have been used}} to fabricate one-dimensional photonic quantum well structures, in which both the well and barrier regions consist of photonic crystals. The structures are operational in the regime of visible light. Quantized states resulting from the <b>photonic</b> confinement <b>effect</b> are observed, consistent with calculations using the transfer-matrix method. Behaviors of the photons in the structures can be well described by the effective wave-vector approach...|$|R
40|$|Weak {{measurement}} is {{an important}} technique for detecting the tiny spin-dependent splitting in <b>photonic</b> spin Hall <b>effect.</b> The weak measurement is only valid when the probe wavefunction remains almost undisturbed during the procedure of measurements. However, it does not always satisfy such condition in some practical situations, {{such as in the}} strong-coupling regime or the preselected and postselected states are nearly orthogonal. In this paper, we develop a modified weak measurement for detecting <b>photonic</b> spin Hall <b>effect</b> when the probe wavefunction is distorted. We find that the measuring procedure with preselected and postselected ensembles is still effective. This scheme is important for us to detect the <b>photonic</b> spin Hall <b>effect</b> in the case where neither weak nor strong measurements can detect the spin-dependent splitting. The modified theory is valid not only in weak-coupling regime but also in the strong-coupling regime, and especially in the intermediate regime. The theoretical models of conventional weak measurements and modified weak measurements are established and compared. We show that the experimental results coincide well with the predictions of the modified theory. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication in Physical Review...|$|R
40|$|We study {{predictions}} for the reaction e + e − → ¯νν(nγ). The complete one-loop corrections {{are taken into}} account and higher order contributions, in particular those for the observed real photons, are added whenever necessary. The event generator KKMC, a general-purpose Monte Carlo generator for the process e + e − → ¯ ffnγ based on the method of exclusive exponentiation, is used as the environment. We extend its applicability to the process e + e − → ¯νlνlnγ, l = e,µ,τ, where the observation of at least a single γ is required. The exponentiation is implemented {{in much the same way}} as for the s-channel process alone. In particular, all <b>photonic</b> <b>effects</b> present in the case of W exchange, which cannot be included in the s-channel exponentiation scheme, are calculated to a finite order only. The real hard photon matrix element is calculated up to O(α 2). Leading logarithmic contributions of the two-loop corrections and one-loop photonic corrections accompanying real single photon emission are included. The electroweak corrections are calculated with the DIZET library of the ZFITTER package. Numerical tests and {{predictions for}} typical observables are presented...|$|R
