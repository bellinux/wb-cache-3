5000|$|A <b>pariah</b> <b>state,</b> {{defined in}} its {{simplest}} terms, is an outcast state. This {{is not a}} new term in the lexicon of International Relations, nor is it a new historical concept. What is new, however, is what Lawal refers to as [...] "the basis for Pariahood appellation." [...] Other definitions have been advanced that expand this basis (see next section below), or perhaps add more academic nuance, which may vary by author or the author's field of study. These definitions are here grouped into two categories: definitions focusing on the lack (or disadvantage) the <b>pariah</b> <b>state</b> objectively suffers from, and definitions focusing on the political justification - given by other nations - for why that <b>pariah</b> <b>state</b> [...] "deserves" [...] their extraordinary attitude towards it.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the past}} few centuries, the {{authority}} to designate a nation as an outcast, or <b>pariah</b> <b>state,</b> was relatively clear, often resting with religious authorities. (E.g., [...] "the Ottoman Empire for example was regarded as an outcast by European States" [...] since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 until the nineteenth century on a [...] "religious basis.") In more recent times, however, the criteria for and attached implications of pariah statehood, {{as well as the}} designating authorities, are the subject of much disagreement. For example, the Nigerian scholar Olawale Lawal has stated: There are so many open questions on the issue of <b>Pariah</b> <b>State.</b> For instance who determines a <b>Pariah</b> <b>State</b> and how a nation becomes a <b>Pariah</b> <b>State...</b> This becomes more profound when one realizes that a nation that is an outcast in one region, has diplomatic and friendly relations with others. By some criteria, nations can be considered pariahs within their own neighborhood of surrounding states. By others, an international body (such as the United Nations) or perhaps a consensus among certain nations may govern the meaning or use of the term.|$|E
5000|$|The first type of {{definitions}} is well {{exemplified by}} Bellany's definition, {{according to which}} a <b>pariah</b> <b>state</b> is [...] "A state lacking any significant soft power."Similarly, The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations, defines the pariah states as [...] "international States/actors which, {{by virtue of their}} political systems, ideological postures, leadership or general behavior, suffer from diplomatic isolation and widespread global moral opprobrium." [...] This definition, as the previous one, does not indicate what kind of political system, ideological posture, leadership or general behavior, is ascribed to the <b>pariah</b> <b>state</b> by the other nations.|$|E

On the face of it, this juxtaposition is easily rejected. But strong evidence backs the increasing weight of international sentiment opposing Australia's record. Australia may already have pariah status {{in terms of its}} asylum policies. So why does its government-and perhaps also the majority of its people-seem to care so little for Australia's tarnished international reputation...|$|R

[...] Grenier also accused the organisation of hypocrisy for granting observer status to SWAPO and the PLO but not the anti-Soviet forces in Afghanistan: [...] "I have no idea why the Afghans struggling desperately to free their country from Soviet occupation do not qualify as a national liberation movement, but I have never heard them mentioned once in the corridors of the U.N., except by the United States".|$|R
25|$|Writer R. Marchal {{identifies}} two {{key events}} in Sino-African relations. First, the Tian'anmen protests in 1989; the spectacle consolidated opposition {{to what was}} perceived as the PRC's violent oppression of demonstrators. Economically developed nations threatened to enforce economic sanctions, while African countries kept silent, either to conceal their own harsh policies or to further their ties with China. Indeed, that was the results as China's strengthened its cooperation with African states. The growing alliance between China and Africa was more and more needed for both sides. China's growing industry resulted in a rapidly expanding and seemingly inexhaustible demand for resources. Meanwhile, in the relative calm ushered in {{by the end of the}} cold war, concerns about human rights issues in China, furthered isolated the mix of rogue and <b>pariah</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
5000|$|International law {{can serve}} as {{objective}} criteria. For example, nations who violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty are often sanctioned for their actions. Such sanctions can include designation as a <b>pariah</b> <b>state,</b> {{as has been the}} approach used by the United States. However, international law can fail in this regard, as under the current international system, most nation states recognize their own legal supremacy over the laws of any international governing body. Thus, according to Lawal, consensus under international law can be problematic. In the case of nuclear arms development, international isolation can have a paradoxical [...] "push effect" [...] on a <b>pariah</b> <b>state,</b> motivating accelerated development of nuclear weapons. As of 2012, there was no provision in international law for pariah status.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second type}} of {{definitions}} is most simply exemplified by Weiss's definition, according to which pariah states are [...] "states that violate international norms." [...] Similarly, Harkavy offers, [...] "A <b>Pariah</b> <b>State</b> is one whose conduct {{is considered to be}} out of line with international norms of behavior." [...] Geldenhuys gives a more detailed definition of that type: [...] "A pariah (or outcast) country is one whose domestic or international behaviour seriously offends the world community or at least a significant group of states." [...] Marks's definition elaborates more: a <b>pariah</b> <b>state</b> is [...] "a state with provocative policies or expansionary territorial ambitions, measures of the absence of diplomatic relations with neighboring states or the situational harm posed to other states if the state in question acquired nuclear weapons." ...|$|E

40|$|Amid {{the burgeoning}} {{literature}} on international norms, {{the study of}} states that violate them, so called pariahs, remains sparse (Shannon 2000). Although recent studies of <b>pariah</b> <b>states</b> have the identified numerous {{ways in which they}} break international norms, we do not know why they pursue one action over another (E. g Geldenhuys 2004, Nincic 2005). I argue that the export of violence is caused by the state’s 2 ̆ 2 revolutionary identity 2 ̆ 2 which leads to the adoption of competing and incompatible norms. Using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) I test this against other alternate and prevailing hypotheses, demonstrating that a combination of sovereignty, existential threat, and either irredentism or a revolutionary identity is necessary to cause the export of violence. As an additional analysis, I examine this under the Cold War and Post-Cold War eras, achieving similar results...|$|R
40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Department of Political Science, Rand Afrikaans University, 29 October 1985 The main {{objective}} of the presentation is to analyse and explain {{the nature and extent}} of South Africa's international isolation. This is done through a dual comparison: on the one hand, South Africa is compared with other isolated states and, on the other, with "normal" or integrated states. There are several historical and contemporary examples of states that isolate themselves and of others that are forced into isolation. In the first section, the study deals briefly with states that have opted for voluntary isolation, viz. the USA, Britain, Japan, China, Burma, Bhutan, Nepal, Albania and a few others. The second and most important section focuses on enforced isolation. Countries that are ostracised by the international community, are popularly known as <b>pariah</b> <b>states.</b> Four basic areas of isolation -diplomatic, economic, military and socio-cultural -are distinguished. In each of these a number of specific indicators of isolation are proposed, enabling one to measure the extent of isolation. South Africa, Israel, Taiwan and Chile are today commonly regarded as the primary examples of <b>pariah</b> <b>states.</b> In this presentation, only South Africa's isolation will be examined in any detail. The discussion of the other three cases should nonetheless be adequate to gain a reasonable understanding of their present isolation. In dealing with South Africa's isolation, aspects of voluntary isolation are first considered, before examining the Republic's current enforced isolation. When all the indicators of isolation are taken into account, South Africa appears to be far more isolated than either Israel or Chile. The closest modern analogy to South Africa is Taiwan, which is in some respects more and in others less isolated than the Republic. South Africa however differs from Taiwan as well as from Israel and Chile in the sense that its isolation is combined with far more intense international pressure and other punitive measures than experienced by any of them. There is also a far stronger pro-isolation lobby within South Africa, than in any of the other three states...|$|R
5000|$|In contrast, various American {{government}} officials, including Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and William Perry. {{who were}} in office during the Cold War period, are now advocating the elimination of nuclear weapons {{in the belief that}} the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence is obsolete, and that reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective in the post cold war era A 2011 article in The Economist argues along similar lines, that risks are more acute in rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lack the [...] "security safeguards" [...] developed by America and the Soviet Union and that additional risks are posed by the emergence of <b>pariah</b> <b>states,</b> such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons as well as the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device.|$|R

Their rationale and conclusion was not based on the old world with only a few nuclear players, but on the instability in many states possessing the technologies and the lack of wherewithal to properly maintain and upgrade existing weapons in many states: The risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union. The emergence of <b>pariah</b> <b>states,</b> such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device.

40|$|Since {{assuming}} its {{seat in the}} UN Security Council in 1971, China {{has gradually}} moved to use its veto to protect <b>pariah</b> <b>states</b> (with which it does business) and to check United States policy on matters deemed {{not to be in}} China 2 ̆ 7 s interests (the protection or recognition of Taiwan.) China 2 ̆ 7 s UN diplomacy is coloured far more by pragmatism than it is by ideology - its voting being shaped by world perceptions as well as strategic considerations. Domestically, China experiences some 150, 000 to 180, 000 protest demonstrations and riots a year. Yet, despite widespread corruption and massive inequalities of income and wealth, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) retains its iron grip on power - economic, health, environmental and political destabilizing factors notwithstanding. Essentially, the CCP controls, imprisons or executes all who seek to reform it or who dare to openly oppose it. Significantly, Mao Ze Dong, often eulogized as a great benefactor, killed 78 million of his own citizens (through starvation or violence), making him a greater mass murderer than the Nazi leader, Adolph Hitler, who killed 17 million German civilian opponents - some 458. 8...|$|R
50|$|Initially, most of Israel's {{arms sales}} were to Third World countries, but, owing to {{financial}} difficulties faced by these clients and to competition from new Third World arms producers such as Brazil and Taiwan, different sales strategies {{had to be}} adopted. In part through joint ventures and coproduction, Israel succeeded in breaking into the more lucrative American and West European markets. By the early 1980s, more than fifty countries on five continents had become customers for Israeli military equipment. Among Israel's clients were communist states (China and Romania), Muslim states (Morocco, Turkey, Indonesia, and Malaysia), and so-called <b>pariah</b> <b>states</b> (South Africa and Iran). To some degree, Israel was restricted in its marketing by United States controls over arms transactions involving the transfer of components or technology of United States origin. In one well-publicized case, the United States vetoed the sale of twelve Kfir fighters to Uruguay in 1978. Intimidation of potential buyers by Arab states also presented a problem. Observers believed that Arab pressure {{played a part in}} decisions by Austria and Taiwan not to purchase the Kfir and in Brazil's decision not to choose the Gabriel missile for its navy.|$|R
50|$|No {{universal}} standard {{exists to}} prevent nations, organizations, or even individuals from referring to nations as pariah states. For example, political commentator and activist Noam Chomsky declared in 2003 {{and again in}} 2014 that the United States had become a <b>pariah</b> <b>state.</b> Both declarations were based on results from Gallup polls showing that only 10 percent {{of people around the}} world supported the US war in Iraq and that 24 percent of people in the world believed the United States represented the greatest threat to world peace. Such poll results are not listed among objective criteria advanced by academic sources, international authorities or NGOs, or any governing bodies as criteria for designation as a <b>pariah</b> <b>state,</b> and they fly in the face of at least one academic standard put forward by Geldenhuys, that major world powers by definition cannot be pariah states because they cannot be isolated or harmed politically or economically, or brought into compliance with international norms by pariah designations, whether by individuals or international governing bodies.|$|E

5000|$|Though Chávez {{inspired}} {{other movements}} in Latin America {{to follow his}} model of chavismo {{in an attempt to}} reshape South America, it was later seen as being erratic and his influence internationally became exaggerated.

Chávez also aligned himself with authoritarian nations and radical movements that were seen as being anti-Western, with relations with Cuba and Iran becoming a particular importance. Chávez focused on a variety of multinational institutions to promote his vision of Latin American integration, including Petrocaribe, Petrosur, and TeleSUR. Bilateral trade relationships with other Latin American countries also {{played a major role in}} his policy, with Chávez increasing arms purchases from Brazil, forming oil-for-expertise trade arrangements with Cuba, and creating unique barter arrangements that exchange Venezuelan petroleum for cash-strapped Argentina's meat and dairy products. He also befriended <b>pariah</b> <b>states</b> such as Belarus and Iran. Domestic mishandling of the country under Chávez prevented Venezuela from strengthening its position in the world.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A crucial {{resource}} {{the apartheid}} state needed to import was oil. As an embargo took hold through the 1970 s, methods were sought to circumvent {{it through the}} use of intermediaries and the construction of pipelines off the Durban coast for the speedy off-loading and transport of oil to the economic heartland, some 500 kilometres inland. This paper casts a net into that period, illustrating how the apartheid state made common cause with the most ruthless of traders, some of whom developed ingenious ways to make considerable amounts of money indirectly fuelling a <b>pariah</b> <b>state’s</b> violent repression of its people. In particular, the paper focuses on a ship called the Salem, which sank off the coast of Senegal in January 1980. The case of the Salem illustrates the global networks that existed in the illicit oil trade, the lengths the state would go to by relying on brokers to break the embargo and also explores maritime insurance scams, of which the sinking of the Salem {{was one of the biggest}} in maritime history. The final section of the paper brings the story up to the present to show how pipelines off the Durban coast and the selling of oil reserves are still the site for nefarious schemes of one sort or another...|$|R
