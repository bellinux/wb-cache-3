40|$|It is {{possible}} to employ opaque <b>photocathodes</b> in image <b>tubes</b> having a special electromagnetic lens {{without the use of}} special internal image-forming optical lenses or mirrors. The special electron lens, having flat object and image planes, is found to provide excellent quality electron-optical image transfer. Stray light reflection inside the tube is expected to be less serious in this electron lens than in a conventional magnetically focused image tube lens due to the offset image plane, and due to the increased absorption of photons in opaque photocathode applications...|$|R
40|$|We {{constructed}} {{an advanced}} detection system for two-photon fluorescence microscopy {{that allows us}} to image in biological tissue and tissue phantoms up to the depth of a few mm with micron resolution. The innovation lies in the detection system which is much more sensitive to low level fluorescence signals than the fluorescence detection configuration used in conventional two-photon fluorescence microscopes. A wide area <b>photocathode</b> photomultiplier <b>tube</b> (PMT) was used to detect fluorescence photons directly from a wide (1 inch diameter) area of the turbid sample, as opposed to the photon collection by the microscope objective which can only collect light from a relatively small area of the sample. The optical path between the sample and the photocathode is refractive index matched to curtail losses at the boundaries due to reflections. The system has been successfully employed in the imaging of tissue phantoms simulating brain optical properties and in biological tissues, such as murine small intestine, colon, tumors, and other samples. The system has in-depth fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) capabilities and is also highly suitable for SHG signal detection, such as collagen fibers and muscles, due to the intrinsically forward-directed propagation of SHG photons. © 2013 SPIE...|$|R
40|$|Streak {{cameras are}} vital to the daily {{functioning}} of the LLE facility, providing the ability to time-resolve high-speed processes occurring in the fusion environment. Even with standardized cameras, such as the Rochester Optical Streak System (ROSS), readings on an identical source can vary over multi-year timescales. Many factors may contribute to these fluctuations, but the most likely cause is degradation of the photocathode. Measuring the absolute quantum efficiency of a streak <b>tube’s</b> <b>photocathode</b> is a lengthy and expensive process. The goal of this project {{was to develop a}} simple method of determining a ROSS camera photocathode’s relative quantum efficiency quickly in a lab setting. This would allow the photocathode response to be monitored on a yearly basis. Furthermore, a method of converting relative measurements into absolute measurements was investigated...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the principles, design, fabrication, and {{operation}} of a highly segmented, large-area hybrid photodiode, which is being developed {{in the framework of}} the LHCb RICH project.

40|$|A new optical {{oscilloscope}} {{has been}} developed {{on the basis of}} the image-converter tube camera technology. Optical or electrical pulses in single or repetitive mode can be tested. When single pulse without time dependence on the sweep circuit is tested, an optical-fiber delay unit is adopted to ensure the pulse is captured. The optical oscilloscope works at a fixed frequency while repetitive pulses of any frequency less than 20 GHz were tested. A newly designed <b>photocathode</b> optical oscilloscope <b>tube,</b> control circuits, and a linear charge-coupled device readout system have been incorporated into the optical oscilloscope.

40|$|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is {{developing}} a direct-detection free-space laser communications transceiver test bed. The laser transmitter is a master-oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) configuration using a 1060 nm wavelength laser-diode with a two-stage multi-watt Ytterbium fiber amplifier. Dual Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulators provide an extinction ratio greater than 40 dB. The MOPA design delivered 10 -W average power with low-duty-cycle PPM waveforms and achieved 1. 7 kW peak power. We use pulse-position modulation format with a pseudo-noise code header to assist clock recovery and frame boundary identification.

40|$|A set of 35 {{photomultiplier}} tubes (ETL D 730 / 9829 Q), {{intended for use}} in the ZEPLIN III Dark Matter detector, was tested from room temperature down to - 100 °C, with the aim of confirming their suitability for detecting xenon scintillation light at 175 nm while immersed in the cryogenic liquid. A general improvement of both gain and quantum efficiency at the xenon scintillation wavelength was observed with cooling, the best combined effect being 40 %, while little change was noted in the timing properties and dark current. Saturation of response due to accumulation of charge in the resistive bialkali photocathodes was seen at an average photocurrent of 108 photoelectrons/s for the device with best quantum efficiency, whereas an order of magnitude higher current was required to saturate the least sensitive one. Variations in <b>photocathode</b> thickness from <b>tube</b> to tube could account for this behaviour, as well as the fact that the quantum efficiency improves the most for devices with poorest efficiency at room temperature.

40|$|The central {{institute}} of electronics (ZEA- 2) in the Forschungszentrum Juelich (FZJ) {{has developed a}} system to scan {{the response of the}} <b>photocathode</b> of photomultiplier <b>tubes</b> (PMT). The PMT sits tight on a supporting structure, while a blue light emitting diode is moved along its surface by two stepper motors, spanning both the x and y coordinates. All the system is located in a light-tight box made by wood. A graphical software was developed in-situ to perform the scan operations under different configurations (e. g., the step size of the scan and the number of measurements per point). During each point measurement the current output generated in the vacuum photomultiplier is processed in sequence by a pre-amplifier (mainly to convert the current signal into a voltage signal), an amplifier, and by an ADC module (typically a CAEN N 957). The information of the measurement is saved in files {{at the end of the}} scan. Recently, software based on the CERN ROOT and on the Qt libraries was developed to help the user analyzing deeper the data obtained by the scan. The new software, cross-platform due to its build performed inside the Qt-IDE, is described in this note. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} in high-voltage switching developed {{in this project}} allow a camera user to rapidly vary the number of output frames from 1 to 25. A high-voltage, variable-amplitude pulse train shifts the deflection location to the new frame location during the interlude between frames, making multiple frame counts and locations possible. The final deflection circuit deflects to five different frame positions per axis, including the center position, making {{for a total of}} 25 frames. To create the preset voltages, electronically adjustable {+-} 500 V power supplies were chosen. Digital-to-analog converters provide digital control of the supplies. The power supplies are clamped to {+-} 400 V so as not to exceed the voltage ratings of the transistors. A field-programmable gated array (FPGA) receives the trigger signal and calculates the combination of plate voltages for each frame. The interframe time and number of frames are specified by the user, but are limited by the camera electronics. The variable-frame circuit shifts the plate voltages of the first frame to those of the second frame during the user-specified interframe time. Designed around an electrostatic image tube, a framing camera images the light present during each frame (at the <b>photocathode)</b> onto the <b>tube’s</b> phosphor. The phosphor persistence allows the camera to display multiple frames on the phosphor at one time. During this persistence, a CCD camera is triggered and the analog image is collected digitally. The tube functions by converting photons to electrons at the negatively charged photocathode. The electrons move quickly toward the more positive charge of the phosphor. Two sets of deflection plates skew the electron’s path in horizontal and vertical (x axis and y axis, respectively) directions. Hence, each frame’s electrons bombard the phosphor surface at a controlled location defined by the voltages on the deflection plates. To prevent the phosphor from being exposed between frames, the image tube is gated off between exposures...|$|R
40|$|Streak cameras {{applied to}} {{inertial}} confinement fusion research and flashless imaging lidar require large working areas. However, {{the larger the}} working area, the bigger the temporal distortion is. And the temporal distortion has a great influence on the detecting precision of the streak camera, resulting in an image distortion on the screen. Yet previous streak camera design work emphasized shorter time resolution and higher special resolution with paying less attention to the temporal distortion extent. Key factors that may affect the temporal distortion are thoroughly analyzed in this paper. We calculate the electric field of a small-size streak tube {{with the aid of}} the Computer Simulation Technology Particle Studio software which is a three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation software based on finite integration technology. Axial electric field distributions at different distances to the axis of the small-size streak tube are displayed. The electron trajectories launched from different points on photocathode of the streak tube are tracked through interpolating pre-calculated electromagnetic field to the particle position. It is known that curved photocathode can reduce the temporal distortion, so we calculate the temporal distortions of streak tubes whose radii of curvature of the photocathode are 30 mm, 35 mm, 40 mm, 45 mm, 50 mm, and 55 mm respectively to ascertain how the curvature influences the temporal distortion. The results show that the temporal distortion is mainly produced in the photocathode-to-deflector region, and it is negligible in the equipotential region. Also, bigger radius of curvature of the photocathode leads to a positive temporal distortion, and smaller one leads to a negative temporal distortion. And the absolute value of the temporal distortion increases with the increase of the slit length. The small-size streak tube whose radius of curvature of the photocathode is 40 mm owns the smallest temporal distortion. We also calculate the temporal distortions of electrons launched from the different positions of the photocathode with different initial energies, and the initial energy has little influence on the temporal distortion. To sum up, the dominating factor that produces the temporal distortion is the curvature of the photocathode. The slit image under a ramp sweeping voltage on screen is curved due to the temporal distortion. And the bigger the temporal distortion, the greater the curvature of the slit image is. Besides, a linear relation between the temporal distortion and deflection of the slit image is displayed. The spatial resolutions of the streak tubes with the radii of curvature of the photocathode 30 mm, 40 mm, 50 mm are calculated respectively. And the small-size streak tube whose radius of curvature of the photocathode is 30 mm has the highest spatial resolution. The radius of curvature of the streak <b>tube</b> <b>photocathode</b> should be carefully selected according to actual requirements for the streak camera. Through the analysis we provide a significant guidance for streak tube design. </p...|$|R
