Mappæ Clavicula has a {{distinctly}} alchemical character and only briefly touches upon craft applications, as highlighted by both its enigmatic prologue and the sequence of its texts. In fact Mappæ Clavicula was originally a coherent work, its subjects arranged in reasoned order: according to its critical edition ([38], p. 41), the text units of Mappæ are organised, with some exception, in order of metal from precious to cheap. The <b>progressive</b> <b>number</b> of the text units (in brackets) are the following: gold (Nos. 1 – 70); silver (Nos. 71 – 113), copper (Nos. 114 – 136); iron (Nos. 142 – 146); lead (Nos. 147 – 151), tin (Nos. 153 – 155); and glass (Nos. 158 – 172).

40|$|Presenting {{consistent}} {{objects in}} scenes facilitates object recognition {{as compared to}} inconsistent objects. Yet the mechanisms by which scenes influence object recognition are still not understood. According to one theory, consistent scenes facilitate visual search for objects at expected places. Here, we investigated two predictions following from this theory: If visual search is responsible for consistency effects, consistency effects could be weaker (1) with better-primed than less-primed object locations, and (2) with less-primed than better-primed scenes. In Experiments 1 and 2, locations of objects were varied within a scene to a different degree (one, two, or four possible locations). In addition, object-scene consistency was studied {{as a function of}} <b>progressive</b> <b>numbers</b> of repetitions of the backgrounds. Because repeating locations and backgrounds could facilitate visual search for objects, these repetitions might alter the object-scene consistency effect by lowering of location uncertainty. Although we find evidence for a significant consistency effect, we find no clear support for impacts of scene priming or location priming {{on the size of the}} consistency effect. Additionally, we find evidence that the consistency effect is dependent on the eccentricity of the target objects. These results point to only small influences of priming to object-scene consistency effects but all-in-all the findings can be reconciled with a visual-search explanation of the consistency effect...|$|R

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility, morbidity, and reproductive performance of fertile women undergoing minilaparotomic myomectomy for large uterine myomas. Methods. Ninety-nine consecutive women with symptomatic myomas underwent myomectomy through a skin incision ≤ 8 cm. Operative, postoperative and reproductive data were prospectively collected. Results. Median (range) age and Body Mass Index (BMI) were 37 years (23 - 44) and 23 (18 - 43), respectively. Median (range) myoma diameter was 7 cm (4 - 20), and the median number of myomas removed was 1 (range 1 - 31). Myomas were intramural in 76 (76 %) cases. Median incision length was 7 cm (range 4 - 13) and median duration of surgery was 70 min (range 40 - 180). Operative time and length of skin incision were not correlated with the <b>progressive</b> <b>number</b> of interventions.

The use of power ultrasound in food industry has increased {{during the last few}} years. A <b>progressive</b> <b>number</b> of studies have been carried out in that direction. Ultrasonic energy represents a promising tool to produce or to enhance a series of food processes without affecting the quality of the foodstuff.

This work deals with two different kind of mass transfer processes assisted by power ultrasound: water transfer in vegetable dehydration and supercritical CO 2 transfer in almond-oil extraction. Ultrasonic energy was applied in direct contact with the substance to be transferred. Although clear differences were observed among the two treatments the effect of the ultrasonic energy was evident in all cases. The parametric study of the water transfer process here presented illuminates about the mechanisms involved. This work was supported by the Research Project AGL 2001 - 2774 -CO 5 - 02.

40|$|Figure 1. RANSAC can be {{significantly}} sped up if modified {{to take advantage}} of additional grouping information between features, e. g., as provided by optical flow based clustering. Left: one of the two images for which we seek epipolar geometry, with inlier and outlier correspondences overlaid in blue and red respectively. Middle and Right: Two largest groups of tentative correspondences after clustering based on feature locations and optical flows. Notice their inlier ratios are much higher than the average ratio in the entire image. We present a novel variant of the RANSAC algorithm that is much more efficient, in particular when dealing with problems with low inlier ratios. Our algorithm assumes that there exists some grouping in the data, based on which we introduce a new binomial mixture model rather than the simple binomial model as used in RANSAC. We prove that in the new model it is more efficient to sample data from a smaller numbers of groups and groups with more tentative correspondences, which leads to a new sampling procedure that uses <b>progressive</b> <b>numbers</b> of groups. We demonstrate our algorithm on two classical geometric vision problems: wide-baseline matching and camera resectioning. The experiments show that the algorithm serves as a general framework that works well with three possible grouping strategies investigated in this paper, including a novel optical flow based clustering approach. The results show that our algorithm is able to achieve a significant performance gain compared to the standard RANSAC and PROSAC. 1...|$|R

The role of the commission was to decide if a rifled firearm should be classified either a war firearm (arma da guerra) or a common firearm (arma comune da sparo).

40|$|Events can {{sometimes}} appear longer or shorter in duration than other events of equal length. For example, in a repeated presentation of auditory or visual stimuli, an unexpected object of equivalent duration appears to last longer. Illusions of duration distortion beg {{an important question}} of time representation: when durations dilate or contract, does time in general slow down or speed up during that moment? In other words, what entailments do duration distortions have with respect to other timing judgments? We here show that when a sound or visual flicker is presented in conjunction with an unexpected visual stimulus, neither the pitch of the sound nor {{the frequency of the}} flicker is affected by the apparent duration dilation. This demonstrates that subjective time in general is not slowed; instead, duration judgments can be manipulated with no concurrent impact on other temporal judgments. Like spatial vision, time perception appears to be underpinned by a collaboration of separate neural mechanisms that usually work in concert but are separable. We further show that the duration dilation of an unexpected stimulus is not enhanced by increasing its saliency, suggesting that the effect is more closely related to prediction violation than enhanced attention. Finally, duration distortions induced by violations of <b>progressive</b> <b>number</b> sequences implicate the involvement of high-level predictability, suggesting the involvement of areas higher than primary visual cortex. We suggest that duration distortions can be understood in terms of repetition suppression, in which neural responses to repeated stimuli are diminished...|$|E
40|$|History and Objectives: Kawasaki {{disease is}} the most common {{vasculitis}} in childhood and its most serious manifestation is cardiac. Considering the <b>progressive</b> <b>number</b> of patients with Kawasaki disease and in order to define the characteristics of 21 patients with Kawasaki, this study was performed on the referrers to the pediatric ward of Shaheed Beheshti hospital of Kashan during the years 1375 to 1377. Material and Methods: This study was performed by descriptive method on the hospitalized patients and the diagnosis was established in the presence of 5 criteria from the 6 clinical criteria. Age, sex, clinical and paraclinical changes of the patients and the seasonal prevalence of the disease were evaluated and recorded. Results: From the 21 patients, 7 cases were female and 14 were male, aged 38. 9 Â± 24 months and male to female ratio was 2 to 1. Clinical manifestations such as fever and oral mucosal changes were present in 100, conjunctivitis in 95, rashes in 91, changes in hands and feet in 71, lymphadenopathy in 67 and diarrhea in 43 of cases. Laboratory findings such as abnormal ESR in 91, leukocytosis in 81, thrombocytosis in 71, pyuria in 43 and increased SGPT in 14 of the studied patients. One third of patients were affected in the winter. Conclusion: The disease is present in our country and diagnostic work up is especially suggested in cases with prolonged fever unresponsive to antibiotics or children with sterile pyuria or unexplained increase in liver enzymes, since the findings of Kawasaki disease particularly its clinical manifestations are in common with many other diseases...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{widespread}} distribution of pyrethroid resistance among malaria vectors, we did a release-recapture trial in experimental huts to investigate the insecticidal and sterilizing effects of a novel long-lasting net (LN), Olyset (R) Duo, incorporating a mixture of permethrin (PER) and the insect growth regulator (IGR), pyriproxyfen (PPF). An LN containing PPF alone and a classic Olyset (R) Net were tested in parallel as positive controls. The effect of <b>progressive</b> <b>number</b> of holes (6, 30, or 150) that may accrue in nets over time was simulated. We used two laboratory Anopheles gambiae s. s. strains: the susceptible Kisumu strain and the pyrethroid-resistant VK-Per strain having solely kdr as resistance mechanism. The effect of these nets on the reproductive success of blood-fed females that survived the different LNs conditions was recorded. Regardless of the mosquito strain, the LNs containing PPF alone with as many as 30 holes drastically reduced the number of eggs laid by females succeeding in feeding, i. e. fecundity by 98 % and egg hatching rate (fertility) by 93 % relative to untreated control net. Very few of the resistant females blood fed and survived under the Olyset (R) Duo with similar number of holes (up to 30) but of these few, the inhibition of reproductive success was 100 %. There was no evidence that the Olyset (R) Duo LN with 150 holes impacted fecundity or fertility of the resistant colony. The efficacy of Olyset (R) Duo is encouraging and clearly illustrates that this new net might be a promising tool for malaria transmission control and resistance management...|$|E
