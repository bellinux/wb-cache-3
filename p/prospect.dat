30|$|Considering that {{different}} geophysical <b>prospecting</b> approaches {{have their own}} characteristics on detection accuracy and scope and integrating with the geological condition of research area, the time-lapse geophysical monitoring of this project has chosen three geophysical <b>prospecting</b> methods, i.e. 3 D seismic <b>prospecting,</b> electrical <b>prospecting</b> and ground penetrating radar <b>prospecting,</b> among which 3 D seismic <b>prospecting</b> mainly aims at studying the structural changes of coal measure data (Peng et al. 2013), electrical <b>prospecting</b> aims at studying water bearing changes of strata (Han 2009) and ground penetrating radar aims at studying water bearing changes of shallow surface strata. It is helpful to improve the detection accuracy of geological results by organically integrating 3 D seismic <b>prospecting,</b> electrical <b>prospecting</b> and ground penetrating radar <b>prospecting</b> and fully taking advantage of strengths of each <b>prospecting</b> approach.|$|R

5|$|At Carroll Street, {{the express}} tracks ramp up {{to rejoin the}} local tracks, and all four tracks rise onto the Culver Viaduct, curving onto Ninth Street. East of Fourth Avenue station towards Park Slope, the tracks become a subway once again. Past 7th Avenue, the local tracks diverge, curving south to 15th Street and <b>Prospect</b> Park West, while the express tracks take a direct route beneath <b>Prospect</b> Park. This {{is one of two}} places in the subway where the express tracks diverge from the local tracks, the other being on the IND Queens Boulevard Line between 65th Street and 36th Street. The express tracks rejoin the {{right-of-way}} at approximately Terrace Place and <b>Prospect</b> Avenue, running on a lower level under <b>Prospect</b> Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway near the <b>Prospect</b> Park Parade Grounds, then rise up as the line curves onto McDonald Avenue. The line then parallels the route of the original Culver Line surface railroad into Church Avenue station, the last stop of the original IND service.|$|E

5|$|The {{section of}} {{legislative}} Route25 from <b>Prospect</b> to Remsen was finally assigned a posted designation in April1935 {{when it became}} part of NY28B, an alternate route of NY28 that extended west along NY287 to Barneveld.

40|$|Identifying {{mechanisms}} to finance environmental conservation {{is crucial to}} achieve sustainable development. Pharmaceutical <b>prospecting</b> has been touted as a mechanism with <b>prospects</b> to generate revenue to conserve biodiversity. Pharmaceutical <b>prospecting</b> could improve {{with the use of}} prior information to guide pharmaceutical <b>prospecting</b> research. Such prior information could be traditional knowledge on use of biodiversity for medicinal purposes. Sri Lanka is richly bestowed with both biodiversity and traditional knowledge of the use of it for medicinal purposes. This paper, through review of the literature and empirical estimation of the willingness to pay for pharmaceutical <b>prospecting,</b> has estimated the complementary value of biodiversity and traditional knowledge of its use, in Sri Lanka. The Knuckles forest has been used as the demonstrative case for analysis. It is found that pharmaceutical <b>prospecting</b> has reasonable potential to generate revenue to conserve biodiversity in Sri Lanka. Thus, it is recommended that legislations, institutions and mechanisms, which are required to establish property rights on biodiversity and traditional knowledge, be expeditiously established to facilitate pharmaceutical <b>prospecting.</b> Given the social and political sensitivity of pharmaceutical <b>prospecting,</b> broad public consultation should be sought, prior to implementation of pharmaceutical <b>prospecting...</b>|$|R

For mixed <b>prospects,</b> subjects become more loss averse and more gain seeking under time pressure, depending on the framing of the <b>prospects.</b> The results suggest the importance of aspiration levels under time pressure. We discuss the implications of our findings for decision making situations that involve time pressure. ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding why {{individuals}} delay dispersal {{and become}} subordinates within a group {{is central to}} studying the evolution of sociality. Hypotheses predict that dispersal decisions are influenced by costs of extra-territorial <b>prospecting</b> that are often required to find a breeding vacancy. Little is known about such costs, partly because it is complicated to demonstrate them empirically. For example, <b>prospecting</b> individuals may be of inferior quality already before <b>prospecting</b> and/or have been evicted. Moreover, costs of <b>prospecting</b> are mainly studied in species where prospectors suffer from predation risk, so how costly <b>prospecting</b> is when predators are absent remains unclear. Here, we determine a cost of <b>prospecting</b> for subordinate Seychelles warblers, Acrocephalus sechellensis, in a population where predators are absent and individuals return to their resident territory after <b>prospecting.</b> <b>Prospecting</b> individuals had 5. 2 % lower body mass than non-prospecting individuals. Our evidence suggests this may be owing to frequent attacks by resident conspecifics, likely leading to reduced food intake by prospectors. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} energetic costs associated with dispersal opportunities are one factor influencing dispersal decisions and shaping the evolution of delayed dispersal in social animals...|$|R
