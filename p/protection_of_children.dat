5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the first}} federal law to ban the for-profit {{production}} and distribution of child pornography was the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977. In response to New York v. Ferber, , a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing the prohibition of child pornography {{even if it did}} not meet the obscenity standard established in Miller v. California, Congress passed the Child Protection Act of 1984, broadening the definition of child pornography and criminalizing nonprofit child pornography trafficking.
