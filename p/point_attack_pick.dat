40|$|ABSTRACT: Mechanical {{excavators}} such as shearers, road-headers, {{and continuous}} miners that utilise conical picks {{are increasingly being}} used in civil construction and mining. Their application has broadened to include stronger and more abrasive rock types that result in higher wear rates and considerably shorter life span. This results in a bottleneck resulting in lower utilization and lower productivity. An understanding {{of the factors that}} cause high wear rates is crucial in the selection and design of an excavator, selection of cutter tools, and definition of optimum cutting geometry. All these parameters can contribute to major cost savings for companies using mechanical excavators. This paper explores how tool wear affects the cutting performance of a <b>point</b> <b>attack</b> <b>pick</b> with changes in the depth of cut. Linear rock cutting tests were performed using samples of Gosford Sandstone and Gambier Limestone at a constant speed of 0. 06 m/s and pick attack angle of 55 °. The rock samples were cut at depths ranging between 5 mm and 20 mm using a standard conical pick having tip angles of 70 °, 90 ° 100 ° and 110 °. The cutting forces and normal forces, specific energy, and yield were correlated against depth of cut. The results reveal that for each rock type, the specific energy increases at a decreasing rate with pick wear, confirming cutting efficiency decreases with increasing pick wear whereby a slight increase in pick wear resulted in a significant reduction in cutting efficiency.

There was a near two to threefold decrease in efficiency between a sharp pick and worn out pick. The cutting and normal forces were also found to increase at a decreasing rate with pick wear...|$|E

The British forces in southern Africa were still composed mostly of infantry, while most of the Boers were skilled horsemen, who used their superior mobility to good advantage. Realising that continuing to engage the British in set-piece battles where British troops could utilize their superior numbers would result in a quick defeat, the Boers adopted tactics of hit-and-run guerilla <b>attacks,</b> <b>picking</b> off men, and disrupting supply lines.|$|R

The bosses can only be sat on if all normal enemies have been defeated, and unless the boss' energy level is low enough, he'll throw the player off.|$|R
50|$|Using {{a whistle}} {{to signal the}} attack, Cole led a bayonet charge that {{overwhelmed}} the defenders in savage close combat, for which Cole was later awarded the Medal of Honor.

The <b>attack</b> <b>picked</b> up impetus as the other paratroopers observed it in progress and joined it, crossing a ditch. Overrunning the empty farmhouse, men of Company H found many German fallschirmjäger dug in along the hedgerow behind it. Companies H and G killed them with hand grenades and bayonets but at severe cost to themselves.|$|R

50|$|Plan of <b>Attack</b> <b>picks</b> {{up where}} Woodward's {{previous}} work, Bush at War left off, {{focusing on the}} decision-making {{that led up to}} the U.S.-led war in Iraq. As a result of the broad access Woodward was granted to the White House and to interview Bush administration officials, the book is able to paint a realistic picture of what happened behind the scenes. Woodward's own approach is to resist making judgements about the war itself, but rather try to describe the decision-making process. As a result of refraining to interpret the story that he presents, Woodward has been described as being both opposed to the Bush administration by some, as well as an apologist of the administration by others.|$|R

50|$|After the attack, W-8 {{participated in}} a number of uneventful convoys and {{minesweeping}} activities, mainly around Truk, until 16 January 1943. On 16 January, the Japanese tanker Toei Maru was struck by a submarine, and began to sink. It is unclear whether W-8 was still escorting Toei Maru or not at the <b>point</b> of the <b>attack,</b> although it is assumed that the escort was heading back to Truk. Three days later, on 19 January, W-8 returned to the sight of the <b>attack</b> and <b>picked</b> up any survivors. After another three months, W-8 headed towards the Marshall Islands, but returned to Truk on 27 April. On 6 August, W-8 was dry-docked for repairs. It was undocked on 23 September.|$|R

At 0620, Selfridge opened fire on a small gasoline carrier entering Tulagi harbor. A few hours later, the transports moved in toward the beaches. At 1320, the Japanese sent in a high level bombing attack. Shortly thereafter, they followed that strike with a dive bomber attack. On the 8th, Selfridge continued to screen the transports and, after a noon bombing <b>attack,</b> <b>picked</b> up two Japanese airmen. On {{the morning of the}} 9th, she assisted survivors of the Battle of Savo Island and, with Ellet, scuttled the badly-damaged Australian cruiser, Canberra; then, toward evening, departed the area to escort the transports to Noumea.|$|R
50|$|New Mexico {{took over}} at its 28-yard line with 9:13 {{remaining}} in the second quarter. A steady Lobo rushing <b>attack</b> <b>picked</b> up yards and first downs on the ground, and New Mexico moved the ball downfield with success. After crossing into Nevada territory, however, the Lobos began to run into difficulty. Inside the Pack 40-yard line, Nevada forced a stop after Porterie was sacked for an 6-yard loss. All-American kicker John Sullivan came into the game to attempt a career-long 53-yard field goal for New Mexico. Sullivan, who had played the entire season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left (plant) leg, completed the kick, thus giving the Lobos a 17-0 lead with 5:55 {{remaining in the}} first half.|$|R

5000|$|As {{the main}} <b>point</b> of <b>attack,</b> Vauban chose the Front {{of the plain}} (New Gate front). Furthermore, an {{additional}} <b>point</b> of <b>attack</b> and several feint attacks were planned. From early May, the actual siege trenches were dug. With the help of sap trenches, Vauban approached the fortress in two locations. The closest Front was still half a gunshot away from the covered passages of the city. Both <b>points</b> of <b>attack</b> were linked through a connecting trench. The French set up four batteries for the siege artillery, which were aimed at the main <b>point</b> of <b>attack.</b> Along with normal guns, mortars were used. In the night of 8 May, the cannons started firing on the city. The defenders reacted on 9 May with several sorties and destroyed several offensive buildings, but could not stop the construction work. On 11 May the besiegers were within 30 steps of the closest covered passage of the fortress. Three parallels connected the trenches. Additional gun batteries were brought in. At other locations, the trenches were also nearing the city.|$|R
