40|$|Introduction Videos {{promoting}} {{electronic cigarettes}} (e-cigarettes) {{can be easily}} accessed on YouTube. Marketing claims present in YouTube videos may help shape the public’s opinion of e-cigarettes. Thus, {{it is important to}} understand the most frequent marketing claims and video sources. Methods The objectives of this study were to 1) identify marketing claims in YouTube videos that are commonly made on e-cigarette retail websites and 2) compare the frequency of marketing claims in user-generated and <b>professional</b> YouTube <b>videos.</b> Through content analysis, this study evaluated six marketing claims and descriptive information about YouTube videos (n = 50) related to “electronic cigarettes” and “vape”. Results Overall, the most frequent marketing claim promoted e-cigarette use as better than traditional tobacco use (52 %). Approximately 65 % of videos appeared to be user-generated and 35 % were professionally-produced. Compared to user-generated <b>videos,</b> significantly more <b>professional</b> <b>videos</b> made claims that e-cigarettes are cleaner (p < 0. 001) and cheaper (p = 0. 04) than traditional cigarettes. Additionally, more <b>professional</b> <b>videos</b> had claims promoting e-cigarettes as better than traditional cigarettes because of their convenience—the user can smoke anywhere (p < 0. 0001) and the products do not produce secondhand smoke (p < 0. 001). The most frequent claim in user-generated videos was related to recreation (53 %). Conclusions Videos on YouTube promote e-cigarettes as safer than other tobacco products. Videos appearing to be user-generated contained different marketing claims compared to <b>professional</b> <b>videos.</b> Further research is necessary to assess how the perceived source of the video impacts the ways these marketing claims shape public perception and influence use...|$|R

25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called robust {{with respect to}} transformations if the embedded information may be detected reliably from the marked signal, even if degraded by any number of transformations. Typical image degradations are JPEG compression, rotation, cropping, additive noise, and quantization. For video content, temporal modifications and MPEG compression often are added to this list. A {{digital watermark}} is called imperceptible if the watermarked content is perceptually equivalent to the original, unwatermarked content. In general, {{it is easy to}} create either robust watermarks—or—imperceptible watermarks, but the creation of both robust—and—imperceptible watermarks has proven to be quite challenging. Robust imperceptible watermarks have been proposed as a tool for the protection of digital content, for example as an embedded no-copy-allowed flag in <b>professional</b> <b>video</b> content.|$|E

25|$|The human {{interface}} guidelines published by Apple for macOS {{are followed by}} many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts. In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, {{making it easy to}} output PDF to multiple devices. As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.

500|$|The {{founder of}} OverClocked ReMix and {{its parent company}} OverClocked ReMix, LLC is David W.

Lloyd originally curated all of the submissions to the site, but since 2002 submissions are judged by a panel of community members for quality and originality.

2500|$|For these concerts, {{the band}} delved {{back into their}} distant past, abandoning {{virtually}} all of their available back catalogue in favour of exclusively playing songs that had been performed prior to 1983. These were taken mostly from the cassette albums (The Obvious Identity and Toy World, but also included songs such as An Ant, Hopeless, Gloomy News and Hello Mr Minnow (which had never been officially recorded before and had only ever been played at concerts in the late '70s/early '80s). A two-volume CD set of recordings from the three shows – The Special Garage Concerts Vol I and The Special Garage Concerts Vol II – was eventually released in 2005. <b>Professional</b> <b>video</b> camera equipment was apparently seen being used to record the band during the concerts, leading to a rumour that members of Org Records had filmed the entire three nights for later video release.

(However, a session {{referred to as the}} [...] "Garage Rehearsals", was filmed: a mix of live studio playing and humorously surreal scenes between the band members.

2500|$|Revelers {{and vendors}} who usually {{frequent}} Mardi Gras on Galveston Island have {{concerns that the}} admission fee will bring fewer attendees along with financial uncertainty when the Park Board sold admission tickets prior to the 2008 season. The March 5, 2011 Knights of Momus Parade attracted 20,000 revelers within the Strand while the crowd estimate during the entire Mardi Gras season is 250,000. Vendors and Downtown Galveston businesses have reported a drop in their sales despite the promoter bringing more live music, parades, and added security which includes metal detectors and bag checks. As a downside, Yaga's Entertainment Inc. incorporated {{the rules and regulations}} modeled on Mardi Gras DFW – including a prohibition on <b>professional</b> <b>video</b> and still camera equipment within the Strand Entertainment District because of the production of live entertainment from national touring or band acts. Ticket sales for the first weekend of the 2012 season dropped to 30% during the first weekend despite the numerous complaints [...] vented at Yaga's Entertainment, Inc. - Dean stated that the admission charge will remain indefinitely until the existing 5-year contract with the City of Galveston is up for renewal. Admission pricing at the entry gates averaged $17 where discounted $8 tickets were available from the Yaga's Entertainment Inc. website (www.YagasPresents.com). Decreased ticket revenue was also attributed to the cold temperatures and high winds on the first weekend, and heavy precipitation on the second weekend - changes for the 2013 season would include contingency planning where events can be rescheduled by time shifts.|$|E
