5|$|The game {{offers a}} large range of enemies and {{different}} stages. It also features online multiplayer modes, such as Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and Siege (in which the player storms the opponent's base {{and tries to}} destroy the <b>power</b> <b>core</b> inside). It supports up to eight players {{at a time and}} supports voice chat through a PS2-compatible headset. Internet connection is needed if playing online against other players.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Soundwave assembles a newer, more {{powerful}} chassis for Megatron, {{using it to}} resurrect him. Megatron then challenges Starscream and his loyalists for leadership of the Decepticons, kills his soldiers, defeats him and frees the Combaticons. He then leads a full-scale assault on the Autobot stronghold {{in the ruins of}} Iacon, where the massive Decepticon Trypticon's remains are kept. Megatron and his soldiers invade the facility and he takes Trypticon's <b>power</b> <b>core,</b> the heart of a transformer. He informs Trypticon that he is not being rescued as he , but he congratulates him for destroying Iacon City and thousands more Autobots. Trypticon is then transformed into the Nemesis, the Decepticon flagship.|$|E
5|$|As Voyager {{installs}} the Isodesium, a ship is {{sent from}} the Forge to tear Voyager apart for resources. Tuvok leads the Hazard Team {{to a nearby}} derelict dreadnought gunship to use the gunship's weaponry to destroy the incoming ship, but is only successful in disabling it as it attaches to Voyager. Voyager is consequently swarmed by crab-like aliens intent on carrying off crew and cargo, although the crew manages to eliminate these aliens. Munro prompts the captain to counterattack, in order to destroy the dampening field projected by the station. The Hazard Team uses the Forge's ship to infiltrate the Forge and disable its defensive systems, allowing the Voyager crew to attack using shuttlecraft; however, Crewman Biessman is killed while waiting for Voyagers reinforcements. The Forge's <b>power</b> <b>core</b> is destroyed, thereby dropping the dampening field. Munro, however, learns of the species behind the Forge, the Vohrsoth, and the station's true purpose: to harvest the genetic features of those trapped by the Forge to create an army designed for conquering the galaxy. Munro disobeys orders to ensure the Vohrsoth cannot recreate the Forge and kills the Vohrsoth commander. With power restored, Voyager attacks the Forge and destroys the station, beaming Munro off {{in the last few}} moments. Voyager and other active ships in the area are freed, and Munro is promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
50|$|The game {{takes place}} in three planets of a Theric system where {{machines}} {{have gone out of}} control. They drove out the human population and took over the planets. The humans have finally regained the strength to recover their planets. In single player, the mission is to destroy the enemy, and, more importantly, recover the stolen <b>power</b> <b>cores.</b> In multiplayer mode, all the <b>power</b> <b>cores</b> in one of the other planets have been recovered. The team of bounty hunters that recovered them are now fighting among themselves for the loot and the credit.|$|R

After the device is disabled, he is sent back to Ysmault. The heroes arrive, fight the Red Lantern Corps, and distract Atrocitus long enough for Green Lantern to sneak away a few Red Lantern <b>power</b> <b>cores.</b> Angrier than usual, he joins with Sinestro and Larfleeze to get their <b>power</b> <b>cores</b> back in the final level, only to Superman focus his and the other Lanterns' energies in a duplicated crystal to shrink Earth back to its normal size, causing him to be teleported back to Ysmault again.|$|R
25|$|In season 4, {{a devastating}} Espheni counterattack relegates {{humanity}} to Espheni-controlled ghettos across the planet. Meanwhile, Tom's half-Espheni daughter Alexis {{continues to grow}} and develop psychic powers due to her heritage. After the 2nd Mass eventually escape the ghettos, another attack severely depletes their numbers. Learning of a <b>power</b> <b>core</b> on the Moon that controls all Espheni technology, Tom and Alexis launch {{an attack on the}} <b>power</b> <b>core</b> using a captured Espheni aircraft. Alexis sacrifices herself to destroy the <b>power</b> <b>core</b> and Tom is left lost in space, but the Espheni war machine is left crippled with the loss of their air support and mechanized servants.|$|E
25|$|Parker and Ned study {{a weapon}} {{left behind by}} Brice, {{removing}} its <b>power</b> <b>core.</b> When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but is trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the <b>power</b> <b>core</b> is an unstable Chitauri grenade, Parker races to the Washington Monument where the core explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator. Evading local authorities, Parker saves his friends, including his fellow classmate and crush Liz. Returning to New York City, Parker persuades Davis to reveal Toomes' whereabouts. Aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan, but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and confiscating his suit.|$|E
25|$|Under Parker and Cartwright's leadership, {{a massive}} British-American force enters London and storms the central tower. Despite their best efforts, the Chimera rally {{themselves}} and initiate a counterattack, killing countless soldiers and leaving Cartwright mortally wounded. Against all odds, Hale destroys the tower's <b>power</b> <b>core,</b> {{causing it to}} ignite in a massive explosion. This triggers a chain reaction, destroying the other towers and leading to a mass extinction of the Chimera in the UK, ending their threat.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the manufacturing aspects for Insulated-Metal-Substrates (IMSs) {{with respect to}} high thermal conductive prepregs used and the Cu/prepreg/Cu stacks selected for each power application in the project. The IMS heat spreaders serve as high-current PCBs and heat dissipation routes for double side cooling of the Embedded <b>power</b> <b>cores.</b> The interconnection of the embedded <b>power</b> <b>cores</b> to the IMS high-current PCBs/heat spreaders is realised by silver sintering at the copper pads metallised by Ni/Au. The sintering technology is being developed and has yielded sinter deposits of 35 - 52 Î²m with single or double printing.

500|$|The game {{begins on}} the desert world of Far Eden {{as one of the}} colonists Joule Adams (Erika Soto) and her corebot Mack (Jonathan Lipow) are walking past the {{wreckage}} of her cryo-sleep maintenance habitat, or [...] "crawler", from which she previously woke. They venture out to obtain a <b>power</b> <b>core</b> to get the crawler back online. Eventually finding it inside a corebot, Joule pries it out with her extractor tool. Joule and Mack then return to the crawler, switching its power back on. Joule sets out to reactivate a terraforming pylon that she learns has been offline for ninety-six years. After Joule manages to reboot the pylon, she receives a distress signal from a beacon that had until then been obstructed. Once she obtains a prismatic core in order to progress towards the signal, enemy corebots appear. On the order of Victor (Alex Fernandez), the leader of the corebots, they demand that she hand over the core. When she refuses, they become agitated. She defeats the enemies and proceeds to her destination. There, she encounters amputee Kai Brehn (Harry Shum) and his corebot Seth. Kai requests aid for his leg and Joule complies. She reveals the prismatic core, as it might assist him. Kai urges her to travel to the core foundry so that Joule may discover the answers to its potential. Seth accompanies her.|$|E
500|$|Riley, meanwhile, learns of Dr. Walsh's {{death and}} his comrades Forrest (Leonard Roberts) and Graham (Bailey Chase) suspect Buffy {{to be her}} murderer. Extremely {{agitated}} and showing signs of drug withdrawal, he follows Buffy and demands {{to know the truth}} in [...] "Goodbye Iowa". None of them are aware of Adam until he re-emerges in the underground laboratories of the Initiative, killing Dr. Walsh's assistant and another soldier. He tells Riley that he knows Dr. Walsh created them both, that she gave Riley chemicals to strengthen him, which makes them brothers. When Riley refuses to acknowledge their bond, Adam skewers Riley, and knocks Buffy across the room while Forrest and Graham are trying to enter the locked door. Adam leaves and the Initiative are tasked with hunting him down and killing him. When one of Sunnydale's residents, Jonathan Levinson (Danny Strong), casts a spell making him the center of everyone's attention in [...] "Superstar", Adam is the only character in town who realizes it is an illusion. He explains his insight by saying he is [...] "aware". His uniqueness has set him apart. Adam is interested in how the illusion will play out, however, and watches it unfold. During the illusion, Jonathan—temporarily a part of the Inititative—discovers Adam's only weakness: a uranium <b>power</b> <b>core</b> source which, effectively, will never allow him to die.|$|E
500|$|Culverhouse {{quickly became}} one of the most {{influential}} NFL owners; he served as a member of the Player Club Relations Committee that handled player grievances, and of the NFL Congressional Committee. He was a member of the Executive Committee that handled negotiations during the 1982 NFL strike, an experience that earned him great praise from NFL negotiator Jack Donlan. Donlan praised Culverhouse's logic, analytical, and problem-solving skills, and his effectiveness [...] "at getting his way". Culverhouse was credited with having a big hand in the owners' course of direction during the strike, and was responsible for recruiting Donlan as negotiator. He repeated the role during the 1987 players' strike, after which NFLPA President Gene Upshaw described him as [...] "formidable", and said that [...] "at times, the whole league seemed to flow from this one guy". He was chairman of the NFL Finance Committee and the Management Council Executive Committee. His efforts were instrumental in bringing Super Bowl XVIII to Tampa, despite a lack of adequate hotel space in the city. Culverhouse was also a pioneer in using computers to handle team finances and scouting reports. He was a member of the four-man committee that stripped ownership of the New England Patriots from the Sullivan family when their debt became too great. Patriots founder Billy Sullivan later accused Culverhouse of blocking his effort to propose a stock sale that would have eased the debt. Culverhouse distanced himself from the NFL <b>power</b> <b>core</b> in later years, stung by other owners' criticisms of the Management Council. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue credited Culverhouse for building much of the strength and unity of the modern NFL.|$|E
