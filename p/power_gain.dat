25|$|A power {{amplifier}} is an amplifier designed primarily {{to increase the}} power available to a load. In practice, amplifier <b>power</b> <b>gain</b> depends on the source and load impedances, {{as well as the}} inherent voltage and current gain. A radio frequency (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20dB might have a voltage gain of 20dB and an available <b>power</b> <b>gain</b> of much more than 20dB (power ratio of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower <b>power</b> <b>gain</b> if, for example, the input is from a 600Ω microphone and the output connects to a 47kΩ input socket for a {{power amplifier}}. In general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see power amplifier classes below.|$|E
25|$|Serial relay {{transmission}} {{is used for}} long distance communication and range-extension in shadowy regions. It provides <b>power</b> <b>gain.</b> In this topology signals propagate from one relay to another relay and the channels of neighboring hop are orthogonal to avoid any interference.|$|E
25|$|The gain of an {{amplifier}} is {{the ratio}} of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in decibels. (When measured in decibels it is logarithmically related to the power ratio: G(dB)=10 log(Pout /(Pin)). RF amplifiers are often specified {{in terms of the}} maximum <b>power</b> <b>gain</b> obtainable, while the voltage gain of audio amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers will be more often specified (since the amplifier's input impedance will often be much higher than the source impedance, and the load impedance higher than the amplifier's output impedance). For example, an audio amplifier with a gain given as 20dB will have a voltage gain of ten (but a <b>power</b> <b>gain</b> of 100 would only occur in the event the input and output impedances were identical).|$|E

30|$|In {{the problem}} of maximizing sum throughput, the {{fairness}} of relay SUs is not considered. In general, fairness could be {{defined in terms of}} different parameters of the system[21]. In this article, we focus on the fairness of power drain of relay SUs. When the differences of relay SUs’ channel <b>power</b> <b>gains</b> are large, it is possible that relay SUs with higher channel <b>power</b> <b>gains</b> will consume most of power. Relay SUs with lower channel <b>power</b> <b>gains</b> might not need to consume any power. This will result in a lower survival time of some relay SUs and the CR network. Moreover, by taking into consideration the limited transmit power of the CR network, we minimize the total transmit power of the CR network simultaneously.|$|R

25|$|Fundamentally, all {{electronic}} devices that provide <b>power</b> <b>gain</b> (e.g., vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors, MOS transistors) are nonlinear. Negative feedback trades gain for higher linearity (reducing distortion) and can provide other benefits. If not designed correctly, amplifiers with negative feedback can under some circumstances become unstable {{due to the}} feedback becoming positive, resulting in unwanted behavior such as oscillation. The Nyquist stability criterion developed by Harry Nyquist of Bell Laboratories is used to study the stability of feedback amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|Parallel relay {{transmission}} {{may be used}} where serial relay transmission {{suffers from}} multi-path fading. For outdoors and non-line-of-sight propagation, signal wavelength may be large and installation of multiple antennas are not possible. To increase the robustness against multi-path fading, parallel relay transmission can be used. In this topology, signals propagate through multiple relay paths in the same hop and the destination combines the signals received {{with the help of}} various combining schemes. It provides <b>power</b> <b>gain</b> and diversity gain simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Amplifiers are {{described}} {{according to the}} properties of their inputs, their outputs, and how they relate. All amplifiers have gain, a multiplication factor that relates the magnitude of some property of the output signal to a property of the input signal. The gain may be specified as the ratio of output voltage to input voltage (voltage gain), output power to input power (<b>power</b> <b>gain),</b> {{or some combination of}} current, voltage, and power. In many cases the property of the output that varies is dependent on the same property of the input, making the gain unitless (though often expressed in decibels (dB)).|$|E

2500|$|Level {{values in}} {{decibels}} {{can be added}} instead of multiplying the underlying power values, {{which means that the}} overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of amplifier stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, log(A×B×C) = log(A) + log(B) + log(C). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1dB is approximately 26% <b>power</b> <b>gain,</b> 3dB is approximately 2× <b>power</b> <b>gain,</b> and 10dB is 10× <b>power</b> <b>gain,</b> it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication.

This leads to characterise the eigenchannels of N × N MIMO channels with N larger than 14, showing that the smallest eigenchannel distributes as a Rayleigh channel, the next four eigenchannels closely distributes as Nakagami-m channels with m = 4, 9, 25 and 36, and the N – 5 remaining eigenchannels have statistics similar to an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel within 1dB signal-to-noise ratio. It is also shown that 75% of the total mean <b>power</b> <b>gain</b> of the MIMO SVD channel goes to the top third of all the eigenchannels.|$|E

2500|$|The power a Formula One engine {{produces}} {{is generated}} by operating {{at a very high}} rotational speed, up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure had stayed at around 14 bar MEP. Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves {{to the point where the}} loss nearly offset the <b>power</b> <b>gain</b> through the increase in rpm. [...] They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. [...] Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used pneumatic valve springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000rpm.|$|E
