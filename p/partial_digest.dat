The enzyme caused a rapid fall in viscosity of proteoglycan aggregate solution (6 mg/ml), and {{the products of}} a <b>partial</b> <b>digest</b> (60 % loss of relative viscosity) and a complete digest (95 % loss of relative viscosity) were characterized. Analysis by gel chromatography on Sepharose 2 B under associative conditions showed that 95 % of the glycosaminoglycans in the complete digest were in small-sized fragments, whereas most of the hyaluronan-binding G 1 domain and link protein remained intact and bound to hyaluronan. In contrast, there was extensive digestion of the G 2 domain which resulted in 76 % loss in its detection by immunoassay. Analysis of the <b>partial</b> <b>digest</b> also showed considerable loss (40 %) of detection of the G 2 domain, but the glycosaminoglycan-rich fragments were much larger than in the complete digest. There was also much less cleavage to create small fragments containing the G 1 domain. This was evident on SDS/PAGE analysis where a 58 kDa G 1 domain fragment was abundant in the complete digest, but was only present in small amounts in the <b>partial</b> <b>digest.</b> There was also only very limited conversion of link protein from a 44 kDa form to a 40 kDa form. The digestion of proteoglycan aggregate (6 mg/ml) by stromelysin was unaffected {{by the addition of}} a high concentration of extra chondroitin sulphate chains (14 mg/ml), and the digestion of proteoglycan monomer showed that the G 1 domain was resistant to stromelysin digestion even when not bound to hyaluronan and link protein. The results show that stromelysin degrades the proteoglycan protein core with major cleavages close to, but not within, the G 1 domain, and extensive cleavage in other regions. Experiments with purified collagenase, a metalloproteinase structurally related to stromelysin, showed that it too cleaved proteoglycan at several sites within the glycosaminoglycan-rich region of the core protein.

This problem is an obstacle {{to the study of}} many bacterial symbionts that live intracellularly in insects and other animals. To recover bacterial DNA from complex samples, we devised a method that facilitates the cloning of DNA fragments of distinctive G+C contents in order to generate shotgun DNA libraries enriched in inserts having a specific base composition. DNA preparations are first treated with a restriction enzyme having a common cleavage site in a particular genome and then shotgun cloned following size-fractionation. This method was applied to whole bacteriomes of the psyllid, Pachypsylla venusta, which harbors the bacterial symbiont Candidatus Carsonella ruddii.
