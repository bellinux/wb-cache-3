5|$|Barnes {{returned}} from injury after {{two and a}} half weeks on the sidelines immediately after the Fourth Test. He made 24 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. He delivered 14 overs in the second innings, taking 0/6, the most economical figures in the match apart from one bowler who bowled a solitary maiden. When Australia fielded, a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> for onlookers was where Barnes would field; he stayed at mid-wicket, well clear of the batsman. Barnes made 31 in the next game against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. After being given out lbw to Allan Watkins, he walked off visibly showing his displeasure at the umpiring decision, believing the ball would have missed leg stump. The hosts fell for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{predicted}} {{to be the}} key player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an offense that earned 610rushing yards in the final two games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also was a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> At the time, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was ranked third. Beamer had never defeated Bowden in a game. Before the game, Beamer was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the game focused {{on the fact that the}} 2009 Orange Bowl was Cincinnati's first Bowl Championship Series game in school history. For Virginia Tech, coverage focused on the Hokies' winless history in BCS games since 1995, as Tech had lost all four of its appearances in a BCS game since an upset win over Texas in the 1995 Sugar Bowl. Also mentioned was the fact that the two teams had faced each other in the 1947 Sun Bowl, which had been each school's first bowl game. The low win rate of ACC teams in general was another <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Teams from the conference had won just one of their ten appearances in a BCS bowl before the Orange Bowl. Before the Orange Bowl matchup, the two teams last played in 2006, when the Hokies defeated the Bearcats, 29–13, at Virginia Tech's home field, Lane Stadium. For the Orange Bowl, spread bettors favored a reversal of that 2006 final, as Cincinnati was initially favored by one point. This expanded to 1.5 points by December 9. The trend toward Cincinnati continued, and on December 27, betting organizations gave Cincinnati the edge by two or two and a half points.|$|E

5|$|The Louvre {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75percent of the total budget to 62percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance. A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.|$|E

25|$|King Gambrinus, Legendary Patron of Brewing (1967), {{a statue}} {{commissioned}} by the Pabst Brewing Company in the United States, has been a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{in the city of}} Milwaukee for many years.

25|$|The {{sculpture}} will {{be located}} on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail at {{the northeast corner of}} Delaware and Washington streets, near the City-County Building.

25|$|Downtown Córdoba is home {{of large}} {{shopping}} malls, notably Patio Olmos. This mall {{is the result}} of a massive regeneration effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side old warehouses into elegant offices and commercial centres. An important cultural <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is the Palacio Ferreyra, a mansion built in 1916 based on plans by the French architect, Ernest Sanson. The Ferreyra palace was converted into the Evita Perón Museum of Fine Arts (the city's second) in 2007. Located at the corner of Hipólito Yrigoyen and Chacabuco Avenues, it has now been restored and adapted to house the city's principal art gallery.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{discoveries in}} the area suggest that humans have {{populated}} the region for at least 10,000-12,000 years. Archaeological research demonstrates that the Chumash people have deep roots in central and southern coastal regions of California, and has revealed artifacts from their culture. Shisholop Village, designated Historic <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interest</b> #18 by the city {{at the foot of}} nearby Figueroa Street, was the site of a Chumash village. The Ventura band (Mitskanaka), which was in residence {{at the time of the}} arrival of the Spanish, had contact with the Limu band on Santa Cruz Island, who traveled in seagoing Tomols, plank-built boats, bringing shell bead money and chert in trade.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{historical}} {{sites in the}} park are easily accessible via short walks, including Gamlin Cabin, built circa 1872 by the Gamlin brothers who had a timber claim at Grant Grove before it became a national park. it {{is believed to be}} the first permanent structure built in the park area. Knapp Cabin, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is the oldest surviving structure in Cedar Grove, dating back to 1925. Another <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is the extensive Boyden Cavern system whose entrance is located just outside the park's western boundary, in the Monarch Wilderness. As of 2016, the cave was closed due to damage from the Rough Fire.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War {{the island}} {{was a part of}} the GHQ Line, a line of {{concrete}} pillboxes constructed as a part of the defence against the expected German invasion. Some of the old pillboxes are still in place. Also, concrete barges were used extensively just off the south coast of the island, partly as a sea-barrier and also as a mounting point for anti-aircraft guns; one of which was beached on the east end of the island and remained for many years as a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> for visitors and a play area for many generations of the island's children. It has since been demolished by the Island Yacht Club as it was considered a risk to health and safety.|$|E
25|$|A further <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is Confey Castle, {{which the}} British Publisher and Cartographer Samuel Lewis, {{mentions}} {{in the first}} volume of his 1837 opus A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland. In it he comments that Confey's (or Confoy as he spells it) population was 165, had formerly had a town and a castle of some importance, which were noticed by Camden. Of the tower's remains were a massive five-storey structure with turrets at the north and west angles; that at the north angle containing a winding staircase opening through pointed arches into each storey. The principal entrance was under a semicircular archway. In the war of 1688 the castle {{is said to have been}} strongly garrisoned, and to have sustained an attack.|$|E

25|$|A main <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> of {{the remains}} at Ras ir-Raħeb is the {{integration}} of two rough stone megaliths within the Punic-Roman structure. These are {{the remains of a}}n earlier, prehistoric structure. The only other instance in Malta of the reuse {{of the remains}} of a prehistoric building is at Tas-Silġ where the rear-apse of a megalithic temple was included in building of a Punic-Roman sanctuary. These two sites share a number of similarities, such as the position of the courtyard with respect {{to the rest of the}} building– leading to the hypothesis that the Ras ir-Raħeb site may have also had a religious meaning. A reassessment of Ptolemy’s descriptions attempted to link this site with a temple to Heracles, but the arguments are not conclusive.|$|E
25|$|At {{the heart}} of yield {{management}} decision-making process is the trade-off of marginal yields from segments that are competing for the same inventory. In capacity-constrained cases, there is a bird-in-the-hand decision that forces the seller to reject lower revenue generating customers {{in the hopes that}} the inventory can be sold in a higher valued segment. The tradeoff is sometimes mistakenly identified as occurring at the intersection of the marginal revenue curves for the competing segments. While this is accurate when it supports marketing decisions where access to both segments is equivalent, it is wrong for inventory control decisions. In these cases the intersection of the marginal revenue curve of the higher valued segment with the actual value of the lower segment is the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs at sites 13 and 14, after the transcription start site, is insignificant between normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals. This is because methylation of CpGs after the transcription start site is assumed to interfere with RNA polymerase II during transcription. Another <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is the significant difference in CpG methylation at site 11 between normal and hyperplasia adrenals. The mean percent CpG methylation at site 11 for hyperplasia and adenoma adrenals is significantly different from that of normal adrenals and carcinoma adrenals, leading Gao et al. to suggest that site 11 is the initial methylated CpG that eventually leads to widespread methylation of the H19 promoter.|$|E
