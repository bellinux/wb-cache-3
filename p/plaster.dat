40|$|Summary: Unconstrained <b>Plastering</b> {{is a new}} {{algorithm}} {{with the}} goal of generating a con-formal all-hexahedral mesh on any solid geometry assembly. Paving[1] has proven reliable for quadrilateral meshing on arbitrary surfaces. However, the 3 D corollary, <b>Plastering</b> [2][3][4][5], is unable to resolve the unmeshed center voids due to being over-constrained by a pre-existing boundary mesh. Unconstrained <b>Plastering</b> attempts to leverage the bene-fits of Paving and <b>Plastering,</b> without the over-constrained nature of <b>Plastering.</b> Uncon-strained <b>Plastering</b> uses advancing fronts to inwardly project unconstrained hexahedral lay-ers from an unmeshed boundary. Only when three layers cross, is a hex element formed. Resolving the final voids is easier since closely spaced, randomly oriented quadrilaterals do not over-constrain the problem. Implementation has begun on Unconstrained <b>Plastering,</b> however, proof of its reliability is still forthcoming...|$|R

5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white <b>plaster</b> and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa <b>plaster</b> can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 <b>plaster</b> ceiling supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative <b>plaster</b> pieces in the ceiling. Contractors had to install scaffolding tall enough to reach the highest interior crevice in the ceiling eight stories up—the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of the repair work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was fresco, {{in which}} the paint is applied to damp <b>plaster.</b> Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the <b>plaster,</b> , began to grow mold because it was too wet. Michelangelo had to remove it and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E
5|$|There {{was limited}} {{interference}} from Orion Pictures.

To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then <b>plaster</b> reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and <b>plaster.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{his home}} in Much Hadham, Moore built up a {{collection}} of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, pebbles, rocks and shells, which he would use to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he usually produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final moulding and casting at a bronze foundry. Moore often refined the final full <b>plaster</b> shape and added surface marks before casting.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the <b>plaster</b> was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a <b>plaster</b> surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{memorial}} began in 1928 with the cut and placement of marble blocks from Macclesfield and Angaston. The South Australian Monumental Works {{were chosen to}} work on the construction, with Alan Tillett as the principal. Although no sculptor was named in the winning proposal, it did make mention of a possible candidate—who later proved to be Rayner Hoff, a Sydney-based sculptor born in England. Rayner Hoff produced the designs for the sculptures from his Sydney studio, with the bronze castings from Hoff's <b>plaster</b> models being produced by the South Australian firm A. W. Dobbie and Company. (Hoff had expressed reservations that a South Australian company would be capable of handling bronzes of the required size, but a test casting of the lion's head from {{the memorial}} was sufficient to overcome his concerns). The two angel reliefs sculpted from the Angaston marble were produced by Julius Henschke in situ from Hoff's designs, expressed through one-third sized <b>plaster</b> models which Henschke then scaled to suit.|$|E

There are many reports on their efficacy but few on patients’ impressions of usability or levels of satisfaction. Objectives. To elucidate the differences in perception between patients and physicians concerning NSAID <b>plasters.</b> Subjects. We conducted two surveys about NSAID <b>plasters</b> on patients and physicians. 600 patients currently using <b>plasters</b> and 200 physicians currently prescribing NSAID <b>plasters</b> were studied. Methods. Questionnaire included items concerning usage, efficacy and side effects, site and intensity of their pain, pain management strategies, characteristics they desired from NSAID <b>plasters,</b> and their satisfaction with them. Results. The characteristic most frequently reported as desirable by patients was analgesic efficacy, followed by avoiding skin irritation and low medication cost. The characteristics most frequently reported as desirable by physicians were analgesic efficacy, alignment with patient preference, safety to skin, and comfort when applied. Our survey revealed that both patients and physicians prioritized analgesic efficacy of NSAID <b>plasters.</b> However, {{approximately half of the}} patients and physicians were unsatisfied with the analgesic efficacy of <b>plasters.</b> Conclusions.
