50|$|Khatami {{summaries}} these stages {{by using}} Husserlian term of Reduction again; However, he still employs this word in his specific indication: “Each stage four stages implies a reduction: (a) Reduction from appearances (dawaher) to their essences (mahyyat); (b) Reduction from essences to the knowing self (nafs al 'aref); (c) Reduction from the knowing self {{to the self}} as <b>presential</b> cognition (al nafs ‘ayn o ma'refateh); (d) Reduction of thepresential cognition to Being which implies a new return to the things (the phenomenal world) through Being itself, with a different outlook; considering neither their appearance (as phenomenalism says) nor their essence (as phenomenology says); rather, their reality as theemanative entities.”Khatami {{tells us that the}} reductions (a) and (b) belong to the horizontal lines in the structure of Being, and “we can classify them as the eidtic reduction (in Husserlian sense) because they belong to essences and the eidetic field.” While “the reductions (c) and (d)”, Khatami writes, “belong to the vertical line in the structure of Being and we can classify them as the ontetic reduction.”3According to the above levels and reduction we see three level of logic which are only levels of a continuously vertical-horizontal, hierarchic and integrated logic. The general name he uses for this logic is “ontetic logic” which accords the transcendental method. First level of this logic which happens with application of the beginningless commence, is called empirical logic. Empirical logic is the logic of induction and experiential conclusions. The second level happens with the eidetic reduction, in which we are reflectively seeking the essences and their interrelations as they appear in our reflective constituting consciousness. Eidetic logic covers formal logic in its all presentation, being classic or modern, being deductive or abductive. The third level which is disclosed by the ontetic reduction, {{in which there is no}} reflection but a pure presence; it is logic of presence which not formal in its nature. According to Khatami, the empirical logic as well as the formal logic are limited to lower regions of human consciousness and being, and have their special field of application. They are parts of the transcendent method and two primary constituents of the ontetic logic. However, the ontetic logic is Logic of Tashkik, that is, a continuous, qualitative, and hierarchic logic with the ability of descending and ascending in vertical, as well as running and returning in horizontal structure, whether in a linear way or circular etc.4This logic and its transcendent method enables Khatami to start by description of the plain commomsensual experience which every body has from him and his environment; then goes further and reduces it to the eidetic entities which constitute various subjects of sciences; then he reduces consciousness to its original source which is <b>presential</b> cognition (and not a transcendental Ego as we see in Kantian-Husserlian heritage). It is from this point that Khatami extends his philosophy of subjectivity and other issues concerning human subjectivity.Meanwhile, by the ontetic reduction he recovered the ancient Persian philosophical triadic idea of “Consciousness-Action-Being” and tried to conclude the ontetic logic hidden in this idea. This idea, though constituted the whole structure of reality, shapes the world of human subjectivity which is a qualitative world (macrocosm) in itself.5 This means for Khatami that human subjectivity accords the world; the ontetic realm would be a human extroversion, that is, the human triad of presence: “Consciousness-Action-Being”. This approach brings Khatami to centralize “human subjectivity” as the main thematic subject of philosophy: “Philosophy is the only science that purely devoted to human subjectivity and its relationships (which build up his world).”6 According to this thesis, every thing we consider as “a being” means for us as appeared in human world and its network of ontetic relations.|$|E

40|$|The {{essay is}} a phenomenological study of Don Berry’s novel Trask (1960), demonstrating that experiential {{priority}} {{is given in}} the text to what Erwin Straus and Otto Bollnow call <b>presential</b> [präsentisch] space. The investigation analyses the difference between two forms of such space. On the one hand <b>presential</b> space is constituted automatically. This happens for the mountain man through the relentless momentum of long-distance trekking. On the other hand <b>presential</b> space is constituted as a mystical terminus of a tribal quest preceded by years of extreme self- discipline. Although such tribal ‘Searching’ is designed {{to lead to a}} sublime space- experience devoid of human agency and control, only agency and control make that happen. The essay proposes that, in the text, this structural contradiction makes traditional-cultural attainment of <b>presential</b> space less subtle than the automatic constitution of <b>presential</b> space that happens effortlessly on long mountain trails, without the consciousness-engineering of shamanistic choreography. By lacking any interest in ‘the Searching,’ and thus not programming himself for mystical enlightenment, the rapturous end of Trask’s half-hearted ‘Searching’ adventure comes across as a miracle rather than as reward for socially approved self-discipline. When mystical clairvoyance in this way finally comes to Trask, without him ever really having sought it, its perfectly gratuitous materialization becomes an extension of <b>presential</b> moments given with equal gratuitousness on the mountain trail. In the last analysis, mystical enlightenment in Trask is not the outcome of any striving but something that emerges effortlessly from sustained walking and from the stillness in which it pauses to renew its momentum...|$|E

OBJETIVO: Avaliar se um material disponibilizado através de E-learning antes de aulas presenciais de prevenção da cegueira (PC) melhora o nível de conhecimento basal dos estudantes, e ajuda a manter esse conteúdo um mês após a aula. MÉTODOS: Estudantes do quarto ano do curso médico foram aleatoriamente sorteados para ter aulas presenciais de PC (grupo tradicional = GT) ou ter aulas presenciais precedidas de material adicional por E-learning (grupo E-learning = GEL). Este material foi enviado por correio eletrônico uma semana antes da aula presencial. Os estudantes foram submetidos a testes de múltipla escolha com sete questões (com três alternativas cada) imediatamente antes da aula presencial, imediatamente após a aula, e um mês após a aula. Os três testes tiveram as mesmas questões: entretanto, as respostas foram distribuídas em sequências diferentes. O desfecho primário foi a nota do pré-teste.

40|$|The {{epistemological}} {{approach of}} evidentialism maintains that a belief must have sufficient evidence {{in order to}} be rationally justified. The belief in God is no exception and, hence, it too must pass the litmus test of evidence as a measure of its rational justification. But what counts as evidence? Responding to this question and identifying the nature of the evidence {{that can be used to}} justify belief has become a point of contention between philosophers. While some evidentialists have denied the possibility of evidence for the belief in God, others have attacked the very basis of the evidentialist claim by promoting belief in God without evidence.

To this end, we analyzed {{the academic performance of}} students in a curricular unit of a course of Physical Education and Sport, for four academic years from 2007 / 2008, during which the unit was initially taught only <b>presential,</b> by 2010 / 2011, a period that was taught in a combined modality (75 % online and 25 % <b>presential).</b> Data analysis, referring to the classifications obtained, suggests that the creation of virtual environments, combined with complementary or <b>presential</b> learning, and using pedagogical models adapted to online environments (eg, Comumunity of Inquiry Garrison et al, 2000; E-Moderating, Salmon, 2000), diversified learning objects (scripto, audiovisual and multimedia) and strategies that encourage students, may indeed contribute to a significant improvement in their academic achievement. We also concluded that this b-learning modality, supported by online pedagogical constructivist and collaborative models allow effectively equate the teaching-learning process in a different way. However, the change should not be seen only from a technological standpoint, since the use of an LMS is no guarantee of success, but must above all be seen in terms of changing attitudes and practices.
