5000|$|Continuous {{artificial}} light, {{which may}} be normal lighting, or produced by special <b>photoflood</b> lights. The properties of different light sources vary; household incandescent lighting, fluorescent lighting, sodium discharge street lighting, etc., are very different and produce different results, and require different correction if a subjectively neutral rendition of colours is required.|$|E
5000|$|Appropriate color {{conversion}} {{filters are}} used {{to compensate for the}} effects of lighting not balanced for the film stock's rated color temperature (usually 3200 K for professional tungstens and 5500 K for daylight): e.g., the 80A blue filter used with film for daylight use corrects the perceived orange/reddish cast of incandescent photographic <b>photoflood</b> lighting (for which the usual photographic term is [...] "tungsten lighting"), and significantly improves the stronger cast produced by lower-temperature household incandescent lighting, while the 85B will correct the bluish cast of daylight photographs on tungsten film. Color correction filters are identified by non-standardised numbers which vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. The need for these filters has been greatly reduced by the widespread adoption of digital photography, since color balance may be corrected with camera settings as the image is captured, or by software manipulation afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|Rohmer {{made the}} film with no budget {{and out of}} order {{while he waited for}} Jean-Louis Trintignant to be {{available}} for My Night at Maud's, and this stricture possibly inspired the techniques and principles he and his cinematographer Nestor Almendros would return to in his later films: extensive rehearsal with the cast followed by very few takes; relying on natural light wherever possible, even for night scenes; [...] "spying" [...] fluid long shots to establish characters and their relationship together in a specific space. In his autobiography, A Man With A Camera, Almendros admits [...] "The film had to have a 'natural' look, whether we wanted it to or not, because we had only five <b>photoflood</b> lamps." [...] They used so little film that, [...] "In the laboratories they thought they were the rushes of a short (film)." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tungsten film is {{photographic}} film designed to accurately represent colors {{as perceived by}} humans under tungsten light; the more usual color films are [...] "daylight films", balanced to produce accurate colours under direct light from the sun or electronic flash. Tungsten film was developed for photographers who use tungsten lights, also known as <b>photofloods,</b> which have a much lower color temperature than daylight, at 3200 kelvins. It also renders colors more accurately than daylight film under ordinary household incandescent lighting.|$|R
40|$|This {{interactive}} learning object introduces {{some of the}} lighting effects used in theatre and stage shows. It uses a mix of text and animated diagrams to explore a number of areas. These areas include: the principles of lighting such as illumination, revelation of form and focus; different types of lanterns (profile, Fresnel and floodlight) and their effects; gels; gobos; how to create moods with lighting; and how to create lighting effects using flicker wheels, strobelights and <b>photofloods.</b> Quiz questions are embedded in the resource to test students' understanding and an accompanying assessment item consolidates what they have learned. A number of additional tools are provided to enhance students' experience of the resource. These include a notepad, a colour changer, a magnifying glass and a calculator. ...|$|R

Under these conditions 90 % of over 1000 young salmonidae were successfully deflected into a dark alley {{by means of an}} angled barrier of light {{from a variety of sources}} ranging from high intensity <b>photoflood</b> lamps down to ordinary 100 watt electric lamps and gasoline lanterns. It is recommended that similar studies be made under field conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{photochromic}} compounds N-p-phenylazophenyl-N-phenylcarbamylcholine chloride and p-phenylazophenyltrimethylammonium chloride {{inhibit the}} carbamylcholine-produced depolarization of the excitable membrane of the monocellular electroplax preparation of Electrophorus. The trans isomer of each predominates {{in the light}} of a <b>photoflood</b> (420 mμ) lamp; they are stronger inhibitors than the cis isomers, which predominate under ultraviolet (320 mμ) irradiation. The potential difference across the excitable membrane may be photoregulated by exposing an electroplax {{in the presence of a}} solution of carbamylcholine and either of the two compounds to light of appropriate wavelengths, since light shifts the cis-trans equilibrium. The system may be considered as a model illustrating how one may link a cis-trans isomerization, the first step in the initiation of a visual impulse, with substantial changes (20 - 30 mv) in the potential difference across an excitable membrane...|$|E
40|$|The color {{photography}} on "Bantam" film {{of polished}} ore specimens {{is the subject}} of this research. Preliminary tests showed that a diffused light source of large area (6 inch diameter) is necessary for even illumination of the subject which is up to 1 3 / 4 inches in diameter. An enlarging lens, designed to function best at low image magnifications, is used on the camera. Focusing and framing is done on a ground glass. A special camera was designed which has a magnification range of 1 to 4 3 / 4 times. Further testing with type A Kodachrome film showed that acceptable results can be achieved using for illumination either a # 1 <b>Photoflood</b> bulb (color temp. 3400 °K) giving bluish colors or a PS- 25 lamp (color temp. 3200 °K) giving reddish colors. If pictures are taken using nearly crossed polarized light: (1) the intensity of reflected light drops from 20 to 100 times de- pending on the minerals, and the intensity will vary with the orientation of the minerals and the degree of extinction of the polarized light; (2) the extinction color of the polaroid filters is not gray but blue-violet, and for some pictures an orange correction filter may be necessary. A study of the sharpness of the pictures indicates that the resolution of the lens, limited by aberrations and diffraction, is below that of the film. Kodachrome film is better than Ektachrome for miniature transparencies. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of an additional Er:YAG laser conditioning step after laser cavity preparations, on the microleakage of class V composite restorations. Forty-eight bovine incisors were randomly divided into four groups: G 1 (control) cavities prepared with bur, G 2 - cavities prepared with laser (400 mJ/ 2 Hz), G 3 -cavities prepared and subsequently conditioned with Er:YAG laser (60 mJ/ 2 Hz); G 4 -idem for G 3, but the laser conditioning was carried out without water-spray. All the cavities were restored using Clearfill SE Bond (R) and Z- 250 (R) composite resin. The samples were thermal cycled for 700 cycles and then immersed in 50 % silver nitrate solution. The sectioned restorations were exposed to a <b>photoflood</b> lamp to reveal silver nitrate penetration. The Kruskal-Walis one-way analyses of variance test and post hoc Wilcoxon pair-wise comparison were used to compare microleakage degrees. At the gingival margin G 2 showed a lower microleakage mean than the control bur-prepared cavities (p = 0. 0003). At occlusal margins there were no statistically significant differences between the groups (p = 0. 28). It may be concluded that Er:YAG laser class V cavity preparations do not need to be followed by an additional laser conditioning step to result in levels of microleakage similar to or lower than those obtained after bur preparations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of various pulse widths with different energy parameters of erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser (2. 94 mu m) on the morphology and microleakage of cavities restored with composite resin. Identically sized class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surfaces of 54 bovine teeth by high-speed drill (n = 6, control, group 1) and prepared by Er:YAG laser (Fidelis 320 A, Fotona, Slovenia) with irradiation parameters of 350 mJ/ 4 Hz or 400 mJ/ 2 Hz and pulse width: group 2, very short pulse (VSP); group 3, short pulse (SP); group 4, long pulse (LP); group 5, very long pulse (VLP). All cavities were filled with composite resin (Z- 250 - 3 M), stored at 37 A degrees C in distilled water, polished after 24 h, and thermally stressed (700 cycles/ 5 - 55 A degrees C). The teeth were impermeabilized, immersed in 50 % silver nitrate solution for 8 h, sectioned longitudinally, and exposed to <b>Photoflood</b> light for 10 min to reveal the stain. The leakage was evaluated under stereomicroscope by three different examiners, in a double-blind fashion, and scored (0 - 3). The results were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test (P > 0. 05) and showed that there was no significant differences between the groups tested. Under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) the morphology of the cavities prepared by laser showed irregular enamel margins and dentin internal walls, and a more conservative pattern than that of conventional cavities. The different power settings and pulse widths of Er:YAG laser in cavity preparation had no influence on microleakage of composite resin restorations...|$|E
