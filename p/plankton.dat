He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, <b>Plankton</b> gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, <b>Plankton</b> gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks.

5|$|Krabs' rival {{and former}} best friend <b>Plankton</b> {{operates}} the Chum Bucket, a failing restaurant {{across the street}} from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton's futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer sidekick Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent <b>Plankton</b> from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out of fear that <b>Plankton</b> might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs also makes it his duty to ensure that the Chum Bucket never has any business whatsoever.|$|E

40|$|A spatial {{distribution}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate the influence of some environmental factors to <b>planktons</b> using collected samples from the Sungai Pulai estuary, near to the Singapore boarder. Six stations chosen for the field sampling were Port Tanjung Pelepas (S 1), Tanjung Bin Charcoal Plant (S 2), seagrasses of Pulau Merambong (S 4) and Second-Link Bridge (S 5) and mangrove areas (S 3, S 6). There is no significant difference of phytoplankton abundance (p> 0. 05) between stations. Instead, it differs significantly {{at the level of}} p 0. 05; p= 0. 8966) between the sampling session (Two tailed, t= 0. 1310, df= 34). Biplot analysis shows that most species are associated with the stations except for Protoperidinium sp., Lithodesmia sp. and Alexendrium sp. Copepod species including Microcalanus sp., Calanus sp. and Temora sp. are associated with S 5. Paracalanus sp., Euterpina sp., Tigriopus sp., Oithona sp. and Pseudocalanus sp. are associated with S 1, S 2 and S 4. The <b>planktons</b> are correlated with the temperature (Pearson’s correlation, r 2 =- 0. 897) and salinity (Pearson’s correlation, r 2 = 0. 9416) in March but no correlation is found in November sampling session.

40|$|<b>Planktons</b> are minute {{organisms and}} are {{essential}} links in food chain in aquatic system. The Narmada river is one among the important rivers in India with varied rich biodiversity.

The present study was carried for the period of two years at Omkareshwar station, as the station is highly subjected to anthropogenic activities. The sampling was done twice in month during the morning hours. During the present study, 42 taxa belonged to phytoplankton were recorded. Out of this 24 species of family Chlorophyceae, 9 species of family Cynophyceae, One species of Euglenophyceae and 8 species of family Bacillariophyceae were recorded.

5|$|Marine mammals {{have evolved}} {{a wide variety}} of {{features}} for feeding, which are mainly seen in their dentition. For example, the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid. In contrast, baleen whales have evolved baleen plates to filter feed <b>plankton</b> and small fish from the water.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{feeds on}} <b>plankton.</b> The tentacles of the dactylzooids are {{normally}} extended all the time. If an object is waved about above the coral, {{it will cause}} the tentacles to retract and then the coral can be handled without experiencing the painful stings caused by the cnidocytes.|$|E
5|$|Most {{sharks are}} carnivorous. Basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have {{independently}} evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction {{to take in}} <b>plankton</b> and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the <b>plankton</b> in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.|$|E
40|$|<b>Planktons</b> {{collected}} (in May, 1952) at {{the coast}} of Enoura, Kita-takagi-gun, could be devided into the following principal groups-Copepoda-group Polychaeta-group and Mysis-group. That is to say Copepoda-group, for example, means that <b>planktons</b> collected in that place hold Copepodas for the most part. The same to another case. If every group is made hydrolysis, and then developed through paper-chromatography, we can recognize that Copepoda-group contains arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, valine and iso-leucine. Polychaeta-group holds arginine, glycine, proline and valine. Mysis-group contains iso-leucine, varine, alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, asyartic acid, arginine and leaves some trace of something. On the occasion of these plankton-gatherings, Mr. Norimichi Funatsu set himself to collections. His kindness really overwhelms us with gratitude. 1. 1952 年 5 月に諫早市郊外の千々岩湾に臨む江の浦海岸で採集したプランクトンは大別してCopepoda-群. Polychaeta-群、Mysis-群の三群と分類することが出來た。 2.

5|$|The {{lineages}} of rorquals {{and right}} whales split almost 20mya. It is unknown where this occurred, {{but it is}} generally believed that they, like their descendants, followed <b>plankton</b> migrations. These primitive mysticetes had lost their heterodont dentition in favor of baleen, and {{are believed to have}} lived on a specialized benthic, <b>plankton,</b> or copepod diet like modern mysticetes. Mysticetes experienced their first radiation in the mid-Miocene. Balaenopterids grew bigger during this time, with species like Balaenoptera sibbaldina rivaling the blue whale in terms of size. It is thought this radiation was caused by global climate change and major tectonic activity when Antarctica and Australia separated from each other, creating the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.|$|E
5|$|The polyps of {{stony corals}} have {{six-fold}} symmetry while those of soft corals have eight. The mouth of each polyp {{is surrounded by}} a ring of tentacles. In stony corals these are cylindrical and taper to a point, but in soft corals they are pinnate with side branches known as pinnules. In some tropical species these are reduced to mere stubs and in some they are fused to give a paddle-like appearance. In most corals, the tentacles are retracted by day and spread out at night to catch <b>plankton</b> and other small organisms. Shallow water species of both stony and soft corals can be zooxanthellate, the corals supplementing their <b>plankton</b> diet with the products of photosynthesis produced by these symbionts. The polyps interconnect by a complex and well-developed system of gastrovascular canals, allowing significant sharing of nutrients and symbionts.|$|E

50|$|With {{the demise}} of living matter, such as diatoms, <b>planktons,</b> spores and pollens, the organic matter begins to undergo {{decomposition}} or degradation. In this break-down process, large biopolymers from proteins and carbohydrates begin to dismantle either partially or completely. (According to Maurice Tucker (1988), this break-down process is basically the reverse of photosynthesis). These dismantled components are units that can then polycondense to form polymers. This polymerization usually happens alongside {{the formation of a}} mineral component (geopolymer) resulting in a sedimentary rock like kerogen shale.|$|R

5|$|The storm-petrels are the {{smallest}} seabirds, feeding on <b>plankton</b> and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering.

50|$|Unlike typical protozoans, M. rubra {{can make}} its own {{nutrition}} by photosynthesis. The unusual autotrophic property was discovered in 2006 when genetic sequencing revealed that the photosynthesising organelles, plastids, were derived from the principal food of the ciliate, the photosynthetic algae called cryptomonads (or cryptophytes). It is, thus, both autotrophic and heterotrophic. This nature also indicates {{that it is an}} example of endosymbiosis, supporting the endosymbiotic theory, as well as the concept of stealing of cell organelles called kleptoplastidy. Moreover, M. rubra represents additional endosymbiosis by transferring its plastids to its predators, the dinoflagellate <b>planktons</b> belonging to the genus Dinophysis.|$|R
