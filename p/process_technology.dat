40|$|Abstract. Competitive {{quality is}} a need for the {{progress}} of the Information Technology sector. For enterprises, process is the starting point of all the approaches in the achievement of competitive quality. Despite these widely accepted hypotheses, we fail to demonstrate that Software <b>Process</b> <b>Technologies</b> are really adopted by enterprises. In this position paper we want to stimulate the discussion about the practical adoption of <b>process</b> <b>technologies</b> proposing two issues. First, following the demand for quality, work in the field of <b>process</b> <b>technologies</b> must be directly addressed to quality achievement. Second, if we want to “sell ” <b>process</b> <b>technologies,</b> we have to propose to enterprises an incremental approach that minimises investments and promises quality results in the short term...|$|R
