5|$|Parry went on {{to receive}} a Doctorate in Music from the University of Cambridge; {{he was the first}} Welshman to receive Bachelor's and Doctor's degrees in music from the University. He {{returned}} to Wales in 1874 to become the first <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> at Aberystwyth University, later accepting a position at Cardiff University.|$|E
5|$|In 1858 Bennett {{returned}} to composition, but his later works, though popular, were considered old-fashioned {{and did not}} arouse as much critical enthusiasm as his youthful compositions had done. He was <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> at the University of Cambridge from 1856 to 1866. In that year he became Principal of the RAM, rescuing it from closure, and remained in this position until his death. He was knighted in 1871. He died in London in 1875 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Stanford was {{appointed}} <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> at Cambridge {{in succession to}} Sir George Macfarren who died in October of that year. Up to this time, the university had awarded music degrees to candidates {{who had not been}} undergraduates at Cambridge; all that was required was to pass the university's music examinations. Stanford was determined to end the practice, and after six years he persuaded the university authorities to agree. Three years' study at the university became a prerequisite for sitting the bachelor of music examinations.|$|E

5|$|Once Tchaikovsky {{graduated}} in 1865, Rubinstein's brother Nikolai offered him {{the post of}} <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> Theory at the soon-to-open Moscow Conservatory. While the salary for his professorship was only 50 rubles a month, the offer itself boosted Tchaikovsky's morale and he accepted the post eagerly. He was further heartened by news of the first public performance {{of one of his}} works, his Characteristic Dances, conducted by Johann Strauss II at a concert in Pavlovsk Park on 11 September 1865 (Tchaikovsky later included this work, re-titled, Dances of the Hay Maidens, in his opera The Voyevoda).|$|E
5|$|Sir John Stainer (6 June 1840– 31 March 1901) was an English {{composer}} and organist whose music, though not generally much performed today (except for The Crucifixion, still heard at Passiontide in many churches of the Anglican Communion), was very popular during his lifetime. His work as choir trainer and organist set standards for Anglican church music {{that are still}} influential. He was also active as an academic, becoming Heather <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Stainer {{was born}} in Southwark, London in 1840, {{the son of a}} cabinet maker. He became a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral when aged ten and was {{appointed}} to the position of organist at St Michael's College, Tenbury at the age of sixteen. He later became organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, and subsequently organist at St Paul's Cathedral. When he retired due to his poor eyesight and deteriorating health, he returned to Oxford to become <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> at the university. He died unexpectedly while on holiday in Italy in 1901.|$|E

5|$|The Manasollasa {{has been}} called an {{important}} source on socio-cultural history of medieval India, particularly {{for the history of}} food, drinks and cuisines and of sports. Mandakranta Bose, a professor on South Asian studies, describes the text to be of great interest because it is the earliest known text with details on dance genres in India. A team consisting of Bruno Nettl, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> and anthropology, has called Manasollasa an enormous treatise with large sections on music, dance and other performance arts.|$|E
5|$|While {{discussing}} typical Bollywood soundtracks, Nilanjana Bhattacharjya, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> at Colorado College, {{noted that}} Rahman integrated traditional Punjabi cultural elements within his music for this soundtrack.

5|$|In April 1926 the German-born {{composer}} Werner Josten {{directed the}} opera's first American performance, at Smith College, Massachusetts {{where he was}} <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> His production was based on d'Indy's edition. The following year, on 27 October, L'incoronazione received its British première, with a performance at Oxford Town Hall {{by members of the}} Oxford University Opera Club using a score edited by Jack Westrup. In the 1930s several editions of the opera were prepared by leading contemporary musicians, including Gustav Mahler's son-in-law Ernst Krenek, Hans Redlich, Carl Orff (who left his version incomplete), and Gian Francesco Malipiero. Malipiero's edition was used to stage performances in Paris (1937) and Venice (1949). The Redlich edition was performed at Morley College, London in 1948, under the direction of Michael Tippett.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{reputation}} at {{this time}} was as a master of orchestration, based on Sadko and Antar. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any counterpoint, could not harmonize a simple chorale, nor knew the names or intervals of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform. Aware of his technical shortcomings, Rimsky-Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, with whom {{he and the others}} in The Five had been in occasional contact. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and was serving as <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> Theory at the Moscow Conservatory. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.|$|E
5|$|While {{still an}} undergraduate, Stanford was {{appointed}} organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1882, aged 29, {{he was one}} of the founding professors of the Royal College of Music, where he taught composition for the rest of his life. From 1887 he was also <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> at Cambridge. As a teacher, Stanford was sceptical about modernism, and based his instruction chiefly on classical principles as exemplified in the music of Brahms. Among his pupils were rising composers whose fame went on to surpass his own, such as Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. As a conductor, Stanford held posts with the Bach Choir and the Leeds triennial music festival.|$|E
5|$|In August 1868 Parry and {{his family}} arrived in England, where he began a three-year study at the Royal Academy of Music under William Sterndale Bennett and Manuel Garcia. During his last year of study at the Royal Academy, Parry {{appeared}} before Queen Victoria three times, each time by her special request. The Queen made another request of Parry each time he appeared: that he perform only works he had composed. In 1871, Bennett convinced Parry to enter University of Cambridge for a degree in music. While at Cambridge, Parry became the first Welshman to take both the MusB and MusD there. After earning his Bachelor's degree, Parry {{and his family}} returned to Danville, where he operated a school of music {{for the next three}} years. When Aberystwyth University established a chair for music, it was offered to Parry; he moved his family back to Wales, becoming the university's first <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music.</b>|$|E
