25|$|A model {{based on}} {{electron}} crystallographic density and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} deconvolution has been proposed to explain the binding of docetaxel to β-tubulin. In this T-shaped/butterfly model, a deep hydrophobic cleft exists near {{the surface of the}} β-tubulin where three <b>potential</b> <b>hydrogen</b> bonds and multiple hydrophobic contacts bind to docetaxel. The hydrophobic pocket walls contain helices H1, H6, H7 and a loop between H6 and H7 that form hydrophobic interactions with the 3’-benzamido phenyl, 3’-phenyl, and the 2-benzoyl phenyl of docetaxel. 3’-phenyl also has contact with β-sheets B8 and B10. The C-8 methyl of docetaxel has Van der Waals interactions with two residues, Thr-276 and Gln-281 near the C-terminal end of β-tubulin. Docetaxel’s O-21 experiences electrostatic attraction to Thr-276 and the C-12 methyl has proximity with Leu-371 on the loop between B9 and B10.|$|E

The conductance histogram of Rh atomic contacts varied with the electrochemical potential. When the electrochemical {{potential of the}} contact was kept at Φ_ 0 = 0. 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Rh potential), the conductance histogram did not show any features. At Φ_ 0 = - 0. 1 V (under <b>potential</b> deposited <b>hydrogen</b> <b>potential),</b> the conductance histogram showed a feature around 2. 3 G_ 0 (G_ 0 = 2 e^ 2 /h), which agreed with the conductance value of a clean Rh atomic contact, which was observed in ultrahigh vacuum at low temperature. At Φ_ 0 = - 0. 25 V (over <b>potential</b> deposited <b>hydrogen</b> <b>potential),</b> the conductance histogram showed features around 0. 3 and 1. 0 G_ 0. The conductance behavior of the Rh atomic contact was discussed by comparing previously reported results of other metals, Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni, Co, and Fe.

The high hydrogen content, {{as well as}} the discovery of reversible hydrogen storage in Ti-doped NaAlH4, have sparked renewed research into LiAlH4 during the last decade. A substantial research effort has been devoted to accelerating the decomposition kinetics by catalytic doping and by ball milling.In order {{to take advantage of the}} total hydrogen capacity, the intermediate compound LiH must be dehydrogenated as well. Due to its high thermodynamic stability this requires temperatures in excess of 400 °C, which is not considered feasible for transportation purposes. Accepting LiH + Al as the final product, the hydrogen storage capacity is reduced to 7.96 wt%. Another problem related to hydrogen storage is the recycling back to LiAlH4 which, owing to its relatively low stability, requires an extremely high hydrogen pressure in excess of 10000 bar. Cycling only reaction R2 — that is, using Li3AlH6 as starting material — would store 5.6 wt% hydrogen in a single step (vs. two steps for NaAlH4 which stores about the same amount of hydrogen). However, attempts at this process have not been successful so far.|$|E

Pet animals other than fish are also available in Aquarium Street, They include Love Birds, Hamsters, pigeons, hens etc. Kolathur was once a hub for fish breeding too,now due to the high ground rates fish farms are converted into residential houses and flats and the farms and ponds are transferred to Gummudipondi.It was Mr. Ashok who was instrumental in breeding ornamental fishes, as he started imparting his knowledge to his friends who started fish breeding farms. Then a few enterprising people started breeding varieties of fishes in the 1980s in the sprawling backyards of their homes.The main reason was that the area was endowed with abundant fresh ground water sources {{and there was the}} perennial ‘Retteri' lake. Moreover, as ornamental fishes breed in different types of water and the water available at Kolathur has a balanced pH (<b>Potential</b> <b>Hydrogen)</b> value of 6 to 7.8, the business thrived.At present, there are around 80 shops dealing in ornamental fishes, aquariums and fish accessories spread out on School Road and Mada Streets in Kolathur.|$|E
