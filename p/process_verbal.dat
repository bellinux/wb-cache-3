40|$|Japanese and Uighur {{languages}} are sorts of agglutinative language, in which new words are formed by attaching suffixes to a stem(or a root word).

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{contrastive}} {{analysis showed that}} the frequency of <b>verbal</b> <b>processes</b> varies according to genre, topic, and the writers’ experience. Within the student texts, the genre with {{the highest percentage of}} <b>verbal</b> <b>processes</b> was reviews. A high <b>verbal</b> <b>process</b> frequency was also found in the journal articles, in part because they deal with discourse analysis, {{associated with the use of}} a dialogic and polyphonic style, but also because of the authors’ writing experience. The study also showed significant differences as to the most frequent <b>verbal</b> <b>processes</b> in the two corpora, and in their projecting characteristics. The most frequent <b>verbal</b> <b>process</b> in the student corpus was the most prototypical one (decir), whereas in the expert corpus it was definir. Besides, projection was more common amongst the student texts as they use a more colloquial and less specialized style than writers of journal articles. However, the extended use of non-projecting processes supports the viewpoint of the linguists that include them in the group of <b>verbal</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{presented}} a quantitative and contrastive analysis of <b>verbal</b> <b>processes</b> in student texts (essays, reviews and question-answers) and expert ones (journal articles). On the one hand, {{the results of}} the quantitative analysis showed that constructions of saying and symbolizing {{play an important role in}} the language of the humanities. With <b>verbal</b> <b>processes,</b> a writer can represent both a subjective experience related to the expression of opinions and emotions and an objective one related to the construing of knowledge in the areas of Literature and Linguistics. With this important role in mind, added to the fact that <b>verbal</b> <b>processes</b> constitute a high percentage among all the processes in the corpora, Matthiessen’s viewpoint according to which <b>verbal</b> <b>processes</b> are one of the four basic types seems pertinent.|$|R

30|$|Still a third {{process was}} used to signal {{implicit}} causal connections, <b>verbal</b> <b>processes.</b> Although they only comprised {{a small percentage of}} the total CACs found amongst the text samples, <b>verbal</b> <b>process</b> CACs served a specific purpose in the selected texts; all instances of CACs signaled by <b>verbal</b> <b>processes</b> were related to the speech of historical actors. For example, following the dispute between the colonists and the British government over taxation, the colonists began refusing to pay taxes: “With their assemblies outlawed, some colonists refused to pay taxes. They said that being taxed without having a voice in government violated their rights” (Garcia et al. 2005, p. 147). In cases such as this, the authors blur the lines between citation and cognition. There is no documentation, for example, that the colonists said those words. Rather, it is more likely that the colonists generally thought that taxation without representation was unfair. Like the example of CAC signaled by cognitive mental process above, then, these <b>verbal</b> <b>process</b> CACs use the link between thought and action to imply causal relationships between events.|$|R

Both the Arab and Israeli media played a role in portraying the image of the released Palestinian Prisoners versus the Israeli soldier to the readers worldwide. The study aimed to identify the online media coverage of the Swap by Aljazeera English and Ha’aretz in terms of the manipulation of language to identify the discursive strategies and the linguistic means of self-justification of both news agencies towards this issue.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{establish}} {{whether the}} disability in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) {{is the result}} of the number of seizures, the anti-epileptic therapy or is an inherent characteristic of the syndrome itself. MethodsThirty-six children with BECTS were tested for cognitive functions prior to commencing treatment with anti-epileptic drugs, and the findings were compared with those in 15 children with normal electroencephalograms, performed for unrelated reasons. The data in the study group were further correlated with the laterality of the epileptic focus and the number of seizures. ResultsScores for verbal functioning on neuropsychological tests were significantly lower in the study group than the control group. There was no relationship between the neuropsychological scores in the patients and either lateralization of the epileptic focus or number of seizures.

40|$|Conversational systems play an {{important}} role in scenarios without a keyboard, e. g., talking to a robot. Communication in human-robot interaction (HRI) ultimately involves a combination of verbal and non-verbal inputs and outputs. HRI systems must <b>process</b> <b>verbal</b> and non-verbal observations and execute verbal and non-verbal actions in parallel, to interpret and produce synchronized behaviours. The development of such systems involves the integration of potentially many components and ensuring a complex interaction and synchronization between them. Most work in spoken dialogue system development uses pipeline architectures. Some exceptions are [1, 17], which execute system components in parallel (weakly-coupled or tightly-coupled architectures). The latter are more promising for building adaptive systems, which is one of the goals of contemporary research systems. In this paper we present an event-based approach for integrating a conversational HRI system. This approach has been instantiated using the Urbi middleware [6] on a Nao robot, used as a testbed for investigating child-robot interaction in the ALIZ-E project. We focus on the implementation for two scenarios: an imitation game of arm movements and a quiz game...|$|E
