40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{parameters}} {{and operation of}} rule types as used in policy formation, arguing that hard law elements (where failure can lead to <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanction</b> and recourse to the European Courts), and soft law (where there is reliance on peer pressure supplemented by various devices such as reporting and benchmarking) both {{have a role to}} play. It examines the role of sanctions – a key distinction between hard and soft law- and their influence on policy formation, how it is used as a symbol, the failure to trigger sanctions, the institutional and policy reasons for this, and the circumstances where sanctions can support coordination effectively, noting that a defensive response to policy coordination can be triggered if such coordination is seen as coercive and top-down. Reform of policy methods and institutions are constrained by the prospect of treaty reform – generally seen as best avoided in relation to EMU and the ECB in particular. This leaves any reform agenda focused on non-Treaty aspects of policy formation of which the Stability and Growth Pact is perhaps the most obvious. Recent reform proposals by the Commission have thus focused on a more flexible interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact’s medium-term budgetary balance rule {{to take into account the}} size of public debt and the quality of public investment. While both of these reforms would help to restore consistency between the pact and the UK Treasury’s Fiscal Code for Stability and thus remove an important obstacle to UK membership of the euro area, they fail to adequately address the curren...|$|E

The application of a new criminal procedure will avoid criminal prosecution of doctors, transfering to the civil courts the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanctions</b> for malpractice. Medical negligence and damage inflicted by doctors that require compensation are explained. The most likely evolution of medical liability is proposed, through an increase in civil liability insurances and the necessary standardization of rules applicable to profesional liabilit...|$|R
40|$|The present article aims {{to answer}} the {{question}} whether an undertaking’s responsibility (sometimes also referred to as liability) in an antitrust proceeding held by the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (the Polish National Competition Authority) is of a criminal nature. The notion of ‘criminal charge’ is rather extensively construed in the jurisprudence of European Court of Human Rights, which has formulated the criteria for criminal responsibility. Taking these criteria into account, the author postulates that the severe character of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanctions</b> imposed in Polish antitrust proceedings is an argument for the criminal character of the proceedings. Thus the guarantees of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights should be applicable to Polish antitrust proceedings. Michał Mija...|$|R
40|$|Competition law {{seeks to}} protect {{competition}} {{on the market}} {{as a means of}} enhancing consumer welfare and of ensuring an efficient allocation of resources. In order to be successful, therefore, competition authorities should be adequately equipped and have at their disposal all necessary enforcement tools. However, at the EU level the current enforcement system of competition rules allows only for the imposition of administrative fines by the European Commission to liable undertakings. The main objectives, in turn, of an enforcement policy based on financial penalties are two fold: to impose sanctions on infringing undertakings which reflect the seriousness of the violation, and to ensure that the risk of penalties will deter both the infringing undertakings (often referred to as 'specific deterrence') and other undertakings that may be considering anti-competitive activities from engaging in them (often referred to as 'general deterrence'). In all circumstances, it is important to ensure that <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanctions</b> imposed on infringing undertakings are proportionate and not excessive. Although <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanctions</b> against infringing undertakings are a crucial part of the arsenal needed to deter competition law violations, they may not be sufficient. One alternative option in that regard is the strategic use of sanctions against the individuals involved in, or responsible for, the infringements. Sanctions against individuals are documented to focus the minds of directors and employees to comply with competition rules as they themselves, in addition to the undertakings in which they are employed, are at risk of infringements. Individual criminal penalties, including custodial sanctions, have been in fact adopted by almost half of the EU Member States. This is a powerful tool but is also limited in scope and hard to implement in practice mostly due to the high standards of proof required and the political consensus that needs first to be built. Administrative sanctions for individuals, on the other hand, promise to deliver up to a certain extent the same beneficial results as criminal sanctions whilst at the same time their adoption is not likely to meet strong opposition and their implementation in practice can be both efficient and effective. Directors’ disqualification, in particular, provides a strong individual incentive for each member, or prospective member, of the Board as well as other senior executives, to take compliance with competition law seriously. It is a flexible and promising tool that if added to the arsenal of the European Commission could bring balance to the current sanctioning system and that, in turn, would in all likelihood make the enforcement of EU competition rules more effective. Therefore, it is submitted that a competition law regime in order to be effective should be able to deliver policy objectives through a variety of tools, not simply by imposing significant <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanctions</b> to infringing undertakings. It is also clear that individual sanctions, mostly of an administrative nature, are likely to play an increasingly important role as they focus the minds of those in business who might otherwise be inclined to regard infringing the law as a matter of corporate risk rather than of personal risk. At the EU level, in particular, the adoption of directors’ disqualification promises to deliver more effective compliance and greater overall economic impact...|$|R
40|$|Assuming that {{metropolitan}} city {{costs and the}} available resources for the realization of public facilities and services are scarce, if not minimal, as in the current economic situation, and {{in the light of}} a growing problem which is that of illegal buildings, it is no longer possible to continue to ignore financial tools that assume a certain relevance for financing urban regeneration. The issue of illegal buildings is strictly connected to <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanctions</b> to obtain a “retrospective building permission” (sanatoria) and could represent a significant item of revenue and capital expenditure (or investment) in financing the public city. In this perspective. the article, analyzing the illegal building phenomenon from a local finance perspective, wants to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of revenues deriving from “retrospective building permission” as well as the financial management and urban planning capacity of local authorities. A first exploration, deriving from a departmental research on Terra di Lavoro, concerning the municipality of Casal di Principe in the province of Caserta...|$|R
40|$|The {{fight against}} cartels is a {{priority}} for antitrust authorities {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. What differs between the EU and the US is not the basic toolkit for achieving deterrence, but to whom it is targeted. In the EU, <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanctions</b> against the firm are the only instruments available to the Commission, while in the US criminal sanctions are also widely employed. The aim of this paper is to compare two diferent types of fines levied on managerial firms when they collude. We consider a profit based fine as opposed to a delegation based fine, with the latter targeting the manager in a more direct way. Under the assumption of revenue equivalence, we find that the delegation based fine, although distortive, is more effective in deterring cartels than the profit based one. When evaluating social welfare, a trade-off between deterrence and output distortion can arise. However, if the antitrust authority focuses on consumer surplus, then the delegation based fine is to be preferred...|$|R

The Central Bank will, adopting the methods regarded as most appropriate, make public the measures referred to in the previous paragraph if they are of general relevance and addressed to the public.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} household recycling in Italy with particular emphasis on social behaviour. The econometric analysis is based on two waves - 1998 and 2000 - of the Multipurpose Household Survey conducted annually by the Italian Central Statistics Office. In Italy household recycling was substantially voluntary in the years from 1998 to 2000 with no monetary incentives or <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Five different materials are investigated: paper, glass, plastic, aluminium and food waste. The results of the probit regressions suggest that membership in organizations, church attendance, the habit of talking politics and reading newspapers are significantly correlated with household recycling behaviour, while gender, age and household income playing the biggest role. Our findings also show {{that the presence of}} recycling bins for waste improves household recycling behaviour for all materials whereas difficulty to reach recycling bins adversely affects household recycling outcomes. Household judgments on waste disposal charges have no effect on the recycling effort. As expected, residency in Southern Italy is associated with the lowest probability of recycling all materials. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{particular}} and worrying {{form of urbanization}} are “informal settlements ” or unauthorised buildings (abusivismo edilizio), a phenomenon which is particularly accentuated in southern Italian cities, especially in Campania Region. Nevertheless their challenges – economic, social and environmental – have been widely recognized in international and national programs fostering urban sustainability. In Italy, as in other European countries, the actions set out by current regulations to address illegal settlements follow several approaches: repressive, mitigatory and comprehensive. This last approach provides the legalization of informal settlements or buildings {{on the basis of}} a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>sanctions</b> to obtain a “retrospective building permit”. The sanctions could represent a significant item of revenue and capital expenditure (or investment) in financing the public city. In this perspective, the article wants to extend the question with reference to some cities of the Campania Region, where there are numerous types of informal settlements. Considering the different assessment procedures used by municipalities in order to determine the value of illegal works and analyzing some municipal budgets, both the efficiency and effectiveness of this tool will be evaluated, as well as the capability of local authorities in the informal settlements management for the promotion of sustainable city...|$|R

On average, an event such as an interrogation of firm representatives by the DGCCRF, a decision by the Minister of Finance to ask the Conseil de la concurrence to investigate a case, or a Decision imposing <b>pecuniary</b> and non-pecuniary <b>sanctions,</b> caused the share price of affected firms to fall significantly.
