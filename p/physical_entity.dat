500|$|At {{the time}} of the quark theory's inception, the [...] "particle zoo" [...] included, amongst other particles, a {{multitude}} of hadrons. Gell-Mann and Zweig posited that they were not elementary particles, but were instead composed of combinations of quarks and antiquarks. Their model involved three flavors of quarks, up, down, and strange, to which they ascribed properties such as spin and electric charge. The initial reaction of the physics community to the proposal was mixed. There was particular contention about whether the quark was a <b>physical</b> <b>entity</b> or a mere abstraction used to explain concepts that were not fully understood at the time.|$|E
500|$|In his 1902 book Myśli nowoczesnego Polaka (Thoughts of a Modern Pole), Dmowski denounced {{all forms}} of Polish Romantic {{nationalism}} and traditional Polish values. He sharply criticized the idea of Poland as a spiritual concept and as a cultural idea. Instead Dmowski argued that Poland was merely a <b>physical</b> <b>entity</b> {{that needed to be}} brought into existence through pragmatic bargaining and negotiating, not via what Dmowski considered to be pointless revolts – doomed to failure before they even began – against the partitioning powers. For Dmowski, what the Poles needed was a [...] "healthy national egoism" [...] that would not be guided by what Dmowski regarded as the unrealistic political principles of Christianity. In the same book, Dmowski blamed the fall of the old Commonwealth on its tradition of tolerance. While at first critical of Christianity, Dmowski viewed some sects of Christianity as beneficial to certain nations, through not necessarily Poland. Later in 1927 he revised this earlier view and renounced his criticism of Catholicism, seeing it as {{an essential part of the}} Polish identity. Dmowski saw all minorities as weakening agents within the nation that needed to be purged.|$|E
500|$|Introspectively, {{the world}} of {{conscious}} experience seems to have considerable structure. [...] Immanuel Kant asserted that {{the world as we}} perceive it is organized according to a set of fundamental [...] "intuitions", which include object (we perceive the world as a set of distinct things); shape; quality (color, warmth, etc.); space (distance, direction, and location); and time. Some of these constructs, such as space and time, correspond to the way the world is structured by the laws of physics; for others the correspondence is not as clear. Understanding the physical basis of qualities, such as redness or pain, has been particularly challenging. David Chalmers has called this the hard problem of consciousness. Some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically unsolvable, because qualities ("qualia") are ineffable; that is, they are [...] "raw feels", incapable of being analyzed into component processes. Other psychologists and neuroscientists reject these arguments. For example, research on ideasthesia shows that qualia are organised into a semantic-like network. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that the}} relationship between a <b>physical</b> <b>entity</b> such as light and a perceptual quality such as color is extraordinarily complex and indirect, as demonstrated by a variety of optical illusions such as neon color spreading.|$|E

500|$|The zombie {{argument}} {{is based on}} a thought experiment proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by David Chalmers in his book The Conscious Mind. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' {{argument is}} that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any <b>physical</b> <b>entity</b> can be by definition described scientifically via physics, the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one. Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie {{is a product of the}} physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that [...] "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!" ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Poincaré's idea of {{momentum}} and mass associated with radiation {{proved to be}} fruitful, when Max Abraham introduced the term „electromagnetic momentum“, having a field density of [...] per cm3 and [...] per cm2.

He argued that, through {{the faculty of}} [...] "imagination" [...] as conceived of in Aristotelian philosophy, certain [...] "pure" [...] and well-prepared souls, were able to receive information about future events. Significantly, he does not attribute such visions or dreams to revelation from God, but instead explains that imagination enables human beings to receive the [...] "form" [...] of something without needing to perceive the <b>physical</b> <b>entity</b> to which it refers. Therefore, {{it would seem to}} imply that anyone who has purified themselves would be able to receive such visions.

2500|$|After the {{discovery}} of the electron and the forces that affect it, a microscopic resolution of the paradox became possible. See Figure 1. The metal portions of the apparatus are conducting, and confine a current due to electronic motion to within the metal boundaries. All electrons that move in a magnetic field experience a Lorentz force of , where v is the velocity of the electrons relative to the frame where measurements are taken, and q is the charge on an electron. Remember, there is no such frame as [...] "frame of the electromagnetic field". A frame is set on a specific spacetime point, not an extending field or a flux line as a mathematical object. It is a different issue if you consider flux as a <b>physical</b> <b>entity</b> (see Magnetic flux quantum), or consider the effective/relative definition of motion/rotation of a field (see below). This note helps resolve the paradox.|$|E
2500|$|This {{argument}} was criticized by Peter Glassen {{in a debate}} with J. J. C. Smart {{in the pages of}} Philosophy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Glassen argued that, because it is not a <b>physical</b> <b>entity,</b> Occam's Razor cannot consistently be appealed to by a physicalist or materialist as a justification of mental states or events, such as the belief that dualism is false. The idea is that Occam's razor may not be as [...] "unrestricted" [...] as it is normally described (applying to all qualitative postulates, even abstract ones) but instead concrete (only applies to physical objects). If one applies Occam's Razor unrestrictedly, then it recommends monism until pluralism either receives more support or is disproved. If one applies Occam's Razor only concretely, then it may not be used on abstract concepts (this route, however, has serious consequences for selecting between hypotheses about the abstract).|$|E

2500|$|This {{mechanism}} {{agrees with}} the observations involving return paths: an EMF is generated whenever the disc moves relative to the return path, regardless of {{the rotation of the}} magnet. In fact it was shown that so long as a current loop is used to measure induced EMFs from the motion of the disk and magnet {{it is not possible to}} tell if the magnetic field does or does not rotate with the magnet. (This depends on the definition, the motion of a field can be only defined effectively/relatively. If you hold the view that the field flux is a <b>physical</b> <b>entity,</b> it does rotate or depends on how it is generated. But this does not alter what is used in the Lorentz formula, especially the v, the velocity of the charge carrier relative to the frame where measurement takes place and field strength varies according to relativity at any spacetime point.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Chalmers' {{argument}} is that it seems plausible that such a being could exist because {{all that is needed}} is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe and observe about a human being must be true of the zombie. None of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any <b>physical</b> <b>entity</b> can be described scientifically via physics whether it is conscious or not. The mere logical possibility of a p-zombie demonstrates that consciousness is a natural phenomenon beyond the current unsatisfactory explanations. Chalmers states that one probably could not build a living p-zombie because living things seem to require a level of consciousness. However (unconscious?) robots built to simulate humans may become the first real p-zombies. Hence Chalmers half-joking calls for the need to build a [...] "consciousness meter" [...] to ascertain if any given entity, human or robot, is conscious or not.|$|E

The Potsdam Gate itself was redesignated the Leipziger Tor (Leipzig Gate) around the same time, but reverted to its old name a few years later.|$|E
