25|$|The {{middle lamella}} is laid down first, formed from the cell plate during cytokinesis, and the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is then {{deposited}} inside the middle lamella. The actual {{structure of the}} cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model, the tether model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model. However, the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall,</b> {{can be defined as}} composed of cellulose microfibrils aligned at all angles. Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex, which is proposed to be made of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for each of the six units. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength. The cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the middle lamella, which contains magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic acid). Cells interact though plasmodesmata, which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the isolation and characterization of rhamnogalacturonan II, a hitherto unobserved {{component of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of dicotyledonous plants. Rhamnogalacturonan II constitutes 3 to 4 % of the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of suspension-cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells. Rhamnogalacturonan II {{is a very complex}} polysaccharide yielding, upon hydrolysis, 10 different monosaccharides including the rarely observed sugars apiose, 2 -O-methylxylose, and 2 -O-methylfucose. In addition, rhamnogalacturonan II is characterized by the rarely observed glycosyl interconnections of 2 -linked glucuronosyl, 3, 4 -linked fucosyl, and 3 -linked rhamnosyl residues. These glycosyl linkages have never previously been detected in <b>primary</b> sycamore <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> Evidence is presented which suggests that polysaccharides similar to rhamnogalacturonan II are present in the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of the three other dicotyledonous plants examined...|$|R
25|$|In plant biology, pectin {{consists}} of {{a complex set of}} polysaccharides (see below) that are present in most <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants. Pectin is a major component of the middle lamella, where it helps to bind cells together, but is also found in <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
25|$|The amount, {{structure}} and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants, within a plant over time, and {{in various parts}} of a plant. Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase, in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other. A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of cell walls varies between species and {{may depend on}} cell type and developmental stage. The <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> of land plants is composed of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Often, other polymers such as lignin, suberin or cutin are anchored to or embedded in plant cell walls. Algae possess cell walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides such as carrageenan and agar that are absent from land plants. In bacteria, the cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan. The cell walls of archaea have various compositions, and may be formed of glycoprotein S-layers, pseudopeptidoglycan, or polysaccharides. Fungi possess cell walls made of the glucosamine polymer chitin. Unusually, diatoms have a cell wall composed of biogenic silica.|$|E
500|$|All {{plants are}} {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, their DNA stored in nuclei. The characteristic features of plant cells that distinguish them {{from those of}} animals and fungi include a <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> composed of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, [...] larger vacuoles than in animal cells {{and the presence of}} plastids with unique photosynthetic and biosynthetic functions as in the chloroplasts. Other plastids contain storage products such as starch (amyloplasts) or lipids (elaioplasts). Uniquely, streptophyte cells and those of the green algal order Trentepohliales divide by construction of a phragmoplast as a template for building a cell plate late in cell division.|$|E

50|$|Pectins are {{a family}} of complex polysaccharides that contain 1,4-linked α-D-galactosyl uronic acid residues. They are present in most <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> and in the non-woody parts of {{terrestrial}} plants.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> of most plant {{cells is}} freely {{permeable}} to small molecules including small proteins, with size exclusion {{estimated to be}} 30-60 kDa. [...] The pH {{is an important factor}} governing the transport of molecules through cell walls.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the primary}} (growing) plant cell wall, the major {{carbohydrates}} are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers {{to form the}} cellulose-hemicellulose network, which {{is embedded in the}} pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose [...] in the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is xyloglucan. In grass cell walls, xyloglucan and pectin are reduced in abundance and partially replaced by glucuronarabinoxylan, another type of hemicellulose. Primary cell walls characteristically extend (grow) by a mechanism called acid growth, which involves turgor-driven movement of the strong cellulose microfibrils within the weaker hemicellulose/pectin matrix, catalyzed by expansin proteins. The outer part of the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> of the plant epidermis is usually impregnated with cutin and wax, forming a permeability barrier known as the plant cuticle.|$|E
50|$|The {{secondary}} cell {{wall is a}} structure found in many plant cells, located between the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> and the plasma membrane.

40|$|Abstract — Plant <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> provide {{form and}} {{mechanical}} strength {{to the living}} plant, but the relationship between their complex architecture and their remarkable ability to withstand external stress is not well understood. <b>Primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> are adapted to withstand tensile stresses while secondary <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> also need to withstand compressive stresses. Therefore, while <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> can with advantage be flexible and elastic, secondary <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> must be rigid to avoid buckling under compressive loads. In addition, <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> must be capable of growth and are subjected to cell separation forces at the cell corners. To understand how these stresses are resisted by <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> {{it will be necessary}} to find out how the walls deform internally under load, and how rigid are specific constituents of each type of <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> The most promising spectroscopic techniques for this purpose are solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman microscopy. By NMR relaxation experiments, it is possible to probe thermal motion in each cell-wall component. Novel adaptations of FTIR and Raman spectroscopy promise to allow mechanical stress and strain upon specific polymers to be examined in situ within the <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> © 2000 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SA...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} {{interactions of}} {{relevance to the}} structure and properties of the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of cereals and grasses, we used arabinoxylan and (1, 3) (1, 4) -beta-glucan, major polymers in cereal/grass <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> to construct composites with cellulose produced by Gluconacetobacter xylinus. Both polymers associated prolifically with cellulose without becoming rigid or altering the nature or extent of cellulose crystallinity. Mechanical properties were modestly affected compared with xyloglucan or pectin (characteristic components of nongrass <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls)</b> composites with cellulose. In situ depletion of arabinoxylan arabinose side chains within preformed cellulose composites resulted in phase separation, with only limited enhancement of xylan-cellulose interactions. These results suggest that arabinoxylan and (1 -> 3) (1 -> 4) -beta-d-glucan are not functional homologues for either xyloglucan or pectin {{in the way they}} interact with cellulose networks. Association of cell-wall polymers with cellulose driven by entropic amelioration of high energy cellulose/water interfaces should be considered as a third type of interaction within cellulose-based <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> in addition to molecular binding (enthalpic driving force) exhibited by, for example, xyloglucans or mannans, and interpenetrating networks based on, for example, pectins...|$|R
30|$|Separate TEs from non-differentiated {{cells is}} {{important}} for biochemical analysis and also for functional testing of genes involved in secondary <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> formation, because changes in secondary <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> composition can be detected more readily when the interfering <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of the other cell types present in the cultures, are removed.|$|R
50|$|The major polysaccharides {{making up}} the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> of land plants are {{cellulose}}, hemicellulose, and pectin.

50|$|Suberin {{consists}} of two domains, a polyaromatic and a polyaliphatic domain.

The two domains {{are supposed to be}} cross-linked. The exact qualitative and quantitative composition of suberin monomers varies in different species. Some common aliphatic monomers include α-hydroxyacids (mainly 18-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid) and α,ω-diacids (mainly octadec-9-ene-1,18-dioic acid). The monomers of the polyaromatics are hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives, such as feruloyltyramine.|$|E

It is the substrate of xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, which cuts and ligates xyloglucans, as a means of integrating new xyloglucans into the cell wall. It is also thought to be the substrate of alpha-expansin, which promotes cell wall enlargement.|$|E
