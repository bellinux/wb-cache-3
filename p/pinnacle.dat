5|$|The {{restoration}} {{then was}} carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of anastylosis and led by Theodor van Erp. The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things {{he could do to}} improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the chhatra (three-tiered parasol) <b>pinnacle</b> on top of the main stupa. However, he later dismantled the chhatra, citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the <b>pinnacle,</b> which means that the original design of Borobudur's <b>pinnacle</b> is actually unknown. The dismantled chhatra now is stored in Karmawibhangga Museum, a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.|$|E

5|$|The former fishing {{hamlet of}} Holywell (local {{pronunciation}} ‘holly well’) was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 {{yards to the}} southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat.

The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.|$|E

40|$|Many {{regions of}} Callisto feature an unusual {{landscape}} consisting of rolling dark plains with interspersed bright knobs (<b>pinnacles)</b> and ridges. In earlier work we interpreted the dark plains as dusty, mass-wasted residue from sublimation from volatile-rich bedrock {{and the bright}} knobs (often crater rims) as water ice accumulations at locations sheltered from thermal reradiation from the dusty residue. We simulated evolution of Callisto's craters as a combination of bedrock volatile sublimation, mass wasting of the dark, non-coherent residue, and redeposition of ice, {{and concluded that the}} ice <b>pinnacles</b> and ridges might be underlain by tens to hundreds of meters of ice. Here we report the initial work of a new study of <b>pinnacles</b> addressing additional questions: 1) Is there an evolutionary sequence starting, e. g., from a cratered initial surface through growth and formation of a dust mantle and <b>pinnacles,</b> to eventual loss of ice to sublimation resulting in just a dark, dusty surface? 2) What determines the areal density and spatial scale of <b>pinnacles</b> - volatile content of bedrock, crater density, surface age, broad-scale topographic setting? 3) Are <b>pinnacles</b> still forming? Several observations address these questions. In a few places scattered high-albedo blocks approx. 25 - 60 m in diameter occur in the vicinity of large icy <b>pinnacles.</b> We interpret these blocks to be remnants from the collapse of tall <b>pinnacles</b> that were undermined by mass wasting. Some high-relief icy knobs have developed a skeletonized planform due to mass wasting by avalanching, or perhaps to seeding of new sites of ice deposition on mass-wasted ice blocks. Some areas nearly lack fresh craters with well-defined ejecta and ice-free rims. This may imply rapid transformation of fresh craters by sublimation, mass wasting, and ice reprecipitation. In other areas small sharp-rimmed craters occur which lack ice <b>pinnacles,</b> but the craters nonetheless lack visible ejecta sheets. Our preliminary interpretation is that mass wasting is very efficient on Callisto, or alternatively the dust cover is very thick and lacks competent coarse materials...|$|R
50|$|Schuyler Hain was a homesteader {{who arrived}} in the <b>Pinnacles</b> area in 1891 from Michigan, {{following}} his parents and eight siblings to Bear Valley. His cousin, A.W. White, {{was a student at}} Stanford University, and White brought one of his professors to see the <b>Pinnacles</b> in 1893. Dr. Gilbert was impressed by the scenery, and his comments inspired Hain to publicize the region. Hain led tours to Bear Valley and through the caves, advocating the preservation of the <b>Pinnacles.</b> Hain's efforts resulted in a 1904 visit by Stanford president David Starr Jordan, who contacted Fresno Congressman James C. Needham. Jordan and Needham in turn influenced Gifford Pinchot to advocate the establishment of the <b>Pinnacles</b> Forest Reserve to President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt proclaimed the establishment on July 8, 1906. Pinchot, who was primarily interested in the management of forests for productive use rather than for preservation, advocated the use of the recently passed Antiquities Act to designate the scenic core of the area as <b>Pinnacles</b> National Monument, which was done by Roosevelt on January 16, 1908. This designation nominally passed control of the <b>Pinnacles</b> from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, but the U.S. Forest Service retained effective control of the area until circa 1911.|$|R
