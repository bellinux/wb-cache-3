2500|$|The {{value of}} the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen was not. The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta, was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and {{transportation}} costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to [...] per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, <b>printers</b> <b>ink,</b> medicines, rust- and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons {{ran out of money}} and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a Provincial Historic Site.|$|E

50|$|French Painter Paul Gauguin used a {{style of}} {{transfer}} drawing to create double-sided artworks when he lived in Tahiti from 1899-1908. For the drawing Eve ('The Nightmare'), Gauguin started by coating {{a sheet of paper}} with <b>printers</b> <b>ink,</b> then placing a blank sheet on top which becomes the artwork. Markings made with various drawing instruments to create an artwork {{on one side of the}} sheet, also transfer the <b>printers</b> <b>ink</b> to the back side of the sheet. The back side (verso) starts as the inverse or mirror-image of the front, which was further developed with different media as a separate drawing.

5000|$|In 1857 Charles Dickens {{published}} {{a detailed description}} of the area in Household Words entitled [...] "Londoners over the Border", writing:"...by the law there is one suburb on the border of the Essex marshes which is quite cut off from the comforts of the Metropolitan Buildings Act;-in fact, it lies just without its boundaries, and therefore is chosen as a place of refuge for offensive trade establishments turned out of the town, - those of oil boilers, gut spinners, varnish makers, <b>printers</b> <b>ink</b> makers and the like. Being cut off from the support of the Metropolitan Local Managing Act, this outskirt is free to possess new streets of houses without drains, roads, gas, or pavement."Describing the slum housing conditions and its effect on the health of local residents, Dickens wrote:"Rows of small houses, which may have cost for their construction eighty pounds a piece, are built designedly and systematically with their backs to the marsh ditches; ...to or three yards of clay pipe [...] "drain" [...] each house into the open cess pool under its back windows, when it does not happen that the house is built as to overhang it... In winter time every block becomes now and then an island, and you may hear a sick man, in an upper room, complain of water trickling down over his bed. Then the flood cleans the ditches, lifting all their filth into itself, and spreading it over the land. No wonder that the stench of the marsh in Hallsville and Canning Town of nights, is horrible. A fetid mist covers the ground... the parish surgeon... was himself for a time invalided by fever, upon which ague followed. , of course, is one of the most prevalent diseases of the district; fever abounds. When an epidemic comes into the place, it becomes serious in its form, and stays for months. Disease comes upon human bodies saturated with the influences of such air as is breathed day and night, as a spark upon touchwood. A case or two of small pox caused, in spite of vaccination, an epidemic of confluent small pox, which remained three or four months upon the spot."Dickens also describes efforts to improve the housing conditions in the area:"Two years ago, when application was made by more than a tenth of the rate payers of the parish of West Ham for an inquiry into the sanitary condition of the district, with a view to bringing it under the conditions of the Public Health Act, Mr Alfred Dickens was the civil engineer sent by the general Board of Health as an inspector. His report and the evidence at his inquiry is before us as we write, and it dwells very much upon the state of Canning Town and Hallsville. We learn from this report that the area of the ditches in the parish amounted to not less than one hundred and fifty acres, according to a surveyors book upwards of thirty five years old, and that area has been increased by side cuttings at the railway and new cuttings of open sewer. Disease had cost the parish six hundred pounds in the year previous to the inquiry. There was then, of course, as now, no drainage or paving in Canning Town; the roads in winter were impassable; but the inhabitants were paying (for what they did not get) an eighteen penny rate under the Commissioners Act, not for works done in accordance with it, but [...] "for the expenses of the act". Also, although the parish did not take charge of their roads, they were paying a highway rate for the parishioners elsewhere. One horrible detail in Mr Dickens report has, happily, to be omitted from our sketch. Two years ago, there was in Hallsville and Canning Town no water supply. Good water is now laid on. In all other respects, the old offences against civilised life cleave to the district. The local Board of Health which the inhabitants of the parish sought and obtained, whatever it may have done for Stratford, seems to have done nothing for Hallsville, unless it be considered something to indulge it with an odd pinch of deodorising powder." ...|$|E

40|$|Propaganda models {{recommend}} {{the use of}} familiar media, such as existing local or national newspapers and magazines, because target audiences are inclined to trust them more than newly established and untried publications. It is assumed that if the media cannot be used or needed to be supplemented with a more directly controlled and plentiful message, then the propagandist could not do any better than to replicate their formats. By reproducing the tested design and mode of information delivery of these trusted conduits, the sponsor of propaganda capitalizes on existing readings habits and this {{increases the likelihood of}} attaining his or her objectives. This is perhaps the reason why in 1941, the Coordinator of Inter American Affairs (CIAA), headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller (NAR), began the publication of a monthly pictorial magazine, titled En Guardia. J. C. Stark, the En Guardia editor, explained in a small article published in <b>Printers</b> <b>Ink</b> that the idea for the magazine came about in 1941 as part of the CIAA information program designed to convince Latin American nations to support the allied side of World War II.
