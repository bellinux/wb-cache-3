25|$|Both the aluminium-polyethylene {{cladding}} and the PIR insulation plates failed {{fire safety}} tests conducted after the fire, {{according to the}} police.

25|$|Conventional {{polyester}} polyols {{are based}} on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance.

They are manufactured by transesterification (glycolysis) of recycled poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) or dimethylterephthalate (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol.

30|$|HCN, in particular, {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the overall fire toxicity of polyurethane foams. Around 10 – 15  % of the nitrogen in the polymer can be converted into HCN with some being released in isocyanates, aminoisocyanates and amines in the fire effluent. Additionally, HCN yields in both flaming and non-flaming conditions increases with temperature. This {{can be explained by}} the fragmentation of nitrogen containing organics in the flame and in the effluent, as suggested by studies of the inert-atmosphere decomposition of polyurethane materials. HCN yields reported in under-ventilated conditions vary depending on the composition of the material; with flexible foams producing less than rigid foams and <b>polyisocyanurates</b> producing the most overall.|$|R
2500|$|In 1956 DuPont {{introduced}} polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical {{started selling}} polyalkylene glycols in 1957.

40|$|Ten model coatings, {{selected}} and {{obtained from a}} family of fluorinated resins synthesized by the reaction of perfluoroether oligomeric diols of different molec- ular weights with <b>polyisocyanurates</b> of hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDI) and isopho- ronediisocyanate (IPDI), were characterized with differential scanning calorimetry, mechanical testing, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The electrochemical and chemico-physical measurements show that the glass-transition temperature of the starting isocyanate trimers greatly influences the properties of the final urethane coatings; the IPDI trimer gives harder coatings with lower water per- meabilities than the corresponding HDI-based materials. Moreover, for each class of materials (from IPDI or HDI), the fluorine content plays a relevant role: the higher the fluorine percentage, the lower the water absorption into the coatings. Furthermore, the chain length of the polyols used for the synthesis of the prepolymers is a variable that exhibits great influence on the coating properties: coatings containing shorter perflu- oropolyether segments show better barrier properties. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|Depletion of the {{stratospheric ozone}} layer now ranks near the top among global environ-mental problems. As {{a result of the}} {{attention}} focused on this issue, an unprecedented in-ternational agreement has been reached which mandates curtailment of the production and use of fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). That Agreement, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, was signed in September 1987 and was subsequently ratified by the majority of signatory nations. The phased reductions in CFC production and consumption required by the Protocol are now well known to most individuals in the industries which use CFCs. Beginning July 1, 1989 CFC production and consumption were frozen at 1986 levels; by mid- 1993 and by mid- 1998 CFC production and consumption must be reduced by 20 percent and another 30 percent, respectively, for a final reduction of 50 percent from 1986 levels. The Montreal Protocol accelerated what was already a major industry effort to find suitable alternatives for CFCs. Both CFC producers and end-user industries had been researching substitutes or alternative production and processing technologies to reduce CFC use. Although much research into substitutes remains to be done, tremendous strides have al-ready been made toward reducing CFC use in polyurethanes and <b>polyisocyanurates.</b> Thi...|$|R

50|$|<b>Polyisocyanurate,</b> also {{referred}} to as PIR, polyiso, or ISO, is a thermoset plastic typically produced as a foam and used as rigid thermal insulation.

50|$|The thermal {{performance}} of loose filled cellulose compares favorably to {{other types of}} low cost insulation, but is {{lower than that of}} polyurethane and <b>polyisocyanurate</b> foams.
