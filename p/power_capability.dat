5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more <b>power,</b> <b>capability</b> to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E

500|$|At high power, arcing {{can occur}} {{at the corners of}} the filter teeth due to strong {{electric}} fields being present at sharp corners. [...] This limits the power-handling capability of the filter. [...] The effect can be mitigated by rounding the edges of the teeth. [...] Completely circular teeth are best of all for power handling. [...] Circular teeth will handle about 1.4 times the <b>power</b> <b>capability</b> of square teeth without arcing. [...] For instance Matthaei describes a [...] passband filter with rounded teeth and a wide stopband with a power-handling capability of [...] [...] A similar filter with circular teeth, on the other hand, can handle [...] [...] Using power dividers to connect filters in parallel and then combining their outputs can provide even greater power handling.|$|E

500|$|Benoît Tréluyer, {{driving the}} No. 7 Audi, was {{pressured}} {{by the two}} Toyota cars with Conway driving closely behind him heading into the Bus Stop chicane. Buemi got ahead of Conway driving into Les Combes to move into fourth place overall. Bird made a mistake at Pouhon, allowing his team-mate Bruni to reclaim the LMGTE Pro lead. After twenty minutes of the race had been completed, Lieb slowed with a hybrid system problem and began lapping slower {{than most of the}} LMP1 runners. The result meant he was unable to utilise his car's full electric <b>power</b> <b>capability</b> {{for the remainder of the}} event, and the driver quickly fell to sixth place behind both Audi entrants and the first Toyota car. Tréluyer was overtaken around the outside for third place by Buemi at the Bus Stop chicane while Conway got ahead of the Porsche driver shortly afterwards. Lieb was told by his team to remain on the circuit and manage the problem as Porsche needed the extra points towards the championship. Derani and Panciatci continued to battle for position which was resolved when the former went slightly wide at Eau Rouge and had to reduce his speed to avoid contact, allowing the latter to take over the position. After spinning at the race's start, Merhi moved back into fifth place in the LMP2 field.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{electric}} motor's inverter {{allows the}} motor windings {{to act as}} the transformer coils, and the existing high-power inverter as the AC-to-DC charger. As these components are already required on the car, and are designed to handle any practical <b>power</b> <b>capability,</b> {{they can be used}} to create a very powerful form of on-board charger with zero additional weight or size. AC Propulsion uses this charging method, referred to as [...] "reductive charging".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, Peter Dearman of Network Rail {{suggested}} that the third-rail network {{will need to be}} converted into overhead lines. He stated, [...] "Although the top speed is 100 mph, the trains cannot go over 80 mph well and 25% of power is lost from heat". Agreeing that conversion would be expensive, he said that the third rail network is at the limit of its <b>power</b> <b>capability,</b> especially as trains become more advanced in technology. The July 2012 Department for Transport High Level Output Specification for Network Rail Control Period 5 includes the conversion of the South Western Main Line between [...] and [...] from 750 V DC third rail to 25 kV AC overhead as part of a scheme to improve rail freight capacity from Southampton Port. This conversion is a pilot scheme to develop a business case for full conversion of the third rail network. The ORR has also stated that on safety grounds, third rail 750V DC has a limited future.|$|E
