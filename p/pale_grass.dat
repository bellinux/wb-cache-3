60|$|It was true, {{but he was}} so glad to see {{her that}} he forgot his annoyance. He had been {{occupied}} for over an hour in making things ready for her, and he now had his reward in seeing her look right and left, as she slipped her cloak from her shoulders, with evident satisfaction, although she said nothing. He had seen that the fire burnt well; jam-pots were on the table, tin covers shone in the fender, and the shabby comfort of the room was extreme. He was dressed in his old crimson dressing-gown, which was faded irregularly, and had bright new patches on it, like the <b>paler</b> <b>grass</b> which one finds on lifting a stone. He made the tea, and Katharine drew off her gloves, and crossed her legs with a gesture that was rather masculine in its ease. Nor did they talk much until they were smoking cigarettes over the fire, having placed their teacups upon the floor between them.|$|R
60|$|The statue {{stood on}} an {{octagonal}} pedestal {{of a highly}} polished slaty-gray stone, and on each of its eight faces was a picture in which one human figure appeared. Now, from gazing on the statue itself I fell to contemplating one of these pictures with a very keen interest, for the figure, I recognized, was {{a portrait of the}} beautiful girl Yoletta. The picture was a winter landscape. The earth was white, not with snow, but with hoar frost; the distant trees, clothed by the frozen moisture as if with a feathery foliage, looked misty against the whitey-blue wintry sky. In the foreground, on the <b>pale</b> frosted <b>grass,</b> stood the girl, in a dark maroon dress, with silver embroidery on the bosom, and a dark red cap on her head. Close to her drooped the slender terminal twigs of a tree, sparkling with rime and icicle, and on the twigs were several small snow-white birds, hopping and fluttering down towards her outstretched hand; while she gazed up at them with flushed cheeks, and lips parting with a bright, joyous smile.|$|R
60|$|Not New York only, {{but all of}} Ruth's {{relatives}} were forgot. Aunt Emma Truegate Winslow was a myth of the dragon-haunted past. Here all was fresh color and free spaces looking to open sea. Behind the dunes, with their traceries of <b>pale</b> <b>grass,</b> reveled the sharp, unshadowed green of marshes, and an inland bay that was blue as bluing, a startling blue, bordered by the emerald marshes. To one side--afar, not troubling their peace--were the crimson roofs of fantastic houses, like chalets and California missions and villas of the Riviera, with gables and turrets of red tiles.|$|E

6000|$|On an April Saturday morning Carl {{rose with}} a feeling of spring. He wanted to be off in the Connecticut hills, among the silvery-gray worm-fences, with larks rising on the breeze and pools a-ripple and yellow crocus-blossoms afire by the road, where towns white and sleepy woke to find the elms misted with young green. Would there be any crocuses out as yet? That was the only {{question}} worth solving in the world, save the riddle of Ruth's heart. The staid brownstone houses of the New York streets displayed few crocuses and fewer larks, yet over them to-day was the bloom of romance. Carl walked down to the automobile district past Central Park, sniffing wistfully at the damp <b>grass,</b> <b>pale</b> green amid old gray; marveling how a bare patch of brown earth, without a single blade of grass, could smell so stirringly of coming spring. A girl on Broadway was selling wild violets, white and purple, and in front of wretched old houses down a side-street, in the negro district, a darky in a tan derby and a scarlet tie was caroling: ...|$|R
60|$|He went {{straight}} to Isabel Temple's grave in the remote shore field of his farm. Isabel Temple had lived and died eighty years ago. She had been very lovely, very wilful, very fond of playing with the hearts of men. She had married William Temple, the brother of his great-grandfather, and as she stood in her white dress beside her bridegroom, {{at the conclusion of}} the wedding ceremony, a jilted lover, crazed by despair, had entered the house and shot her dead. She had been buried in the shore field, where a square space had been dyked off in the centre for a burial lot because the church was then so far away. With the passage of years the lot had grown up so thickly with fir and birch and wild cherry that it looked like a compact grove. A winding path led through it to its heart where Isabel Temple's grave was, thickly overgrown with long, silken, <b>pale</b> green <b>grass.</b> Roger hurried along the path and sat down on the big grey boulder by the grave, looking about him with a long breath of delight. How lovely--and witching--and unearthly it was here. Little ferns were growing in the hollows and cracks of the big boulder where clay had lodged. Over Isabel Temple's crooked, lichened gravestone hung a young wild cherry in its delicate bloom. Above it, in a little space of sky left by the slender tree tops, was a young moon. It was too dark here after all to read Wordsworth, but that did not matter. The place, with its moist air, its tang of fir balsam, was like a perfumed room where a man might dream dreams and see visions. There was a soft murmur of wind in the boughs over him, and the faraway moan of the sea on the bar crept in. Roger surrendered himself utterly to the charm of the place. When he entered that grove, he had left behind the realm of daylight and things known and come into the realm of shadow and mystery and enchantment. Anything might happen--anything might be true.|$|R

40|$|When species {{shift their}} ranges to track climate change, {{they are almost}} certain to {{experience}} novel environments {{to which they are}} poorly adapted. Otaki and co-workers document an explosion of wing pattern variation accompanying range expansion in the <b>pale</b> <b>grass</b> blue butterfly. This pattern can be replicated in the laboratory using artificial selection on cold shocked pupae, at temperature extremes typical of recently colonized environments. We discuss how this phenotypic plasticity may be associated with successful colonization and how significant local adaptation is likely to re-establish developmental control. Integrating knowledge of trait plasticity into current genetic models of adaptation is central to our understanding of when and where a colonising population will be able to persist and adapt in novel surroundings...|$|E
40|$|Larvae of the <b>pale</b> <b>grass</b> blue butterfly, Zizeeria maha (Kollar) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), feed {{exclusively}} on Oxalis corniculata L. (Oxalidales: Oxalidaceae), which accumulates oxalic acid {{as with other}} Oxalidaceae species. Larvae were stimulated to feed on artificial diets containing a crude methanolic extract from host plant leaves. Fractionations and bioassays revealed that the strong feeding activity {{was found in the}} water layer, from which oxalic acid was detected as a major compound. Removal of oxalic acid as calcium oxalate precipitates by addition of calcium chloride into the water layer resulted in a significant decrease in feeding activity on the filtrate. Re-addition of oxalic acid to the filtrate recovered the feeding activity. The addition of 260 μmol oxalic acid, corresponding to 1 g fresh leaves of Oxalis, to 1 g of artificial diet significantly stimulated feeding compared with the intact artificial diet. Therefore, oxalic acid was concluded to be a major feeding stimulant for Zizeeria maha larvae...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that the {{survival}} rate of Wolbachia decreases under high temperature in incubators. It is also known that a high density of Wolbachia in the host body reduces the host emergence rate, while low densities fail to change reproduction rates. However, {{few studies have examined}} the density of Wolbachia in hosts in the field. Here, we focus on Wolbachia infection of the <b>pale</b> <b>grass</b> blue butterfly, Zizeeria maha (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), which is distributed throughout the Japanese islands. We examined the rate and density of Wolbachia infection in the bodies of butterflies at thirteen locations in Japan. At seven of these places, we collected butterflies in different seasons to determine seasonal differences in the infection rate and density and found that Wolbachia density has seasonal differences within the same population. Moreover, to determine whether Wolbachia density has a geographical cline, we compared the infection density of Wolbachia amongst all geographical populations. In addition, we determined the sequences of Wolbachia wsp and host mtDNA CO 1 haplotypes of all populations. The results showed that Wolbachia density increased in early summer and decreased in autumn. Further, the density of Wolbachia infecting the same strain of Z. maha varied amongst populations, although no tendency in geographical cline was observed...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{release of}} {{radioactive}} materials {{due to the}} Fukushima nuclear accident has raised concern regarding the biological impacts of ingesting radioactively contaminated diets on organisms. We previously performed an internal exposure experiment in which contaminated leaves collected from polluted areas were fed to larvae of the <b>pale</b> <b>grass</b> blue butterfly, Zizeeria maha, from Okinawa, {{which is one of}} the least polluted localities in Japan. Using the same experimental system, in the present study, we further examined the effects of low-level-contaminated diets on this butterfly. Leaves were collected from two localities in Tohoku (Motomiya (161 Bq/kg) and Koriyama (117 Bq/kg)); two in Kanto (Kashiwa (47. 6 Bq/kg) and Musashino (6. 4 Bq/kg)); one in Tokai (Atami (2. 5 Bq/kg)); and from Okinawa (0. 2 Bq/kg). In addition to the effects on the first generation, we examined the possible transgenerational effects of the diets on the next generation. Results: In the first generation, the Tohoku groups showed higher rates of mortality and abnormalities and a smaller forewing size than the Okinawa group. The mortality rates were largely dependent on the ingested dose of caesium. The survival rates of the Kanto-Tokai groups were greater than 80 %, but the rates in the Tohoku groups were much lower. In the next generation, the survival rates in the Tohoku groups were below 20 %, whereas those of the Okinawa groups were above 70 %. The survival rates in the second generation were independent of the locality of the leaves ingested by the first generation, indicating that the diet in the second generation was the determinant of their survival. Moreover, a smaller forewing size was observed in the Tohoku groups in the second generation. However, the forewing size was inversely correlated with the cumulative caesium dose ingested throughout the first and second generations, indicating that the diet in the first generation also influenced the forewing size of the second generation. Conclusions: Biological effects are detectable under a low ingested dose of radioactivity from a contaminated diet. The effects are transgenerational but can be overcome by ingesting a non-contaminated diet, suggesting that at least some of the observed effects are attributable to non-genetic physiological changes...|$|E
