25|$|A mobile phone, or cell phone, is a long-range, {{electronic}} device used for mobile voice or data communication over {{a network of}} specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years, but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited in any area, the number of phone calls were also very limited. To solve this problem, there could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies. When users moved from one area to another while calling, the call {{would have to be}} switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls. The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St. Louis, Missouri on June 17, 1946, but the system was impractical from what is considered a <b>portable</b> <b>handset</b> today. The equipment weighed 80lbs, and the AT service, basically a massive party line, cost $30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per local call. The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a mobile telephony system while remaining on the same channel were devised by Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young at AT Bell Labs in 1947. Finally in 1973, Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone. His first mobile phone call was made to Joel S. Engel in April 1973.|$|E
50|$|Martin Cooper {{invented a}} <b>portable</b> <b>handset</b> in 1973, {{when he was}} a project manager at Motorola. It was almost three decades after the idea of {{cellular}} communications was introduced by Bell Laboratories. Two decades later, cellular phones made a commercial debut in the mass market in the early 1990s. In the early days of cellular handsets, phone functionality was limited to dialing, and voice input/output.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1957 {{he made an}} {{experimental}} model of a wearable automatic mobile phone ("radiophone"), called LK-1 (not {{to be confused with}} the cancelled Soviet spacecraft of the same name). His device consisted of a base station and a <b>portable</b> <b>handset.</b> LK-1 was 3 kg in weight, 20-30 km operating distance, and 20-30 hours of battery life. Leonid Kupriyanovich patented this mobile phone in 1957 (author's certificate № 115494, 1.11.1957). The base station, in accordance with author's description, could serve several customers. In 1958, Kupriyanovich made the new experimental [...] "pocket" [...] model mobile phone. This phone had 0,5 kg weight. To serve more customers, Kupriyanovich proposed the device, named it as a correllator.|$|E

2500|$|Most American police {{departments}} are dispatched from a centralized communications center, using VHF, UHF or, more recently, digitally trunked radio transceivers mounted in their vehicles, with individual officers carrying <b>portable</b> <b>handsets</b> or ear-worn headsets for communication when {{away from their}} vehicles. [...] American police cars are also increasingly equipped with mobile data terminals (MDT's)or portable computers linked by radio to a network allowing them access to state department of motor vehicles information, criminal records, and other important information.|$|R
40|$|A server {{infrastructure}} allows wireless wearable appliances or <b>portable</b> <b>handsets</b> {{to access}} consumer services offered via the server. Services are accessed via a Universal Home Services Interface (UHSI) which {{is shared by}} all access devices. The UHSI can include a voice-activated interface to simplify usage from non-graphical terminals. In a home network the infrastructure resides on a home gateway or central home computer and allows users access to local subsystems or external Â¿ WAN services.

5000|$|The [...] "Timeport" [...] {{phone with}} a voice control system was offered as on option on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The Timeport phone was similar to a Motorola Startac. In 2000 Mercedes and {{telecommunications}} and electronics's company Motorola announced they would offer the Timeport cell phone system on all models in the year 2001. The Timeport cell-phone was a jointly developed and became available on all of Mercedes 2001 models(including the 2001 W220 S-Class) The Timeport phone was integrated with S-Class systems, major features included Voice-control and automatic muteing of the radio when accepting an incoming call (or tape or CD player). Another features was that the directory of numbers in the phone could be downloaded to the car, and shown on the in-car display. Even though the phone was integrated as a system with car, it was <b>portable</b> <b>handset</b> that could {{be removed from the}} car. The cell-phone had an electro-luminescent Organic display with multiple colors available. The Mercedes-Benz Timeport phones were the only ones in the StarTac family to have the organic-luminescent display. (see also OLED) Another set of phones that the S-Class used were the Nokia 6150, Nokia 6210, Nokia 6310, and Nokia 6310i. These phones worked with S-Class equipped with D2B data communication system (another later system was the UHI).|$|E

40|$|With the {{evolution}} of 3 G wireless communications, the once benign thermal management requirements of <b>portable</b> <b>handset</b> design are quickly gaining potential for becoming long-term performance and safety roadblocks. The need for EMI shielding of plastic-housed handsets, particularly wireless devices, {{has long been known}} and met through a variety of methods. The most common approach to shielding at the plastic enclosure level is to apply a conductive coating on the housing’s interior surface. Methods for applying this conductive layer include; sprayed conductive paint, vacuum deposited metallization and electroless plating. However, none of these existing techniques address the designer’s thermal management challenges. A new method developed for applying a metallic conformal coating to plastic enclosures combines traditional EMI shielding performance with a heat-spreading material layer that provides an effective thermal management solution. Thermal performance data has been gathered for a typical power semiconductor component mounted to a plastic housing in a closed environment. The metallic conformal coating layer has been shown to lower both the junction temperature and the plastic enclosure temperature by as much as 30 °C. Key words: thermal management, EMI shielding...|$|E
50|$|Established in December 2003, TU Media Corp. {{introduced}} a new digital media service —satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB). Subscribers can now view satellite TV broadcasts on their <b>portable</b> <b>handsets</b> or via vehicle-mounted terminals. As of December 2006, subscribers to TU Media topped one million, up from 372,000 in 2005. Its nationwide DMB is available on 37 channels, consisting of 16 video, 20 audio and one data, and provides programs on education, games, drama, music, news and culture. In 2006, TU Media launched TUBOX, a pay-per-view movie channel that allows subscribers to see movies prior to DVD release. In addition to South Korea's 84 cities, TU Media provides service in express highways and Seoul metropolitan subways. DMB coverage was later expanded to include the Korea Train eXpress (KTX) Seoul to Busan line, Busan subways and 10 metropolitan Seoul local highways.In 2010 TU Media was merged with another subsidiary, SK Telink —Korea's leading international call service provider. DMB broadcasts ended two years later as it became uncompetitive in the mobile TV market.|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of PCS has necessitated the complete characterization of radio channels existing inside buildings. The indoor radio channel {{differs from the}} conventional mobile radio channel in two aspects. First of all the distances taken in account are a lot small, and then the inconsistency of the environment is much larger for a smaller range of distance between transmitter and receiver. Indoor use of wireless systems poses {{one of the major}} design challenges, as indoor radio (RF) propagation is essentially a complex phenomenon. In this paper we will try to emphasis on this odd subject and will try to compute and place boundaries for use of wireless systems within buildings at 900 MHz. There are many good system design tools which have been developed solely for ground mobile cellular systems. However, no proper design tools have been developed for both ground mobile communication and in-building communications operated within one cellular system. As cellular systems are operated today, in-building communication is provided by transmitting radio signals from cell sites so that they penetrate the building walls to reach <b>portable</b> <b>handsets</b> inside buildings. In-building communication is harder to perform on the reverse link (portable-to-base link) than the forward link. Du to this it is difficult to mathematically put the model for all telecommunication systems in a single equation so many model...|$|R

In addition, there is much emphasis by operators on consumer electronics devices such as Gaming consoles, MP3 players and similar devices. WiMAX is more similar to Wi-Fi than to other 3G cellular technologies.|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} and massively growing rate of usage of mobile phones {{around the world}} is leading to having over a billion people using their phones most days. Initially we had bag phones and car phones. Over 10 years ago we moved to <b>portable</b> <b>handsets</b> which originally were analogue phones and now most of the phones are digital. With the phone held against the ear the exposure of the head to modulated or digitally pulsed microwaves from the antenna, is very high. The head is a very sensitive bioelectromagnetic organ. Resonance, absorption and electrical interference are classical biophysics mechanisms. Cherry (2002) shows that natural electromagnetic radiation, the Schumann Resonance signal, when it is modulated by Solar Activity, is associated with modulation of human health effects, including cancer, cardiac, reproductive and neurological diseases and mortality, through the melatonin mechanism. The study also shows that similar elevated health effects are found in occupational studies of electrical workers and physiotherapists exposed to short wave and microwaves. Since the cellphone radiation from within 500 m from a cell site, exposes the people’s bodies to about a thousand to a million times higher, and the cellphone user’s heads to about a billion times higher exposure than the mean Schumann resonance signal, it is scientifically plausible that the same effects will be found from exposure to cellphone radiation. This review confirms that scientific studies show all these effects are associated with exposure to cellphone radiation. It is therefore scientifically plausible that these health effects will be found in populations living within the vicinity of cellphone sites and from using cellphones...|$|R
40|$|Direction Finding (DF) is {{a process}} that {{involves}} estimating the directions of the arrival (DOA) for propagating wavefronts impinging on an antenna array from arbitrary directions relative to that antenna array. GSM, the Global System for Mobile Communications is a mobile digital communications system which has rapidly gained acceptance on a global scale since the early 1990 s. Because of its popularity on a global scale, it would be desirable to investigate the feasibility of the detection and tracking of such signals as an extension for DF platforms that are used by monitoring authorities such as the police or service providers. This paper presents a correlative DF algorithm that is suitable for detecting and inferring DOAs for <b>portable</b> GSM <b>handsets.</b> The algorithm is applied to real datasets obtained in the field, the results of which are presented and discussed together with future work for the tracking of these handsets...|$|R
50|$|Although these {{batteries}} {{can be used}} in any {{device that}} supports a standard size (AA, AAA, C, D, etc.), they are formulated to last longest in periodical use items. This type of battery is better suited for use in low-drain devices such as remote controls or for devices that are used periodically such as flashlights, television remote control <b>handsets,</b> <b>portable</b> radios, etc. If they are discharged by less than 25%, they can be recharged for hundreds of cycles to about 1.42 V. If they are discharged by less than 50%, they can be almost fully recharged for a few dozen cycles, to about 1.32 V. After a deep discharge, they can be brought to their original high-capacity charge only after a few charge-discharge cycles.|$|R
