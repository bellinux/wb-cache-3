25|$|The Postal Index Number (PIN, or <b>PIN</b> <b>code)</b> is a six-digit code of post-office {{numbering}} introduced on 15 August 1972. There {{are nine}} PIN {{regions in the}} country; the first eight are geographical regions, and the ninth is reserved for the Army Postal Service (APS).|$|E
25|$|A {{postal code}} (also known locally in various English-speaking {{countries}} {{throughout the world}} as a postcode, post code, Eircode, <b>PIN</b> <b>Code</b> or ZIP Code) is a series of letters or digits or both, sometimes including spaces or punctuation, included in a postal address for the purpose of sorting mail.|$|E

25|$|Plex Home is {{a feature}} {{allowing}} to have advanced multi-users mode and fast switching between users. This feature is accessible from the Plex Web App. The first user of Plex is considered as the admin and can create, modify and remove other users. A maximum of 15 additional users can be created. If Plex Home is enabled, each app, device or tool {{communicating with the}} concerned Plex Media Server {{will need to be}} signed in a Plex Account and the server will have DLNA disabled. Each user can be customized, and managed with fine-grained access controls. A <b>PIN</b> <b>code</b> can be used to switch faster between accounts. Each users inherits the Plex Pass benefits from the admin. This feature is particularly convenient in a family when a member wants to watch a movie while another wants to watch another TV series episode for example.|$|E
25|$|The first {{distress}} call {{had been made}} just hours after beginning their hike: one from Kremers's iPhone at 04:39 pm and shortly after that, one from Froon's Samsung Galaxy at 04:51 pm. None of the calls had gone through {{due to a lack}} of reception in the area except for one 911 call attempt on April 3 that lasted for a little over a second before breaking up. After April 5, Froon's phone battery became exhausted after 05:00 am and was not used again. Kremers's iPhone would not make any more calls either but was intermittently turned on to search for reception. After April 6, multiple attempts of a false <b>PIN</b> <b>code</b> were entered into the iPhone; it never received the correct code again. One report showed that between the 7th and 10th of April, there were 77 emergency call attempts with the iPhone. On April 11, the phone was turned on at 10:51 am, and was turned off for the last time at 11:56 am.|$|E

30|$|This {{simplified}} setting naturally {{comes with}} limitations. First and concretely, {{the number of}} possible <b>PIN</b> <b>codes</b> for a typical smart card would of course be {{much larger than the}} 6 ones we investigate (e.g., 10, 000 for a 4 -digit PIN). In this respect, we first insist that the primary goal of the following experiments is to investigate the information leakages in EEG signals thoroughly, and this limited number of <b>PIN</b> <b>codes</b> allowed us to draw conclusions with good statistical confidence. Yet, we also note that this setting could be extended to a reasonable threat model. For example, one could target ≈ 1000 different users by repeatedly showing them ≈ 10 <b>PIN</b> <b>codes</b> among the 10, 000 possible ones and recover one PIN with good confidence. Second, and since the attacks we carry out essentially test familiar versus unfamiliar information, there is also a risk of false positives (e.g., an all zero code or a close to correct code). In this respect, our mitigation plan is to exploit statistical tools minimizing the number of false negatives, therefore potentially allowing enumeration among the most likely candidates [18].|$|R
40|$|Alarm {{systems with}} keypads, sensors and sirens protect our homes and {{commercial}} premises from intruders. The reliability {{of these systems}} has improved {{over the past years}} but the technology has remained largely as it was 3 decades ago. With simple keypads and generally 4 digit <b>PIN</b> <b>codes</b> used for setting and unsetting the alarms, the main protection against a determined intruder is the necessity to choose robust <b>PIN</b> <b>codes.</b> However, with <b>PIN</b> <b>codes</b> chosen that are generally easy to remember and therefore relatively easy to guess, or numbers chosen to follow a pattern on the keypad, the main protection from these systems lies in the ability to detect an intruder as they approach the keypad. This gives the intruder very little time to try multiple codes meaning the systems are secure because the intruder is detected quickly. This research looks at the choices of <b>PIN</b> <b>codes</b> and the patterns that they often follow, and sets out the forthcoming research that will look at circumventing the safeguards by performing computer driven attacks against the codes when access to the device is possible and when remote access to the device can be made over the telephone system. Additionally, the forensic evidence left behind by an attacker is discussed and how simple enhancements to systems can have significant advantages in enhancing the amount of evidence that can be found. This paper describes the preliminary findings from analysing 700 alarm codes used in alarm systems throughout New Zealand and describes the planned research into alarm system security and forensic evidence remaining after a successful attack by an intruder...|$|R

50|$|Smart-ID {{users can}} {{authenticate}} themselves by entering PIN-codes: PIN1 for authentication and PIN2 for digital signing of transactions. To get the <b>PIN</b> <b>codes,</b> user needs to download Smart-ID mobile application and register an account. This {{is done by}} authenticating with ID-card (currently only with Estonian, Lithuanian and Latvian ID-cards), Mobile-ID (currently only Lithuania and Estonia) or by e-banking. After successful registration, users are asked to choose PIN1 and PIN2 <b>codes.</b> Both <b>PIN</b> <b>codes</b> can be randomly generated or chosen by user. PIN1 has {{to be at least}} 4 digits long, PIN2 - at least 5 digits.Once registered, the Smart-ID account is active for three years. It can be renewed without cost at any time.Users can have several Smart-ID accounts on multiple devices. Smart-ID is available in English, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Russian.|$|R
