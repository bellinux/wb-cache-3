In currently used two-dimensional (2 D) cell culture systems, typical problems like morphological {{changes and the}} loss of liver cell-specific functions occur.

Isolated <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> were cultured on collagen-coated nanofibrous scaffolds for 7 days. Cell loading efficiency was quantified via DNA content measurement.

Our results indicate that <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> cultured on nanofibrous scaffolds revealed high viability and well-preserved glycogen storage.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} a toxic hybrid protein that is recognized by asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptors of cultured rat hepatocytes.

This conjugate is highly toxic, inhibiting protein synthesis in <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> at concentrations {{as low as}} 10 pM. The ASF-DTA conjugate was 600 and 1800 times as toxic as diphtheria toxin and DTA, respectively, on <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes.</b> The ASGP receptor recognizes galactose-terminated proteins. We tested a series of glycoproteins {{for their ability to}} block the action of the ASF-DTA conjugate. Fetuin and orosomucoid, two glycoproteins with terminal sialic acid on their oligosaccharide chains, did not block the action of the conjugate. Their galactose-terminated asialo derivatives, ASF and asialoorosomucoid, as expected, did block the action of the conjugate. The N-acetylglucosaminyl-terminated derivative (asialogalactoorsomucoid) had no appreciable effect on the activity of the conjugate. We tested the ASF-DTA conjugate on six cell types; except for <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes,</b> none of them were affected by a high concentration (10 nM) of ASF-DTA conjugate. A fetuin-DTA conjugate was less toxic by a factor of 300 than the ASF-DTA conjugate and exerted its effects primarily through non-receptor-mediated mechanisms.

Unsaturated fatty acids may offset the lipotoxicity associated with saturated fatty acids. Stearic acid induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and caused apoptotic and necrotic cell death in the <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes.</b> Methods Cell viability was investigated using MTT assay, and apoptosis was evaluated with Hoechst 33342 staining. Western blot {{analysis was used to}} examine the changes in the expression levels of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP 78), glucose regulated protein 94 (GRP 94), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Caspase- 3 activity was evaluated using a Caspase- 3 substrate kit. Results We have studied the ability of α-linolenic acid to prevent endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis of rat hepatocytes elicited by stearic acid and thapsigargin. Incubation of <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> for 16 h with stearic acid produced a significant increase in cell death. Stearic acid also increased levels of three indicators of ER stress [...] GRP 78, CHOP, and GRP 94. α-Linolenic acid distinctly reduced cell death and levels of all three indicators of ER stress brought about by stearic acid. Thapsigargin, which induces ER stress produced similar effects to those obtained using stearic acid; its effects were partly reversed by α-linolenic acid.

In this study, we investigated the effects of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (FA) on apoptosis in <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes.</b> Methods The <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> were treated with palmitic acid and/or α-linolenic acid in vitro. The expression of proteins associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, apoptosis, caspase- 3 levels were detected after the treatment. Results The treatment with palmitic acid produced {{a significant increase in}} cell death. The unfolded protein response (UPR) -associated genes CHOP, GRP 78, and GRP 94 were induced to higher expression levels by palmitic acid. Co-treatment with α-linolenic acid reversed the apoptotic effect and levels of all three indicators of ER stress exerted by palmitic acid. Tunicamycin, which induces ER stress produced similar effects to those obtained using palmitic acid; its effects were also reversed by α-linolenic acid.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{examined}} P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and function in cultured <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> {{in response to}} dexamethasone (DEX), which is known to modulate various liver functions.

Similarly, Western blotting analysis indicated high levels of P-gp in liver cells maintained in the absence of DEX. The use of mdr gene-specific probes allowed us to show that DEX-modulated P-gp induction in cultured hepatocytes involved mostly, if not specifically, mdrl gene regulation. Doxorubicin P-gp-mediated efflux analyses revealed lower intracellular doxorubicin accumulation in DEX-untreated liver cells than in DEX-treated cells, thus indicating that over-expressed P-gp was functional.

The Na(+) -dependent uptake of TC was inhibited by nine bile acids and five nonbile acid organic anions in a concentration-dependent manner, and their inhibitory effects were similar in both <b>primary</b> cultured <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> and Ntcp-transfected COS- 7 cells. BQ- 123 (1 microM) and indomethacin (10 microM), both of which exhibit no Ntcp-mediated transport, significantly inhibited the Na(+) -dependent uptake of TC mediated by Ntcp. In addition, the Na(+) -independent uptake of E(2) 17 betaG was inhibited by 15 organic anions in a concentration-dependent manner, and their inhibitory effects were similar between <b>primary</b> cultured <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> and oatp 1 -transfected COS- 7 cells. BQ- 123 (1 microM), pravastatin (1 microM), and indomethacin (10 microM), all of which do not undergo oatp 1 -mediated transport, significantly inhibited the Na(+) -independent uptake of E(2) 17 betaG mediated by oatp 1.

40|$|Mdrl-type P-glycoproteins mediate ATP-dependent {{elimination}} of various amphi-philic cations. Since intrinsic mdrl overexpression {{can contribute to}} chemotherapy resistance in tumour cells, {{it is important to}} elucidate endogenous mechanisms of mdr 1 gene regulation. In previous studies, <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> cultures have been characterized as a model for intrinsic mdrl overexpression, as they reveal intrinsic, time-dependent mdrlb up-regulation, which is due to transcriptional activation of the mdr 1 b gene. Using <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> cultures, we have formerly demonstrated that cyclooxygenase- 2 -dependent liberation of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) contributes to intrinsic mdrlb overexpression and that overexpression is further enhanced by the stable cAMP analogue 8 -Br-cAMP or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. Since stimulation of the PGE 2 -receptors EP 2 and EP 4 is associated with an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, we addressed the question whether these PGE 2 -receptors participate in intrinsic mdr 1 b gene activation. In the present study, <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> cultured with the specific EP 4 -receptor antagonist AH 23848 B indeed demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in intrinsic mdrlb mRNA overexpression (in Northern blot analyses). This decrease was maximal (~ 62 % inhibition) at 15 - 30 µM after 24 h of incubation. The potent EPl/EP 2 -receptor antagonist AH 6809 was less effective (~ 25 % inhibition at 5 - 10 µM). To further elucidate the signal transduction cascade leading to intrinsic, PGE 2 -receptor-mediated mdr 1 b gene activation, we focussed on cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and PKA-associated transcription factors. Transient transfection assays with <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> cultures were performed, using a luciferase reporter gene, controlled by 1264 bp of the mdr 1 b gene 5 '-flanking region (- 1074 to + 150 bp). The high intrinsic mdrlb promoter activity in this system could be markedly decreased by overexpression (via transfection of expression vectors) of a PKA-inhibitor protein (pPKI) or of a dominant negative mutant of the cAMP responsive element (CRE) -binding protein (KCREB). KCREB co-transfected cells exhibited luciferase activities of ~ 45 % of control cells. In conclusion, these data suggest that stimulation of the EP 4 -receptor, cAMP-dependent activation of PKA, and CREB or factors which are able to dimerize with CREB contribute to intrinsic mdr 1 b gene overexpression in <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> cultures...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe have {{previously}} shown that <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> treatment by n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3) gave opposite results concerning early ethanol cytotoxicity (only a 5 -hours-intoxication period) {{depending on the}} tested omega 3 type. The {{aim of this study}} was to follow on experiments in other in vitro and in vivo models that allowed longer intoxication times with ethanol. When highly differentiated hepatocytes from WIF-B 9 line were treated with ethanol for 4 days, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) protected from ethanol-induced cell death and oxidative stress, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) increased ethanol toxic effects. In vivo, Zebrafish larvae exhibited a similar behavior after 7 days of ethanol intoxication depending on the omega 3 introduced in the bath. Altogether, these data confirm differential effects for omega 3 s even for longer exposure times with ethanol...|$|R
40|$|Quinones are {{believed}} to induce their toxicity by two main mechanisms: oxygen activation by redox cycling and alkylation of essential macromolecules. The physicochemical parameters that underlie this activity have not been elucidated, although redox potential is believed to play a significant role. In this study, we have evaluated the cytotoxicity, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the glutathione (GSH) depleting ability of 14 p-benzoquinone congeners in <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> and PC 12 cell cultures. All experiments were performed under identical conditions (37 C, 5 %CO 2 /air) in 96 -well plates. The most cytotoxic quinone {{was found to be}} tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (chloranil), and the least toxicwas duroquinone or 2, 6 -di-tert-butyl-p-benzoqui-none. The cytotoxic order varied between the cell types, and in particular, the di-substituted methoxy or methyl p-benzoquinones were particularly more cytotoxic towards PC 12 cells. We hav...|$|R
40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} (mdr) proteins of the mdr 1 type {{function as}} multispecific xenobiotic transporters in hepatocytes. In the liver, mdr 1 overexpression occurs during regeneration, cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinogenesis and {{may contribute to}} primary chemotherapy resistance. Cultured rat hepatocytes exhibit a time-dependent "intrinsic" increase in functional mdr 1 b expression, which depends on cyclooxygenase-catalyzed prostaglandin E(2) release. In the present study, the prostaglandin E (EP) receptor agonist misoprostol (1 - 10 mug/ml) further enhanced intrinsic mdr 1 b mRNA expression in <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes.</b> On the other hand, [1 alpha(z), 2 beta, 5 alpha]-(+) - 7 -[5 -[1, 1 '-(biphenyl) - 4 -yl]methoxy]- 2 -(4 -morpholin yl) - 3 -oxocyclopentyl]- 4 -heptenoic acid (AH 23848 B) (30 muM), an antagonist of the cAMP-coupled EP 4 receptor, and the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, N-(2 -[bromocinnamylamino]ethyl) - 5 -isoquinolinesulfonamide (H 89) (10 nM), repressed intrinsic mdr 1 b mRNA up-regulation, whereas the stable cAMP analog 8 -bromo-cAMP (10 muM) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX) (100 muM) further enhanced intrinsic mdr 1 b expression. <b>Primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes,</b> transiently transfected with reporter gene constructs controlled by mdr 1 b 5 '-gene-flanking regions [- 1074 to + 154 base pairs (bp) or - 250 to + 154 bp], demonstrated pronounced mdr 1 b promoter activity, already without the addition of exogenous modulators. Nevertheless, activity was further stimulated by misoprostol, 8 -bromo-cAMP, or IBMX. Cotransfection with expression vectors for PKI, an inhibitor protein of cAMP-dependent PKA, or KCREB, a dominant-negative mutant of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), decreased high-intrinsic mdr 1 b promoter activity. KCREB also counteracted misoprostol-induced mdr 1 b promoter activation. In conclusion, these data provide evidence for a pivotal role of EP receptor-stimulated, cAMP-dependent activation of PKA and CREB or CREB-related proteins in mdr 1 b gene activation in <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes.</b> Thus, these data might offer potential new target structures for the reversal of primary drug resistance, for example, of liver tumors...|$|E

40|$|Over 350 {{million people}} are chronically {{infected}} with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and {{a significant number of}} chronically infected individuals develop primary liver cancer. HBV encodes seven viral proteins, including the nonstructural X (HBx) protein. The results of studies with immortalized or transformed cells and with HBx-transgenic mice demonstrated that HBx can interact with mitochondria. However, no studies with normal hepatocytes have characterized the precise mitochondrial localization of HBx or the effect of HBx on mitochondrial physiology. We have used cultured <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> as a model system to characterize the mitochondrial localization of HBx and the effect of HBx expression on mitochondrial physiology. We now show that a fraction of HBx colocalizes with density-gradient-purified mitochondria and associates with the outer mitochondrial membrane. We also demonstrate that HBx regulates mitochondrial membrane potential in hepatocytes and that this function of HBx varies depending on the status of NF-κB activity. In <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocytes,</b> HBx activation of NF-κB prevented mitochondrial membrane depolarization; however, when NF-κB activity was inhibited, HBx induced membrane depolarization through modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Collectively, these results define potential pathways through which HBx may act in order to modulate mitochondrial physiology, thereby altering many cellular activities and ultimately contributing to the development of HBV-associated liver cancer...|$|E

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that {{the expression of the}} peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) is regulated by glucocorticoid hormones in hepatocytes. Hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone stimulated PPAR alpha mRNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner in <b>primary</b> <b>rat</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> cultures. This glucocorticoid stimulation was inhibited by RU 486, a specific glucocorticoid antagonist. Moreover, in contrast to glucocorticoid hormones, the mineralocorticoid aldosterone had only a weak effect, suggesting that the hormonal stimulation of PPAR alpha was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. The induction was not prevented by cycloheximide treatment of the hepatocytes, indicating that it was mediated by preexisting glucocorticoid receptor. Finally, the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D abolished the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone, and nuclear run-on analysis showed an increase of PPAR alpha transcripts after hormonal induction. Thus, the PPAR alpha gene is an early response gene of glucocorticoids that control its expression at the transcriptional level...|$|R
