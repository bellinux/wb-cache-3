5|$|In the 1970s, Dormand {{had opposed}} left-wing {{infiltration}} into the Labour Party, and in foreign affairs, he was pro-American and pro-NATO {{at a time}} when the party's left-wing was becoming increasingly hostile to both. In October 1981, Dormand stood for the vacant position of Chairman of the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> supported by the centre-Right Manifesto Group of Labour MPs. The strength of the left-wing in the Constituency Labour Parties at the time had spurred the Manifesto group to improve its organisation, and Dormand (nominated by former Prime Minister James Callaghan) defeated the main challenger, left-wing MP Ian Mikardo by 102 votes to 65, and Mikardo then withdrew. The other three candidates were Harry Ewing (22 votes), Willie Hamilton (11 votes) and Frank Hooley (11 votes) but all withdrew so no second ballot was held. Dormand held the chairmanship until he retired from the House of Commons in 1987.|$|E

25|$|In May 1946, Moyle was {{appointed}} as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, following Geoffrey de Freitas {{who had been}} given a ministerial post. The appointment gave Moyle a central role in managing relations between Attlee and government backbenchers, and almost silenced him in the chamber of the House of Commons. Attlee gave his PPS access to almost all important decisions, and respected Moyle's advice on the sometimes fractious <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

He considered standing as a candidate himself but eventually deferred to Michael Foot who was eventually elected (against expectations). Due to a resignation, Heffer was briefly promoted {{to be a member of}} the Shadow Cabinet in October–November 1980. Foot made Heffer spokesman on Europe and Community Affairs from November.|$|E

Forty members of the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> condemned Bevan's appointment.|$|E
25|$|After Labour {{lost the}} election, Heffer {{ran for the}} Shadow Cabinet again and {{finished}} as the runner-up.

He was an important link between the National Executive and the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party.</b> Heffer did endorse the policy of forcing Labour Members of Parliament to seek reselection from their constituency parties, although he wanted the vote to involve all members rather than the 'General Management Committee' which comprised only activists.|$|E

Commentary at the time reflected an opinion that this was a belated agreement to central government funding of the project by the ruling National Party, while the main opposition <b>parliamentary</b> <b>parties</b> (<b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> Greens and NZ First) had all been promising immediate construction timetables which were more closely aligned to the plans of the Council.|$|R

His resignation ensured that his successor would be elected by MPs only. After a campaign that laid bare the deep internal divisions of the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> Michael Foot narrowly defeated Denis Healey on 10 November {{in the second round of}} the election to succeed Callaghan as party leader. Foot had been a relatively late entrant to the contest and his decision to stand ended the chances of Peter Shore.|$|E
