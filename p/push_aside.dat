5|$|Mourning doves eat almost {{exclusively}} seeds, {{which make up}} more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine gravel or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for canola, corn, millet, safflower, and sunflower seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.|$|E
25|$|Bison are nomadic grazers, {{wandering}} high on Yellowstone's grassy plateaus in summer. Despite their slow gait, bison {{are surprisingly}} fast for animals that {{weigh more than}} half a ton. In winter, they use their large heads like a plow to <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> snow and find winter food. In the park interior where snows are deep, they winter in thermally influenced areas and around the geyser basins. Bison also move to winter range {{in the northern part of}} Yellowstone.|$|E

He has been touted several times as a potential Atlantic Canadian minister in the cabinets of Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin. He expressed some interest in running in the 2004 federal election but announced he would not do so {{because of the lack of}} an available riding in the Moncton, New Brunswick, area. He did not want to <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> any incumbent Liberal member of Parliament.|$|E

500|$|Tesla never married, {{explaining}} that his chastity was {{very helpful to}} his scientific abilities. He once said in earlier years that he felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. His opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant. This [...] "new woman" [...] was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power. In {{an interview with the}} Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, [...] "In place of the soft voiced, gentle woman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind... The tendency of women to <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me". Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{received}} generally negative {{reviews for}} her portrayal. Jamey Giddens of Zap2it {{wrote of the}} decision to sign Francis onto the series: [...] "Maria Arena Bell just made Brian Frons kick a puppy in the face." [...] After her debut, he called Francis' portrayal of Genevieve [...] "embarrassingly-bad", stating: [...] "I'm sure I will catch hell for going here about a daytime treasure, but Francis' portrayal of Cane and Caleb's (Daniel Goddard) unhinged mother has been cartoonish and abysmal from her first air show. I don't know if Francis is painfully attempting to channel the late Elizabeth Taylor’s fun, campy turn as Luke and Laura's arch nemesis Helena Cassadine on General Hospital 30 years ago, or going for Evil-Lyn from the old He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, but she's missing the mark either way." [...] He also wrote that as much as he would [...] "love to solely blame this performance on the writing—because let’s face it, the story is dreadful—Francis is the one making the choices to jerk, gasp and wince as Genevieve registers each and every emotion or painful memory. This is not the Genie Francis we know and love." [...] Adam Hughes of Yahoo! wrote of viewers' reactions to Francis' debut and her portrayal, stating: [...] "Since Francis arrived on the scene this spring, fan reaction to her revised on-screen attitude has been a mixed bag, but she continues to draw a ton of interest to her new CBS television digs. Former General Hospital followers may find her more biting character hard to swallow, and longtime fans of The Young and The Restless have watched her <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> some of their favorites, but Francis has undoubtedly shaken up the local landscape. Buzz is half the game when comes to keeping soap opera fans interested, and Francis has certainly delivered that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prairie farmers {{had always}} {{believed}} that they were being exploited by Toronto and Montreal. [...] What they lacked was a prophet who would lead them to the promised land, one who promised, despite the UFA's misgivings, to <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> the existing economic and constitutional barriers to the fight for Social Credit. The Social Credit movement in Alberta found its leader in 1932 when Aberhart read his first Social Credit tract; it became a political party in 1935 and burned like a prairie fire. It was elected to majority government on August 22, 1935.|$|E
2500|$|Linkin Park {{released}} {{their third}} studio album Minutes to Midnight on May 15, 2007 in the United States. For this album, the band strayed {{away from the}} style of nu metal style they had perfected in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, and developed an entirely new sound. For Delson, this meant experimenting with different guitars and amps, both new and vintage. It also meant he needed to <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> his disinclination for guitar solos, which are featured in tracks such as [...] "Shadow of the Day", [...] "What I've Done", [...] "In Pieces" [...] and [...] "The Little Things Give You Away".|$|E

In addition, soldiers in two Army transports followed the flotilla. General Sherman himself was with the troops. The gunboats got through Steele's Bayou and Black Bayou {{by the end of}} the second day, and there Sherman overtook them. He saw that the overgrowth would be a serious obstacle; while the armored gunboats could <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> the limbs in their path, the smokestacks and upper works of the flimsier transports would be severely battered. Nevertheless, Porter decided to push on, and Sherman returned to bring up the rest of his soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, Akhmetov {{acted as}} an {{assistant}} to Akhat Bragin, whom law enforcement agencies regarded as a powerful crime boss; allegedly in the illegal cloth trading business. Andrew Wilson, a scholar specializing in Ukrainian politics, categorized Akhmetov as a former 'enforcer' and 'leader' of [...] " [...] Bragin's 'Tatar' clan", responsible for the use of [...] "mafia methods to <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> the 'red directors' of the [...] (IUD)". By the early 1990s, Akhmetov began acquiring property in Donetsk allegedly by means of extortion with the assistance of Volodymyr Malyshev, Lieutenant-General of The Head of Ministry of Internal Affairs Department in Donetsk Oblast. Malyshev, now a member of Ukraine's Parliament on the committee controlling law enforcement, is accused by Kuzin of using his position to do away with previously existing police records concerning Akhmetov shortly before becoming chief of security for Akhmetov's company. [...] "In , Akhmetov was very different – he was totally private with no public persona, and was trying to find ways to deal with his 'difficult past'", noted U.S. ambassador William Taylor, citing prominent Ukrainian businessman Serhiy Taruta.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 December, Morsi {{supporters}} and anti-Morsi demonstrators continued their protests in different cities including Cairo, Alexandria, and Assiut. Demonstrators in Assiut chanted [...] "No Brotherhood, no Salafis, Egypt is a civic state." [...] Dozens of protesters threw rocks and glass bottles at Morsi's home in Sharkia province {{and tried to}} <b>push</b> <b>aside</b> a police barrier. Advisers and Brotherhood leaders acknowledged that outside his core base of Islamist supporters Morsi felt increasingly isolated {{in the political arena}} and even within his own government. Opposition leaders {{said in a statement that}} Morsi's 6 December dialogue offer failed to meet [...] "the principles of real and serious negotiations" [...] and displayed [...] "the complete disregard" [...] for the opposition's demands. They said they would not negotiate with Morsi until he cancels his 22 November decree and calls off the 15 December referendum on the draft constitution. Opposition protesters marched on the presidential palace and breached a security perimeter built by the military's elite Republican Guard – charged with protecting the palace – which withdrew behind the palace walls. The Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm also reported that individuals suspected of protesting against the Muslim Brotherhood were being tortured and beaten in a facility run by the Brotherhood in Heliopolis, a Cairo suburb.|$|E
