40|$|M. Comm. (Business Management) The {{general purpose}} of this study is to {{determine}} the factors that lead to the motivation of Call Centre staff within a financial institution. This research is conducted in an effort to build upon the current knowledge base on the subject of motivation. The research describes the different models of motivation, and how these models can be applied to a new, younger generation of Call Centre agents. The presentation and discussion of the framework allow for a meaningful interpretation of the research conducted. An understanding of how to motivate Call Centre Agents will address the gaps that currently exist in the literature, and provide an educated link between theory and practice. The research conducted in this dissertation is qualitative and consists of in-depth interviews within the Internet banking Call Centre teams within a financial institution. The sample consisted of 40 agents in an Internet Banking Call Centre. The findings revealed that the factors most highly associated with increased levels of motivation were a strong identification with the organisation, the frequency and method of training and communication that took place in the Call Centre, and an organisation‟s ability to grow its employees displaying a strong predictor for increased job satisfaction and turnover intentions. A rejuvenation model is introduced, allowing for the identification of root cause analysis from the customer queries. Agents would make up part of the project teams that would manage the project and make improvements. A continual cycle of problem identification and resolution should lead to an increased learning opportunity for agents, as well as increased benefits for the organisation. These benefits would be realised in terms of increased staff retention due to the increased levels of motivation, improved customer service and an improved, <b>proactive</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Centre,</b> which could be the leader in service delivery...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the management of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity by identifying the factors that contribute to lack of knowledge and low productivity levels in a service <b>call</b> <b>centre.</b> This research investigated measures that are required to manage productivity, factors that affect <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity, as well as the knowledge required to manage productivity in a service <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> effectively. In-depth case study research was conducted through document analysis and a questionnaire process, in order to gain insight into how lack of knowledge can affect the management of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity. The document analysis was done on operations reports from January 2011 to October 2015. The questionnaire results are a summary of 19 service <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> staff working for the same organisation representing agents, team leaders and managers. The results from the document analysis suggest that only 50 % of the current <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity management processes are similar to those recommended in the literature. The questionnaire results suggest that there is a knowledge gap across all staff in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> when it comes to knowledge required to manage productivity efficiently. The results show that 55 % of the agents and 54 % of the team leaders require training on <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> knowledge and processes that improve <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity. The combined results from both the document analysis and the questionnaire show that <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> staff do not have enough knowledge to improve current <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity. Training is recommended as the solution to the knowledge gap identified. The two types of training that are recommended for <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> staff is formal <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> qualification training, as well as on-the-job training i. e. job mentorship and job rotation for all <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> staff.

40|$|Teams are an {{enduring}} feature of <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> The literature highlights {{the multitude of}} different tasks performed by teams in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> context. In terms of service work teams are probably more prevalent in <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> than in other industry. However, the nature and function of teams can vary across <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> and even within the same <b>call</b> <b>centre.</b> One feature of teams in <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> that has not received much attention, and what differentiates <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> teams from other industries, is that teams are present in small <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> with less than 100 employees. The discussion of teams in the management literature is generally associated with productivity enhancement in large manufacturing organisations; especially around high performance work systems.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. <b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> are {{typically}} {{characteristic of a}} highly repetitive, monotonous, and low skilled nature of work, which has resulted in low levels of job satisfaction, dissatisfaction or no satisfaction for <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> representatives. This has been the motivating factor in determining if a relationship exists between <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> representatives’ job satisfaction and their locus of control orientation. A sample of 103 <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> representatives from a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> in KwaZulu-Natal participated in this research. The results of the research {{suggest that there is}} no significant relationship between <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> representatives’ job satisfaction and their locus of control orientation. The findings suggest that irrespective of a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> representative’s locus of control orientation, the nature of work in a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> itself is such that it leads low levels of job satisfaction, dissatisfaction and no satisfaction. The results further suggest that there is no relationship between <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> representatives’ job satisfaction, gender, qualifications and tenure. Similarly, no relationship has been found between <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> representatives’ locus of control orientation, gender, qualifications and tenure.

40|$|Employment in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> {{sector in}} the Netherlands, similar to the trend in other European countries, is {{expanding}} greatly. In 2001, Datamonitor (2002) estimated that 1, 266 <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> were operating in the Netherlands. This number {{is expected to have}} risen to roughly 2, 000 in 2006. An estimated 188, 000 people work in this sector at the moment, representing 2. 5 % of the entire working population in the Netherlands. This represents the highest percentage in Europe with the exception of Ireland. The <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> workforce is employed by in-house and subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> In-house <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are part of the firm for which they handle customer contacts, whereas subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> which provide customer contact services for other firms or institutions. The <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector features a large number of employees working in so-called atypical employment contracts, in particular ‘agents’ who handle the actual customer contacts (De Grip, Hoevenberg & Willems, 1997). Agents are often hired into temporary appointments, part-time contracts, irregular shifts, stand-by contracts, et cetera. The use of such atypical contracts is closely related to the great need for flexibility in the deployment of staff (Kalleberg, 2000). Such workforce flexibility is necessary in order to negotiate peaks and valleys in call volumes. In addition, many <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> prioritize on cost reduction, and this approach constrains investment in personnel. <b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> are therefore often classified as ‘electronic sweatshops’ offering only ‘dead-end jobs’ (Taylor, et al., 2002; Deery & Kinnie, 2004). The labour market for <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents could thus be characterised as a ‘secondary labour market’ of insecure, poorly paid jobs without any career opportunities (see e. g. Dekker, De Grip & Heijke, 2002). However, the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector is heterogeneous with respect to employment conditions. For example, agents who work in in-house <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> have better employment conditions than their counterparts in subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> The Dutch industrial relations system offers one explanation for this difference. Agents working in in-house <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> have protections defined by the collective labour agreement (CLA) of the firm the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents work in. In contrast, the subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> did not have any comparable protections or their own CLA until 2003. The establishment of a CLA that covers agents employed in Dutch subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in 2003 is a unique phenomenon in the European <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> market (Roland, 2000 b). The difference in working conditions between in-house and subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> raises the following research question addressed in this paper: To what extent is the labour market for <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents a dual labour market, with a secondary segment in the subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> and a primary segment {{in the form of a}} ‘professional labour market’ in the in-house call centres?To answer this question, we analyze survey data collected from a national survey of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> managers in the Netherlands. Moreover, we investigate whether the aforementioned need for workforce flexibility may provide an explanation for the labour market segmentation in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector and if this segmentation is embedded in Dutch industrial relations. We begin with a brief overview of labour market segmentation theory. Next, we describe the dataset, and provide some brief background about the Dutch <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector and its workforce. Then, we investigate the differences between employment conditions in in-house and subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> to determine whether there is a segmented labour markets. Finally, we assess the influence of industrial relations in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector, and determine whether these reflect the labour market segmentation. education, training and the labour market;...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. (Business Management) The {{statement}} at {{the core}} of the thesis is that the success of the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> depends on a strategic benefits model. The search for the proof will be conducted within the systems theory framework. The <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> is depicted as a micro system of the bigger organisation. This micro system is influenced by external factors. Factors that are external to the organisation and factors that are external to the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> but forms part of the rest of the organisation. Systems have internal processes that deliver specific outputs, therefore the saying that the system is perfectly engineered for the results it achieves. The <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> has internal processes to deliver certain outputs. This study tries to identify what internal processes will have an impact on a strategic benefits model for the success of the <b>call</b> <b>centre.</b> 3 Systems theory is known to have feedback loops. The <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> operation should have similar feedback loops. <b>Call</b> <b>centre</b> feedback is received from three different perspectives, that of the customer, the employees and management.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. <b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> form an {{increasingly}} {{important part of the}} modern day business environment and perform {{an important role in the}} strategic and operational aspects of organisations. <b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> have emerged and developed to provide efficient and cost effective communication channels between organisations and their customers. <b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> are often the largest or only channel used to access customers or for customers to access organisations. Early <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> were seen as cost centres and operated in a similar manner, often resulting in poor and unsatisfactory performance. Modern <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are being approached in a different way. They are aligned with the strategic objectives of the organisation and are seen as performance centres and revenue drivers. Modern <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are dynamic and complex organisations, both technologically and operationally. Performance objectives are often conflicting and controlling parameters have to be finely balanced in a volatile environment. It is therefore imperative to utilise <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> effectively and efficiently. This can only be achieved by a structured and scientific operations research based approach. The research was initiated by the requirement of a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> design and implementation as part of a larger business process reengineering project. The thesis provides an overview of the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> environment and operational aspects. A structured <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> design model is reviewed and two aspects namely workforce management and performance management are found to form the core of the design and operations activities. The <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> design model is then integrated with the proposed workforce management and performance management models.

This project aimed to develop and pilot a standardised evaluation framework to assess Marie Stopes International reproductive health <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> Methods: Consultations were held with staff from the 14 existing international <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> to gauge current monitoring and evaluation processes, identify gaps, and establish evaluation needs. The draft framework was then piloted in the Marie Stopes Mexico <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> using client and provider surveys, mystery callers and a review of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> records. Results: A flexible framework was developed to allow <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> to measure the effectiveness of services offered. Nineteen indicators were developed to assess access, equity, quality and efficiency. The pilot found pre-defined ranges for indicators of access were not appropriate for a high-functioning <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> that was already achieving nearly 100 % compliance. Several indicators could not be measured {{due to a lack}} of routine data collection systems. Conclusions: A standardised evaluation framework will allow comparisons over time and between <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in different countries.

40|$|The authors {{contribute}} to the developing literature on <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> by providing detailed empirical evidence on the spatial unevenness {{in the distribution of}} <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> activity. They argue that the driving forces of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> growth, whether as the rationalisation of back-office functions or as entirely new entities, have been corporate strategy and the pursuit of low-cost competitive advantage. Thus, although technological developments at the heart of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> operations render them relatively 'footloose' in locational terms, the search for specific characteristics makes certain regions (and parts of regions) more attractive than others. By using a sample database of <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> the authors describe the characteristics of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in the United Kingdom in terms of size, sector, and spatial distribution. They then attempt to explain the determinants of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> location at the county level through a multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that there is a propensity to site <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> close to existing concentrations of allied activity, with preferences for densely populated areas mediated by needs to maintain employee access and avoid staff turnover problems. This has important implications for the spatial division of labour, with <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> growth likely to reinforce existing spatial unevenness in employment in key service activities. The authors conclude by considering the implications of these findings for contemporary urban and regional development, as well as providing a number of suggestions for future research. ...|$|R

Some <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are transformed processing centres where workforces have had to be re-trained as customer service representatives, (CSRs), while other <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are totally new ‘greenfield sites’. This article analyses the implications of transforming a previously existing service <b>centre</b> into a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> as compared to constructing a new ‘green field’ facility, using a comparative study of two <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> branches. The main focus is on the reception that HR initiatives are accorded in a brownfield and greenfield <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> site by the CSRs who staff the phones and computers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Call</b> <b>centre</b> {{development}} has been extensive and ongoing across the industrial world. These developments have resulted from an ongoing process of consolidation and restructuring of service work that has been facilitated by the continuing application of information and communication technology (ICT) to production in the service sector. Thus far, the academic discussion of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> {{has been dominated by}} labour processes, particularly in the private sector. Meanwhile, there has been an extensive and growing use of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> to deliver public services. Hence, this article draws on secondary data, policy documents and registered workplace agreements to examine employment related issues in Australian public sector <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> while comparing these issues with those found in private sector <b>call</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> {{have been}} {{described}} as &# 039;electronic sweatshops&# 039; and &# 039;slave galleons of the twenty first century&# 039; and, contrarily as progressive, team based and career fulfilling work environments. Drawing on data from a survey of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> managers in Australia, it is shown that there are elements of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> management with practices from both extremes of the descriptive continuum and in some instances these elements coexist in the one <b>centre.</b> Whilst <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are managed {{with a high level of}} control and the work of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents is subject to intense scrutiny and monitoring, the simplistic notion that they are electronic sweatshops, or that the metaphor of the Panopticon applies, is rejected...|$|R
40|$|As {{businesses}} restructure {{their operations}} {{the number of}} <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> is growing through ICT developments. Indeed the ACTU (2002) have argued that <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are well placed to represent an e-commerce gateway for many companies. The scale, nature, organization and operation of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> is extremely diverse (Burgess and Connell, 2004) although they share {{the ability to be}} organized on a continuous operational basis, they are highly dependent upon ICT platforms and <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> work is capable of being subject to extensive control and surveillance. While research has generated many bleak stories of the work experience in <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> with reference to 20 th century workhouses (Callaghan and Thompson, 2001), there are also examples of high levels of job satisfaction combined with job commitment (Kinnie et al, 2001). Kjellerup (2004) has referred to two types of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> as being either ‘The Galley Slave Model’ or the ‘Coaching Culture Model’. We propose it is time to search for a new management model for <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> that is not at one or other end of the continuum but perhaps somewhere in the middle. For this paper the authors have focused on work in the context of two small-medium sized <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> – with between 50 and 150 seats. This is because much of the research to date has focused on large <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> with several hundred operatives. As a result in our search for a different management model we intend to look beyond the most commonly examined locations. The purpose of the paper is to first outline the nature and dimensions of the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> industry in Australia before analysing the drivers of organizational and workplace change in the industry. Next, we consider the substantive job quality issues that surround <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> work. The paper then considers the findings from structured focus groups with operatives and team leaders in the featured Australian <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in order to determine how the role of management may impact on employee’s perceptions of job quality, commitment and fairness given the drive to increase productivity in the current economic climate. We conclude by proposing a typology for <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> management...|$|R
