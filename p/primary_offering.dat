25|$|When {{a company}} lists its {{securities}} {{on a public}} exchange, the money paid by the investing public for then newly issued shares goes directly to the company (<b>primary</b> <b>offering)</b> {{as well as to}} any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings (secondary offerings) as part of the larger IPO. An IPO, therefore, allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth, repayment of debt, or working capital. A company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their shares. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the IPO process, the IPO represents an opportunity to monetize their investment. After the IPO, once shares trade in the open market, investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market, or sell a large block of shares directly to the public, at a fixed price, through a secondary market offering. This type of offering is not dilutive, since no new shares are being created.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of "underpricing " {{has been established}} {{by a number of}} empirical studies in the case of common stock initial public offerings (CSIPOs). The after-market prices of such common stocks have consistently been found to be higher than their corresponding offering prices. However, these papers appear to have concentrated on examining the underpricing in the case of CSIPOs as a whole even though, in practice, there are three types of <b>offerings</b> viz. pure <b>primary</b> <b>offerings,</b> mixed offerings, and pure secondary offerings. This study is motivated by the results of two studies. From the results, it may be inferred that a possibility exists of there being differences in the extent of underpricing for the different types of offerings. This study shows that the level of underpricing is about the same based on one-day excess returns. However, based on one-month excess returns, mixed offerings have a higher level of underpricing as compared to pure <b>primary</b> <b>offerings</b> at a 15 % level of significance. It appears that the market does not appear to consider mixed offerings to be substantially more risky than pure <b>primary</b> <b>offerings...</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{are proposing}} {{to amend the}} {{eligibility}} requirements of Form S- 3 and Form F- 3 to allow domestic and foreign private issuers to conduct <b>primary</b> securities <b>offerings</b> on these forms {{without regard to the}} size of their public float or the rating of debt they are offering, so long as they satisfy the other eligibility conditions of the respective form and do not sell more than the equivalent of 20 % of their public float in <b>primary</b> <b>offerings</b> pursuant to the new instructions on these forms over any period of 12 calendar months. The amendments are intended to allow more companies to benefit from the greater flexibility and efficiency in accessing the public securities markets afforded by Form S- 3 and Form F- 3 without compromising investor protection. The proposal would not extend to shell companies, however, which would be prohibited from using Form S- 3 and Form F- 3 for <b>primary</b> <b>offerings</b> until 12 calendar months after they cease being shell companies.
