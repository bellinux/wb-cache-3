The first came on a 20-yard AJ McCarron pass to Kevin Norwood and the second on a seven-yard Altee Tenpenny run.

Because of the lack of a reciprocal right between the U.S. and other countries, American performing artists are unable to collect on revenue generated from non-domestic airplay, an inequity likely to be ameliorated with the passage of performance rights legislation in the U.S.|$|E

Payments from these organizations to performing artists are known as residuals and performance royalties. Royalty-free music provides more direct compensation to the artists. In 1999, recording artists formed the Recording Artists' Coalition to repeal supposedly [...] "technical revisions" [...] to American copyright statutes which would have classified all [...] "sound recordings" [...] as [...] "works for hire", effectively assigning artists' copyrights to record labels.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1995, SRCOs in the United States did {{not have}} a {{performance}} right; that is, recording companies and performing artists were not entitled to receive payment for the public performance of their sound recordings. The Digital <b>Performance</b> <b>Right</b> in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 together granted a <b>performance</b> <b>right</b> for sound recordings. As a result, copyright law now requires that users of music pay the copyright owner of the sound recording for the public performance of that music via certain kinds of digital transmissions. In 2000 a court decision ruled that this did not exempt any type of webcasters from the royalties, ensuring all forms of webcasters would pay royalties to the recording artists for the songs they played.|$|E
