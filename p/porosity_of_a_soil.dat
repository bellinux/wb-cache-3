40|$|X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray µCT) was {{employed}} to characterize vertical variations of structural <b>porosity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>soil</b> profile (pore dimension higher than 5. 103 µm 3). Three distinct horizons of a Cambisol have been studied for a total depth of 75 cm: L, S 1 /S 2 and S 2 /SFe horizons. Samples have been cored in situ by driving in PVC tubes (inner diameter 10 cm). From reconstructed and filtered volumes, pores segmentation allows to study variations of structural porosity within the profile. Two kinds of porosity were identified: biological pores (tube-like) and physical pores (fracture-like). Structural porosity content varies strongly according to the horizons: from 5. 48 % in the L horizon to 6. 48 % in the S 1 /S 2 horizon. The 3 D connectivity of both of these pore types was also assessed. During sampling, soil shearing induced damages around the cores. Identification and quantification of the damaged zone was performed from the calculation of porosity profile from core surface to core heart. In average, the damaged zone reaches a depth of 1 cm. Porosity loss (compaction) or porosity increase (fracturing) was observed according to the studied profile...|$|E

40|$|The present {{practice}} of reporting site investigations {{in areas of}} cohesionless soils, for roads, railways and canals in particular, is to produce <b>a</b> large number <b>of</b> particle size distribution curves. The value and meaning of such information is limited. To the Client it demonstrates that trial pits were dug and the soil was sieved, whilst to most engineers a well graded material signifies high stability and a uniformly graded one, low stability. This thesis examines cohesionless <b>soil</b> as <b>a</b> particulate system with the object <b>of</b> establishing <b>a</b> method <b>of</b> interpreting, in <b>an</b> engineering context, a particle size distribution; the simplest test carried out in routine site investigations. Fundamental to a particulate system is the interaction of its particles and this is dependent upon their packing.

Using published results <b>of</b> <b>porosity,</b> shape and particle size distribution <b>a</b> simplified method <b>of</b> determining the minimum <b>porosity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cohesionless <b>soil</b> has been developed.

40|$|The {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> compacted <b>soil</b> liner {{is partly}} <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> the <b>porosity,</b> {{which is important}} because the transport of materials through the liner occurs via the pore space. This project studies the pore spaces of compacted soil materials to estimate the effective porosity, which is {{the portion of the}} pore space where the most rapid transport of leachate occurs. Pore space of three soil materials, till, loess. and paleosol, was studied by using mercury intrusion porosimetry, water absorption, and image analysis. These analyses provided cumulative porosity curves from which the pore size distribution of soil samples were estimated. Theory was developed to estimate the effective <b>porosity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> compacted <b>soil</b> material based upon <b>a</b> model <b>of</b> its pore size distribution and pore continuity. The effective <b>porosities</b> <b>of</b> compacted till. loess. and paleosol materials are estimated-to be 0. 04. 0. 08. and 0. 09. respectively. These values are 10 to 20 % <b>of</b> the total <b>porosities.</b> Comparisons between measured and predicted C 1 travel times through compacted soil samples were made in order to verify the estimated effective porosities. The estimated effective porosities are reasonable because predicted C 1 ~ first breakthrough times are similar to the measured first breakthrough times in the,soils studied. For these three soils predicted first breakthrough times are 5 to 10 times earlier when effective porosity is used. in the Darcy-equation based calculations as compared to Darcy-equation-based calculations that utilize total porosity...|$|R

The hydrologic properties examined were bulk density, soil texture, total porosity, pore size distribution, saturated hydraulic conductivity, - and soil moisture-tension relationships. Soil samples were taken from a 2. 5 ha study slope on watershed 10 of the H. S. Andrews Experimental Forest near Blue River, Oregon. Eleven soil pits were excavated and six soil core samples were taken at depths of 10, 30, 70, 110, 130, 150, and 200 cm where soil conditions permitted. Laboratory analyses were conducted to determine the hydrologic properties of each sample. The extreme permeability and high <b>porosities</b> <b>of</b> the samples necessitated the use of specially designed apparatus to measure the saturated weights and hydraulic conductivities.

A trial using a completely randomized design with 9 treatments and 3 replications, corresponding to the incorporation of organic byproducts, alone and in combination, a control (without application) and agronomic treatment (lime dolomite).

The results indicated that the application of leaf litter, bagasse and fresh filter cake in the <b>soil,</b> generated <b>a</b> favorable response in the variables: bulk density and total porosity, after 45 days; in the second sampling, the best response in these variables was achieved with 6. 2 t/ha of leaf litter.

40|$|Information on {{the effects}} of growing cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) -based crop {{rotations}} on soil quality of dryland Vertisols is sparse. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the effects of growing cereal and leguminous crops in rotation with dryland cotton on physical and chemical properties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grey Vertisol near Warra, SE Queensland, Australia. The experimental treatments, selected after consultations with local cotton growers, were continuous cotton (T 1), cotton-sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) (T 2), cotton-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) double cropped (T 3), cotton-chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) double cropped followed by wheat (T 4) and cotton-wheat (T 5). From 1993 to 1996 land preparation was by chisel ploughing to about 0. 2 m followed by two to four cultivations with a Gyral tyne cultivator. Thereafter all crops were sown with zero tillage except for cultivation with a chisel plough to about 0. 07 - 0. 1 m after cotton picking to control heliothis moth pupae. Soil was sampled from 1996 to 2004 and physical (air-filled <b>porosity</b> <b>of</b> oven-dried <b>soil,</b> <b>an</b> indicator <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> compaction; plastic limit; linear shrinkage; dispersion index) and chemical (pH in 0. 01 M CaCl 2, organic carbon, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na contents) properties measured. Crop rotation affected soil properties only with respect to exchangeable Na content and air-filled porosity. In the surface 0. 15 m during 2000 and 2001 lowest air-filled porosity occurred with T 1 (average of 34. 6 m 3 / 100 m 3) and the highest with T 3 (average of 38. 9 m 3 / 100 m 3). Air-filled porosity decreased in the same depth between 1997 and 1998 from 45. 0 to 36. 1 m 3 / 100 m 3, presumably due to smearing and compaction caused by shallow cultivation in wet soil. In the subsoil, T 1 and T 2 frequently had lower air-filled porosity values in comparison with T 3, T 4 and T 5, particularly during the early stages of the experiment, although values under T 1 increased subsequently. In general, compaction was less under rotations which included a wheat crop (T 3, T 4, T 5). For example, average air-filled porosity (in m 3 / 100 m 3) in the 0. 15 - 0. 30 m depth from 1996 to 1999 was 19. 8 with both T 1 and T 2, and 21. 2 with T 3, 21. 1 with T 4 and 21. 5 with T 5. From 2000 to 2004, average air-filled porosity (in m 3 / 100 m 3) in the same depth was 21. 3 with T 1, 19. 0 with T 2, 19. 8 with T 3, 20. 0 with T 4 and 20. 5 with T 5. The rotation which included chickpea (T 4) resulted in the lowest exchangeable Na content, although differences among rotations were small. Where only a cereal crop with a fibrous root system was sown in rotation with cotton (T 2, T 3, T 5) linear shrinkage in the 0. 45 - 0. 60 m depth was lower than in rotations, which included tap-rooted crops such as chickpea (T 4) or continuous cotton (T 1). Dispersion index and organic carbon decreased, and plastic limit increased with time. Soil organic carbon stocks decreased at <b>a</b> rate <b>of</b> 1. 2 Mg/ha/year. Lowest average cotton lint yield occurred with T 2 (0. 54 Mg/ha) and highest wheat yield with T 3 (2. 8 Mg/ha). Rotations which include a wheat crop are more likely to result in better soil structure and cotton lint yield than cotton-sorghum or continuous cotton...|$|R
