40|$|<b>Perineal</b> hernias (pelvic <b>floor</b> hernias) are {{extremely}} rare occurring through defects in musculature of the pelvic floor. This report presents a successfully treated case of primary perineal hernia {{and takes a}} review of the existing literature. The case of a 14 -month-old girl with a great perineal hernia is presented. Diagnosis was secured by barium enema. The pelvic defect was successfully treated by primary suture with prolene. The literature shows many different approaches for treatment of perineal hernia, such as open or laparoscopic mesh repair, and perineal, abdominal or combined access in the adult, but our case like others confirms that primary closure of the hernial orifice through a perineal approach is also feasible in children...|$|R

Background. Pelvic floor (PF) hypertonic disorders are a group of conditions that present with muscular hypertonia or spasticity, resulting in a diminished capacity to isolate, contract, and relax the PF. Their presentation includes voiding and sexual dysfunctions, pelvic pain, and constipation. Various factors are associated, such as complicated vaginal birth, muscular injury, scar tissue formation, and neuropathies. Study Design. The case of a single patient will be presented, together with the management strategies employed. Case Description. A woman with hereditary spastic paraparesis {{and a history of}} muscle spasticity and urinary and fecal complaints since childhood. She presented to this institution seeking treatment for pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, constipation, and micturition problems. A physical therapy protocol was developed, with the trial of several treatment modalities. Outcome. After some failed attempts, <b>perineal</b> and pelvic <b>floor</b> stretching proved to be very efficacious therapies for this patient’...|$|R

50|$|In women, {{physical}} changes resulting from pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause often contribute to stress incontinence. Stress incontinence can worsen {{during the week}} before the menstrual period. At that time, lowered estrogen levels may lead to lower muscular pressure around the urethra, increasing chances of leakage. The incidence of stress incontinence increases following menopause, similarly because of lowered estrogen levels. In female high-level athletes, effort incontinence occurs in all sports involving abrupt repeated increases in intra-abdominal pressure that may exceed <b>perineal</b> <b>floor</b> resistance.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} the functionality of ileal detubularized reservoir and ileocecal neobladder with multiple teniamyotomies {{after a long}} term follow-up. Material and Methods. Eight patients with ileal detubularized reservoir (IR) and 10 with ileocecal neobladder with multiple teniamyotomies (ICUS) with an average follow-up of 95 months, were submitted to a videourodynamic digital fluorongiographic examination. The patients had the longest disease-free follow-up of our series. Results. Urodynamic data collected were almost good and comparable between IR and ICUS. Anyway the exams showed that the smooth intestinal muscles remain active both in non-detubularized and detubularized bladders even after years. Continence is mostly assured by the striated sphincter, which can withstand transient high pressure peaks but is less effective when facing prolonged pressure increases. While in some cases a valid micturition was achieved simply relaxing the <b>perineal</b> <b>floor,</b> in other cases micturition was obtained by an abdominal straining against the resistance of a contracted urethral sphincter/pelvic floor even after a long follow-up. Conclusions. Detubularization and teniamyotomies can equally help the striated sphincter function by increasing the neobladder compliance. Moreover we observed that a non-spherical neobladder was compatible with good clinical results as well, proving that neobladder shape was less important in achieving good functional performance. Furthermore, {{in some cases the}} optimal relaxation of the <b>perineal</b> <b>floor</b> made abdominal straining superfluous especially when neobladders had physiological capacity. Thus a <b>perineal</b> <b>floor</b> musculature training and its co-ordination with abdominal muscles may improve the quality of micturition...|$|E

Discussion. PF spasticity can lead to severe disability and interfere with daily basic functions, such as micturition and evacuation. Physical therapy plays an essential role in the management of these patients and can lead to significant improvement in quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this review}} {{is to provide a}} {{comprehensive}} overview of the available literature on preventing perineal trauma with the EpiNo. Methods. We perfomed a literature research in the MedLine and EMBASE databases for studies referring to EpiNo published between 1990 and 2014, without restrictions for language and study type. Results. Five published studies were identified, regarding the effect of EpiNo on the rate of episiotomy and <b>perineal</b> tears, pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle function, and fetal outcome. The device seems to reduce episiotomy and perineal tears’ rate, as well as the risk for levator ani microtrauma and avulsion, though not always statistically significant. It {{does not seem to have}} an effect on duration of second stage of labour and fetal outcome. The device is well tolerated and the adverse events are rare and mild. However, design and reporting bias in the reviewed articles do not allow evidence based conclusions. Conclusions. The EpiNo device seems to be promising, with potential positive effects on natural birth, while being uncomplicated to use and without major complications. Well designed, randomized trials are needed in order to understand the effects of EpiNo on pelvic floor and make evidence based recommendations on its use...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Background: Attitudes drive practice, {{perhaps more}} than evidence. The objec-tive {{of this study was}} to {{determine}} if the new generation of Canadian obstetricians has attitudes differing from those of their predecessors. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional, Internet, and paper-based survey, we conducted an in-depth study of obstetricians responding to the Canadian National Maternity Care Attitudes Survey. Results: Of the 800 Canadian obstetri-cians providing intrapartum care, 549 (68. 6 %) responded. Participants were stratified by age less than or equal to 40 years compared with those over 40 years; 81 percent of those 40 years or younger were women versus 40 percent over 40 years of age. Younger obstetricians were significantly more likely to favor use of routine epidural analgesia and believed that it did not interfere with labor or lead to instrumentation; were more concerned and feared the <b>perineal</b> and pelvic <b>floor</b> consequences of vaginal birth compared with cesarean section; and were sig-nificantly less supportive of vaginal birth after prior cesarean section, home birth, birth plans, routine episiotomy, and routine electronic fetal monitoring as providing maternal or fetal bene-fits. They were less positive than the older generation about a range of approaches to reducing the cesarean section rate, the importance of maternal choice and role in their own birth, an...|$|R
40|$|Urodynamic {{test has}} a main role in: 1) making a precise {{diagnosis}} in presence of urinary symptoms not clearly interpretable by other means; 2) assessing {{the characteristics of}} neurogenic bladder for a correct treatment; 3) detecting an underlying, previously not diagnosed neurologic disease in patients with voiding abnormalities. This report concerns 10 patients with urinary symptoms in whom the urodynamic tests allowed to suspect a neurogenic problem. Seven pts. showed an areflexic bladder with positive betanechol supersensitive test, 3 pts. had detrusor hyperreflexia, while in 2 cases there was a low compliant bladder. All the patients with detrusor hyperreflexia had also detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, while 5 out of 7 pts. with detrusor areflexia showed a denervated <b>perineal</b> <b>floor.</b> The final neurologic diagnoses were 4 protruded discs, 2 multiple scleroses, 1 cerebral tumor, 2 spinal tumors, 1 cervical spondylosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of morphine was followed in white mice by a typical Straub reaction {{which consisted of}} the tail becoming rigid and erected {{across the back of}} the animal in an S-shaped curve. This reaction was accompanied by restlessness, excitability, extension rigidity of the hindlimbs, forcible viodance of faeces and prominence of the perineum. The Straub reaction was abolished by general anaesthesia with pentobarbitone or ether, by {{administration of}} tubocurarine, by bilateral section of the muscles causing extension to the tail, and by the removal of the circulation to the lower extremity. The reaction was modified by unilateral section of the extensor muscles of the tail. Section of the spinal cord, decortication, division of the anal sphincter and <b>perineal</b> <b>floor,</b> or ablation of the pelvic splanchnic nerves did not suppress the appearance of the Straub response. It was concluded that the phenomenon described by Straub (1911) was produced mainly by the action of the sacro-coccygeus dorsalis muscle, and that it was also necessary that the lumbo-sacral cord with its peripheral nervous outflow should be intact and that these functioning units should have an adequate circulation...|$|E

Research concepts {{use in the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} urinary incontinence Gabriela Bidzińska 1, Adrian Sieroń 2 1 Academy of Physical Education, Department of Physiotherapy, Department of Physiotherapy in Internal Diseases 2 Academy of Physical Education, Faculty of Physical Education, Department of Physical Anthropology Abstract The phenomenon of urinary incontinence is an important social problem that affects both men and women regardless of age, ethnic or cultural differences. It is estimated that in Poland suffers from this ailment approx. 5 million people and affects women twice as often than men. Furthermore, it has been shown that the incidence and severity of symptoms increases with age. Most recent reports indicate that over 50 % of all cases this stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which with the use of suitable diagnostic and therapeutic methods is reversible and treatable. The cause of stress incontinence is to reduce the voltage <b>perineal</b> muscles, pelvic <b>floor</b> relaxation fascia and connective tissue. Diagnosis of lower urinary tract should be based on intelligence, analysis of micturition diary, physical examination and urodynamic. In recent years, also they started to be used as diagnostic imaging including ultrasound first and foremost. The cheapest and the safest for the patient using the medical treatment and is to this form of therapy, patients should be classified at the beginning. Surgical treatment should be used when conservative treatment will not bring positive results. Keywords: urinary incontinence, physiotherapy, treatmen...|$|R
