5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 percent of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of <b>psoriatic</b> <b>arthritis,</b> lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. <b>Psoriatic</b> <b>arthritis</b> affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed.

40|$|Cytidine deaminase (CD) is a cytoplasmatic enzyme present {{predominantly}} in polymorphonuclear cells (PMNC) in inflamed joints. Lactoferrin {{is situated}} in the secondary granules of PMNC and is released by secretory/phagocytic stimuli, whereas CD is released mainly upon cell lysis. To study the release of these molecules in arthritic conditions we measured CD and lactoferrin levels in synovial fluid (SF) drawn from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), crystal pyrophos-phate disease (CPPD), <b>psoriatic</b> arthropathy, reactive <b>arthritis,</b> spondylarthropathy, and osteoarthrosis. CD activity was highest in SF from RA and CPPD followed by <b>psoriatic</b> arthropathy, reactive <b>arthritis</b> and spondylarthropathy. Lac-toferrin concentrations were highest in CPPD followed by RA, reactive <b>arthritis,</b> <b>psoriatic</b> arthropathy, and spondyl-arthropathy. Both CD and lactoferrin levels were low in osteoarthrosis SF. Although SF CD activity and lactoferrin levels correlated well in all diagnostic groups, the ratio between CD and lactoferrin was higher for RA, psoriatic arthropathy, and spondylarthropathy compared to reactive arthritis and CPPD. This suggests predominant release by PMNC lysis in the more chronic arthritis groups and more degranulation in the more episodic CPPD and reactive arthritis groups. CD activity and lactoferrin levels correlated significantly with SF cell counts in the RA and psoriatic arthropathy groups. KEY WORDS: Synovial fluid.

5|$|The rate of {{psoriasis}} in HIV-positive {{individuals is}} {{comparable to that of}} HIV-negative individuals, however, psoriasis tends to be more severe in people infected with HIV. A much higher rate of <b>psoriatic</b> <b>arthritis</b> occurs in HIV-positive individuals with psoriasis than in those without the infection. The immune response in those infected with HIV is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ helper T cells, whereas the immune response in psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ helper T cells and Th17 helper T cells. It is hypothesized that the diminished CD4+-T cell presence causes an overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the exacerbation of psoriasis in HIV-positive people. Psoriasis in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy.|$|E

40|$|Psoriasis is a common, chronic, relapsing, papulo-squamous dermatitis, with {{overlying}} silvery scales.

40|$|Abstract Leflunomide is a disease-modifying {{antirheumatic}} drug with antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive activity {{used for}} the treatment of <b>psoriatic</b> and rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b> It undergoes rapid metabolization to teriflunomide, a metabolite that is responsible for the biological activity of leflunomide. Continuing our investigations on the interactions of biologi-cally important azahetarenes with the environment, we fo-cused on leflunomide and its active metabolite, teriflunomide, considering the interactions teriflunomide–amino acid within the target protein (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) using den-sity functional theory, as well as ONIOM techniques. The results of theoretical {{studies have shown that the}} interactions of teriflunomide with tyrosine and arginine involve principally the amide fragment of teriflunomide. The presence of the in-ternal hydrogen bond between (Z) -teriflunomide carbonyl ox-ygen and enolic hydroxyl decreases the interaction strength between teriflunomide and tyrosine or arginine. Even the E isomer of teriflunomide would usually provide a stronger in-teraction teriflunomide—amino acid than the Z isomer with the internal hydrogen bond...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} unusual {{case of a}} patient with {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus (SLE) -associated arthritis mutilans. Arthritis mutilans is a variant of erosive arthritis that is more commonly reported with <b>psoriatic</b> and rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and not with SLE. Joint fusion {{has been shown to}} be the most effective measure to preserve bone length and prevent further erosive joint changes in arthritis mutilans. We attempted to enhance success of a thumb interphalangeal joint fusion in our patient by adding compression across the fusion with implant screws, given the difficulty of achieving solid bone fusion ordinarily. Osteolysis around the compression screw resulted in arthrodesis failure. We were finally able to achieve successful fusion with iliac crest corticocancellous bone grafts and Kirschner wire fixation. Implant athroplasty in patients with bone loss is risky as it often furthers joint instability because of bone resorption around the prosthesis. This is a point of caution regarding use of any implant (including large screws) in patients with arthritis mutilans, as osteolysis around the implant may occur...|$|R

40|$|It is {{recognised}} {{that the}} epidemiology of disease {{as well as}} ill-health manifestations in minority populations may be at variance from orthodox formulations generated through traditional research and {{as described in the}} western medical literature.

A comparison {{group consisted of}} 616 patients including 27 with systemic lupus erythematosus, 15 with Sjö gren’s syndrome, 25 with ankylosing spondyloarthritis; 33 with osteoarthritis, 20 with overlap syndrome, 9, 22, and 168 {{patients with}} gouty, <b>psoriatic,</b> and undifferentiated <b>arthritis,</b> respectively; as well as 297 healthy donors matched with the examinees for gender and age. The concentrations of 36 biomarkers were measured by an immunonephelometric method, enzyme immunoassay, and xMAP technology. The values of one variable from others were predicted using a multiple linear regression method (multivariate analysis). Results. The strongest predictors of early RA, such as the concentrations of interleukin- 6, C-reactive protein, granulo-cyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IFN^-inducible protein, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, were identified and a candidate for MDI was developed for early RA (MIRRA). After thorough validation, MIRRA may {{be regarded as a}} precision serological assay for the early diagnosis of RA. Conclusion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether {{elevated levels of}} the angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), detected on presentation to an early arthritis clinic, {{are associated with the}} development of chronic and erosive arthritis. METHODS: Concentrations of VEGF and its soluble receptor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt- 1), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples from patients with early (3 years from symptom onset) RA treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, from patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and from patients with polyarthralgia without arthritis, as well as from nonarthritic controls. RESULTS: Serum VEGF levels at presentation were elevated in patients with inflammatory <b>arthritis</b> (RA, <b>psoriatic,</b> and self-limiting <b>arthritis)</b> as well as in patients with OA, in comparison with nonarthritic controls. Moreover, serum VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in patients with early RA than in patients with self-limiting arthritis. Serum VEGF levels at presentation in patients with early RA correlated significantly with the development of radiographic damage after 1 year. Improvement in the clinical symptoms of RA was associated with a reduction in serum VEGF levels. Serum sFlt- 1 levels were raised in patients with early and longstanding RA and in those with self-limiting arthritis, and correlated positively with the serum VEGF concentrations in patients with inflammatory arthritis. CONCLUSION: These findings implicate the proangiogenic cytokine VEGF in the persistence of inflammatory arthritis, and support the hypothesis that expansion of the synovial vasculature is important for the development of joint destruction in RA...|$|R

40|$|SAPHO {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} and often unrecognized disease with prominent inflammatory cutaneous and articular manifestations characterized by similar musculoskeletal manifestations (synovitis, hyperostosis, osteomyelitis) associated with dermatological conditions (severe acne and pustulosis) [1]. The acidic soluble fraction of whole saliva from 10 adult women affected by SAPHO syndrome and from 10 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects was analysed by RP-HPLC-ESI-MS with the aim to discover salivary biomarkers of the disorder. The levels of oral proteins and peptides were correlated with clinical data. The following proteins showed a significant decreased concentration in saliva of SAPHO subjects with respect to controls: cystatin S 1 and S 2, histatin 1 and 5 and the major acidic PRPs. Salivary concentration of cystatin S 1 and S 2 positively correlated with neutrophil count in patients, and the abundance of cystatin S 2 lowered according to the disease duration. Histatin 1 and 5 showed positive relationship with C reactive protein and negative with the disease duration. Levels and frequency of S 100 A 12 protein showed a trend to increase in SAPHO patients.

40|$|Based {{on recent}} {{experience}} that Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive drug, produces marked improvement in psoriasis, possible immunomodulatory activities of methotrexate (MTX) have been reviewed {{to look for}} alternate mechanisms of MTX action in psoriasis. It is generally considered that the therapeutic results of MTX in psoriasis are related to a direct effect on epidermal cell hyperplasia through inhibition of DNA synthesis. Several studies in the literature now suggest possible effects of MTX on the immune system of psoriatics {{as well as in}} animal models that may have some pathogenic similarities to psoriasis. In psoriatics receiving MTX, neutrophil chemotaxis is suppressed, resulting in a possible alteration in the potential pathologic activity of neutrophils commonly found in lesional skin. MTX does improve both <b>psoriatic</b> and rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b> Animal studies of the latter using adjuvant arthritis and graft vs host disease (GVHD) have indicated several possible mechanisms for MTX that affect these processes. In GVHD, MTX selectively destroys cycling CD 8 + cells, and in adjuvant arthritis the activation of macrophages is prevented by inhibition of T-cell function. While MTX generally has not been clinically utilized as an immunomodulatory drug for immunologically related diseases, it may, nonetheless, have selective actions that could be specific for some diseases. MTX and Cyclosporin A could work mechanistically in similar ways but at different steps in the activation of T cells and macrophages. It may be that the major direct effect of MTX on epidermal cell proliferation is complemented or even mediated by subtle immunoregulatory effects on the melange of cells in the affected skin and the systemic immune response...|$|R
