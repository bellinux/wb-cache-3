40|$|Borders {{are perhaps}} the most {{significant}} institutions in international relations. A mas-sive literature demonstrates that border disputes fundamentally affect the character of relations between disputants, often escalating to violent and persistent conflict. How-ever, the literature has barely begun to explore and identify the exact mechanisms that produce disputes and whereby these disputes escalate. Recent research demonstrates that how borders are drawn affects the probability of subsequent conflict and suggests that borders will be peaceful when they effectively and efficiently coordinate the ac-tors {{on either side of the}} border, thereby creating stable and predictable patterns of interactions. This research, however, ignores the obvious temporal component implied by theory. We develop the temporal component of an institutional theory of borders, starting from the argument that whether new international borders become more sta-ble over time depends upon whether actors on both sides learn to coordinate on new jurisdictional international borders. We build on this idea to argue that the effect of time is significantly influenced by the manner in which the new border is drawn. We find that new borders that follow <b>previous</b> <b>administrative</b> become stable institutions much faster than than those of new borders drawn otherwise. In other words, stable and peaceful coordination on new borders occurs much faster when those new borders follow <b>previous</b> <b>administrative</b> frontiers...|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} function {{is an important}} aspect of the science of taxonomy. Every classification is built upon a critical evaluation and emendation of a previously existing one. Ultimately, this reaches back to pre-scientific classifications which are, like scientific ones, hierarchically structured. The {{critical function}} is strongly developed in phylogenetic systematics in which some time-honoured taxa are no longer considered natural groups. Rejection of paraphyletic taxa has given rise to opposition against the phylogenetic methodology. It is suggested that paraphyletic taxa may be retained for <b>administrative</b> <b>reference,</b> but not for scientific evaluation of biogeography and evolutionary differentiation...|$|R
