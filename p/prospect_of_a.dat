5|$|Another {{potential}} source of income was the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain.

Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} {{there was no immediate}} <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quick end to the Continuation War but there was an immediate need for new vehicles. In the longer term, the army was expected to need at least 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the only option was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E

The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.|$|E

5|$|In the {{meantime}} Sigismund also arrived and was crowned in Kraków, which initiated his {{long in the}} Commonwealth (1587–1632) reign as Zygmunt III Waza. The <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> personal union with Sweden raised for the Polish and Lithuanian ruling circles political and economic hopes, including favorable Baltic trade conditions and a common front against Russia's expansion. However concerning the latter, the control of Estonia had soon become the bone of contention. Sigismund's ultra-Catholicism appeared threatening to the Swedish Protestant establishment and contributed to his dethronement in Sweden in 1599.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after his spell at Inverness ended, Davis joined League One side Chesterfield on loan for three months. He was ever-present over nine league matches and also played twice in the Football League Trophy, a cup {{competition}} open to teams from {{the third and fourth}} tiers of the Football League; a 3–1 aggregate win against Oldham Athletic in the Northern Final earned Chesterfield a place in the final itself. On 6 March, he was recalled by Wolves' new manager, Terry Connor, after an injury to Karl Henry left Wolves in need of midfield cover. Davis himself felt that the possibility of playing Premier League football for Wolves far outweighed the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Wembley final.|$|E

5|$|Between 1939 and 1945, {{there were}} many plans to assassinate Hitler, some of which {{proceeded}} to significant degrees. The most well known, the 20 July plot, came from within Germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German defeat in the war. In July 1944, in the 20 July plot, part of Operation Valkyrie, Claus von Stauffenberg planted a bomb in one of Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast. Later, Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900people.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the two {{monitors}} entered service, the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French attack had decreased, prompting the Navy to question the usefulness of retaining the vessels. As a result, they were quickly removed from service. The ultimate fate of the two ships is unclear; according to naval historian Erich Gröner, both ships were sold for 3,500gold marks in December 1875. Robert Gardiner, however, states that the ships remained, out of service, until 1884, when they were sold for scrapping. The latter version {{would appear to be}} correct, as J.F. von Kronenfels published an elevation and deckplan of Rhein in 1881, with the inference that Rhein and Mosel were still extant at that time.|$|E
5|$|Charles faced a {{political}} storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being {{next in line}} to the throne. The <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley {{and a member of}} the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).|$|E
5|$|Charles {{made the}} Treaty of Brussels with Spain in 1656. This {{gathered}} Spanish {{support for a}} restoration in return for Charles's contribution to the war against France. Charles raised a ragtag army from his exiled subjects; this small, underpaid, poorly-equipped and ill-disciplined force formed {{the nucleus of the}} post-Restoration army. The Commonwealth made the Treaty of Paris with France in 1657 to join them in war against Spain in the Netherlands. Royalist supporters in the Spanish force were led by Charles's younger brother James, Duke of York. At the Battle of the Dunes in 1658, as part of the larger Spanish force, Charles's army of around 2,000 clashed with Commonwealth troops fighting with the French. By the end of the battle Charles's force was about 1,000 and with Dunkirk given to the English the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Royalist expedition to England was dashed.|$|E

During the bombardment of Hartlepool, Moltke was struck by a 6in (15.2cm) shell from a coastal battery, which caused minor damage between decks, but no casualties. Blücher was hit six times and Seydlitz three times by the coastal battery. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.|$|E

5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> powerful alliance with a European royal house was low.

Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E
