5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} God {{is too great}} for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God {{is often referred to}} by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their <b>potentialities</b> on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle holds a teleological worldview: he {{sees the}} {{universe}} as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists {{for the sake of}} actuality.

Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither. Hence, we can say that the snake ought to slither.

Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the <b>potentialities</b> of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.|$|E

This special issue of Current Anthropology explores how genes, cells, bodies, and populations as well as technologies, disciplines, and research areas become imbued with potential. We suggest that anthropologists of the life sciences and biomedicine should work reflexively with the concept of <b>potentiality</b> and the politics of its naming and framing. We lay out a set of propositions and emphasize the moral aspects of claims about <b>potentiality</b> as well as the productivity of the ambiguity involved when dealing with that which does not (yet and may never) exist. We suggest that <b>potentiality</b> is both an analytic—one that has appeared explicitly and tacitly in the history of anthropology—as well as an object of study in need of further attention. To understand contemporary meanings and practices associated with <b>potentiality,</b> we must integrate an awareness of our own social scientific assumptions about <b>potentiality</b> with critical scrutiny of how the word and concept operate {{in the lives of the}} people we study...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare two {{different}} notions of 'power', {{both of which}} attempt to provide a realist understanding of quantum mechanics grounded on the potential mode of existence. For this propose we will begin by introducing two different notions of <b>potentiality</b> present already within Aristotelian metaphysics, namely, irrational <b>potentiality</b> and rational <b>potentiality.</b> After discussing {{the role played by}} <b>potentiality</b> within classical and quantum mechanics, we will address the notion of causal power which is directly related to irrational <b>potentiality</b> and has been adopted by many interpretations of QM. We will then present the notion of immanent power which relates to rational <b>potentiality</b> and argue that this new concept presents important advantages regarding the possibilities it provides for understanding in a novel manner the theory of quanta. We end our paper with a comparison between both notions of 'power', stressing some radical differences between them.

5000|$|Theta {{sets out}} to define <b>potentiality</b> and actuality. Chapters 1-5 discuss <b>potentiality.</b> We learn that this term {{indicates}} the potential (δύναμις, dunamis) of something to change: <b>potentiality</b> is [...] "a principle of change in another thing or in the thing itself qua other" [...] (1046a9). In chapter 6 Aristotle turns to actuality. We can only know actuality through observation or [...] "analogy;" [...] thus [...] "as that which builds is to that which is capable of building, so is that which is awake to that which is asleep...or that which is separated from matter to matter itself" [...] (1048b1-4). Actuality is the completed state of something that {{had the potential to}} be completed. The relationship between actuality and <b>potentiality</b> {{can be thought of as}} the relationship between form and matter, but with the added aspect of time. Actuality and <b>potentiality</b> are diachronic (across time) distinctions, whereas form and matter are synchronic (at one time) distinctions.|$|R

25|$|We must {{single out}} the {{children}} who are endowed with high <b>potentialities,</b> and develop them as completely as possible. And in this manner give to the nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children may be found in all classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very rich men, like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live among us, might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble-mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High <b>potentialities</b> are rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers, who have failed in business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon.|$|E

40|$|As {{stated by}} Giorgio Agamben, in Western philosophy, <b>potentiality</b> {{is part of}} a very long tradition. <b>Potentiality</b> {{represents}} one of the central concepts of Western philosophy, already claiming this status with Aristotle, who posited <b>potentiality</b> against actuality, framing it into a specific register of knowledge, to a specific mode of anthropogenesis, to an anthropological machine. However, {{what does this mean for}} the politics of <b>potentiality,</b> if, as shown by Marina Gržinić in her book Estetika kibersveta in učinki derealizacije [Aaesthetics of the Cyber World and Effects of Derealisation], in the chapter Zunaj biti [Beyond Being], <b>potentiality</b> is thematised through the tradition of metaphysics as a process that never really comes to an end, incessantly deciding upon what counts as human and what does not. In this respect the aim of this text is threefold: first, to suggest that <b>potentiality</b> is to be examined within the context of the process of anthropogenesis as put forward by Agamben in The Open: Man and Animal; second, in order to show their inadequacy, to critically evaluate political ontologies of <b>potentiality</b> within the Western anthropological machine; third, following Achille Mbembe’s political figure of “becoming the Negro of the world”, to (de) articulate the concept of <b>potentiality,</b> consequently positing it beyond the Western anthropological machine and offering its decolonial articulation.   Article received: June 2, 2017; Article accepted: June 16, 2017; Published online: October 15, 2017; Original scholarly paper How to cite this article: Cvar, Nina.

Osbert Sitwell constructed a text, selecting verses from several books of the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation. As Walton worked on it, he found that his music required far larger forces than the BBC proposed to allow, and Beecham rescued him by programming the work for the 1931 Leeds Festival, to be conducted by Malcolm Sargent. Walton later recalled Beecham as saying, [...] "As you'll never hear the work again, my boy, why not throw in a couple of brass bands?" [...] During early rehearsals, the Leeds chorus members found Walton's music difficult to master, and it was falsely rumoured in London musical circles that Beecham had been obliged to send Sargent to Leeds to quell a revolt. The first performance was a triumph for the composer, conductor and performers. A contemporary critic wrote, [...] "Those who experienced the tremendous impact of its first performance had full justification for feeling that a great composer had arisen in our land, a composer to whose <b>potentialities</b> it was impossible to set any limits."

40|$|Monosynaptic reflex {{response}} of spinal motoneurons to graded afferent volleys {{has been studied}} in natural populations and in {{a representative sample of}} individual motoneurons. By analysis of input-response relations certain of the requirements for initiation of reflex discharge have been defined. Initation of motoneuron discharge by monosynaptic afferent excitatory volleys results from the development of transmitter <b>potentiality</b> among members of a pool. Transmitter <b>potentiality</b> is considered to have the following characteristics: 1. It {{is a function of the}} number of active excitatory synaptic knobs, the degree to which such knobs are aggregated on the motoneuron soma, and the intensity of action per knob. 2.

While transmitter <b>potentiality</b> has considerable dependence on number of active excitatory knobs, proximity of such knobs is an important variable. Total activation of a discrete zone does not appear to be necessary for initiation of discharge. In addition to initiation of discharge, volleys in monosynaptic afferent excitatory fibers facilitate response otherwise engendered. Such facilitation depends upon the production of an increment in transmitter <b>potentiality.</b> Facilitator <b>potentiality</b> has the following characteristics: 1. It depends principally on number of active excitatory synaptic knobs and intensity of action per knob. 2.
