40|$|On 20 January 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada {{heard an}} appeal by Percy Schmeiser, a 73 year old canola farmer from Bruno, Saskatchewan, against {{findings}} {{that he had}} infringed the patents of the biotechnology company Monsanto. The matter raises important questions about gene patents, innocent infringement, and farmers’ rights. Are biological inventions patentable – like mechanical inventions? Can an innocent bystander {{be held liable for}} infringing a patent? Should farmers’ privileges to save seed trump patent rights and technology user agreements? The case concerns a Canadian patent granted to Monsanto in 1993 for an invention named “Glyphosate-Resistant Plants”. The patent was for “man-made genetically engineered genes, and cells containing those genes which, when inserted in plants, in this canola, make those plants resistant to glyphosate herbicides” such as Monsanto’s product Roundup Ready. In 1997, Monsanto sent private investigators – ex-Mounted Policemen – to take samples from the canola farm of Percy Schmeiser. It claimed that the farmer planted glyphosate-resistant seeds to grow a crop of GM canola, for harvest. It claimed that Schmeiser used, reproduced, and created genes, cells, plants and seeds containing the genes and cells claimed in the patent. Both the Federal Court and the Full Federal Court held that Percy Schmeiser knew or should have known that those plants were glyphosate resistant when he saved their seeds in 1997 and planted those seeds the following year. It was the cultivation, harvest and sale of the 1998 crop that made Percy Schmeiser vulnerable to Monsanto’s infringement claim. As a result of the decision, Schmeiser owed Monsanto about 140, 000 in judgments. He also had to pay substantial legal fees of 230, 000. He has rented out all but 140 acres of his farm. Monsanto has placed a lien against the house and farm of Schmeiser. As a result, the farmer has raised funds from donations by supporters to help fight the considerable costs of his legal battles. Percy Schmeiser was supported by a group of six NGOs – including the Council of Canadians, the Sierra Club, and the International Center for Technology Assessment. Monsanto was supported by the Canadian Seed Trade Association, the Canadian Canola Growers Association, and the industry group BIOTECanada. The provincial government of Ontario was also a party to the case because of its concerns about the impact of gene patents on biomedical research and health care. The provincial government has taken a strong interest in the topic since it was sued by the Utah biotechnology company, Myriad Genetics, for infringement of the company’s patents on genetic tests for breast and ovarian cancer. The Supreme Court of Canada will have to consider a complex array of issues surrounding gene patents, innocent infringement, and farmers’ rights. There are three main areas of dispute. First, the court will consider whether Monsanto’s patent on “Glyphosate-Resistant Plants” is valid given the <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>patenting</b> high life forms in Canada. Second, the Supreme Court will evaluate whether Percy Schmeiser infringed the patent of Monsanto by having a patented GM canola crop on his land. Third, the court will consider the defence of Schmeiser that he is permitted under law to save and reuse seed. I will examine each of these issues in turn...|$|E
40|$|The idea of ominous {{technologies}} that put human individuals {{or parts of}} their bodies under someone else 2 ̆ 7 s control has been stirring emotions and terrifying people for centuries. It was a recent offshoot of this idea [...] the notion of “patenting humans” [...] that mobilized certain members of Congress to pass legislation prohibiting the issuance of patent claims “directed to or encompassing a human organism. ” The values underlying this legislation {{may well have been}} agreeable, even admirable. Yet, the actual motivation for it was misguided; its execution, deeply flawed; its potential outcomes, hazardous This Article reviews the history and background of this prohibition. It fleshes out the prohibition 2 ̆ 7 s numerous flaws, including, primarily, the lack of an agreed-upon definition of “human organism. ” It explains why the perception that humans could be patented is part of what the Article labels as the “Ownership Fallacy,” which is founded on a misunderstanding of patent laws. The Article further discusses why the <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> the <b>patenting</b> of inventions “directed to or encompassing a human organism” [...] while unnecessary and unlikely to achieve its purpose [...] poses a danger to technological innovation, especially in the area of biomedical technology. The Article then discusses ways of minimizing the potential negative ramifications of the prohibition by construing it narrowly. Finally, the Article calls for the repeal and substitution of the <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> the <b>patenting</b> of inventions “directed to or encompassing a human organism” with a scientifically-informed legislative effort aimed at expanding the boundaries of the concepts of slavery and involuntary servitude...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of genetic medicine following decades of molecular biology {{research has been}} accompanied by the procurement of patent rights to many medically significant genes and methods for their use. The intellectual force of reductionism in the life sciences – to explain biological phenomena with molecular precision – generates direct conflicts with patent law’s exclusion of basic knowledge from patenting: laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas must remain in the public domain. This is a period of renewed attention to the issue of patentable subject matter in the life sciences, with a particular focus <b>on</b> genetic <b>patenting.</b> Patents have been obtained for the gene as an isolated DNA molecule, and for methods that rely on the assessment of genetic status to determine medical risk. It is only recently that a direct legal challenge to the patent eligibility of a gene as an isolated DNA molecule was undertaken, in the case of Association for Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and Trademark Office. Recent developments in the patent eligibility of method claims for biochemical assays, including genetic tests, have emerged in such cases as LabCorp v. Metabolite, Prometheus v. Mayo, and Association for Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and Trademark Office. The article will outline the current legal frameworks for judging whether genetic-related inventions are patentable subject matter and identify the analytic choices available to the courts to decide the patent eligibility question for composition claims to genes and process claims to methods for genetic analysis. A central challenge to the eligibility question for genes is whether the courts should utilize a general or specific patentable subject matter theory for DNA; the choice will determine whether a decision has implications for general patenting in biotechnology. A central challenge to the analysis of life science method claims arises {{from the fact that the}} dominant analytic tests have been derived from the business method patent controversies, and illustrates how the technological neutrality of patent law causes doctrines that originate from one technical field to influence judicial review in an unrelated field. Further resolution of the eligibility controversies in genetic patenting has larger theoretical implications. The life sciences await a definitive and modern interpretation of the product of nature doctrine and its scope, and a contemporaneous analysis of whether and how correlations in the life sciences are defined as natural phenomena or laws of nature. The resolution of eligibility for genes has implications for the patenting of other biomolecules, while the resolution of the eligibility of genetic testing methods has implications for the contours of the preemption analysis as applied to subject matter in the life and physical sciences, including such scientific sectors as nanotechnology. The appellate courts confront an opportunity to update the set of “basic tools” for genetic science, and to settle these eligibility controversies for the benefit of scientists, medical practitioners, and patients who wish to use isolated genes and genetic correlations in research and medical care. As the courts enforce inventive precision through the proper application of 35 U. S. C. § 101, creative applications of fundamental knowledge will emerge and legitimately solicit legal protection, while the intellectual foundations of genetic science remain accessible. It should be possible to reconcile the <b>prohibitions</b> <b>on</b> <b>patenting</b> laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas with careful patenting practices that advance the application of genetics to medicine...|$|R
