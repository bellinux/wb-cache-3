The company had previously taken a £300million [...] "loss charge" [...] in 2000, which was expected to cover [...] "all the costs of completion of the current contract".

500|$|In 1995, Slug and Lettuce was rebranded again, {{this time}} as a [...] "contemporary English bar", {{designed}} to occupy the middle ground between a continental cafe and a classic English pub. By this time, food constituted 30 per cent of total sales. In 1997 the chain identified its primary competitors as the All Bar One and Pitcher & Piano bar chains. In 1998 Grosvenor Inns {{changed its name to}} The Slug and Lettuce Group, reflecting the fact that the now 22-strong chain had become the company's sole focus. The chain also announced that it would not stock the Amusement with Prizes machines common in many other pubs. In 1998, the chain encountered its first major setback after it expanded into the North of England with five outlets in Nottingham, York, Manchester, Harrogate and Leeds. These all made profit losses in their first six months of operation, which triggered the company's first <b>profit</b> <b>warning.</b> In 1999, the chain first entered the Scottish market, with an outlet in Glasgow. Meanwhile, the company board was criticised for a lack of dynamism and being too slow to expand its number of outlets. The chain launched a website in February 2000. All Slug and Lettuce outlets serve food throughout the day, and the meals are English inspired, with offerings including sandwiches, burgers, pasta and salads. Outlets sell a range of cocktails, beer and wine. Since 2011, outlets have opened early for breakfast.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the information content of <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> released by firms on the abnormal returns for {{a sample of}} 149 firms listed on the Euronext Amsterdam in 2000 - 2002. We propose that firms can diminish the negative influence of <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> on shareholder's returns by releasing detailed information, thereby reducing the information asymmetry between shareholders and management. We find empirical evidence that {{a greater degree of}} disclosure has a significantly positive impact on the abnormal returns of firms with multiple successive <b>profit</b> <b>warnings.</b> We argue that negative abnormal returns will occur with firms which provide external reasons in their press releases indicating that the causes of the current situation are a market-wide phenomenon and beyond their scope. We report a negative - but not significant - impact of information regarding external reasons on the abnormal returns to shareholders of firms with <b>profit</b> <b>warnings.</b> Our research findings offer valuable insights into the practical implications of the information content of <b>profit</b> <b>warnings.</b> ...|$|R

Over the period six to eighteen months after the warning we find positive abnormal returns of 18 %. After eighteen months {{there is no evidence of}} significant abnormal returns. We argue that <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> can offer a useful test for several models that have been proposed in behavioral finance. This evidence is consistent with their predictions. ...|$|R

Shares in the company were also temporarily suspended. This led to Barbara Cassani, former Chief Executive of UK low-cost airline Go, joining Vueling {{as chairman of the}} board in September 2007.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} explanations for the home bias in international portfolio investments is the moral hazard problem faced by foreign investors. Following recent literature we argue that a drop in the expected return of resources employed within the firm should increase the expected incidence of this type of moral hazard. Based on this argument foreign investors should react more strongly to <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> than domestic investors, resulting in at least a momentary increase in the home bias phenomenon. Data on <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> combined with an extensive set of intra-day trading and shareholder depository data for the Helsinki Stock Exchange in Finland are used to test this hypothesis. The results indicate that foreign investors are indeed more likely to sell while domestic investors tend to buy when <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> are released. The magnitude of the observed reaction by foreign investors depends on the magnitude of the surprise, the perceived information asymmetry, and on some corporate governance related indicators.

5000|$|A <b>profit</b> <b>warning</b> is {{a warning}} {{declaration}} issued by a listed company to investors through a stock exchange. It warns investors that the profit of the company in the coming quarter will significantly decline when {{compared with that of}} the same quarter of previous year, or the company may even make a loss. Investors {{should be aware of the}} possible loss when buying or selling its stock. For example, William Hill Bookmakers issued a <b>profit</b> <b>warning</b> on 23 March 2016 which they attributed to [...] "a bad run of results and customers imposing betting limits on themselves". Company share prices often fall following a <b>profit</b> <b>warning</b> being issued.|$|E

40|$|Using event study methodology, {{we examine}} market {{reactions}} to nearly 2, 000 trading statements {{during the period}} 1995 - 2001. We find that <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> outnumber upgrades by 50 %, and, in line with previous US studies, we find that market reaction to the actual announcements is considerably greater for <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> than for upgrades. Sub-samples demonstrate significant market reaction to <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> for all sizecontrolled portfolios, but that reaction to the announcements is greatest for small companies. Examination of pre- and post-announcement CARs shows no pre-announcement market anticipation of the announcements. Post-announcement {{there is a significant}} positive abnormal return on the day after the announcement of bad news for the small company subsample. Other post-announcement results are small and insignificant. Trading volume results are consistent with this picture. Finally, when the trading statements are examined for news on turnover and margin changes, we find that the market reaction to margin changes is greater than market reaction to turnover changes.

40|$|This paper investigates whether investors react rationally to the {{announcements}} of <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> in the Norwegian {{stock market}} by examining abnormal returns, information leakage and post-announcement drift. A classification of the warnings {{has been made}} to analyze whether the information content inherent in quantitative- and qualitative warnings has an effect on the market reaction. The sample includes 184 <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> from 2005 to 2012, where 144 of them are quantitative and 40 qualitative. The mean price reaction to the <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> on the announcement day was - 5. 25 % and we report a mean CAR of - 6. 36 % in the event window [- 1, + 1]. Contrary to many existing studies, this paper provides evidence of a greater market reaction to quantitative warnings than qualitative. This disparity decreases somewhat over time as qualitative warnings experience a significant one-day delayed market reaction of CAAR equal to - 2. 1 %. Distinguishing between positive and negative disclosures reveals that bad news result in a greater market reaction than good news...|$|R

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the verdict of acquittal in “Sweden’s largest insider trading case” once again a debate concerning illegal insider trading has arisen and a lot of criticism is directed towards the laws. The purpose of this master´s thesis is to investigate the occurrence of insider trading and whether or not Swedish legislation has decreased the presence of insider trading on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. For this purpose the legal aspects and relevant arguments are presented and discussed. An event study is performed in order to see if <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> show evidence of insider trading on the Swedish stock exchange. The event study show statistically significant evidence of illegal insider trading in 21 out of 44 cases on the Stockholm stock exchange. There is no significant difference in insider trading between <b>profit</b> <b>warnings</b> and reversed <b>profit</b> <b>warnings.</b> The regression show evidence of that the law has had a small negative impact on insider trading in the sample which is surprising and that insider trading is industry correlated. The high frequency of insider trading shows evidence of that the laws are inefficient in stopping insider trading. Since {{it is clear that the}} law is seriously flawed in stopping insider trading and that insider trading actually may positively affect the market and its participants, it is argued that it is very questionable if the legislation is necessary and if insider trading should be prohibited at all...|$|R
