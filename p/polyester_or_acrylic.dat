50|$|The first {{whiteboards}} {{were very}} expensive and {{were made of}} an enameled steel. Cheaper versions were then produced, including laminated chipboard, high-pressure laminates and steel boards with a white, usually <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> <b>acrylic,</b> coating. Enameled whiteboards, {{also referred to as}} porcelain, and sometimes glass boards, have the advantage that markings can be erased completely; other materials tend to become stained over time. Enameled boards are more expensive and less used in commercial environments, but in more demanding environments with heavier use, such as educational establishments, porcelain boards are considered superior.|$|E

40|$|The textile {{washing process}} {{involves}} basically three stages: (1) removing the soiling from the substrate, (2) suspending the soling removed in the washing bath and (3) preventing redeposition of the soiling onto the substrate {{from which it}} has just been removed. In fact, soiling removed from the substrate may have deposited on it {{to a greater or}} lesser extent during the detergent process, as unwanted phenomenon that can be avoided using appropriate polymers. Preventing the redeposition of impurities is especially important during the washing of synthetic fibres with a compact crystal structure such as <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> <b>acrylics.</b> The primary purpose of this work was to assess the performance of a polyethylene glycol polyester copolymer used as a detergent additive to prevent redeposition of solid impurities during the washing of standard polyester and acrylic fabrics in terms of the zeta potential of the fabrics. The copolymer was used in combination with the anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, the non-ionic surfactant fatty alcohol ethoxylate with 7 mol E. O. or both in variable proportions. The soiling used as a solid impurity in the washing process was carbon black. The observed behaviour is explained in terms of the electrical double layer of the fabrics, which was characterised separately with each surfactant and their mixturePostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|Etherified {{amino resins}} {{are used in}} {{conjunction}} with alkyds, <b>polyesters,</b> epoxy <b>or</b> <b>acrylic</b> resins in coating formulation. They are formed from the reaction between formaldehyde and compounds containing NH 2 groups, for example, amide, amine or imide groups. Control of this reaction is important in order to obtain the appropriate mixture targeted for the intended use and, as a consequence, the development of analytical procedures able to describe the different species present in the final resin mixtures is necessary. The use of high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with electrospray ionisation or atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry, proved to be efficient in the characterisation of n-butylated melamine-formaldehyde resins. The same analytical approach was also applied to describe the first steps in the synthesis of i-butylated urea-formaldehyde resins...|$|R

40|$|The textile {{washing process}} {{consists}} basically of three stages: 1) {{removal of the}} soiling from the substrate, 2) suspension of the soiling in the washing bath, and 3) prevention of redeposition of the soiling on the substrate from which has just been removed. The soiling removed may be caught again on the substrate {{to a greater or}} lesser extent during the detergent process. This phenomenon constitutes the unwanted redeposition of that impurity on the substrate and polymers are added to prevent it. The redeposition of impurities must be prevented during the washing of synthetic fibres, such as <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> <b>acrylic,</b> which have a compact crystalline structure. The purpose of this work is to ascertain the behavior of a polyethylene glycol polyester copolymer when used as a detergent additive to prevent redeposition of solid impurities during the washing of standard polyester and acrylic fabrics. That polymer was used in washing tests in the presence of an anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), and a non-ionic surfactant, fatty alcohol ethoxylate with 7 moles E. O., separately and in mixtures of both with varying proportions. The soiling applied was carbon black, as a solid impurity in washing. In order to explain the observed behavior, the electrical double layer of the fabrics was characterized, depending on the surfactants and the mixtures testedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|This {{body of work}} is {{the result}} of {{practice}} based research, culminating in a collection of five garments featuring pictorial prints, created through digital sublimation printing¹. The accompanying exegesis examines the place of my work within the contextual framework of related knowledge. The exegesis explores two main contextual notions. Firstly, the position of dolls' clothing play as a hegemonic tool in the process of learning to construct identity through self-presentation. This reflects on the practice of enculturing in girls the ability not just to do, but to observe oneself whilst doing. Secondly, the role of garments and fabric as liminal² markers at the transitional space between interior and exterior, domestic and public, self and not-self. My analysis is centered on the creation of original pieces of clothing. The garments are questioned by the issues explored in this exegesis. The research makes an original contribution to the body of knowledge {{by the nature of the}} creative work, and its analysis involving contemporary theoretical debate on the nature of fashion. ¹ Sublimation printing is a method of chemically bonding ink to a <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> <b>acrylic</b> surface such as fabric, using extremely high heat and pressure.
