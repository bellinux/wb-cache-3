5|$|Micro Machines is a {{top-down}} racing game: players observe races from above. Players race in environments such as {{breakfast and}} pool tables, work desks, and treehouses, driving toy vehicles such as powerboats, helicopters, formula one cars, and tanks that can shoot other racers. Courses have a predefined path that racers must follow: {{if a player}} leaves the defined route for too long they are {{sent back to the}} track. Many have obstacles such as cereal boxes on breakfast tables, and <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> on desks.|$|E
2500|$|Marc Brown's children, Tolon, Eliza and Tucker, are {{referenced}} in {{the show}} many times, {{just as they are}} in the Arthur book series. For example, the town's moving company is called [...] "Tolon Moving", and everyday items such as cups or <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> have the word [...] "Eliza" [...] printed on them. References to Cookie Jar Entertainment and WGBH also appear often on the show. In one episode, Francine and Buster are shown playing a table hockey game in which one team's players wear shirts in the Montreal Canadiens' signature colours with Montreal-based Cinar's logo on them (Cinar was the predecessor to today's Cookie Jar Entertainment) and the other team's players wear shirts in the Boston Bruins' colors with Boston-based WGBH's sting logo on them. Subsequent episodes that involve hockey also depict players wearing these sweater designs. Also, in the episode [...] "The Big Blow-Up" [...] in Season 2, a racecar driver wears a jersey with [...] "Cinar" [...] written on it and a car with [...] "WGBH" [...] written on it. In the episode [...] "Prove It" [...] in Season 4, The Brain introduces D.W. to science while watching a non-animated episode of Nova, a science series also produced by WGBH. Brown's son Tolon, for whom Brown first invented the character of Arthur the Aardvark in a bedtime story, {{is the executive director of}} the show.|$|E
60|$|It was one {{of those}} queer little shops so {{constantly}} seen in the side streets of London, which must be called toy-shops only because toys upon the whole predominate; for the remainder of goods seem to consist of almost everything else in the world--tobacco, exercise-books, sweet-stuff, novelettes, halfpenny paper clips, halfpenny <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners,</b> bootlaces, and cheap fireworks. It also sold newspapers, and a row of dirty-looking posters hung along the front of it.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the success}} in {{scissors}} and rulers, Westcott extended its product line with other office {{tools such as}} paper trimmers, <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners,</b> math kits, etc. The Westcott iPoint family of electric <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> is Acme United’s best-selling product with sales reaching $11 million in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Electric <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> were {{introduced}} in 1940. They work on the same principle as manual ones, but the cylindrical cutter is (or cutters are) rotated by an electric motor. Some electric <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> are powered by batteries rather than being plugged into a building's electrical system, making them more portable.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{development}} of dedicated <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners,</b> a pencil was sharpened by whittling it with a knife. <b>Pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> made this task much easier and gave a more uniform result. Some specialized types of pencils, such as carpenter's pencils, are still usually sharpened with a knife, due to their flat shape. However, since the 2000s, a fixed-blade device with a rotatable collar has become available.|$|E
50|$|French {{mathematician}} Bernard Lassimonne {{applied for}} the first patent (French patent #2444) on <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> in 1828, {{but it was not}} until 1847 that the pencil sharpener in its recognizable modern form was invented by fellow Frenchman Thierry des Estivaux. The first American pencil sharpener was patented by Walter K. Foster of Bangor, Maine in 1855. Electric <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> for offices have been made since at least 1917.|$|E

5000|$|One {{effect of}} this was that [...] "during World War II rotary <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> were outlawed in Britain because they wasted so much scarce lead and wood, and pencils had to be {{sharpened}} in the more conservative manner - with knives." ...|$|E

50|$|The axes of {{all gears}} are usually parallel, but for special cases like <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> and differentials, {{they can be}} placed at an angle, {{introducing}} elements of bevel gear (see below). Further, the sun, planet carrier and ring axes are usually coaxial.|$|E
50|$|Because Westcott {{was such}} a strong brand, Acme United started selling dozens of other school and office items, like scissors, <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> and paper {{trimmers}} under the Westcott name. Nowadays, Westcott sells 60 to 80 million scissors and 15 to 18 million rulers worldwide annually.|$|E
