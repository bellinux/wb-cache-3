5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} is {{a hypothesis}} {{that attempts to}} explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence {{suggests that it is}} expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the <b>presynaptic</b> to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the <b>presynaptic</b> cell in a retrograde (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a <b>presynaptic</b> component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} only a few {{proteins}} synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute to the increase in dendritic spine number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression. The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP. Late LTP is also associated with the <b>presynaptic</b> synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic vesicle number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in <b>presynaptic</b> cells as well. As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in <b>presynaptic</b> protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the <b>presynaptic</b> cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.|$|E
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} {{is currently}} a contentious subject as some investigators {{do not believe the}} <b>presynaptic</b> cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP. Even among proponents of the hypothesis there is controversy over the identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on nitric oxide, while most recent evidence points to cell adhesion proteins.|$|E
5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against <b>presynaptic</b> voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, {{dopamine}} {{functions as}} a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled {{by a set of}} mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a solute carrier—a vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, {{but it can also be}} caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the <b>presynaptic</b> cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Chemical synapses pass {{information}} directionally from a <b>presynaptic</b> cell to a {{postsynaptic cell}} {{and are therefore}} asymmetric in structure and function. The <b>presynaptic</b> terminal, or synaptic bouton, is a specialized area within the axon of the <b>presynaptic</b> cell that contains neurotransmitters enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called synaptic vesicles (as {{well as a number}} of other supporting structures and organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum). Synaptic vesicles are docked at the <b>presynaptic</b> plasma membrane at regions called active zones.|$|E
25|$|H3 receptors {{function}} as <b>presynaptic</b> autoreceptors on histamine-containing neurons.|$|E
25|$|In general, if an {{excitatory}} synapse is strong enough, an action {{potential in the}} <b>presynaptic</b> neuron will trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic cell. In many cases the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) will not reach the threshold for eliciting an action potential. When action potentials from multiple <b>presynaptic</b> neurons fire simultaneously, or if a single <b>presynaptic</b> neuron fires at a high enough frequency, the EPSPs can overlap and summate. If enough EPSPs overlap, the summated EPSP can reach the threshold for initiating an action potential. This process is known as summation, and {{can serve as a}} high pass filter for neurons.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to identify the type of inhibitory effect a <b>presynaptic</b> neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron, based on the proteins the <b>presynaptic</b> neuron expresses. Parvalbumin-expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex, whereas somatostatin-expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron.|$|E
25|$|Calcium ions {{flow through}} the <b>presynaptic</b> membrane, rapidly {{increasing}} the calcium concentration in the interior.|$|E
25|$|Cholinergic neurons—acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is {{released}} from <b>presynaptic</b> neurons into the synaptic cleft. It {{acts as a}} ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+ depolarization and increases the probability of <b>presynaptic</b> neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoreceptor}} ribbon synapse {{is around}} 30nm in thickness. It sticks {{out into the}} cytoplasm around 200-1000nm and anchors along its base to the arciform density which is an electron dense structure that is anchored to the <b>presynaptic</b> membrane. The arciform density is located within the synaptic ridge, a small evagination of the <b>presynaptic</b> membrane. Hair cells lack an arciform density so the anchor of this ribbon {{is considered to be}} invisible by electron microscope. The ribbon’s surface has small particles that are around 5nm wide where the synaptic vesicles tether densely via fine protein filaments. There are multiple filaments per vesicle. There are also voltage gated L-type calcium channels on the docking sites of the ribbon synapse which trigger neurotransmitter release. Specifically, ribbon synapses contain specialized organelles called synaptic ribbons, which are large <b>presynaptic</b> structures associated in the active zone. They are thought to fine-tune the synaptic vesicle cycle. Synaptic ribbons are in close proximity to synaptic vesicles, which, in turn, are close to the <b>presynaptic</b> neurotransmitter release site via the ribbon.|$|E
25|$|Reserpine irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{vesicular}} monoamine transporter (VMAT). This normally transports free intracellular norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the <b>presynaptic</b> nerve terminal into <b>presynaptic</b> vesicles for subsequent release into the synaptic cleft ("exocytosis"). Unprotected neurotransmitters are metabolized by MAO (as {{well as by}} COMT) in the cytoplasm and consequently never excite the post-synaptic cell. Thus, reserpine decreases metabolic rate of monoamine neurotransmitters; but also decreases magnitude of monoamine release.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurotransmitter}} {{is either}} reabsorbed by the <b>presynaptic</b> cell, and then repackaged for future release, or else it is broken down metabolically.|$|E
25|$|Reuptake pumps may {{actively}} {{pump the}} neurotransmitter {{back into the}} <b>presynaptic</b> axon terminal for reprocessing and re-release following a later action potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{process begins}} {{with a wave of}} {{electrochemical}} excitation called an action potential traveling along the membrane of the <b>presynaptic</b> cell, until it reaches the synapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} a {{neurotransmitter}} is triggered {{by the arrival of}} a nerve impulse (or action potential) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of cellular secretion (exocytosis). Within the <b>presynaptic</b> nerve terminal, vesicles containing neurotransmitter are localized near the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of calcium ions through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels at the down stroke of the action potential (tail current). Calcium ions then bind to synaptotagmin proteins found within the membranes of the synaptic vesicles, allowing the vesicles to fuse with the <b>presynaptic</b> membrane. The fusion of a vesicle is a stochastic process, leading to frequent failure of synaptic transmission at the very small synapses that are typical for the central nervous system. Large chemical synapses (e.g. the neuromuscular junction), on the other hand, have a synaptic release probability of 1. Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the <b>presynaptic</b> terminal known as SNAREs. As a whole, the protein complex or structure that mediates the docking and fusion of <b>presynaptic</b> vesicles is called the active zone. The membrane added by the fusion process is later retrieved by endocytosis and recycled for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.|$|E
25|$|Synaptic fatigue or {{depression}} is usually {{attributed to the}} depletion of the readily releasable vesicles. Depression can also arise from post-synaptic processes and from feedback activation of <b>presynaptic</b> receptors.|$|E
25|$|Ohno-Shosaku T, Tsubokawa H, Mizushima I, Yoneda N, Zimmer A, Kano M. (2002) <b>Presynaptic</b> {{cannabinoid}} sensitivity {{is a major}} {{determinant of}} depolarization-induced retrograde suppression at hippocampal synapses. J Neurosci. May 15;22(10):3864-72.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} again neurons of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system, which release noradrenaline, which, in addition, generates an inhibitory effect on <b>presynaptic</b> terminals of neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Clostridium botulinum is an anaerobic, Gram positive, spore-forming rod. Botulinum toxin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} known toxins: about one microgram is lethal to humans when inhaled. It acts by blocking nerve function (neuromuscular blockade) through inhibition of the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine's release from the <b>presynaptic</b> membrane of neuromuscular junctions in the somatic nervous system. This causes paralysis. Advanced botulism can cause respiratory failure by paralysing the muscles of the chest; this can progress to respiratory arrest. Furthermore, acetylcholine release from the <b>presynaptic</b> membranes of muscarinic nerve synapses is blocked. This can lead to a variety of autonomic signs and symptoms described above.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin is {{released}} into the synapse, or space between neurons, and diffuses over a relatively wide gap (>20µm) to activate 5-HT receptors located on the dendrites, cell bodies and <b>presynaptic</b> terminals of adjacent neurons.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} neurons of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system (SNS), which release noradrenaline, which, besides affecting postsynaptic receptors, also affects <b>presynaptic</b> α2-adrenergic receptors, inhibiting further release of noradrenaline. This effect is utilized with clonidine to perform inhibitory effects on the SNS.|$|E
25|$|CB1 receptors are coupled through Gi/o {{proteins}} and inhibit adenylyl cyclase and activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. In addition, CB1 receptors inhibit <b>presynaptic</b> N- and P/Q-type calcium channels and activate inwardly rectifying potassium channels. CB1 antagonists produce inverse cannabimimetic effects that are opposite in direction from those produced by agonists for these receptors.|$|E
25|$|Synapses may be {{described}} as symmetric or asymmetric. When examined under an electron microscope, asymmetric synapses are characterized by rounded vesicles in the <b>presynaptic</b> cell, and a prominent postsynaptic density. Asymmetric synapses are typically excitatory. Symmetric synapses in contrast have flattened or elongated vesicles, and do not contain a prominent postsynaptic density. Symmetric synapses are typically inhibitory.|$|E
25|$|Although {{atropine}} treats bradycardia (slow heart rate) {{in emergency}} settings, {{it can cause}} paradoxical heart rate slowing when given at very low doses (i.e. <0.5nbsp&mg), presumably {{as a result of}} central action in the CNS. One proposed mechanism for atropine's paradoxical bradycardia effect at low doses involves blockade of inhibitory <b>presynaptic</b> muscarinic autoreceptors, thereby blocking a system that inhibits the parasympathetic response.|$|E
25|$|Sourness is acidity, and, like salt, it is a taste sensed using ion channels. Undissociated acid diffuses {{across the}} plasma {{membrane}} of a <b>presynaptic</b> cell, where it dissociates {{in accordance with}} Le Chatelier's principle. The protons that are released then block potassium channels, which depolarise the cell and cause calcium influx. In addition, the taste receptor PKD2L1 {{has been found to}} be involved in tasting sour.|$|E
25|$|Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) {{are believed}} to increase the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by limiting its reabsorption into the <b>presynaptic</b> cell, increasing the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft available to bind to the postsynaptic receptor. They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other monoamine transporters, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.|$|E
25|$|Serotonergic neurons—serotonin. Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) {{can act as}} {{excitatory}} or inhibitory. Of {{the four}} 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is ligand gated cation channel. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase, and then further by aromatic acid decarboxylase. A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons {{has been linked to}} depression. Drugs that block the <b>presynaptic</b> serotonin transporter are used for treatment, such as Prozac and Zoloft.|$|E
25|$|Glutamate {{can cause}} {{excitotoxicity}} when {{blood flow to}} the brain is interrupted, resulting in brain damage. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from <b>presynaptic</b> neurons causing NMDA and AMPA receptor activation more so than would normally be the case outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca2+ and Na+ entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase.|$|E
25|$|Histamine H3 receptors are {{expressed}} in {{the central nervous system}} {{and to a lesser extent}} the peripheral nervous system, where they act as autoreceptors in <b>presynaptic</b> histaminergic neurons, and also control histamine turnover by feedback inhibition of histamine synthesis and release. The H3 receptor has also been shown to presynaptically inhibit the release of a number of other neurotransmitters (i.e. it acts as an inhibitory heteroreceptor) including, but probably not limited to dopamine, GABA, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, histamine and serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Neuroplasticity is {{the ability}} of a {{particular}} part or region of a neuron to change in strength over time. There are two largely recognized categories of plasticity: synaptic and nonsynaptic. Synaptic plasticity deals directly with the strength of the connection between two neurons, including amount of neurotransmitter released from the <b>presynaptic</b> neuron, and the response generated in the postsynaptic neuron. Nonsynaptic plasticity involves modification of neuronal excitability in the axon, dendrites, and soma of an individual neuron, remote from the synapse.|$|E
25|$|After premonitions {{for example}} {{in the work of}} the Portuguese {{pharmacologist}} Serafim Guimarães, α-adrenoceptor subclassification came in 1971 with the discovery of the self-regulation of noradrenaline release through α-adrenoceptors on noradrenergic synaptic terminals, <b>presynaptic</b> α-autoreceptors. Their existence was initially combated but is now established, for example by the demonstration of their messenger RNA in noradrenergic neurones.-adrenoceptors |journal =Journal of Neurochemistry |volume = 78|issue =4 |pages = 685–693| doi =10.1046/j.1471-4159.2001.00484.x}} They differed from α-receptors on effector cells and in 1974 became the prototype α2-receptors, the long-known smooth muscle contraction-mediating receptors becoming α1.|$|E
25|$|The {{synaptic}} ribbon is {{a unique}} structure at the active zone of the synapse. It is positioned several nanometers away from the pre-synaptic membrane and tethers 100 or more synaptic vesicles. Each pre-synaptic cell can have from 10 to 100 ribbons tethered at the membrane, or a total number of 1000–10000 vesicles {{in close proximity to}} active zones. The ribbon synapse was first identified in the retina as a thin, ribbon-like <b>presynaptic</b> projection surrounded by a halo of vesicles using transmission electron microscopy in the 1950s, as the technique was gaining mainstream usage.|$|E
25|$|At a {{chemical}} synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules {{into a small}} space (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron. The neurotransmitters are kept within small sacs called vesicles, and are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis. These molecules then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell's side of the synaptic cleft. Finally, the neurotransmitters must be cleared from the synapse through one of several potential mechanisms including enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by specific transporters either on the <b>presynaptic</b> cell or possibly by neuroglia to terminate {{the action of the}} transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine {{inhibits}} the <b>presynaptic</b> norepinephrine transporter (NET), {{preventing the}} reuptake of norepinephrine throughout the brain along with inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine in specific brain regions {{such as the}} prefrontal cortex, where dopamine transporter (DAT) expression is minimal. In rats, atomoxetine increased prefrontal cortex catecholamine concentrations without altering dopamine levels in the striatum or nucleus accumbens; in contrast, methylphenidate, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, was found to increase prefrontal, striatal, and accumbal dopamine levels to the same degree. In mice, atomoxetine was also found to increase prefrontal catecholamine levels without affecting striatal or accumbal levels.|$|E
