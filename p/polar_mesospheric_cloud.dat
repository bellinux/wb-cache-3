50|$|Observed {{from the}} ground, this {{phenomenon}} is known as noctilucent clouds. From satellites, PMCs are most frequently observed above 70°-75° in latitude and have a season of 60 to 80 days duration centered about a peak which occurs about 20 days after the summer solstice. This holds true for both hemispheres. Great variability in scattering is observed from day-to-day and year-to- year, but averaging over large time and space scales reveals a basic underlying symmetry and pattern.

PMSE exhibit strong signal power enhancements of scattering cross section at VHF radar frequencies in the range 50 MHz to 250 MHz, at times even to over 1 GHz, that occur in summer at high latitudes. The peak PMSE height is slightly below the summer mesopause temperature minimum at 88 km, and above the noctilucent cloud (NLC) and/or <b>polar</b> <b>mesospheric</b> <b>cloud</b> (PMC) layer at 83-84 km.

This indicates that control of polar mesospheric clouds isdetermined by geographical rather than geomagnetic factors. The brightness of polar mesosphericclouds and noctilucent clouds appears to be consistent at the latitudes where both are observed, butpolar mesospheric clouds near the pole are much brighter than noctilucent clouds, even taking intoaccount the lower sky background seen from space. <b>Polar</b> <b>mesospheric</b> <b>cloud</b> observations haverevealed that the well-known phenomenon of the northward shifting with latitude of date of peaknoctilucent cloud occurrence is partly due to the increased number of hours of noctilucent cloudvisibility with latitude and partly due to an actual northward retreat of the boundary towards the end ofthe season.|$|E

This analysis extends the spectral coverage into the visible region of the spectrum. The data reduction technique compared the cloud brightness to the brightness scattered from the background atmosphere at the same wavelength. The ratios determined in this way are independent of systematic errors in instrument radiometric calibration. The data are analyzed using theoretical determinations of the color ratios from the Mie theory of small particle scattering, assuming a lognormal distribution for the particle size dispersion.

In addition, we show that the time/lagged correlation between these summer mesospheric temperatures and the ECMWF winter stratospheric temperatures displays a strong Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). The sign and phase of the correlation is consistent with the QBO modulation of the extra-tropical stratospheric dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere via the Holton-Tan mechanism (Holton and Tan, 1980). This lends strength to the identification of synoptic and planetary waves as the driver of the inter-hemispheric coupling, and results in a strong QBO modulation of the polar summer mesospheric temperatures...|$|E

Here using both mesospheric MF radar wind observations from Rothera Antarctica (67 °S, 68 °W) as well as stratospheric analysis data, we present observational evidence that the stratospheric and mesospheric wind strengths are highly anti-correlated, and show their largest variability in November. We find that these changes are related to the total amount of ozone loss that occurs during the Antarctic spring ozone hole and particularly with the ozone gradients that develop between 57. 5 °S and 77. 5 °S. The results show that with increasing ozone loss during spring, winter conditions in the stratosphere and mesosphere persist longer into the summer.

OMI PMC local time variations are closely coupled to concurrent variations in measurement scattering angle, so that ice phase function effects must be considered when interpreting the observations. Two different phase functions corresponding to bright and faint clouds are examined in this analysis. OMI observations show maximum frequency and albedo values at 8 - 10 h local time in the Northern Hemisphere, with decreasing amplitude at higher latitudes.

40|$|The middle {{atmosphere}} {{is a very}} important part of the Earth system. Until recently, we did not realize the importance of the structure of this vaporous shell and of the fundamental role it plays in both creating and sustaining life on the planet. Thanks to the development and improvement of new sounding methods and techniques, our knowledge of the composition of the atmosphere has become more detailed than ever before. We have also learned how to reveal complex interactions between different species and how they react to the incoming solar radiation. The middle part of the Earth’s atmosphere serves as a host for the <b>Polar</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Clouds.</b> These clouds consist of a thin layer of water-ice particles, only exsisting during the summer months and only close to the poles. There are indications that the occurrence of <b>Polar</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Clouds</b> may be linked to climate change. It has been pointed out that the first sightings coincide with the industrial revolution. Satellite observations have shown that <b>Polar</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Clouds</b> have become brighter and possibly more widely distributed during the 20 th century. The clouds might therefore be suited as indicators of the variability of the climate - a good reason for studying this night-shimmering phenomena. The clouds can also be used as a proxy for middle atmospheric dynamics. In order to fully utilize <b>Polar</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Clouds</b> as tracers for atmospheric variability and dynamics, we need to better understand their local properties. The Optical Spectrograph and Infra-Red Imager System (OSIRIS) is one of two instruments installed on the Odin satellite. The optical spectrograph of this instrument observes sunlight scattered by the atmosphere and thus the <b>Polar</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Clouds.</b> This thesis deals with a tomographic technique that can reconstruct both horizontal and vertical structures of the clouds by using observations from various angles of the atmospheric region. From this information, microphysical properties such as particle sizes and number densities are obtained. The tomographic technique presented in this thesis also provides a basis for a new satellite concept - MATS. The idea behind the MATS satellite mission is to analyze wave activity in the atmosphere over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, based on the scientific heritage from Odin/OSIRIS and the tomographic algorithms presented in this thesis.

40|$|AbstractObservations by the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) {{instrument}} on the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite {{have demonstrated}} the existence of <b>Polar</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Cloud</b> (PMC) regions populated by particles whose mean sizes range between 60 and 100 nm (radii of equivalent volume spheres). It is known from numerous satellite experiments that typical mean PMC particle sizes are {{of the order of}} 40 – 50 nm. Determination of particle size by CIPS is accomplished by measuring the scattering of solar radiation at various scattering angles at a spatial resolution of 25 km 2. In this size range we find a robust anti-correlation between mean particle size and albedo. These very-large particle-low-ice (VLP-LI) clouds occur over spatially coherent areas. The surprising result is that VLP-LI are frequently present either in the troughs of gravity wave-like features or at the edges of PMC voids. We postulate that an association with gravity waves exists in the low-temperature summertime mesopause region, and illustrate the mechanism by a gravity wave simulation through use of the 2 D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA). The model results are consistent with a VLP-LI population in the cold troughs of monochromatic gravity waves. In addition, we find such events in Whole Earth Community Climate Model/CARMA simulations, suggesting the possible importance of sporadic downward winds in heating the upper cloud regions. This newly-discovered association enhances our understanding of the interaction of ice microphysics with dynamical processes in the upper mesosphere...|$|E

The AGWs modulate the PMC albedo, ice water content, and particle size, creating concentric ring patterns. On only one occasion (13 July 2007), the concentric AGWs in PMCs were aligned with AGWs with similar shapes observed in 4. 3 µm radiance in the lower stratosphere, as measured by Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). Coincident AIRS and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer nadir measurements of 8. 1 µm radiance reveal a region of deep convection in the troposphere close to the estimated centers of the AGWs in the stratosphere, strongly suggesting that convection is the wave source. The AGWs in CIPS on 13 July 2007 were ~ 1000 [*]km away from the observed deep convection. Three other concentric AGWs in PMCs were 500 – 1000 [*]km away from deep convection in the troposphere, while no convection was observed related to the wave on 29 July 2009. We perform a 2 -D ray tracing study for the AGW event on 13 July 2007. The calculated propagation distance is much shorter than the distance between the AGWs in PMCs and the observed convection. The 2 -D ray tracing study indicates that the AGWs in PMCs and in the stratosphere are probably excited by different tropospheric convective systems...|$|E

40|$|The SBUV/ 2 (Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet, model 2) {{instrument}} {{is designed to}} monitor ozone stratospheric profile and total column ozone using measurements of the Earth's backscattered ultraviolet albedo. We have previously demonstrated that the normal radiance measurements from SBUV/ 2 instruments, which sample 12 discrete wavelengths between 252 and 340 nm during each scan, {{can be used to}} identify polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs). Some SBUV/ 2 instruments also periodically view the earth in continuous scan mode, covering the wavelength range 160 - 400 nm with 0. 15 nm sampling. Analysis of these data show PMC occurrence rates similar to the normal discrete scan results, although the observation technique reduces the number of daily measurements by a factor of six. PMC observed by SBUV/ 2 instruments show a monotonic variation in the residual spectral albedo over the wavelength range 250 300 nm, with maximum enhancements of 10 15 % at 250 nm. This result is consistent with microphysical model predictions from Jensen [1989. A numerical model of <b>polar</b> <b>mesospheric</b> <b>cloud</b> formation and evolution, Ph. D. Thesis, University of Colorado]. We find no evidence for a systematic localized increase in PMC residual albedo for wavelengths near 260 nm, in contrast to the recently reported results from the MSX UVISI instrument [Carbary J. F., et al., 2004. Evidence for bimodal particle distribution from the spectra of polar mesospheric clouds. Geophysics Research. Letters 31, L 13108]. This result is observed for three different SBUV/ 2 instruments in both Northern and Southern Hemisphere data over a 13 -year span. Our Mie scattering calculations show that the location and magnitude of the 260 nm hump feature is dependent upon the specific scattering angles appropriate to the MSX measurements. Although it explains the MSX spectrum, the bimodal size distribution proposed by Carbary et al. (2004), cannot explain the lack of scattering angle dependence of the SBUV/ 2 spectral shapes. The spectral signature of the SBUV/ 2 continuous scan PMC data is thus inconsistent with the bimodal particle size distribution suggested by Carbary et al. (2004) ...|$|E
40|$|A special {{observation}} mode of the Odin satellite {{provides the}} first simultaneous measurements of water vapour, temperature and <b>polar</b> <b>mesospheric</b> <b>cloud</b> (PMC) brightness {{over a large}} geographical area while still resolving both horizontal and vertical structures in the clouds and background atmosphere. The observation mode was activated during June, July and August of 2010 and 2011, and for latitudes between 50 and 82 ° N. This paper focuses on the water vapour and temperature measurements carried out with Odin's sub-millimetre radiometer (SMR). The tomographic retrieval approach used provides water vapour and temperature between 75 and 90 km with a vertical resolution of about 2. 5 km and a horizontal resolution of about 200 km. The precision of the measurements is estimated to 0. 2 ppmv for water vapour and 2 K for temperature. Due to limited information about the pressure at the measured altitudes, the results have large uncertainties (> 3 ppmv) in the retrieved water vapour. These errors, however, influence mainly the mean atmosphere retrieved for each orbit, and variations around this mean are still reliably captured by the measurements. SMR measurements are performed using two different mixer chains, denoted as frequency mode 19 and 13. Systematic {{differences between the two}} frontends have been noted. A first comparison with the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment instrument (SOFIE) on-board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite and the Fourier Transform Spectrometer of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE-FTS) on-board SCISAT indicates that the measurements using the frequency mode 19 have a significant low bias in both temperature (> 15 K) and water vapour (> 0. 5 ppmv), while the measurements using frequency mode 13 agree with the other instruments considering estimated errors. PMC brightness data is provided by OSIRIS, Odin's other sensor. Combined SMR and OSIRIS data for some example orbits is considered. For these orbits, effects of PMCs on the water vapour distribution are clearly seen. Areas depleted of water vapour are found above layers with PMC, while regions of enhanced water vapour due to ice particle sedimentation are primarily placed between and under the clouds...|$|E
