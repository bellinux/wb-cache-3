There are three grinding roller wheel assemblies in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.The fixed-axis roller in each roller wheel assembly rotates on a segmentally-lined grinding table that is supported and driven by a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>reducer</b> direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The two gears of {{the double}} circular-arc helical gear is a mesh of a concave/convex combination. Because the {{curvature}} is close to each other, the strength also increased and thus, it is often used in heavily-loaded workplaces. The national standard for double circular-arc helical gear (ex., GB 12759 - 91) {{is based on the}} size of the gear module to design its tooth profile. This shows that tooth geometric-related designs are quite complicated. If the effect of the different pressure angle parameter is considered, we would be unable to conduct relevant studies for the original standard formula with a double circular-arc helical gear set at a pressure angle of 24 °. Firstly, this paper would redefine a new double circular-arc helical gear according to the discontinuousness tooth profile molded line {{of the double}} circular-arc helical gear and unchangeable pressure angle and explain the improvements in the design and stress analysis of the tooth especially since the double circular-arc helical gear has no limitation in the minimum number of teeth.
