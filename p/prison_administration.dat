5|$|Number 10, {{also known}} as the Superintendent's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} limestone walls and a corrugated iron roof behind parapet walls.

The house was initially built in 1853 for the Chaplain, but was taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and was later used by the <b>prison</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the <b>prison</b> <b>administration</b> – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E

25|$|Generally, when {{an inmate}} {{arrives at a}} prison, they go through a {{security}} classification screening and risk assessment that determines {{where they will be}} placed within the prison system. Classifications are assigned by assessing the prisoner's personal history and criminal record, and through subjective determinations made by intake personnel (which include mental health workers, counselors, prison unit managers, and others). This process will {{have a major impact on}} the prisoner's experience, determining their security level, educational and work programs, mental health status (e.g. will they be placed in a mental health unit), and many other factors. This sorting of prisoners is one of the fundamental techniques through which the <b>prison</b> <b>administration</b> maintains control over the inmate population, and creates an orderly and secure prison environment.

2500|$|Having found a liberty {{interest}} in avoiding placement in OSP, the Court {{went on to}} consider whether Ohio afforded its inmates the required procedural protections. [...] The particular protections required emerged from a three-part balancing test first articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge, [...] [...] The three factors are (1) the private interest affected by the official action, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation by the procedures used, and the marginal value of any increased protections, and (3) {{the burden on the}} government that adding those increased protections would impose. [...] After weighing these factors, the Court concluded that Ohio afforded its inmates the requisite procedures. [...] The {{interest in}} avoiding assignment to a Supermax facility must be [...] "evaluated... {{within the context of the}} prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties." [...] Ohio afforded inmates notice that it was considering placing them in OSP and a fair opportunity for rebuttal; this was consistent with the procedural protections afforded in other <b>prison</b> <b>administration</b> contexts. [...] Furthermore, Ohio's requirement that it explain the factual basis for the classification review and offer the inmate an opportunity for rebuttal [...] "safeguards against the inmate being mistaken for another or being singled out for insufficient reason". [...] At each of the three levels, the reviewing administrator can decline to recommend OSP placement, at which point the process terminates. [...] The Court found this arrangement preferable to Ohio's former system, under which inmates were sometimes placed in OSP without any explanation at all. [...] Because the inmate will always have an explanation of the reasons for recommended OSP placement, he will always have something to argue against when he proceeds to the next level of review or comes up for his next suitability hearing.|$|E

30|$|This framing {{in terms}} of group {{equality}} has been present in multiple {{other aspects of the}} contractual negotiations. The <b>prison</b> <b>administrations,</b> for example, explicitly distanced themselves from any political considerations regarding religious extremism in their hiring procedures for the chaplaincy by referring to the equal neutrality of the state towards all religious groups.

However, state actors insisted on state neutrality regarding the regulation of theological content and concepts and therefore left it up to the Muslim community to choose their appellation.|$|R

6000|$|This is {{the popular}} view of crime; yet no dog goes mad from choice, and {{probably}} {{the same is true}} of the great majority of criminals, certainly in the case of crimes of passion. Even in cases where self-interest is the motive, the important thing is to prevent the crime, not to make the criminal suffer. Any suffering which may be entailed by the process of prevention ought to be regarded as regrettable, like the pain involved in a surgical operation. The man who commits a crime from an impulse to violence ought to be subjected to a scientific psychological treatment, designed to elicit more beneficial impulses. The man who commits a crime from calculations of self- interest ought to be made to feel that self-interest itself, when it is fully understood, can be better served by a life which is useful to the community than by one which is harmful. For this purpose it is chiefly necessary to widen his outlook and increase the scope of his desires. At present, when a man suffers from insufficient love for his fellow-creatures, the method of curing him which is commonly adopted seems scarcely designed to succeed, being, indeed, in essentials, the same as his attitude toward them. The object of the <b>prison</b> <b>administration</b> is to save trouble, not to study the individual case. He is kept in captivity in a cell from which all sight of the earth is shut out: he is subjected to harshness by warders, who have too often become brutalized by their occupation.[53] He is solemnly denounced as an enemy to society. He is compelled to perform mechanical tasks, chosen for their wearisomeness. He is given no education and no incentive to self-improvement. Is it to be wondered at if, at the end of such a course of treatment, his feelings toward the community are no more friendly than they were at the beginning? ...|$|E

Those practices, argue the author, lead to ignore important changes in trends and to avoid questioning the meaning of those. The limited interest in research using more sophisticated indicators — that could add usefully informations to the data published regularly by the <b>prison</b> <b>administrations</b> —, international comparisons between data not necessarily comparable, references to old statistics, all result in everyone continuing to attribute to France the European championship in terms of pre-trial detention, while the actual situation could be totally different.
