6000|$|There was the mainmast, fifteen {{inches in}} {{diameter}} at what was now the butt, still sixty-five feet in length, and weighing, I roughly calculated, at least three thousand pounds. And then came the foremast, larger in diameter, and weighing surely thirty-five hundred pounds. Where was I to begin? Maud stood silently by my side, while I evolved in my mind the contrivance known among sailors as “shears.” But, though known to sailors, I invented it there on Endeavour Island. By crossing and lashing the ends of two spars, and then elevating them {{in the air like}} an inverted “V,” I could get a point above the deck to which to make fast my <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> To this <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle</b> I could, if necessary, attach a second <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> And then there was the windlass! ...|$|R
50|$|By 1914 Bentalls had 600-700 employees. During {{the first}} world war they took on female workers for the first time, and the {{workshop}} was equipped with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hoists.</b> After the war, though, the fortunes of the company declined - largely due to its involvement in the Agricultural & General Engineers association. After A G E went bust in 1933 Bentalls gradually began to recover.|$|R

40|$|Citation: Butterfield, Joseph Abbott. An {{original}} {{design for a}} traveliing crane with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hoist.</b> Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1898. Introduction: The following drawings, formulae, figures and specifications are for a traveling crane designed especially for the foundry in the K. S. A. C. It is to raise the load six ft. and the maximum load is to be two tons. It is to travel on a bridge made of two channel beams; these beams will be specified in a later drawing. This is a special design because {{it is designed to}} secure the most possible head room where but very little was available, {{and at the same time}} as little length wise space as possible was to be used. The Differential Chain Hoist is to be attached to lift small loads that would be cumbersome to handle fro the ground and are too small to us e the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hoist.</b> There is no hard and fast rule that the specifications must be adhered to, because many of the rules and formulae by which they were obtained were only close approximations. It not being possible to secure exact data. First will be the Cylinder This is to be 40 ” long inside to inside of heads.

60|$|The houses {{near the}} sea have not fared so well. They are {{built in the}} water on piles, and are all of them {{warehouses}} with projections in front, from which hang blocks and <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> These projections resemble heads; the piles look like legs; {{and it does not}} require a very strong effort of imagination to believe that the warehouses are great living creatures which have waded into the sea, and are looking earnestly down into the water to observe how the fish are getting on.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} an {{hour the}} single and double blocks came {{together}} {{at the top of the}} shears. I could hoist no more. And yet the mast was not swung entirely inboard. The butt rested against the outside of the port rail, while the top of the mast overhung the water far beyond the starboard rail. My shears were too short. All my work had been for nothing. But I no longer despaired in the old way. I was acquiring more confidence in myself and more confidence in the possibilities of windlasses, shears, and <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackles.</b> There was a way in which it could be done, and it remained for me to find that way.|$|R
50|$|Production lathes were {{obviously}} of key {{importance in the}} war years, however on 14 November 1940 the Smallpeice and Cromwell factories in Coventry were completely destroyed by a large air-raid. Production of the Multicut lathe was resumed by a relationship with Alfred Herbert Ltd, as the Herbert-Smallpeice Lathe. While, {{in the village of}} Marton, work continued on pneumatic devices, and the company Martonair was formed. A new product, the Martonair <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hoist,</b> found a strong market in wartime factories due to the large proportion of women involved in production. In 1941 the head office was moved to a disused dance hall in Parkshot near Richmond, Surrey. While Martonair thrived, Cosby was working on a new precision lathe, something now in short supply. The design was put out to tender in December 1944, and the first lathe was produced for Smallpeice Ltd by J Evans & Sons of Portsmouth in October 1945 (though at the time they were in Frome, where they had been relocated during the war).|$|R
60|$|In {{less than}} an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was {{constructing}} the shears. Lashing the two topmasts together, and making allowance for their unequal length, at the point of intersection I attached the double block of the main throat-halyards. This, with the single block and the throat-halyards themselves, gave me a <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> To prevent the butts of the masts from slipping on the deck, I nailed down thick cleats. Everything in readiness, I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and carried it directly to the windlass. I was growing to have faith in that windlass, for it gave me power beyond all expectation. As usual, Maud held the turn while I heaved. The shears rose in the air.|$|R
60|$|But we did {{not have}} to wait long, and the problem solved itself. In the morning, after several trials, I found the point of balance in the {{foremast}} and attached my <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle</b> a few feet above it. Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down while I heaved. Had the windlass been in order {{it would not have been}} so difficult; as it was, I was compelled to apply all my weight and strength to every inch of the heaving. I had to rest frequently. In truth, my spells of resting were longer than those of working. Maud even contrived, at times when all my efforts could not budge the windlass, to hold the turn with one hand and with the other to throw the weight of her slim body to my assistance.|$|R
5000|$|Cosby Donald Philipps Smallpeice (1896-1977) was an English {{engineer}} {{involved in}} design of precision and production lathes, and <b>pneumatic</b> tools and <b>hoists.</b> He created the company Martonair, {{and on its}} flotation in 1966 he founded The Smallpeice Trust to provide opportunities for engineering students. Much {{of the history of}} Cosby Smallpeice is covered in a publication by The Smallpeice Trust titled [...] "A Smallpeice of History", which documents the history of the founder, the trust, and its ongoing training programmes.|$|R

5000|$|The Pyramid Play {{was first}} used unsuccessfully in a game on October 28, 1933, against Washington State College (now Washington State University) without much fanfare. [...] The play was used again on November 11, 1933, against the University of Oregon during the annual Civil War game at Multnomah Stadium, now Providence Park. The Beavers had a 6'5" [...] (1.97 m) center named Clyde Devine and two 6'2" [...] (1.88 m) tackles named Harry Fields and Ade Schwammel. The two <b>tackles</b> <b>hoisted</b> Devine upon their shoulders. [...] With the {{combination}} of their height and Devine's long arm span, they succeeded in blocking one of Oregon's two kicks. [...] The play is [...] "probably the most notorious on-field shenanigan" [...] {{in the history of}} the Civil War game.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel-Lift (also {{called a}} [...] "spectacle lift") - {{evolved from the}} hook and chain {{technology}} to produce a large metal yoke that can be fitted under the front or rear wheels to cradle them, drawing the front or rear end of the vehicle clear of the ground by a <b>pneumatic</b> or hydraulic <b>hoist</b> {{so it can be}} towed. This apparatus generally picks up the drive wheels of the vehicle (i.e. the front wheels if it is front wheel drive, the rear wheels if it is rear wheel drive) touching only the tires. The wheel lift was designed by Arthur W. Nelson of Weld Built Body Co. in 1967. The name spectacle lift is common in Europe; the cradle resembles a pair of squared spectacles (eyeglasses). Medium and heavy trucks use a variation, the [...] "underlift" [...] or [...] "chassis lift", which lifts the axle or frame instead of the wheels. Wheel-lift trucks can have adapters which can also lift the chassis.|$|R
60|$|In his {{own small}} room Martin lived, slept, studied, wrote, and kept house. Before the one window, looking {{out on the}} tiny front porch, was the kitchen table that served as desk, library, and type-writing stand. The bed, against the rear wall, {{occupied}} two-thirds of the total space of the room. The table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau, manufactured for profit and not for service, the thin veneer of which was shed day by day. This bureau stood in the corner, and in the opposite corner, on the table's other flank, was the kitchen--the oil-stove on a dry-goods box, inside of which were dishes and cooking utensils, a shelf on the wall for provisions, and {{a bucket of water}} on the floor. Martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink, there being no tap in his room. On days when there was much steam to his cooking, the harvest of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous. Over the bed, <b>hoisted</b> by a <b>tackle</b> to the ceiling, was his bicycle. At first he had tried to keep it in the basement; but the tribe of Silva, loosening the bearings and puncturing the tires, had driven him out. Next he attempted the tiny front porch, until a howling southeaster drenched the wheel a night-long. Then he had retreated with it to his room and slung it aloft.|$|R
60|$|One of the {{attending}} harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable {{hole in the}} lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging, slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two <b>tackles</b> <b>hoisting</b> and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.|$|R
