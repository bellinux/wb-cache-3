5|$|Millwall began {{life on the}} Isle of Dogs and {{inhabited}} {{four different}} grounds in the club's first 25 years. Their first home was a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> ground called Glengall Road, where they only stayed for one year. From 1886 to 1890 they played behind The Lord Nelson pub on East Ferry Road, which {{was known as the}} Lord Nelson Ground, before being forced to leave by the landlady, who received a better offer for its use.|$|E

Founded in Aberdeen in 1849 to supply sailing ships with food, the company opened their first English cannery and food processing plant at Millwall dock in 1872 and attracted a workforce from across the country, including {{the east coast of}} Scotland, primarily Dundee. The club secretary was 17-year-old Jasper Sexton, the son of the landlord of The Islander pub in Tooke Street where Millwall held their club meetings. Millwall Rovers' first fixture was held on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> ground on Glengall Road, on 3 October 1885 against Fillebrook, a team that played in Leytonstone. The newly formed team were beaten 5–0.|$|E

As interest grew, they moved to an enclosed field in the Sparkbrook area where admission could be charged. In 1877, they decamped again, this time paying £5 a year to the family of a team member to rent a field adjacent to Muntz Street, in the Small Heath district, which became their home for the next 29 years.|$|E

It in honor of the later village upon which the British named the entire colony and the combined city Madras. Controversially, in an attempt to revise history and justify renaming the city as Chennai, the ruling party has purged the history of the early English Madras settlements. According to the new party history, instead of being named Madras, it was named Chennai, after a village called Chennapattanam, in honour of Damerla Chennappa [...] mudirasa Nayaka, father of Damerla Venkat mudirasa [...] Nayaka, who controlled the entire coastal country from Pulicat in the north to the Portuguese settlement of Santhome.|$|E

The NIR spectra for different color samples had a little difference in the shape and the intensity.

2500|$|After 1825 a horse tramway {{led from}} the High Horse Level round {{the edge of the}} marsh to a picking floor {{near the top of the}} Swart Beck. Here, <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> rock were {{separated}} from ore by hand and dumped. The ore was then crushed, originally by hand using wide-headed hammers (called buckers). A crushing mill was erected in about 1827, probably using a roller crusher powered by a water wheel, although this still required ore to be broken by hand (known as [...] "knocking") into pieces less than [...] in size. Water was also used to separate the galena from the gangue in hotching tubs. These worked by jigging the crushed mixed ore up and down in a tub of water; the heavier galena worked its way to the bottom of the swirling mixture and the lighter gangue to the top. There were probably no slime pits at this date, so very fine lead ore and mud in the water polluted the beck and the lake. Until 1828 the concentrated ore was taken to the High Wath smelter at Caldbeck.|$|R

40|$|Issue: All wood acts abrasively on {{processing}} equipment. Recovered {{wood waste}} is especially abrasive {{because of the}} presence of non-wood contaminants within it. The abrasive characteristics <b>of</b> wood <b>waste</b> cause short- and long-term equipment maintenance problems. These maintenance problems include excessive wear on size-reduction equipment and material-handling equipment. Overall, the abrasiveness of the wood itself leads to long-term equipment wear problems, although normal wear on sensitive pieces like chipper blades requires regular sharpening. The non-wood contaminants, however, will sometimes lead to short-term, or even catastrophic, equipment wear problems. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends implementing several techniques at wood-waste processing facilities that minimize wear in size-reduction equipment and material-handling equipment. Wear-Minimizing Methods Fines Removal. Fine sawdust, dirt, and grit are especially abrasive materials common at wood-waste processing facilities. These small particles can find their way into every mechanical system and cause extensive equipment wear problems. Every effort should be made to screen these fines and all small wood from the large <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> wood <b>waste</b> early in the process. The screened fines can be designated for lowvalue hogged fuel or mulch products...|$|R
