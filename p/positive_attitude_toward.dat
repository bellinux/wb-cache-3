However, he disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and Ras T.

5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses. Conservative Judaism holds that the Oral Law is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.|$|E

40|$|Background: Health {{professionals}} frequently exhibit negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> {{people with}} mental disorders. It is not known whether stigmatising attitudes among pharmacy students predict less <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> consumer participation in decision-making about medications. Aims: (1) To assess the attitudes of pharmacy students toward people with schizo-phrenia, and (2) to determine whether stigma predicts less <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> concordant medication counselling. Method: All pharmacy students enrolled in a fi ve-year degree program were invited to participate. Students completed the seven-item Social Distance Scale, six items related to stereotypical attributes of people with schizophrenia and the 14 -item Leeds <b>Attitudes</b> <b>Toward</b> Concordance Scale. Results: Completed survey instruments were received from 157 students (94 % response rate). Previous employment in a pharmacy and personal experience of a mental disorder were associated with low social distance. Later year of study, believing that people with schizophrenia are diffi cult to talk to, and believing people with schizophrenia have themselves to blame were predictive of high social distance. Low social distance and later year of study were associated with <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> providing concordant medication counselling. Conclusion: Mental health stigma was common and predictive of less <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> consumer participation in decision-making about medications.

500|$|Fortune was {{particularly}} {{concerned with the}} issue of sex. In her early works she displayed a prudish attitude regarding sexuality, warning her readers about the perceived perils of masturbation, extra-marital sex, same-sex sexual activity, abortion, and free love. The only form of sexual expression that she considered appropriate was that between a heterosexual married couple, and she promoted a form of 'psychic masturbation' to quell any sexual urges that a celibate individual may have. According to Richardson, she was [...] "a prude, at least by today's standards". In her later works she exhibited a more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> sexuality, describing the sexual union between a man and woman as the most powerful expression of a [...] "life-force" [...] which flows throughout the universe. She believed that this erotic attraction between men and women could be harnessed for use in magic. She urged her followers to be naked under their robes when carrying out magical rituals, for this would increase the creative sexual tension between the men and women present. Although sex features in her novels, it is never described in graphic detail. Nevertheless, her later occult novels entail depictions of heterosexual sex outside of marriage, suggesting that by this point Fortune no longer believed that sex must be restrained to wedlock.|$|E
