5|$|The {{concept and}} origin of Burnt Norton is {{connected}} to Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. The poem discusses the idea {{of time and the}} concept that only the <b>present</b> <b>moment</b> really matters because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the <b>present</b> <b>moment</b> and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the <b>present</b> <b>moment</b> as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

25|$|Another Theravada {{interpretation}} of the twelve links sees them as explaining psychological or phenomenological processes in the <b>present</b> <b>moment.</b> In Buddhaghosa's Sammohavinodani, a commentary to the Vibhanga of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the principle of Dependent Origination is explained as occurring entirely within the space of one mind moment. According to Prayudh Payutto there is material in the Vibhanga which discusses both models, the three lifetimes model and the phenomenological mind moment model.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist teachings {{explain the}} moment-to-moment {{manifestation of the}} mind-stream. The {{components}} {{that make up the}} mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the <b>present</b> <b>moment</b> is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws. The Buddhist practice of mindfulness involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} Atlantis is a lost land has {{made of it}} a metaphor for {{something}} no longer attainable. For the American poet Edith Willis Linn Forbes (1865-1945), “The Lost Atlantis” stands for idealisation of the past; the <b>present</b> <b>moment</b> can only be treasured once that is realised. Ella Wheeler Wilcox finds the location of “The Lost Land” (1910) in one’s carefree youthful past. Similarly, for the Irish poet Eavan Boland in “Atlantis, a lost sonnet” (2007), the idea was defined when “the old fable-makers searched hard for a word/ to convey that what is gone is gone forever”.|$|E

25|$|Gestalt Therapy, an {{approach}} created by Fritz Perls, {{was based on}} phenomenology, existentialism and also Zen Buddhism and Taoism.

Other authors in Gestalt Therapy who were influenced by Buddhism are Barry Stevens (therapist) and Dick Price (who developed Gestalt Practice by including Buddhist meditation).|$|E

25|$|According to Jewish teachings, hell is {{not entirely}} physical; rather, it can be {{compared}} to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which makes up for the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of God, one is said to be in Gehinnom. This is not meant to refer to some point in the future, but to the very <b>present</b> <b>moment.</b> The gates of teshuva (return) are said to be always open, and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the Torah.|$|E
25|$|If special {{relativity}} is true, then each observer {{will have their}} own plane of simultaneity, which contains {{a unique set of}} events that constitutes the observer's <b>present</b> <b>moment.</b> Observers moving at different relative velocities have different planes of simultaneity hence different sets of events that are present. Each observer considers their set of present events to be a three-dimensional universe, but even the slightest movement of the head or offset in distance between observers can cause the three-dimensional universes to have differing content. If each three-dimensional universe exists, then the existence of multiple three-dimensional universes suggests that the universe is four-dimensional. The argument is named after the discussions by Rietdijk (1966) and Putnam (1967). It is sometimes called the RietdijkPutnamPenrose argument.|$|E

Pope Alexander then gave a sermon on the trinities of virtues appropriate to a pope, to a prelate, and to subjects. Then Cardinal Cossa ascended the pulpit and read out a decree of the Pope, in which he gave his approval to all acts conducted by the cardinals between 3 May 1408 {{and the beginning of the}} Council on 25 Marcy 1409, as well as to all acts of the Council itself down to that <b>present</b> <b>moment,</b> supplying whatever might have been lacking in any of those acts.|$|E
