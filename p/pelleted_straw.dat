We assessed the nutrient cycling properties of three bedding materials (peat, wood shavings and <b>pelleted</b> <b>straw)</b> in horse manure by comparing their compostability, ability to retain nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) under rainfall and capacity to release N when mixed with soil. Manure with <b>pelleted</b> <b>straw</b> bedding had superior composting characteristics as it lost half of its dry mass, reached temperatures > 60  °C and ended up having a carbon (C) to N (C:N) ratio of < 15. In percolated water, 4 – 11 % of total manure N and 5 – 23 % of total manure P was leached during a 2 h 15 min event of artificial rainfall. Peat manure was most susceptible to P loss. In all fresh manures, C:N ratio exceeded 30, which led to net N immobilization in soil. Composting decreased the C:N leading to a slight positive or an insignificant fertilizer effect...|$|E
40|$|Eight Holstein steers (216 ± 48 kg body weight) {{fitted with}} ruminal and {{duodenal}} cannulas {{were used to}} evaluate effects of wheat straw processing (ground vs pelleted) at two straw inclusion rates (7 % and 14 %; dry matter basis) in dry rolled or steam-flaked corn-based finishing diets on characteristics of digestion. The experimental design was a split plot consisting of two simultaneous 4 × 4 Latin squares. Increasing straw level reduced ruminal (p 0. 10) by wheat straw level. Likewise, straw level did not influence ruminal acetate and propionate molar proportions or estimated methane production (p> 0. 10). Pelleting straw did not affect (p≥ 0. 48) ruminal digestion of OM, NDF, and starch, or microbial efficiency. Ruminal feed N digestion was greater (7. 4 %; p = 0. 02) for ground than for pelleted wheat straw diets. Although ruminal starch digestion was not affected by straw processing, post-ruminal (p 0. 14) by corn processing. However, microbial N flow to the small intestine and ruminal N efficiency (non-ammonia N flow to the small intestine/N intake) were greater (p< 0. 01) for steam-flaked than for dry rolled corn-based diets. Ruminal pH and total VFA concentration were not affected (p≥ 0. 16) by corn processing method. Compared with dry rolled corn, steam-flaked corn-based diets resulted in decreased acetate:propionate molar ratio (p = 0. 02). It is concluded that at 7 % or 14 % straw inclusion rate, changes in physical characteristics of wheat straw brought about by pelleting negatively impact OM digestion of both steam-flaked and dry-rolled corn-based finishing diets. This effect is due to decreased post-ruminal starch digestion. Replacement of ground straw with <b>pelleted</b> <b>straw</b> also may decrease ruminal pH...|$|E

A prospective way for the degradation of EDs at WwTP can be their removal by ligninolytic fungi.

Sprayed pellet preference was evaluated in two sessions conducted in two consecutive weeks. Each session consisted of three two-choice presentations performed on three consecutive days.

40|$|Biochar {{has been}} heralded as a {{promising}} technology for {{climate change mitigation}} that can also benefit soils. Biochar is a carbonaceous solid produced by pyrolysis of biomass – the thermal decomposition of plant and plant-derived matter {{in the absence of}} oxygen. When added to soils, biochar has the potential to increase crop yields and suppress soil emissions of greenhouse gases, whilst sequestering carbon in a stable form. In addition to biochar, biomass pyrolysis produces liquids and gases that can serve as biofuels. Biochar production systems that generate excess heat or power are particularly environmentally and economically attractive. Rotary kilns are the favoured process reactor in many industries, given their potential to handle a wide range of feedstocks and provide good process control. This thesis investigates the potential to coproduce biochar and excess biofuels by slow pyrolysis in a pilot-scale rotary kiln. The work attempts to progress towards the ultimate aim of scaling up the rotary kiln and optimising its operating conditions to produce biochar of good quality along with an excess of useful biofuels. Experimental work, involving the development and application of new methodologies, was used {{to gain a better understanding}} of the process. The data gathered were then used to support preliminary numerical simulation efforts towards the development of a comprehensive process model. Five biomass feedstocks were considered: softwood <b>pellets,</b> miscanthus <b>straw</b> <b>pellets,</b> wheat <b>straw</b> <b>pellets,</b> oilseed rape <b>straw</b> <b>pellets</b> and raw rice husks. The granular flow of biomass feedstocks was observed in a short closed drum faced with acrylic and resting on rollers. All pelletized feedstocks displayed similar angles of repose, validating the use of softwood pellets as a model biomass for these feedstocks. Bed mixing, which can improve product uniformity, was slow under typical operating conditions, requiring 5 min to complete at 4 rpm for softwood pellets. Mixing quickened considerably at higher rotation rates. A digital image analysis method was developed to measure the distribution of solid residence times inside the rotary kiln. The mean residence time of softwood pellets ranged from 19 to 37 min under typical operating conditions, decreasing with increases in kiln rotation rate, but mostly unaffected by feeding rates. These findings show that kiln rotation rates must be selected to balance the residence time of solids inside the kiln with bed mixing levels. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry were performed on samples of ground softwood pellets under five different heating profiles to study the kinetics and heat flows of the pyrolysis process. Both exothermic and endothermic regions were identified, with most reactions taking place between 250 °C and 500 °C. Results suggest that exothermic pyrolysis reactions can be promoted by altering the process heating rate, thereby improving net biofuel yield from the process. The thermogravimetric data collected was used to develop a distributed activation energy model (DAEM) of the kinetics of softwood pellet pyrolysis for integration into a comprehensive model of the process. The applicability of the kinetic model to large-scale processes was confirmed using a simplified process model developed to simulate biomass pyrolysis inside the pilot-scale rotary kiln. Although crude, the simplified process model produced sufficiently accurate estimates of char yield for preliminary design purposes. The simplified model also allowed important process parameters, such as kiln filling degree, solid residence time and heating rate, to be evaluated. A series of pyrolysis experiments was performed on the pilot-scale rotary kiln to evaluate the yields of biochar and biofuels and determine the temperature profile inside the kiln. This work required the design of a suspended thermocouple system that measures temperatures along the kiln, both in the gas phase and inside the solid bed. For most experiments at 550 °C, a region of high temperature gas and solids was observed, possibly indicative of exothermic reactions. Biochar yield varied from 18...|$|R

50|$|The use {{of straw}} in {{large-scale}} biomass power plants is becoming mainstream in the EU, with several facilities already online. The straw is either used {{directly in the}} form of bales, or densified into pellets which allows for the feedstock to be transported over longer distances. Finally, torrefaction of straw with pelletisation is gaining attention, because it increases the energy density of the resource, making it possible to transport it still further. This processing step also makes storage much easier, because torrefied <b>straw</b> <b>pellets</b> are hydrophobic. Torrefied straw {{in the form of}} pellets can be directly co-fired with coal or natural gas at very high rates and make use of the processing infrastructures at existing coal and gas plants. Because the torrefied <b>straw</b> <b>pellets</b> have superior structural, chemical and combustion properties to coal, they can replace all coal and turn a coal plant into an entirely biomass-fed power station. First generation pellets are limited to a co-firing rate of 15% in modern IGCC plants.|$|R
30|$|The PMP {{results are}} {{presented}} in Fig.  2 b. The different nature of transportation fuels means that higher PMP values are expected in the fossil diesel system, rather than in fossil H 2 and NG systems. As a result, the PMP result of the fossil diesel is approximately two times {{the value of the}} other two reference systems. Benefits are achieved only when FT diesel is produced. The reduction in PM potential is 48, 11, and 8 % for TB pellets, TW <b>pellets,</b> and <b>straw</b> <b>pellets,</b> respectively. In general, the conversion stage of the FT systems, i.e., the excess electricity and by-products, has a positive effect. The much better PMP of TB-based FT diesel system is due to the torrefaction pretreatment. Torrefaction strongly enhances energy densification which results in benefits in the transportation stages. Furthermore, due to the decreased electricity requirements in the pelletization step, additional benefits are achieved in the TB-based FT diesel system. Finally, concerning the SNG and bio-H 2 systems, the increase in the PMP is so large due to biomass cultivation and collection, gasification and gas cleaning, as well as biofuel conversion stages. The former two result in requirements on diesel and electricity, whereas the latter does not result in by-products that offer benefits, except for the straw-based SNG system.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the life cycle}} assessment of electricity generation from <b>straw</b> bales and <b>pellets.</b> <b>Straw</b> is the most abundant biomass residue in Europe and its use for energy purposes is promoted on the premise of high greenhouse gas savings. This assumption has delayed the study of sustainability of straw-fired systems on a broader sense and {{the literature on the}} topic is almost absent. This study uses data from specific literature and emissions inventories to model a number of straw pathways. The plant modeled is a medium-scale straw-fired power plant of 50 MWth capacity. The results show that electricity from straw-fired power plants can indeed realize high greenhouse gas savings compared both with existing coal plants and with the European electricity mix. The savings are in the range 70 – 94 %. The influence of the geographical origin of straw is analyzed by using datasets for the cultivation of wheat in five different European countries. The highest emissions are recorded for the case of straw from Spain due to the small yields, whereas cultivation processes in United Kingdom and the Netherlands show high environmental impacts due to the high level of fertilization. Other environmental impacts are evaluated, such as acidification potential, eutrophication, particulate matter emissions, and photochemical ozone formation. The bioenergy system scores worse than the current European electricity mix for all the categories. However, it is important to notice that in Spain and United Kingdom the straw system shows lower impacts compared with the local average coal electricity. Finally, the study investigates the ‘break-even’ distance at which the higher emissions from the pellets production are paid off by the saved emissions in their transport compared with the bales. The results show that no reasonable break-even distance exists for road transport, whereas advantages for pellets are evident in any configuration for transoceanic transport. JRC.

40|$|Combining {{co-firing}} biomass {{and carbon}} capture and storage (CCS) in power plants offers attractive potential for net removal {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) from the atmosphere. In this study, the impact of co-firing biomass (wood <b>pellets</b> and <b>straw</b> <b>pellets)</b> on the emission profile of power plants with {{carbon capture and storage}} has been assessed for two types of coal-fired power plants: a supercritical pulverised coal power plant (SCPC) and an integrated gasification combined cycle plant (IGCC). Besides, comparative life cycle assessments have been performed to examine the environmental impacts of the combination of co-firing biomass and CCS. Detailed calculations on mass balances of the inputs and outputs of the power plants illustrate the effect of the different content of pollutants in biomass on the capture unit. Life cycle assessment results reveal that 30 % co-firing biomass and applying CCS net negative CO 2 emissions in the order of 67 - 85 g/kWh are obtained. The impact in all other environmental categories is increased by 20 - 200 %. However, aggregation into endpoint levels shows that the decrease in CO 2 emissions more than offsets the increase in the other categories. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that results are most sensitive to parameters that affect the amount of fuel required, such as the efficiency of the power plant and assumptions regarding the supply chains of coal and biomass. Especially, assumptions regarding land use allocation and carbon debt of biomass significantly influence the environmental performance of BioCCS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{aimed to explore}} the {{nutrient}} content, relative feed values (RFV) and in vitro true digestibilities (IVTD) of wheat straw and soybean <b>straw</b> <b>pellets</b> produced {{with the addition of}} molasses, guar meal and sepiolite. In this experiment, 16 groups were created for 2 different straws (wheat/soybean straws), 2 different sepiolite applications (available/not available) and 4 different applications (control, guar meal, molasses, guar meal+molasses) in accordance with the 2 × 2 × 4 factorial design. A Daisy incubator was used to determine the IVTD of the feeds. According to the results, molasses and guar meal increased the RFV of soybean straws, while molasses and guar meal treatments and sepiolite did not affect the RFV of wheat straws. It was observed that sepiolite increased the RFV’s of soybean straw for guar meal and guar meal+molasses. The higher IVTD’s were found for guar meal (without sepiolite) treatment of soybean straw and guar meal (with sepiolite) treatment of wheat straw. Molasses and guar meal addition to wheat and soybean straws improved the crude protein contents. In conclusion, <b>straw</b> <b>pelleting</b> can be used as an alternative forage conservation method to close the gap in forage supply during the winter...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{research}} on the pyrolysis and gasification of randomly packed <b>straw</b> <b>pellets</b> was conducted {{with an emphasis on}} the reactive properties of the shrinking porous structure of the pellets. The apparent kinetics of such pyrolysis was approximated by the random pore, grain, and volumetric models. The best approximation results were obtained with the grain and random pore models. The self-organized oscillations of the pellet conversion rate during pyrolysis were observed. Two complementary explanations of the phenomenon are proposed. QC 20150324 </p...|$|R

40|$|Combustion of a biomass with an {{enhanced}} content of chlorine (Cl) {{can result in}} operational problems including deposit formation and superheater corrosion. The strategies to reduce such problems include co-combustion {{and the use of}} additives. The positive effects of such measures are mainly due to sulphation of the alkali chlorides (KCl for biomass) to less corrosive alkali sulphates or capture of released alkali (K) in components such as potassium aluminium silicates. A mixture of wood <b>pellets</b> and <b>straw</b> <b>pellets</b> was fired in a 12 MW circulation fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. PVC was added to the fuel in order to achieve a further enhanced reference level of gaseous KCl during certain tests. Two strategies were applied to decrease the risk for superheater corrosion by reducing gaseous KCl and content of chlorine in deposits. The strategies were sulphation of KCl by injection of ammonium sulphate and co-combustion with peat. During co-combustion of biomass with peat both sulphation of KCl and capture of released K in ash components can be of importance. The results were evaluated by means of several advanced measurement tools including IACM (on-line measurements of gaseous KCl), deposit measurements (chemical composition in collected deposits, initial corrosion), ash analysis (chemical composition in fly ashes). The overall performance was better for ammonium sulphate, which significantly reduced gaseous KCl. Meanwhile almost no chlorine was found in the deposits. Only a minor reduction of gaseous KCl was obtained during co-combustion of biomass with peat although the chlorine content in the deposits was greatly reduced...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a life cycle {{analysis of the}} production of electricity using straw bales and <b>straw</b> <b>pellets.</b> <b>Straw</b> is the most abundant residue in Europe and its use for energy purposes is promoted at every level. However, while studies on the sustainability of the production of liquid biofuels from straw, no literature exists {{regarding the use of}} this material for the production of power and heat. Moreover, while straw is nowadays mostly used in bales and traded locally, the production of agri-pellets could create great opportunities to promote and develop international trade markets for biomass fuels. This study uses data from specific literature and emissions inventories in order to model the considered straw pathways. The plant modeled is a medium-scale straw-fired power plant of 50 MWth input capacity. The straw is supplied by trucks from a range of 70 km distance (for the base case). The results indicate that electricity from straw-fired power plants can guarantee high GHG savings in the range of 65 – 80 %. The highest emissions are recorded for the case of straw from Spain due to the very small yields, while cultivation processes in UK and The Netherlands show high emissions due to the large level of fertilization used. Other environmental impacts are analyzed, such as acidification potential, eutrophication, respiratory effects and terrestric ecotoxicity. The bioenergy system scores largely worse than the reference system for all these categories. Important to notice the impact that heavy metal emissions from biomass combustion could have on terrestric ecotoxicity. Finally, the study investigated the “break-eve” distance at which the higher emissions due to the pellets production are paid off by the saved emissions in road transport. The results show that with the assumptions made, actually no reasonable break-even distance exist and even up to 800 km of feedstock transport it would still be better to use straw bales. JRC.

40|$|Abstract: Bioethanol is {{considered}} an alternative to fossil fuels in the transportation sector. The use of pellets for heating is another efficient way to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. This paper evaluates the techno-economic performance of a biorefinery system in which an existing {{combined heat and power}} plant integrates with the productions of bioethanol and <b>pellets</b> using <b>straw</b> as feedstock. A two-stage acid hydrolysis process for bioethanol production is used, and two different drying technologies are chosen for drying hydrolysis solid residues. A sensitivity analysis on critical parameters, such as the bioethanol selling price and feedstock price, is performed. The bioethanol production cost is also calculated for two cases at the conditions of ten-year and five-year payback time. The results show that the first case is a more feasible economic configuration at present, having an over 30 % production cost reduction compared with the conventional cogeneration plants of bioethanol and solid fuel...|$|R
