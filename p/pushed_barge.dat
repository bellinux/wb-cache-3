40|$|Nowadays {{predicting}} {{transportation costs}} {{is more and}} more important. Most significant part of inland navigation's costs are the costs of fuel. Fuel consumption is related to operating conditions of ship's propulsion system and its resistance. On inland waterways the ship resistance is strictly related to the depth of the waterway. There is a tendency to build a formula that allows its user to calculate the resistance of any inland waterway vessel, but researches claim that most of them are accurate only for particular types of ships and/or operating conditions. The paper presents selected methods of calculating ship resistance on inland waterways. These methods are examined for different types of ships and different conditions using results of model tests. The performed comparison enabled selecting the best option for pushboats and <b>pushed</b> <b>barge</b> trains, but also showed that any of the tested methods is good enough to be used for calculating the resistance of motor cargo vessels. For this reason, based on known equations and using the regression method, the authors have formulated a new method to calculate the resistance of motor cargo vessels on limited waterway. The method makes use of ship's geometry and depth of waterway in relation to ship's speed. Correlating the ship's speed with its resistance and going further with fuel consumption, enables to calculate the costs of voyage depending on the delivery time. The comparison of the methods shows that the new equation provides good accuracy in all examined speed ranges and all examined waterway depths...|$|E

5000|$|A pusher, pusher craft, pusher boat, pusher tug, or towboat, is a boat {{designed}} for <b>pushing</b> <b>barges</b> or car floats. In the United States, the industries that use these vessels {{refer to them}} as towboats. These vessels are characterized by a square bow, a shallow draft, and typically have knees, which are large plates mounted to the bow for <b>pushing</b> <b>barges</b> of various heights. These boats usually operate on rivers and inland waterways. Multiple barges lashed together, or a boat and any barges lashed to it, are referred to as a [...] "tow" [...] and can have dozens of barges. Many of these vessels, especially the long distances, or long haul boats, include living quarters for the crew.|$|R

50|$|Canadian National Tug no. 5, or CN Tug no. 5, was a tugboat {{owned and}} {{operated}} by the Canadian National Railway (CNR) company on Okanagan Lake in British Columbia, Canada. She was launched on May 8, 1930 and was a steel tug that <b>pushed</b> railway <b>barges</b> to the Okanagan Landing shipyard and railway connection to transport fruit. By the 1950s and 1960s, CNR had three tugs: MV Pentowna, CN Tug no. 6, and CN Tug no. 5. Only one tug operated at a time, though two would be used in busy times, and each tug only <b>pushed</b> one <b>barge.</b> CNRs competitor on the lake, the Canadian Pacific Railway company, ran three tugs at a time, as well as many sternwheelers over the years, and each tug <b>pushed</b> two <b>barges.</b> Although the date of CN Tug no. 5s retirement is unknown, CNR terminated barge service on the lake in 1973, retiring its last ship, CN Tug no. 6, due to the highways and other modes of transportation that had emerged by that time.|$|R

[...] Despite the hurricane force centered on Mississippi, neighboring areas were also affected: when New Orleans began slowly flooding with high east/north winds, a 28-foot (9m) storm surge eastward from Bay St. Louis devastated coastal areas with 30–55foot (17m) sea waves, flooding 12miles (19km) inland. [...] The waves <b>pushed</b> <b>barges,</b> oil rigs, ships, and debris into submerged towns to flatten many coastal buildings across to Pascagoula with 20-foot (6 m) surge, [...] and into Alabama with 15-foot (5m) surge and 24-foot (7m) waves battering beach houses inside Mobile Bay and tilting the battleship [...] [...] (See extensive details below).|$|R
50|$|An opduwer or opdrukker {{is a small}} tug- or towboat {{that was}} used in the Low Countries to <b>push</b> <b>barges</b> on inland waterways. Opduwers were {{predominantly}} in use {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. During that time the internal combustion engine got adapted for inland shipping. Earlier, barges were propelled either by sail or by towing from shore by horse or manpower. Fitting an engine and propeller to an existing barge was found cumbersome however. It was easier to construct a small tugboat and use this to propel the existing barge.Opduwers were built between about 1910 to 1940. A large number survive as pleasure craft.|$|R
