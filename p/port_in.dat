40|$|Previous {{studies have}} not {{considered}} one {{important aspect of}} <b>port</b> efficiency; seaports <b>in</b> different groups operate under different technologies. This study examines the technical efficiency (TE) of 43 <b>ports</b> <b>in</b> Vietnam and their influential factors using metafrontier analysis. The results show that cargo handling facilities and information technology {{are the most important}} inputs for ports, despite their varying contribution to port performance across regions. Land is important for the TE of <b>ports</b> <b>in</b> the North, whereas the cargo storage capacity is important to <b>ports</b> <b>in</b> the Central areas, and information technology is important to <b>ports</b> <b>in</b> the South. The majority of Vietnamese ports are operating under increasing returns to scale. On the other hand, each region needs a different approach. For example, <b>in</b> ideal situations, <b>ports</b> <b>in</b> the North could reduce berth length by up to 57 % without affecting throughput. National and regional reference networks are developed to identify the leading ports at the regional and national levels and their connections with other ports...|$|R
