40|$|Aging is {{characterized}} by progressive, degenerative changes in many tissues. To elucidate the relationships among degenerative changes in Caenorhabditis elegans, we developed methods to measure age-related changes quantitatively and analyzed correlations among these changes by using a longitudinal study. The age-related declines of pharyngeal <b>pumping</b> and <b>body</b> movement were positively correlated {{with each other and}} lifespan. These findings suggest that the declines of pharyngeal <b>pumping</b> and <b>body</b> movement cause a decline in survival probability or that a shared regulatory system mediates the declines in pharyngeal <b>pumping,</b> <b>body</b> movement, and survival probability. Furthermore, measurements of these processes can be used to predict lifespan and detect premature aging. The declines of physiological processes were measured in daf- 2, age- 1, daf- 16, eat- 2, and clk- 1 mutants that have altered lifespans. Each mutant strain displayed changes in one or more age-related declines, but the correlations among age-related changes were similar to WT. These measurements were used to generate a system of four stages that describes the aging process and is useful for the analysis of genetic and environmental effects on aging...|$|R

In 1932, ESCO opened its first stainless steel industrial service center.

Gray {{cast iron}} is {{traditionally}} {{used in many}} industries because it is characterized by flexibility of use, excellent castability, low cost, wide range of achievable mechanical properties [1]. The Italian company Casappa SpA that produces gear pumps for the hydraulic power industry gave the motivation of this study. The company extensively uses pearlitic gray cast iron to manufacture <b>pump</b> <b>bodies</b> of complex three-dimensional shape that are subjected to dynamic service loading conditions.

50|$|In the {{regeneration}} phase the <b>pump</b> <b>body</b> {{is heated}} to 300 °C to drive off water vapor {{that does not}} desorb at room temperature and accumulates in the molecular sieve. It takes typically 2 hours to fully regenerate a pump.|$|E
50|$|Circulator pumps {{as used in}} {{hydronic}} {{systems are}} usually electrically powered centrifugal pumps. As used in homes, they are often small, sealed, and rated {{at a fraction of}} a horsepower, but in commercial applications they range in size up to many horsepower and the electric motor is usually separated from the <b>pump</b> <b>body</b> by some form of mechanical coupling. The sealed units used in home applications often have the motor rotor, pump impeller, and support bearings combined and sealed within the water circuit. This avoids one of the principal challenges faced by the larger, two-part pumps: maintaining a water-tight seal {{at the point where the}} pump drive shaft enters the <b>pump</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
50|$|In pump design, {{a spacer}} {{coupling}} is a cylindrical piece installed between the pump shaft coupling hub and motor shaft coupling hub.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of modernization of gear micropump casing in order to achieve minimization of overall dimensions and mass of the construction. Three different cases of the pump casing size were analyzed during numerical simulations with the use of finite element method (FEM). The dimensions of the first of the casings were identical to prototype unit, the second model was characterized by 15 % reduction in size and the third casing was reduced by 25 %. During the analysis, stress and displacement distribution in pump casings were observed. In the first modernized casing (85 %), maximal stress value was equal to 104 MPa, and the maximal value of displacement 0. 012 mm. In the second modification of pump casing (75 %), the highest stress values achieved 134 MPa, and maximal displacement 0. 017 mm.

50|$|Pump Mounted Driver: Relates to thermal failures. The PMD is screwed to the DS-4 {{injection}} pump on the 1994-2001 GM 6.5 diesel utilizing fuel flow to dissipate heat. The {{injection pump}} is {{mounted in the}} intake valley (a high heat area). The PMD contains two power transistors that should be cooled by proper contact with the injection <b>pump</b> <b>body.</b> If the pump is not precisely machined to make complete contact with the transistors via the silicone thermal gasket and paste, the PMD is improperly installed without the gasket or paste, the PMD is installed off center with the <b>pump</b> <b>body,</b> or corrosion develops on the mounting surface the PMD will overheat. Several companies manufacture an extension harness and heat-sink kits. These allow an owner or their mechanic to relocate the PMD away from the injection pump to a lower heat environment and/or a place that can get more air flow.|$|E

50|$|A {{submersible}} pump (or sub pump, electric {{submersible pump}} (ESP)) is a device {{which has a}} hermetically sealed motor close-coupled to the <b>pump</b> <b>body.</b> The whole assembly is submerged in the fluid to be pumped. The main advantage {{of this type of}} pump is that it prevents pump cavitation, a problem associated with a high elevation difference between pump and the fluid surface. Submersible pumps push fluid to the surface as opposed to jet pumps having to pull fluids. Submersibles are more efficient than jet pumps.|$|E
50|$|Feedwater pumps {{range in}} size up to many {{horsepower}} and the electric motor is usually separated from the <b>pump</b> <b>body</b> by some form of mechanical coupling. Large industrial condensate pumps may also serve as the feedwater pump. In either case, to force the water into the boiler, the pump must generate sufficient pressure to overcome the steam pressure developed by the boiler. This is usually accomplished {{through the use of}} a centrifugal pump.Another common form of feedwater pumps run constantly and are provided with a minimum flow device to stop overpressuring the pump on low flows. The minimum flow usually returns to the tank or deaerator.|$|E
5000|$|Designers have {{a number}} of {{problems}} to overcome in designing axial piston pumps. One is managing to be able to manufacture a pump with the fine tolerances necessary for efficient operation. The mating faces between the rotary piston-cylinder assembly and the stationary <b>pump</b> <b>body</b> have to be almost a perfect seal while the rotary part turns at perhaps 3000 rpm. The pistons are usually less than half an inch (13 mm) in diameter with similar stroke lengths. Keeping the wall to piston seal tight means that very small clearances are involved and that materials have to be closely matched for similar coefficient of expansion.|$|E

5000|$|Water level sensing switch type - Pressure {{switches}} {{are fully}} enclosed, usually inside the <b>pump</b> <b>body,</b> making them immune to obstructions or floating debris in the sump basin. Float switches, particularly the types {{attached to the}} end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. Pressure switches are typically factory set and not adjustable, while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.|$|E
