On this view Government as a guarantor of basic human rights, has the responsibility to intervene with universal public policies, heterogeneous and comprehensive to provide a minimum of welfare for all citizens. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze the change in public policies approach in Argentina and Government role through the analysis of the Universal Child Allowance for Social Protection (AUH, 2009) and its extension to the <b>Pregnancy</b> <b>Allowance</b> for Social Protection (AxE, 2011). This measure seeks to provide access to social protection in cases where the labor path is not necessarily formal, showing a shift in social protection policies. In Argentina, the AUH has as a short term goal to reduce the poverty, extreme poverty and inequity and to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by encouraging the formation of human capital through health and education conditionalities and coordination with programs that contribute to the realization of rights, as the "Plan Nacer" and the "Conectar Igualdad”. Empirical evidence suggests that AUH has had positive impacts however, there is still a long way in reinforcing the vision of public policy that considers citizens as right subjects. On the other hand, it is also necessary to investigate the heterogeneity of the productive structure so as to articulate employment with social protection policies. ...|$|E

40|$|Background:The Policy for Women Labors in the Act No. 1 1951 {{states that}} women {{are not allowed to}} work 1, 5 months before and after bearing a child. However, up to the present time, its {{implementation}} is not effective. Objective:This explorative research uses quantitative and qualitative approach which objective is to observe the knowledge, attitude and behavior of the woman labourers towards their right of child birth leave. Method of his research is also aimed at observing the employers in imlementing the child birth leave right of the woman labourers and the ralated constraints of the practices. The qualitiative samples consist of 300 respondens of the woman labourers and the qualitative samples consist of 18 employers “Depnaker” staff, 18 SPSI members and 15 woman labourers. Instruments for collecting data are questionaire and interviewguides. Qualitative data are analysed by using frequency distribution while qualitative data are analysed by using content analysis. Result:The research results shows that the knowledge and attitude of the woman labourers towards the rights of child birth leave are good enough. However in practice it is not well implemented as that in the regulation, because employers never give additional wages, such as <b>pregnancy</b> and childbirth <b>allowances</b> despite their agreement to implement it. Conclusion:Most employers are not consistent in implementing the right of child birth leave. It {{can be seen from the}} fact that the implementation is met only to each own company 2 ̆ 7 s condition. Those who have had or are in the process of having PKB for example are more consistent than those who have not. Contraints of the implementation of childbirth leave are as follows: 1). Not all employers well comprehend the right of child births leave, 2). The surveillance and empowerment of Disnaker is not effective, 3) The law enforcement to the employers who break the rules is very weak, and 4). The role of SPSI in giving supervision is not yet significant...|$|R
