5000|$|Inserted {{between the}} ends of the slats, under the saki-gawa, is a <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> [...] (saki-gomu), and under the tsuka-gawa there is a small square of metal [...] (chigiri), that holds the slats in place.|$|E
5000|$|His {{most famous}} {{supposedly}} invention is the grey [...] "S Plug" [...] (Split-)Wallplug made from plastic materials (Polyamide) {{and is available}} in various shapes and sizes since 1958 (see Wall plug). But the <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> was already in 1957 patented by Oswald Thorsmann, Sweden, who won the honour in court. Fischer held over 1100 patents and overtook Thomas Alva Edison, who held 1093 patents. Fischer also held 5867 trade rights and invented fischertechnik.|$|E
50|$|The largest by turnover, this {{division}} manufactures {{a range of}} anchors used in the construction and DIY industry including <b>plastic</b> <b>plugs,</b> steel anchors, chemical anchors {{and a range of}} associated products such as SaMontec, solar-fix and screws.|$|R
50|$|In the UK and {{mainland}} Europe, {{windows in}} new-build houses are usually fixed with long screws into expanding <b>plastic</b> <b>plugs</b> in the brickwork. A gap {{of up to}} 13 mm is left around all four sides, and filled with expanding polyurethane foam. This makes the window fixing weatherproof but allows for expansion due to heat.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} the Ural-4320 and Ural-5557 {{have had their}} {{headlights}} located on the bumper, and the old attachment points for headlights appear as <b>plastic</b> <b>plugs.</b> However, on special order for the Ministry of Defence, the factory supplied the truck with a narrow bumper and headlights in the wings, {{on either side of}} the grille.|$|R
50|$|There are two sub-types of plug, {{that differ}} {{only in the}} type of {{contacts}} used. One contact is suitable for solid (single strand) copper conductors and the other is suitable for stranded or tinsel wire copper conductors. The crimper may also permanently deform part of the <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> body {{in such a way that}} it grips the outer sheath of the cable. This helps to keep the plug securely fastened to the end of the cable, by providing strain relief.|$|E
50|$|Motors are {{electrically}} ignited with {{an electric}} match consisting of a short length of pyrogen-coated nichrome, copper, or aluminum bridgewire pushed into the nozzle and held in place with flameproof wadding, a rubber band, a <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> or masking tape. On top of the propellant is a tracking delay charge, which produces smoke but in essence no thrust, as the rocket slows down and arcs over. When the delay charge has burned through, it ignites an ejection charge, {{which is used to}} deploy the recovery system.|$|E
5000|$|Blank {{cartridges}} frequently {{contain a}} paper, wood or <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> called a wad which seals the powder in the case. This wad can cause severe penetrating wounds {{at close range}} and bruising at medium ranges. There is also [...] "muzzle blast" [...] - a cloud of hot, expanding gas expelled at extremely high velocity from the muzzle of the firearm. This high velocity gas can inflict severe injury (see powerhead for an example) at close ranges. In addition, {{if there is any}} small debris lodged inside the barrel it will be expelled at a velocity similar to that of a bullet, with the ability to inflict a severe or lethal wound. Furthermore, the extremely loud noise of blanks being fired can damage the hearing of people in the immediate area.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{techniques}} are developed {{to study and}} measure the shear-wave velocity in an aluminum cylindrical shell subjected to a radial impact. The radial impact is obtained by exploding an electrical detonator inserted in <b>plastic</b> <b>plugs</b> mounted {{on the end of}} the shell. Strain gages, mounted on the outside surface of the shell at various axial locations, are used to obtain oscilloscope traces from which the shear-wave velocity can be calculated...|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} two Basic Rate Interface (BRI) ISDN connectors; the system shipped with <b>plastic</b> {{blocking}} <b>plugs</b> inserted in these connectors.|$|R
5000|$|Espalier {{plants on}} solid walls are usually {{installed}} six to twelve {{inches from the}} base of that wall, to allow space below ground for roots to grow in all directions as well as space above ground for good air circulation and pest control. [...] Supports for wire guides, which are generally necessary to train an espalier into a design, are installed first, directly into a wall constructed of suitable material. [...] Masonry walls are ideal for placing U-bolts, eye bolts, or eye screws, anchored with either <b>plastic</b> <b>plugs</b> or expandable lead shields, directly into the mortar joints. [...] Wooden walls may be better fitted with galvanized nipples, using turnbuckles for adjustment of the wire tautness.|$|R
5000|$|The VX {{cassette}} {{itself had}} both reels of 1/2 in magnetic tape stacked {{on top of}} each other in a coaxial fashion (much like the earlier Philips [...] "VCR" [...] and Cartrivision formats) in the bottom half of the tape, with a circular opening on the underside of the top half of the cassette, where the video head drum would enter. The tape in this opening was pre-formed in a loop to go around the head drum, eliminating the need for the tape to be pulled out of the cassette and threaded around the drum (as with later videocassette formats such as VHS and Betamax). The opening was protected by a cylindrical <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> to protect the tape, which was unscrewed from the opening when the tape was loaded in the machine (by means of moving a horizontal lever on the front of the machine), and inserted back into the tape when ejected (by moving the lever back).|$|E
50|$|Armour of God {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in parts of what was then Yugoslavia: Zagreb (Dolac Central Market), Upper town, Trnje (near the then-unfinished building of Croatian Radio Television), Croatia, and Predjama Castle near Postojna, Slovenia. Filming was also undertaken in Graz, Austria, France, Spain and Morocco. During filming of the opening sequence, one scene called for Jackie Chan to jump from a wall to a tree branch. The first take went as planned, but Chan insisted on re-shooting the scene. On his second attempt, the branch broke and he fell 5 metres to the ground below. His head hit a rock, cracking his skull and forcing a piece of bone up into his brain. Chan was flown {{to the hospital and}} was in surgery eight hours later. As a result, he now has a permanent hole in his head filled with a <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> and slight hearing loss in one ear. Chan replaced Eric Tsang as director following the accident. Footage of the accident is shown during the film's ending credits.|$|E
50|$|Stopcocks {{are often}} parts of {{laboratory}} glassware such as burettes, separatory funnels, Schlenk flasks, and columns used for column chromatography. The stopcock is a smooth tampered plug or rotor with a handle, which fits into a corresponding ground glass female joint. The stationary female joint is designed {{such that it}} joins two or more pieces of glass tubing. The stopcock has holes bored through it which allow the tubes attached to the female joint to be connected or separated with partial turns of the stopcock. Most stopcocks are solid pieces with linear bores although some are hollow with holes to simple holes that can line up the joints tubing. The stopcock is held together with the female joint with a metal spring, <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> retainer, a washer and nut system, {{or in some cases}} vacuum. Stopcocks plugs are generally made out of ground glass or an inert plastic like PTFE. The ground glass stopcocks are greased to create an airtight seal and prevent the glass from fusing. The plastic stopcocks are at most lightly oiled.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of supernova remnants (SNRs) represents a useful and natural laboratory for gasdynamics studies. In this paper {{the results of}} several hydrodynamical simulations of the propagation and early phases of interaction of two SNRs embedded in a homogeneous interstellar environment are shown. In particular, the hydrodynamic evolution and collision of twin SNRs during their self-similar stage has been simulated using a two-dimensional Lagrangian hydrocode. In addition, {{the results of a}} detailed simulation that attempts to set the adequate conditions to reproduce the same phenomenon through laser ablation of two <b>plastic</b> <b>plugs</b> at the laboratory scale are presented. These results indicate that both large-scale and small-scale simulations display several common features {{that can be used to}} design an experiment aimed to validate the hydrodynamical codes. Of particular interest are the structures found around the juncture of the two colliding shells produced by the interaction of the remnants. Postprint (published version...|$|R
5000|$|Classic plugs {{float on}} the surface or suspend in the water, but will dive {{under the surface of}} the water and swim with a {{side-to-side}} wobbling movement (hence the alternative name wobbler) upon retrieval, which usually consists of slow to medium fast reel in. This makes the bait seen like a real fish which attracts predatory fish such as [...] bass and [...] pike. <b>Plastic</b> <b>plugs</b> can dive to either a very shallow depth, due to a small lip, or to a moderately deep depth (i.e. several meters), due to a large lip. The angle of the bib also affects diving depth. Sometimes, plugs are named after their diving ability, e.g. [...] "deep-diver" [...] or [...] "shallow-diver". Plugs can also be designed to hover (neutral buoyancy), sink slowly, or sink rapidly. Some have a small metal ball inside to [...] "rattle" [...] when retrieved.|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} problem with rigid prosthetic stems {{applied in the}} finger bones, {{as well as in}} other bones of the upper and lower extremity, is resorption of bone at the interface. An investigation was carried out using a <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> which would more evenly distribute the stresses to the bone, with fine ridges to produce enhanced fixation by bony ingrowth. A total knee prosthesis in the cat was used as the model, radiographic and histological studies being made at up to one year. A finite element analysis identified areas of high interface and material stresses. With a finely grooved plug, bone ingrowth occurred in all regions except for the region near the bone entry, where the finite element analysis showed the highest interface shear stresses and bone material stresses to occu...|$|E
40|$|As {{a part of}} the RAIL {{feasibility}} study, Operation Dorothe (March 1961) {{was conducted}} to determine if a liquid explosive could survive the acceleration of launch from a 155 mm howitzer. This operation was successful, although some structural difficulty was experienced with the test round (C- 90). Upon completion of that exercise, it was decided to design a test round that could be used with the more viscous slurry-type explosives, and to fire several of these new rounds with inert filler prior to their use with slurry High Explosives (H. E.), precluding the difficulty previously experienced. The C- 91 projectile, is a modified M 107 H. E. round. It has been reduced in weight, equipped with an obturator, and provided with a large fill orifice. The rotating band has been altered to eliminate rotation. Internally, a <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> is used to control column height. A piston-type `O` ring seal prevents gun gas from reaching the interior to the projectile. Four of these projectiles were fired from a 155 mm howitzer at 15, 500 g`s, plus. They survived not only the launch, but also impact and repeated ricochet in sand, gravel, and small rock. No leakage of the inert filler (glycerin) occurred. All rounds were destroyed with explosives upon completion of the exercise. Test data and engineering drawings are provided...|$|E
50|$|In {{the system}} {{originally}} developed by FFV for the Carl Gustav, a <b>plastic</b> blowout <b>plug</b> is {{placed at the}} center rear of the shell casing containing the projectile and propellant, which itself is enclosed in the AT4 outer tube. When the gases build up to the correct pressure level, the blowout plug disintegrates, allowing the proper amount of gases to be vented to the rear, balancing the propellant gases pushing the projectile forward.|$|R
50|$|During the interwar period, the Rawlplug company {{tried and}} {{patented}} {{a number of}} new fixing solutions and tools. Several types of wall plugs were among them including the Rawlbolt, the first solution for heavier loads and the world’s first mechanical anchor. In the tooling area, Rawlplug offered customers tools such as a mechanical hammer drill and electric soldering iron. After the war, the company came up with the first metal drywall anchor in 1947 and in the 1960’s they began to offer <b>plastic</b> wall <b>plugs,</b> which became the industry standard at that point.|$|R
50|$|GM {{recalled}} 1.5 million {{vehicles with}} this engine on April 14, 2009 due to risk of fire from engine oil leaking under the valve cover gaskets onto hot exhaust manifolds. The fire could {{spread to the}} nearby <b>plastic</b> spark <b>plug</b> wire retainers on the valve cover {{and then to the}} rest of the engine compartment. GM fitted the affected vehicles with redesigned spark plug wire retainers. These engines were noted for having problems with the plastic upper intake manifold cracking around the EGR passage. The engine would then hydrolock. The lower intake gaskets and upper intake manifolds were revised, correcting all these issues.|$|R
40|$|Lisianthus/Eustoma {{has emerged}} as one of the top ten cut flower crops in {{international}} flower trade during the past few years. It is a prominent cut flower from Japan where it has been in cultivation since 1960. The main reason behind its growing popularity is the range of varieties available as different series with vast charming colour shades, flower shapes, suited for growing under varying agro climatic conditions, having a good vase life. Studies carried out at H. R. S & T. Kandaghat and on the farmers ’ fields with Echo Double series, Roshita series and Flamenco series from Sakata Seeds, Japan and 10 new double flowering cultivars from Miyoshi Seeds, Japan during 2010 - 2012 have indicated that pelleted seed sowing of Lisianthus was basically done in conventional germination media containing sieved soil, FYM, leaf mould, coco peat and sand in 98 cavity <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> trays. The initial germination percentage obtained was 90 % but the final seedling survival was only 68 percent. Final transplanting of seedlings was done after 65 - 80 days of sowing. Responses obtained from growers have indicated that Lisianthus took approximately 6 months to come into full bloom under mid hill conditions. April sown seed resulted in flowering stems after 150 - 185 days of sowing in September, followed by a second flush in October- November.

40|$|A {{limitation}} {{with the}} current analytical models for predicting {{the performance of a}} magnetorheological (MR) damper is that they fail to capture the hysteretic variation of force versus velocity variation correctly. This can significantly underestimate the damper force and overestimate the dynamic range of the device. In this work a transient analytical fluid dynamics model is developed by using a combination of Laplace and Weber transform and Duhamel’s superposition of velocity boundary condition, to overcome these limitations. The solution of the system of nonlinear simultaneous equations, obtained by applying mass flow balance, velocity compatibility conditions and force equilibrium of Bingham <b>plastic</b> <b>plug</b> flow, gives the damper force. This method is shown to generate direct and inverse model of an MR device. The proposed model has been validated against a commercially available MR damper at low speed, to a range of test signals. The mean error using the above model {{has been shown to be}} 5 % for all the test signals. This compares well with three conventional models which give; transient constant velocity model 35 %, quasi static model 35 % and phenomenological model 35 %. The phenomenological model gives 10 % mean error for a sinusoidal input signal. The application of the proposed analytical model has been demonstrated by the design of a novel dual channel damper. The design of the electromechanical components has been shown to be np-hard problem and the optimisation using genetic algorithm has been applied to minimise the volume and electrical time constant. The performance of the dual channel damper has been simulated for various combinations of values of shear yield stress for two channels. Compared to the conventional single channel damper the novel design is shown to give 30 % higher damper force, 50 % improved dynamic range and limits the effect of transients to within 10 % of the damper force. The dual channel damper is an effective solution to resist the onset of turbulent flow in the channels up to 20 m/s piston velocity. © Cranfield Universit...|$|E
5000|$|The M30 is the {{practice}} {{version of the}} M26 grenade. It had a cast-iron two-piece oval body with a <b>plastic</b> base <b>plug.</b> The body was embossed with the symbols [...] "RFX55"; it was originally the basis for an experimental hand grenade that was never put into production. It had a filler of 21 grains of black powder and used the M10A3/M10A4 or M204A1/M204A2 series of fuzes. Its body is painted light blue with a brown band across the middle. When the grenade detonated, the overpressure made the plug pop out and released a plume of black smoke caused by the burnt filler.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the more}} common {{concerns}} of child safety {{is the potential for}} electrocution or serious injury when an object, such as a key or metal paper clip, is inserted into an electrical outlet. Many childproofing devices exist that block access to the electrical outlets. These devices may be as simple as <b>plastic</b> units that <b>plug</b> into each individual socket but this type could be removed by a toddler or parents might forget to re-insert them after using the outlet. Once removed from the outlet, most plastic plug-in caps become potential choking hazards. Other devices such as sliding outlet covers replace the current outlet plate but still allow parents access to use the outlet.|$|R
50|$|Threaded {{plug valves}} are used {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a threaded plug valve involves a plug with a threaded cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. Screwing the plug in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or <b>plastic,</b> near the <b>plug's</b> base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. Screwing the plug valve all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{examine the}} {{longitudinal}} migratory force required to cause disconnection of the bifurcated distal body component from the tubular proximal {{body of a}} fenestrated stent-graft. MethodsUsing a previously reported mathematical model distal distraction forces were calculated prior to performing in vitro pullout testing. The top end of the proximal body and the iliac limbs of the distal body were attached to the grips of a tensile tester via <b>plastic</b> sealing <b>plugs</b> and pneumatic clamps. Channels within the plugs allowed pressurisation of {{the inside of the}} stent-graft. Pullout tests were conducted in the vertical plane. Force and displacement data were recorded and tests repeated 8 times at room temperature with the stent-grafts either dry or wet and unpressurized, at 100  mmHg or at 120  mmHg. ResultsThe median maximum pullout force was 2. 9  N (2. 6 – 4. 1) when dry, 3. 9  N (3. 5 – 5. 4) when wet and unpressurized, 6. 3  N (4. 8 – 8. 3) when wet and pressurized at 100  mmHg and 6. 5  N (4. 8 – 7. 2) when wet and pressurized at 120  mmHg. There was a significant difference between pressurized and unpressurized conditions (P <  0. 01). ConclusionsThe force required to distract the distal bifurcated component of a fenestrated stent graft is much lower than the reported proximal fixation strength of both a standard and fenestrated Zenith stent graft. Although this helps protect the fenestrated proximal body from the effects of longitudinal migration forces in vivo the current strength of the body overlap zone may actually be unnecessarily weak and requires careful surveillance in follow up...|$|R

5000|$|During World War II, the U.S. Army's Artillery Section {{was working}} on a 105 mm {{recoilless}} cannon, based on captured German models that used a <b>plastic</b> blow out <b>plug</b> in the cartridge case. At the same time, there was a freelance research by the U.S. Army's Infantry Section of a man-portable recoilless 57 mm cannon by two engineers, named Kroger and Musser. Instead of a blowout plug, the infantry section's recoilless cannon used a British development in which the cartridge case had hundreds of small holes in the side walls with a lining of plastic {{on the inside of the}} cartridge case walls to keep water and other elements out until the round was fired. Another unique innovation was the use of pre-engraving bands on the 57 mm projectile that engaged the barrel's rifling. [...] The belief was this feature would reduce friction on firing, allowing more of the propellant gases to be used to force the shell towards the target and less being used to achieve the recoilless effect and therefore giving their design a much higher muzzle velocity than most recoilless cannon at that time period had achieved.|$|R
