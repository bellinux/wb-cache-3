5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or <b>physostigmine</b> as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{antidote}} to atropine is <b>physostigmine</b> or pilocarpine.|$|E
25|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{effects of}} diazepam {{can help in}} the treatment of seizures due to a drug overdose or chemical toxicity as a result of exposure to sarin, VX, or soman (or other organophosphate poisons), lindane, chloroquine, <b>physostigmine,</b> or pyrethroids.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{myasthenia}} gravis, {{characterized by}} muscle weakness and fatigue, {{occurs when the}} body inappropriately produces antibodies against acetylcholine nicotinic receptors, and thus inhibits proper acetylcholine signal transmission. Over time, the motor end plate is destroyed. Drugs that competitively inhibit acetylcholinesterase (e.g., neostigmine, <b>physostigmine,</b> or primarily pyridostigmine) are effective in treating this disorder. They allow endogenously released acetylcholine more time to interact with its respective receptor before being inactivated by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft (the space between nerve and muscle).|$|E
25|$|Like other TCAs, doxepin {{is highly}} toxic {{in cases of}} overdose. Mild {{symptoms}} include drowsiness, stupor, blurred vision, and excessive dryness of mouth. More serious adverse effects include respiratory depression, hypotension, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Urinary retention, decreased gastrointestinal motility (paralytic ileus), hyperthermia (or hypothermia), hypertension, dilated pupils, and hyperactive reflexes are other possible symptoms of doxepin overdose. Management of overdose is mostly supportive and symptomatic, and can include the administration of a gastric lavage so as to reduce absorption of the doxepin. Supportive measures to prevent respiratory aspiration is also advisable. Antiarrhythmic agents may be an appropriate measure to treat cardiac arrhythmias resulting from doxepin overdose. Slow intravenous administration of <b>physostigmine</b> may reverse some of the toxic effects of overdose such as anticholinergic effects. Haemodialysis is not recommended due to {{the high degree of}} protein binding with doxepin. ECG monitoring is recommended for several days after doxepin overdose due to the potential for cardiac conduction abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Cole tells Hastings {{that she}} is a sister of Margaret Litchfield, who confessed to the murder of their father in one of the five cases. Margaret has died in Broadmoor Asylum and Elizabeth is stigmatised by the trauma. Three {{incidents}} occur in the next few days, showing the imprint of X. First, Hastings and others overhear an argument between the Luttrells. Shortly afterwards, Luttrell wounds his wife with a rook rifle, saying he mistook her for a rabbit. Mrs Luttrell recovers, and the incident has a good effect on their marriage. Next, Hastings is concerned that his daughter Judith spends time with Major Allerton, a married man. While Hastings and Elizabeth are out with birdwatcher Stephen Norton, Norton sees something through his binoculars that disturbs him. Hastings assumes {{it has to do with}} Allerton. When his attempts to persuade Judith to give Allerton up merely antagonise her, the worried father plans Allerton's murder. He falls asleep while waiting to poison Allerton, relieved he took no action when he awakes the next day. Last, Barbara Franklin, wife of Judith's employer Dr Franklin, dies the following evening. She was poisoned with <b>physostigmine</b> sulphate, an extract from the Calabar bean that her husband researches. Poirot's testimony at the inquest, that Mrs Franklin had been upset and that he saw her emerge from Dr Franklin's laboratory with a small bottle, persuades the jury to return a verdict of suicide.|$|E
500|$|At {{the lowest}} point in Julian's career, his former mentor, William Blanchard, threw him a much-needed lifeline. [...] Blanchard offered Julian a {{position}} to teach organic chemistry at DePauw University in 1932. Julian then helped Josef Pikl, a fellow student at the University of Vienna, {{to come to the}} United States to work with him at DePauw. In 1935 Julian and Pikl completed the total synthesis of <b>physostigmine</b> and confirmed the structural formula assigned to it. Robert Robinson of Oxford University in the U.K. had been the first to publish a synthesis of <b>physostigmine,</b> but Julian noticed that the melting point of Robinson's end product was wrong, indicating that he had not created it. When Julian completed his synthesis, the melting point matched the correct one for natural <b>physostigmine</b> from the calabar bean.|$|E
500|$|Percy Lavon Julian (April 11, 1899 – April 19, 1975) was an African American {{research}} chemist and {{a pioneer}} in the chemical synthesis of medicinal drugs from plants. He was the first to synthesize the natural product <b>physostigmine,</b> and {{a pioneer in}} the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones [...] progesterone and testosterone from plant sterols such as stigmasterol and sitosterol. His work laid the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of cortisone, other corticosteroids, and birth control pills.|$|E
500|$|Many {{pesticides}} are enzyme inhibitors. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is {{an enzyme}} found in animals from insects to humans. [...] It {{is essential to}} nerve cell function through its mechanism of breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into its constituents, acetate and choline. [...] This is somewhat unusual among neurotransmitters as most, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, are absorbed from the synaptic cleft rather than cleaved. [...] A large number of AChE inhibitors are used in both medicine and agriculture. [...] Reversible competitive inhibitors, such as edrophonium, <b>physostigmine,</b> and neostigmine, {{are used in the}} treatment of myasthenia gravis and in anaesthesia. [...] The carbamate pesticides are also examples of reversible AChE inhibitors. [...] The organophosphate pesticides such as malathion, parathion, and chlorpyrifos irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
500|$|In {{a renewed}} attempt to {{retrieve}} his memory, House has his team re-enact the bus crash. House overdoses on <b>physostigmine,</b> a medication for Alzheimer's disease, {{and his mind}} flashes back to the bus scene before the accident. [...] "The answer" [...] reminds House that, since he values reason above all else, {{there must be a}} reason for her presence in his mind. She keeps asking House what her necklace is made from, until he realizes that it's made of amber. [...] "The answer" [...] transforms into Amber Volakis, and when Wilson and Cuddy manage to resuscitate House from his overdose-induced cardiac arrest, he immediately informs Wilson that Amber's life is in danger as he now remembers the crash. In the crash, Amber was injured with a bar through her leg and House later saw her being carried away to an ambulance. Wilson has not spoken to Amber since before the accident. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) checks the patient roster and sees that a patient admitted to a different hospital matches Amber's description.|$|E

2500|$|In this study, {{two groups}} of {{participants}} {{took part in a}} two night counterbalanced [...] study. [...] Two tasks were learned by all participants between 10:00-10:30pm. [...] The declarative task was a paired-associate word list of 40 German semantically related word pairs. [...] The non-declarative task was a mirror-tracing task. [...] At 11:00pm all participants were put on a two-hour infusion of either <b>physostigmine</b> or a placebo. [...] <b>Physostigmine</b> is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; it is a drug that inhibits the breakdown of the inhibitory neurotransmitter Acetylcholine, thereby allowing it to remain active longer in the synapses. [...] The sleep group was put to bed while the other group stayed awake. [...] Testing of both tasks took place at 2:45am, 30 minutes after the sleep group had been woken up; a sleep which had been rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS). [...] Results showed that the increased ACh negatively affected recall memory (declarative task), in the sleep condition compared to participants given the placebo. Specifically, recall after sleep for the placebo group showed an increase of 5.2 ± 0.8 words compared to an increase of only 2.1 ± 0.6 words when participants were given the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. [...] Conversely, neither speed nor accuracy declined in the non-declarative mirror task when participants were given <b>physostigmine,</b> and neither task performance was affected in the wake groups when physotigmine was administered. [...] This suggests that the purpose of ACh suppression during SWS allows for hippocampus –dependent [...] declarative memory consolidation; high levels of ACh during SWS blocks memory replay on a hippocampal level.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first to}} write about MG were Thomas Willis, Samuel Wilks, Erb, and Goldflam. The term [...] "myasthenia gravis pseudo-paralytica" [...] was {{proposed}} in 1895 by Jolly, a German physician. Mary Walker treated a person with MG with <b>physostigmine</b> in 1934. Simpson and Nastuck detailed the autoimmune nature of the condition. In 1973, Patrick and Lindstrom used rabbits to show that immunization with purified muscle-like acetylcholine receptors caused the development of MG-like symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Rivastigmine was {{developed}} by Marta Weinstock-Rosin of the Department of Pharmacology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and sold to Novartis by Yissum for commercial development. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of <b>physostigmine.</b> [...] It has been available in capsule and liquid formulations since 1997. In 2006, it became the first product approved globally {{for the treatment of}} mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease; and in 2007 the rivastigmine transdermal patch became the first patch treatment for dementia.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s, Otto Loewi {{determined}} the biomechanical {{mechanism for the}} effects of <b>physostigmine</b> on the body. Loewi was studying how actions that we now consider to be controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, were directed by chemicals. During his studies, Loewi discovered acetylcholine and that <b>physostigmine</b> acted by preventing acetylcholine inhibition. In 1936, Loewi was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on discovering acetylcholine and biological chemical transmitters. More important discoveries surrounding <b>physostigmine</b> were made at Edinburgh University in 1925. Edgar Stedman and George Barger {{determined the}} structure of <b>physostigmine</b> using a method called chemical degradation. Percy Lavon Julian was later the first to synthesize <b>physostigmine</b> in 1935. English scientist Robert Robinson was also working on the synthesis of <b>physostigmine,</b> but surprisingly Julian, a relatively unknown scientist at the time, was the successful one.|$|E
50|$|Recently, <b>physostigmine</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an antidote for intoxication with gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB, a potent sedative-hypnotic agent that can cause loss of consciousness, loss of muscle control, and death). <b>Physostigmine</b> may counteract GHB by producing a nonspecific state of arousal. However, not enough scientific evidence shows <b>physostigmine</b> properly treats GHB toxicity. Furthermore, lower doses of GHB produce a stronger action at the GHB receptor than at the GABAB-receptor, resulting in a stimulating effect which would act synergistically with <b>physostigmine</b> and produce hyperstimulation when the GHB blood levels begin to drop.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Physostigmine</b> {{also has}} a miotic function, causing pupillary constriction. It is useful in {{treating}} mydriasis. <b>Physostigmine</b> also increases outflow of the aqueous humor in the eye, making it useful {{in the treatment of}} glaucoma ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Physostigmine</b> {{functions}} as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Its mechanism {{is to prevent}} the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase at the transmitted sites of acetylcholine. This inhibition enhances the effect of acetylcholine, making it useful {{for the treatment of}} cholinergic disorders and myasthenia gravis. More recently, <b>physostigmine</b> has been used to improve the memory of Alzheimer's patients due to its potent anticholinesterase activity. However, its drug form, <b>physostigmine</b> salicylate, has poor bioavailability.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{anticholinergic}} {{syndrome is}} reversible and subsides once {{all of the}} causative agent has been excreted. Reversible Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents such as <b>physostigmine</b> {{can be used as}} an antidote in life-threatening cases. Wider use is discouraged due to the significant side effects related to cholinergic excess including: seizures, muscle weakness, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, lacrimation, salivation, bronchorrhea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Even in documented cases of anticholinergic toxicity, seizures have been reported after the rapid administration of <b>physostigmine.</b> Asystole has occurred after <b>physostigmine</b> administration for tricyclic antidepressant overdose, so a conduction delay (QRS > 0.10 second) or suggestion of tricyclic antidepressant ingestion is generally considered a contraindication to <b>physostigmine</b> administration.|$|E
50|$|In 1934, {{while working}} at St Alfege's Hospital, Dr. Walker {{discovered}} that the subcutaneous injection of <b>physostigmine</b> could temporarily reverse the muscle weakness found in patients suffering from myasthenia gravis. She had noted that the symptoms and signs of myasthenia {{were similar to those}} found in curare poisoning, and <b>physostigmine</b> was used as an antidote to curare poisoning at that time. The first case of myasthenia gravis successfully treated with <b>physostigmine</b> was published in the Lancet in June 1934.|$|E
50|$|<b>Physostigmine</b> {{also has}} other {{proposed}} uses: it could reverse undesired {{side effects of}} benzodiazepines such as diazepam, alleviating anxiety and tension. Another proposed use of <b>physostigmine</b> is to reverse the effects of barbiturates (any {{of a group of}} barbituric acids derived for use as sedatives or hypnotics).|$|E
50|$|Calabar bean {{contains}} <b>physostigmine,</b> a reversible {{cholinesterase inhibitor}} alkaloid. The alkaloid <b>physostigmine</b> acts in effect like nerve gas, influencing {{communication between the}} nerves and muscles, and resulting in copious salivation, seizures, loss {{of control over the}} bladder and bowels, and eventually loss of control over the respiratory system, causing death by asphyxiation.|$|E
5000|$|Combination of {{acetylcholine}} and <b>physostigmine</b> is {{an example}} of supra-additive phenomenon [...]|$|E
50|$|<b>Physostigmine</b> acts by {{interfering with}} the {{metabolism}} of acetylcholine. It is a covalent (reversible - bond hydrolyzed and released) inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft of the neuromuscular junction. It indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. <b>Physostigmine</b> has an LD50 of 3 mg/kg in mice.|$|E
50|$|<b>Physostigmine</b> has two chiral carbon atoms. Therefore, {{attention}} {{needs to}} be paid to the synthesis of the correct diastereomers. The 71 syntheses of <b>physostigmine</b> yield 33 racemic mixtures and 38 products of a single enantiomer. The first total synthesis of <b>physostigmine</b> was achieved by Julian and Piki in 1935. The main goal of Julian’s <b>physostigmine</b> synthesis was to get the intermediate key compound, l-eseroline (compound 10 in the adjacent diagram). Then, this compound would be easily converted to <b>physostigmine.</b> In one of his earlier works Julian synthesized the ring of <b>physostigmine</b> from starting material 1-methyl-3-formyl oxindole, which was discovered by Friedlander. However, he faced the problems that the starting material was expensive, and the reduction of a nitrile to an amine (similar to the reaction of compound 6 to given compound 7 in the diagram) with sodium and alcohol did not result in good yield. In his second work “Studies in the Indole Series III,” he had improved the yield of amine from nitrile significantly by using palladium and hydrogen. Although he succeeded in the synthesis of the target chemical, the route had several drawbacks. First, the chemical resolution of compound 8 is unreliable, and the chemical resolution of d,l-eserethole gives optically pure enantiomers after eight recrystallizations of its tartrate salt. Second, the reaction of compound 8 to give compound 9 requires a large amount of Na. In the years since this initial work, many other groups have used a variety of approaches to overcome these problems.|$|E

50|$|<b>Physostigmine</b> is used {{to treat}} {{glaucoma}} and delayed gastric emptying. Because it enhances the transmission of acetylcholine signals {{in the brain and}} can cross the blood-brain barrier, <b>physostigmine</b> salicylate {{is used to}} treat anticholinergic poisoning (that is, poisoning by substances that interfere with the transmission of acetylcholine signaling, such as atropine, scopolamine, and other anticholinergic drug overdoses). It is also used to reverse neuromuscular blocking. <b>Physostigmine</b> is the antidote of choice for Datura stramonium poisoning. It is also an antidote for Atropa belladonna poisoning, the same as for atropine. It has been also used as an antidote for poisoning with GHB, but is poorly effective and often causes additional toxicity, so is not a recommended treatment.|$|E

50|$|Eseroline {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as an opioid agonist. It is a {{metabolite}} of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor <b>physostigmine</b> but unlike <b>physostigmine,</b> the acetylcholinesterase inhibition produced by eseroline is weak and easily reversible, and it produces fairly potent analgesic effects mediated through the μ-opioid receptor. This mixture of activities gives eseroline an unusual pharmacological profile, although its uses are limited by side effects such as respiratory depression and neurotoxicity.|$|E
