Pope was sired by the 1790 Epsom Derby winner Waxy, who was {{purchased}} by the Duke and became an influential and important sire that went on to sire three additional Derby winners and three winners of The Oaks. Pope's dam, Prunella, was bred by the Duke of Grafton and was sired by Highflyer out the mare Promise, sired by Snap. Prunella produced 12 foals for the Duke of Grafton between 1796 and her death in December 1811. Pope was her seventh foal and {{the first of four}} foals sired by Waxy. Full-siblings to Pope include the mares Pledge (the dam of the 1819 Derby winner Tiresias), Pope Joan (the dam of the 1827 2,000 Guineas winner Turcoman and 1828 Oaks winner Turquoise) and Prudence (the dam of Reginald and Rowena). Half-siblings to Pope include the mares Pelisse (winner of the Oaks), Penelope (the dam of 1810 and 1815 Derby winners Whalebone and Whisker who were also sired by Waxy), Parasol (the dam of <b>Pastille</b> and Pindarrie) and the good racer Pioneer.|$|E

"And, Miss Eyre, so {{much was}} I flattered by this {{preference}} of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed {{her in an}} hotel; gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c. In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the received style, like any other spoony. I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I found her out; {{but it was a}} warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence. No,--I exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of <b>pastille</b> perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one now, if you will excuse me." ...|$|E
