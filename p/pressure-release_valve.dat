5000|$|In 1972, Bullock {{rejoined the}} Electrochemical Research Department of the Gates Company. John Devitt's group at Gates {{was working on}} {{development}} of a valve-regulated lead-acid battery (VRLA). Prior {{to the development of}} VRLAs, [...] "flooded" [...] rechargeable lead-acid batteries were used. They were filled with 30-40% sulfuric acid. At 85-90% of their charge capacity, chemical reactions within the battery became less effective, and water in the system was converted into hydrogen and oxygen gases. Flooded batteries could not be sealed, and had to be monitored to ensure effectiveness and prevent problems. In contrast, VRLAs were designed to ensure that oxygen would recombine rather than being lost. VRLAs contain acid inside a silica gel or absorb it into a porous glass separator. Gases that do not recombine are vented through a one-way <b>pressure-release</b> <b>valve.</b> [...] Bullock developed computer models describing the relationships between the circuit voltage of VRLAs and their acid concentration, battery charge and internal temperature. She read widely and was inspired by the work of people like Jeanne Burbank, Paul Ruetschi, and Detchko Pavlov. She studied corrosion within batteries. She examined the effects of adding phosphoric acid to lead dioxide electrodes in gel batteries to increase battery cycle life, resulting in the creation of batteries with low levels of phosphoric acid. In 1977, Bullock joined Globe-Union, Inc. in Milwaukee, where she continued her work with VRLAs. [...] Her work on the effects of adding phosphoric acid to lead dioxide electrodes won her the Battery Division Research Award from the Electrochemical Society in 1980.|$|E
5000|$|Zion was {{initially}} {{built for the}} purpose of saving the last of the remaining humans following the war against the armies of Zero One. However, a Machine program named the Architect, the creator and manipulator of the Matrix, manipulated the situation so Zion served as a control for the survival of the program in two ways. Firstly, the Machines could allow any humans who did not, or could not, accept the Matrix for what it was to live in the physical world without having to recapture them (this reduced dissent within the Matrix's population and prevented an exponentially-growing rejection rate from its population from causing entire [...] "crops" [...] of humans to die out, reducing power output). Essentially, Zion was allowed to exist by the Machines as a giant <b>pressure-release</b> <b>valve</b> on the entire system, allowing the humans that realized the Matrix wasn't real (statistically, only a fraction of 1% of the whole human population) to be conveniently removed and isolated. Secondly, the Architect would periodically destroy Zion and its inhabitants as part of a deal coercing the One into reinserting the [...] "Prime Program", a program code required to maintain the Matrix, allowing the Matrix to continue and Zion to be rebuilt by chosen survivors without memory of the destruction. The Machines usually timed this to occur when Zion's population grew in size {{to the point that it}} was just beginning to pose a significant threat to them, which was roughly when its population reached about 250,000. This cycle was broken when the sixth installment of the One refused to re-enter the program, and instead brokered the truce with the Machines.|$|E
40|$|My project {{explores the}} almost {{exponential}} rise in {{popularity of the}} zombie film genre over the past fifty years. As one probable cause, my presentation explores the connections between zombie films (as a type of apocalyptic film) and the pervasive nuclear holocaust anxiety which arose in the United States following the advent of atomic weapons and their subsequent use. Although {{the concept of the}} destruction of the world was nothing new considering the events/prophecies of the Bible, the level of destructive force which once remained securely {{in the realm of the}} divine was now available as part of the push-button age. Though seen by some as a savior when first used against the Japanese in World War II, Americaâ€™s relationship with nuclear weapons (and later nuclear power as well) soon changed due to the Cold War with its massive over stockpiling of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and accidents at both Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Though no longer as actively feared, many scholars would argue that nuclear holocaust anxiety groomed the social consciousness for a general holocaust anxiety which enabled later panics about AIDS, Y 2 K, severe acute respiratory syndrome, swine/avian flu, and 9 / 11 -related terrorist attacks. Once the anxiety was integrated into the general social consciousness it enabled zombie films to enter the mainstream as a safe, comfortable <b>pressure-release</b> <b>valve</b> where this anxiety could be displaced. I look at what makes the zombie film an idea vehicle for the transfer and amelioration of nuclear holocaust anxiety...|$|E
