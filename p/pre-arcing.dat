This paper also describes the temperature evolution and the Joule energy dissipated in a fuse element during the <b>pre-arcing</b> time. By varying typical electrical parameters, namely the closing angle and the power factor, we show that various prospective currents such as those observed in industrial case can be fairly simulated. The <b>pre-arcing</b> time and then the clearing of the fault current are shown to be deeply dependent on these electrical characteristics. We exhibit simulated results of prospective current and supply voltage waves for given closing angles under two typical power factors which are compared with the experimental ones. A comparison between simulated <b>pre-arcing</b> times with experimental ones shows some discrepancies and a discussion on the numerical assumptions is made...|$|E
40|$|Switching-in of {{short-circuit}} current leads to <b>pre-arcing</b> in the switching device. <b>Pre-arcing</b> affects {{the ability of}} switchgear to close and latch. In three-phase systems, making is associated with transient voltage phenomena that may {{have a significant impact}} on the duration of the <b>pre-arcing</b> period. An analysis is presented of these transients. It was found that <b>pre-arcing</b> times in three-phase systems can be considerably prolonged with respect to a single phase situation. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the three-phase interaction has a moderating influence on the peak value of asymmetrical current. A test-circuit is described, able to perform three-phase synthetic make tests up to 245 kV at current up to 63 kA, representing all transient phenomena.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{earthing switch}} (HSES) of a gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) performs a secondary role {{in protecting the}} power system {{in the event of}} an accident. After being interrupted by a circuit breaker (CB), the short-circuit current remaining in the network should be earthed by the HSES. However, as the contacts of the HSES may have been damaged by a pre-arc during the closing operation, the HSES may fail to ground the short-circuit current. To successfully ground the short-circuit current, the contacts of the HSES must be protected from damage by the pre-arc. Thus, minimizing the <b>pre-arcing</b> time is required to step up the making performance. This paper analyzes the making performance of the HSES by predicting the <b>pre-arcing</b> time within the short-circuit current making test. To estimate the <b>pre-arcing</b> time, we compared the results of analytical calculations based on streamer discharge theory and the numerical simulations of the electric field strength. By conducting a short-circuit current making test for a 420 kV 63 kA HSES in a high-power laboratory, the <b>pre-arcing</b> time calculation results were verified. A comparison of the results showed that the proposed prediction method was useful for verifying the performance of the HSES...|$|E

We have performed realistic HBC fuse tests for short (10 ms) <b>pre-arcing</b> times by varying the phase angle of the electrical fault (defined as the phase angle of the fault current once the supplied voltage {{is applied to the}} fuse) in the range from 0 to 160 deg., for two values of the power factor cos phi ~ 0. 9 and cos phi ~ 0. 1. Experimental values of the <b>pre-arcing</b> time and the arcing timeare given for tprearc/tarc ≲ 1 to ~ 4. 2, and discussed from the energetic point of view by taking into account the inductive source term.

For the time range considered (up to 10 ms), we assume no heat transfer between the fuse-element and the surrounding sand. To solve numerically the governing equations, we employ a semi-implicit scheme for time integration and a finite element method for space discretization.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of <b>pre-arcing</b> time {{in the case of}} High Breaking Capacity fuses submitted to high fault currents. The fuse elements studied consist of silver fuse strips with reduced sections in their centre. During the fuse working the fuse element is fused partly and hence vaporized. The time necessary to obtain an electric arc is called the <b>pre-arcing</b> time. This latter is defined by the duration from the appearance of the fault current to the splitting of the fuse element due to the vaporization of the reduced sections. The mathematic model is based on the solution of the heat transfer equation, using an enthalpy formulation {{to take into account the}} phase transitions, supplemented by an energy source due to the heat produced by ohmic losses. In order to determine the current density evolution in the fuse element, the Laplace equation governing the electric potential and the Ohm's law are used. Two typical fuse elements close to industrial ones are chosen for the simulations. The calculated <b>pre-arcing</b> times are given together with the main electrical properties, and compared with the experimental values.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{electric}} fuse operation the arcing period follows immediately the <b>pre-arcing</b> period depicted in Part 1 (Part 1. <b>Pre-arcing</b> period). The transition {{between these two}} operation steps is not fully understood at this time. To simplify {{the beginning of the}} arcing period can be identified with {{the electric}} arc ignition i. e. with the electrodes voltage drop. The consecutive plasma is of metallic type {{at the beginning of the}} arcing period and of metallic plus silica type with varying mixture up to the end of the arcing period. The energy brought by the fault current is withdrawn by means of the interaction between the electric arc and the arc quenching material (usually silica sand) whose morphometric properties influence the properties of the plasma column: composition, thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients of the plasma column depend on the porosity (and other morphometric properties) of the filler. The fuse element erosion also known as burn-back is responsible for the lengthening of the plasma column and the variations of the electric field.

40|$|Capacitive current {{switching}} means a specific operating condition for vacuum circuit-breakers. It combines high inrush-currents at connection of a capacitive load with considerable low breaking currents at its disconnection. Though {{the event of}} a restrike under recovery voltage stress can cause voltage escalation a reliable dielectric performance is essential. This leads to a reconsideration of the vacuum circuit-breaker design for capacitive switching duties. The behavior of various contact materials and designs are studied during series of tests, representing complete switching cycles at 24 kV system voltage comprising making operation and current interruption followed by the subsequent capacitive recovery voltage. The <b>pre-arcing</b> behavior and the occurrence of restrikes are observed as indication for the alteration of the dielectric condition of the contact system during the test series. In comparison of both kinds of breakdowns {{a significant difference in the}} breakdown field strength appeared. Considering the occurrence of restrikes these events can be observed as late as several hundreds of milliseconds after current interruption. In view of the reconsideration of an appropriate contact design the choice of contact material takes centre stage since the tested contact types of various materials show a different behavior in their <b>pre-arcing</b> and restrike performance. The relevant material properties affecting the deterioration of the contact surface during a number of capacitive switching operations and the probability of a breakdown must be taken into account accurately...|$|E

The distributions of the breakdowns versus applied field were compared with the more frequent pre-breakdown arcs. A strong correlation was observed for LDPE between the distribution of breakdowns in step-up tests {{and the distribution of}} pre-breakdown arcing.

And this requires the making operation with symmetrical short-circuit current that is established when the breakdown between contact gap occurs near the crest of the applied voltage. Also, if the interrupting chamber of circuit breakers is designed as the type of common enclosure or the operation is made by the gang operated mechanism that three-phase contacts are operated by one common mechanism, three-phase synthetic making test is basically required. Therefore, several testing laboratories have developed and proposed their own test circuits to properly evaluate the breaker performance.

40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) {{continues to}} pose significant risks to space missions despite decades of intense study. We emphasize here the advantages to spacecraft designers and modelers from considering the stochastic distributions of breakdown {{and how it}} can be affected by factors including spacecraft environment conditions, design geometries, material temperature, material purity, charging history, and appropriate timescales. Spacecraft charging models and spacecraft designs typically rely on tabulated values or ranges of breakdown strength, often based on cursory measurements with little or no experimental detail. Depending on the timescales and history of environmental and orbital changes or durations of specific missions, it may be critical to consider breakdown as a probability distribution rather than a single number or range of values. We present measured distributions of ESD data across several test configurations and materials including low density polyethylene (LDPE), polyimide (Kapton HN or PI) and biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP). Step-up ramp-to-breakdown tests measured the distribution of breakdowns as a function of applied field at various fixed ramp rates and temperatures. Time endurance tests measured breakdown after some time for samples held at sub-critical static electrostatic fields. Taken together, these tests begin to provide an understanding of the probability of breakdown, what tests are most applicable, and how to interpret this for specific missions and charging concerns. Achieving statistically significant results as described above for several candidate materials can be onerous, even with accelerated test methods. We have observed <b>pre-arcing</b> events (transient, non-shorting, current spikes) during voltage ramp-up tests with sufficiently slow ramp rates. The distributions of these events have a strong correlation with the distributions of ESD events in many polymeric materials. We propose that experiments observing <b>pre-arcing</b> versus applied electric field could be used a proxy for step-up to breakdown ESD tests to significantly accelerate sample characterization. *This work was supported by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship and funding through NASA GSFC and the James Webb Space Telescope...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring the HBC fuse working, {{the fault}} current implies the {{initiation}} of an electric arc which is composed of metallic species vapours mainly, generally silver. This defines {{the end of the}} <b>pre-arcing</b> time. This electric arc interacts quickly with the surrounding silica sand grains or quartz sand. Thus a silver plasma is formed around the reduced sections of the fuse element. This silver plasma interacts with the silica sand grains and this interaction gives rise to the ignition of a plasma composed of vapours resulting from the dissociation of the SiO 2 molecules. The radiation escaped from the SiO 2 plasma can be used to assess experimentally the temperature (T) and the electron density (ne), two fundamental parameters for modelling purposes. T and ne are difficult to interpret because of the strong gradients in pressure, temperature, and material densities from the centre to the surroundings where the measurement is done. We propose a first formulation to calculate this radiation in order to increase the understanding of the radiation measurements...|$|E

40|$|Field {{electron}} emission current measurements during the recovery phase of vacuum interrupters {{are carried out}} to understand the origin of restrikes in case of interrupting capacitive loads. A special shunt is designed for this measurement. To compensate the capacitive current component due to the stray capacitance of the interrupter, hardware (electronic, on-line) as well as software (off-line) processing are developed for different applications.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} a {{specific}} test device especially designed to perform tests on HBC fuse {{on a scale of}} a non industrial laboratory. In fact it is not possible for most of academic laboratories to build up a device supplying the same current and voltage ranges as in an industrial test station. Moreover the capacitor bank discharges are often used in academic laboratories to test electric fuses. But the main drawback of the capacitor bank is to supply a non 50 Hz-sinusoidal current waveform for one half period only. We present the first measurements performed on experimental HBC fuses using a 100 kVA station built up from a single phase transformer. These first measurements are performed using various fuse elements with the same geometries as in industrial fuses of the middle voltage range. The filling material is silica sand or quartz sand and it is chosen with the same properties as in industrial fuses. The fuse working is studied experimentally on the whole duration of the fuse working which depends on the values chosen for the power factor and the closing angle. The results are given for the <b>pre-arcing</b> time and the fulgurite length. The power factor put in the tests is equal to cos phi = 0. 9 and cos phi = 0. 1, and the closing angle is increased from 0 ° to 180 °.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{various aspects of}} the {{electromagnetic}} effects influencing the commutation of uncompensated single phase universal motors are investigated. An introduction to the subject as well as a review of significant literature on the subject are given. The literature review includes classical text books about commutator motors as well as more recent publications about the mathematical analysis of the commutation of universal motors. Subsequently, the analysis of the most important inductances of the machine is outlined that comprises the analytical and numerical calculation as well as the measurement of the machine inductances using different measurement techniques. Moreover, a brush model for commutation analysis of small commutator motors is presented. Equivalent circuits of the brush are established for the cases of one coil shorted and two coils shorted by one brush, and a strategy to obtain their elements is proposed. This uses a dedicated finite difference program to calculate the effective brush resistance between all pairs of terminals. The treatment of the boundary conditions is critical in this process. The resulting terminal resistances are regarded as combinations of a set of internal resistances and this nonlinear relationship is inverted to obtain the internal resistors using a modified Newton-Raphson method. Results are presented showing the influence of anisotropy and geometry, and a simplified example of commutation analysis using the model established is given. In the next step the arcing phenomenon in analysed mathematically. Equations are given for the <b>pre-arcing</b> phase, the arcing phase and the post-arc oscillation. Equivalent circuits for the different phases are proposed and the equations are derived strictly from a circuit point of view. In the analysis a constant arc voltage (confirmed by experimental data and literature on the subject) and a minimum uncommutated residual current necessary for arc ignition are assumed. Those quantities are adopted from reviewed literature and used in the calculations. The design of a motor test bench is described that allows to measure the motor performance according to the principle of the reaction dynamometer. The load machine is mounted on air bearings to minimize possible torque errors in the measurements. A measured torque speed characteristic of a universal motor is shown as well as the torque {{as a function of the}} motor current. These measurements were carried out at reduced motor voltage to keep the shaft speed within reasonable limits. Furthermore, theoretical and experimental investigations are carried out in order to estimate how strongly certain rotor coils undergoing rapid current changes affect each other due to mutual coupling and how the mutual coupling changes in the presence of a damping field winding. Several FEA simulations are performed in order to get an insight into the flux pattern if rotor coils are acting on each other and the field winding is allowed to impose its damping effect on the rotor coils. Simple AC measurements are performed as well as di/dt - tests using a more complex oscillating circuit for measurements of the change of the di/dt of a rotor coil with and without the presence of an active field winding. Additionally, investigations are carried out in order to analyse the influence of power cord and source impedances on the ability of the field winding of an uncompensated universal motor to damp flux variations caused by the commutation process. The motor is regarded as a harmonic generator with the power cord and the source impedance acting as a load. Rotational tests are carried out with different loads connected to the field winding and the Fourier spectrums of the field voltage are evaluated. In the final stage a simulation model is described that uses deductions from the previous chapters and that simulates the electromagnetic behaviour of the machine including the complex problem of brush commutation. Measured and calculated signals suitable for validation of the model were compared in order to evaluate the accuracy of the model with regard to motor performance and commutation analysis...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum circuit {{breakers}} (VCB) are dominantly used worldwide in medium voltage levels. However, {{in the recent}} years, there is a marked increase in interest to use VCBs also in sub-transmission voltage levels. This is mainly due to the environmental issues. However, the existing medium voltage VCB technology cannot be directly applied to the high voltage VCB due to the different design features which face an increase in difficulties as the voltage rises. One very important issue in this regard could be {{the lack of an}} appropriate diagnostic tool for the evaluation of the vacuum interrupters’ internal pressure. The users in the transmission voltage levels often {{want to know more about}} the up-to-date state of the high-voltage devices during their whole service life. Although in case of vacuum interrupter, it is difficult to decide upon the necessity of such diagnostics, and further discussion is required. According to current findings of the Cigré working group A 3. 27 “The impact of the application of vacuum switchgear at transmission voltages” (established 2009; work not yet finished), besides some technical and economical concerns, the non-availability of vacuum quality diagnostic tools might be one of the reasons for transmission system operators not to apply vacuum {{circuit breakers}} in their high-voltage transmission systems. Therefore, more investigation should be performed to develop an applicable diagnostic method for the internal pressure verification and vacuum quality tests, without demounting the interrupter from the switchgear. This investigation is the first part of the presented work, which is abbreviated in the whole work as “DVQ” for the diagnostic of vacuum quality. In this regard, a promising method, based on the measurement of field emission current immediately after arc-polishing of the contacts (named here as “FEA” method) is studied, which was firstly proposed by Frontzek and König. The results show that for a model vacuum interrupter with inhomogeneous electrode configuration (tip-plate), the decay rate of the field emission current after arc-polishing can be used for identifying the vacuum quality. However, for commercially available vacuum interrupters having more complex gap and contact geometries, it was not possible at all to define a test method or any test parameter configuration based on the chosen method, respectively, which would reproducibly cause a decay of the field emission current after arc-polishing. For statistically reliable evaluation on commercial interrupters extremely large number of trials would be necessary, which is totally unacceptable. Therefore, the investigated method has no practical meaning for monitoring purposes. Though the effects, which were published earlier, are basically present, the reproducibility is unfortunately too low. The search for a practical on-site diagnostic tool must therefore go on. Another challenging issue with regard to the applicability of VCBs in high voltage systems, is the performance of the interrupter during capacitive switching test duty and the avoidance of dielectric breakdowns (restrikes). Even in the medium voltage level, there are severe requirements for this test duty according to the IEC circuit breaker standard. To design an interrupter with very low probability of restrikes, especially at higher voltages, it is necessary to understand the physical origins of restrikes occurrence. Therefore, systematic research is performed to identify different electrical activities (especially field emission current) in the vacuum gap during the recovery phase of the interrupter after capacitive switching. The influence of <b>pre-arcing</b> during closing as well as arcing during opening on the dielectric performance and field emission characteristics of the gap for different types of vacuum interrupters are studied. This investigation is the second part of this dissertation, which is abbreviated as “ICS” for the impact of capacitive switching. The results of the investigation show that the capacitive arc current and its time duration have significant influence on the field emission current during recovery. The impact of the inrush (making) current on the field emission current during recovery is observed to be large and to be clearly related to its amplitude. It was also found that the average value of the field emission current (according to the proposed procedure “(10 x 10) measurement”) is a good measure for dielectric instabilities of the interrupter. However, no solid one-by-one relationship can be established between breakdown probability and field emission current in the available types of the interrupters. Furthermore, it is observed that the likelihood of restrikes during capacitive switching is a proper figure to control the production quality of vacuum interrupters. Hence, by using this method the stability of the production process of vacuum interrupters can be evaluated. In both part-projects (DVQ and ICS), measurements, analysis and modeling of very small field emission currents (microampere up to milliampere range), as prognosticated by the quantum mechanical Fowler-Nordheim theory, in a high voltage environment under severe electromagnetic interferences, are the basis of the investigations. For this purpose, an especial measurement system as well as the required circuit for compensation of the capacitive current component, caused by the interrupter stray capacitance, are developed...|$|E
