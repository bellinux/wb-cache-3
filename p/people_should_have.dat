25|$|A Parpolity or Participatory Polity is a {{theoretical}} form of democracy that is {{ruled by a}} Nested Council structure. The guiding philosophy is that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> decision making power in proportion to how much they {{are affected by the}} decision. Local councils of 25–50 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.|$|E
25|$|Watch – A {{watch is}} used when {{the risk of}} a {{hazardous}} weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location, or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible. <b>People</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities. The National Weather Service may activate weather spotters in areas affected by watches to help them better track and analyze the event.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 an {{interview}} within the book De dybeste rødder (en: The Deepest Roots) she showed, according to historians at Saxo instituttet, {{a change in}} attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture {{in order to be}} able to teach them to new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.|$|E

25|$|The {{benefits}} of the referendum began to flow to Aboriginal people in 1972. On 26 January 1972, Aboriginal peoples erected the Aboriginal Tent Embassy on the lawns of the Federal Parliament building in Canberra to express their frustration {{at the lack of}} progress on land rights and racial discrimination issues. This became a major confrontation that raised Aboriginal affairs high on the political agenda in the federal election later that year. One week after gaining office, the Whitlam Government (1972–1975) established a Royal Commission into land rights for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory under Justice Woodward. Its principal recommendations, delivered in May 1974, were: that Aboriginal <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> inalienable title to reserve lands; that regional Land Councils should be established; to establish a fund to purchase land with which Aboriginal people had a traditional connection, or that would provide economic or other benefits; prospecting and mineral exploration on Aboriginal land should only occur with their consent or that of the Federal Government if the national interest required it; entry onto Aboriginal land should require a permit issued by the regional Land Council. The recommendations were framed in terms to enable application outside the Northern Territory. The Federal Government agreed to implement the principal recommendations and in 1975 the House of Representatives passed the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill and the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill but the Senate had not considered them by the time parliament was dissolved in 1975.|$|E

500|$|... "We seriously {{regret that}} what may prove an {{extended}} racial conflict arising from {{this issue has}} apparently been deliberately created by {{a small group of}} West Indians professing to be representative. We also deplore the apparent fact that social and economic fears {{on the part of some}} white <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> placed the Bristol Bus Company in a position where it is most difficult to fulfil the Christian ideal of race relations."This in turn was criticised by Robert Davison, an official at the Jamaican High Commission, who stated that it was [...] "nonsense to describe a group of West Indians as unrepresentative when no representative West Indian body existed." ...|$|E

[...] While Cobain said the narrative of [...] "Lithium" [...] was fictional, he said, [...] "I did infuse some of my personal experiences, like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships." [...] Cobain acknowledged that the song was possibly inspired in part by the time he spent living with his friend Jesse Reed and his born-again Christian parents. He explained to Azerrad, [...] "I've always felt that some <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> religion in their lives [...] That's fine. If it's going to save someone, it's okay. And the person in [...] needed it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Award-winning novelist Haruki Murakami {{has said}} that the Fukushima {{accident}} was the second major nuclear disaster that the Japanese people have experienced, but this time it was not a bomb being dropped.

2500|$|After World War I, however, many Europeans came {{to doubt}} the {{morality}} of the means used to [...] "civilize" [...] peoples. At the same time, the anti-colonial movement, and advocates of indigenous peoples, argued that words such as [...] "civilized" [...] and [...] "savage" [...] were products and tools of colonialism, and argued that colonialism itself was savagely destructive. In the mid 20th century, European attitudes began to shift {{to the view that}} indigenous and tribal <b>peoples</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the right to decide for themselves what should happen to their ancient cultures and ancestral lands.|$|R

2500|$|The 1960s {{was a key}} decade for {{indigenous}} rights. In 1962, the Menzies Government's Commonwealth Electoral Act provided that all Indigenous <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the right to enrol and vote at federal elections (prior to this, indigenous people in Queensland, Western Australia and [...] "wards of the state" [...] in the Northern Territory had been excluded from voting unless they were ex-servicemen).

2500|$|Chin again argued {{freedom of}} thought and choice must be {{recognized}} by the Malayan government if the new nation was to survive past its independence, as the <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{the right to decide}} which political path the nation should take rather than having that choice be decided by a select few in the government. [...] Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this as well, and only promised freedom for the CPM members to join any existing political party after being cleared by the authorities.|$|E

However, Suisa and the other hill leaders did not attend the first session of the Committee. On 13 August 1947 he chaired a meeting of hill leaders, at which the assembled demanded that the hill <b>peoples</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the right to secede from Manipur after a five-year period. However, these demands were not heeded by the Committee, and in the new constitution the administration of the hill areas was placed {{under the control of the}} Maharaja.

2500|$|The Tao Te Ching focuses {{upon the}} {{beginnings}} of society, and describes a golden age in the past, comparable {{with the ideas of}} Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Human problems arose from the [...] "invention" [...] of culture and civilization.

2500|$|While {{the film}} depicts the Alliance as an all-powerful, authoritarian-style regime, Whedon {{is careful to}} point out that it is not so simple as that. [...] "The Alliance isn't some evil empire", he explains, but rather a largely benevolent bureaucratic force. The Alliance's main problem is that it seeks to govern everyone, {{regardless}} of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not. What the crew of Serenity represent—specifically Mal and his lifestyle—is the idea that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the right to make their own decisions, even if those decisions are bad.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin Valentino {{noted that}} {{years after the}} {{conclusion}} of the campaign, Mao admitted that some people were [...] "unjustly killed," [...] but insisted that [...] "basically there were no errors; that group of <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been killed ... if they had not been killed the people {{would not have been able}} to raise their heads." [...] Valentino argued that the biggest concern of the CPC during the campaigns was to urge local cadre to [...] "not fear executing people only to fear mistakenly executing people" [...] and to punish those who were too lenient and practiced [...] "peaceful land reform".|$|E

2500|$|The {{situation}} was confusing, chaotic, {{and difficult to}} assess. Observers were unsure of whether the war had ended, with {{a victory for the}} Zaire government, or instead devolved into a guerrilla war. Journalists continued to face restrictions and intimidation. Seven European journalists (including Colin Smith) had been arrested in April and accused of illegally entering the Shaba province. A spokesperson for the Zaire military stated: [...] "In the normal way these <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been treated as mercenaries and shot immediately. It is a miracle they are still alive." [...] These journalists were removed from Zaire after being imprisoned for two weeks.|$|E

He was the first director of Cairo University, in which he served from 1925 to 1941. He was considered one of the first Egyptian officials to introduce Mill’s works to the general Arab public, so they could educate themselves on concepts of liberalism.

While traveling in Yosemite National Park, she witnessed a white trail guide beating a Chinese worker, whom she confronted. While many westerners held negative views of Chinese immigrants, Churchill remained a defender of their rights in her writings throughout her life.
