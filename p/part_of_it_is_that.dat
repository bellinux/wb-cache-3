500|$|Shaughnessy said, [...] "The funny <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I gave Maryland {{the roughest}} deal I have ever given anyone in my life, and when Dr. [...] {{offered me a}} chance to come back, I accepted." [...] Because of his {{repeated}} job changes, the Associated Press dubbed Shaugnessy [...] "football's man in motion". At Maryland, he replaced Bear Bryant who had departed for Kentucky. Shaughnessy reintroduced his preferred red and white uniforms, which again replaced the black and gold scheme and remained the dominant colors until 1987.|$|E

2500|$|The {{coaches were}} calling the house, telling my dad to ‘talk to her.’ And <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the drugs, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> I'd done <b>it</b> so long.

6000|$|... "And the sad <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{she is not}} so much {{to blame}} as I. She was a {{pupil-teacher}} under me, as you know, and I took advantage of her inexperience, and toled her out for walks, and got her to agree to a long engagement before she well knew her own mind. Afterwards she saw somebody else, but she blindly fulfilled her engagement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did get a}} knock, certainly;--but the odd <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I {{knew nothing}} about it till I found the blood in my eyes after they had decamped. But I lost my hat, {{and there is a}} rather long cut just above the temple. It hasn't done me the {{slightest}} harm. The worst of it was that they got off with Everett's watch and money." ...|$|E

[...] "And the best <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they caught him trying to pawn my wife's silver spoons and Laura's two rings. The pawnbroker got suspicious, and as {{he happened to be}} an honest man, he called in a detective. This detective remembered the picture he had seen printed of Link at the time he and Jasniff stole the jewelry, and he at once placed Link under arrest." ...|$|E

The absolute candor and completely good understanding which existed a short time ago seems to have become clouded. Carraby is trying to suggest in English circles that I have been using my influence over here against the present government. The absurd <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> although I have been in France for a month, I arrived in Paris only yesterday." ...|$|E

6000|$|... * In {{the terrible}} wolf-struggle of those centuries, no man [...] was {{permanently}} safe, {{no matter how}} much wealth he amassed. [...] Out of fear for the welfare of their families, men devised [...] the scheme of insurance. To us, in this intelligent age, [...] such a device is laughably absurd and primitive. But in [...] that age insurance was a very serious matter. The amusing [...] <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the funds of the insurance companies were [...] frequently plundered and wasted by the very officials who [...] were intrusted with the management of them.|$|E

You can travel or amuse {{yourself}} in any way, but their faces are always coming before you, their voices seem always in your ears. It {{is the one}} eternal sadness of life. And the strangest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> just as you who have once really understood can never forget, so {{it is the most}} difficult thing in the world to make those people understand who have not themselves lived and toiled amongst them. It is a cry which you cannot translate, but if once you have heard it, it will follow you from the earth to the stars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, lad, it's a {{very strange}} life; and the strangest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the longer we live the {{stranger}} it gets. I travelled once in Switzerland--," [...] (the old gentleman paused, as if to allow the statement to have its full weight on Ned's youthful mind,) [...] "and it's a curious fact, that when I had been some months there, home and all connected with it became like a dream to me, and Switzerland became a reality. But after I came back to England, and had spent some time here, home again became the reality, and Switzerland appeared like a dream, so that I sometimes said to myself, `Can it be possible that I have been there!' Very odd, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Mrs. Conway, {{that things}} are going even better than we hoped. The foreman said that from what little talk he had with the servants, he thought they had all been {{attached}} to Mr. Penfold, and that his sisters were by no means popular among them. He said very often one or other of them would come into the room where they were working and make suggestions, and hunt about themselves {{to see if they could}} find anything. But the best <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one of the carpenters, a steady fellow of twenty-five, took up, as he calls it, with the upper housemaid, and he believes there is a talk about their being married some day. If this is so it would be the very thing for you. You could help him to get married, and the girl could help you to get her place." ...|$|E
