The time evolution of synaptic interactions is described by a Langevin equation including a Hebbian learning term, and a bias term which is the interactions of the Hopfield model. We assume that synaptic interactions change much slower than neurons and study the stationary states of synaptic interactions by the replica method. We find that {{the order of the}} phase transition changes from the second to the first and that the existence regions of the Hopfield attractor and mixed states increase as the coefficient of the learning term increases. We also study the AT stability of solutions and find that the temperature region in which the Hopfield attractor is stable increases as the learning coefficient increases.

40|$|A {{partially}} annealed mean-field spin-glass {{model with}} a locally embedded pattern is studied. The model consists of two dynamical variables, spins and interactions, that are in contact with thermal baths at temperatures T_S and T_J, respectively.

In the ferromagnetic phase, the embedded pattern is stably realized. The phase diagram depends significantly on the ratio of two temperatures n=T_J/T_S. In particular, a reentrant transition from the embedded ferromagnetic to the spin-glass phases with T_S decreasing is found only below at a certain value of n.

40|$|Abstract. The {{current status}} of ACS {{calibration}} software is described, with em-phasis on the correction of geometric distortion. Plans for the future are outlined, as {{are a variety of}} support utilities which we anticipate providing. 1. Overview The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) calibration pipeline has been processing science observations for about 6 months. From the outset the pipeline processing environment has supported On-The-Fly-Reprocessing, or OTFR. Indeed, for the majority of people, OTFR will be the most relevant mode of operation. Clearly, not everything is done by the pipeline, and often parameters need adjusting for specific data sets, so stand-alone use of the ACS software tools is also encouraged. A significant number of utilities are provided within the “pyraf ” environment which also gives access to the normal suite of iraf/stsdas software. The initial pipeline processing of ACS data is accomplished with calacs, and the subse-quent correction for geometric distortion and associated image combination is accomplished with PyDrizzle. The latter includes mapping the two 4096 × 2048 chips onto a single image. Some of the calibration observations are obtained essentially contemporaneously with the data, in particular the daily darks which track the growth of hot pixels. These calibration observations require accumulation of data through a (<b>partial)</b> <b>anneal</b> cycle, processing and delivery to support the pipeline, hence there is an unavoidable delay before the best reference files are available for use. In addition there are occasional updates to calibration as new information becomes available, such as photometric measurements. Information on the appropriate reference files may be found on the ACS web page at STScI. Hence, in general both new observers and archival investigators should expect to use OTFR when they retrieve their data. Below, the operations performed in the ACS calibration pipeline are described as well as some description of the ACS stand-alone software tool usage. We recognize {{that there is a need}} for improved cosmic ray rejection software, and we are actively working on this as well as on providing a number of additional support utilities...|$|R

Radiation Measurements, 65, 1 - 7 Thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL) dating protocols have been suggested {{as a means of}} extending the age range of luminescence dating. Several studies demonstrate that TT-OSL signals increase with large radiation doses (> 2000 Gy) and yet, few studies report older TT-OSL ages (> 400 Gy) in agreement with independent absolute age control. In one such study, agreement with independent chronology was only achieved for the old samples by implementing a pulsed-irradiation procedure. Pulsed-irradiation is suggested to compensate for dose rate dependent competition effects by dividing the laboratory irradiation into discrete irradiation steps interspersed with heat treatments. However, every inter-step heat treatment has the potential to anneal part of the TT-OSL dating signal. This study compares constant- and pulsed-irradiation TT-OSL protocols and investigates the degree of partial thermal annealing. The results suggest that almost all of the difference in outcome between constant- and pulsed-irradiation protocols can be explained by <b>partial</b> <b>annealing</b> of the TT-OSL signal rather than by competition effects. <b>Partial</b> <b>annealing</b> distorts the laboratory dose response curve but has no impact on the natural signal, resulting in unreliable equivalent dose estimates.

An automotive aluminium alloy (AA 5182 -O) is selected and the room temperature failure angle of this material is determined experimentally. The straining behaviour as well as sheet thinning of the test part (at its maximum forming angle) is studied using an experimentally validated finite element model. From the thinning rate of the sheet metal and the shape of the contact zone between tool and sheet it is concluded that continuous straining of the sheet on the wall region of the contact area is responsible for extra thinning and failure. Based on the size and position of the contact zone, different laser tool positioning strategies have been used to achieve the highest forming angle. It is concluded that due to an elongated shape of the contact zone in steep wall angle parts and considering a small deviation of the forming robot, the selection of a large spot diameter is necessary in terms of maximum obtainable wall angle.

Al nortede la Zona Axial se registra así mismo una marcada exhumación durante el Miocenoinferior, indicando una reactivación cabalgante en pop-up de la Zona Axial...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films of}} Ni- 49 at. % Ti were {{deposited}} by DC magnetron sputtering on silicon substrates at 300 degrees C. The as-deposited amorphous films were annealed at a vacuum of 10 (- 6) mbar at various temperatures between 300 and 650 degrees C {{to study the}} effect of annealing on microstructure and mechanical properties. The as-deposited films showed <b>partial</b> crystallization on <b>annealing</b> at 500 degrees C. At 500 degrees C, a distinct oxidation layer, rich in titanium but depleted in Ni, was seen on the film surface. A gradual increase in thickness and number of layers of various oxide stoichiometries as well as growth of triangular shaped reaction zones were seen with increase in annealing temperature up to 650 degrees C. Nanoindentation studies showed that the film hardness values increase with increase in annealing temperature up to 600 degrees C and subsequently decrease at 650 degrees C. The results were explained {{on the basis of}} the change in microstructure as a result of oxidation on annealing...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of oxygen in non-irradiated and irradiated polystyrene based plastic scintillators SCSN 38 has been measured {{making use of}} a fluorescence quenching effect. Fluorescence light from electron or light excitation of dyes is reduced when oxygen {{is present in the}} sample. The reduction is characteristic for the dye and proportional to the <b>partial</b> pressure. Oxygen <b>annealing</b> of color centers of samples stored and irradiated in vacuum enhances the light yield. A diffusion model describes the results very well and results in a diffusion constant D=(1. 00 Σ 0. 10) Δ 10 Γ 7 cm 2 s Γ 1 at 23 ffi C.

J; 61. 82; 78. 55 1 Introduction Particle detectors for high energy physics often use plastic scintillators composed of an optically clear base, e. g. polystyrene (PS), and one or two wavelength -shifting organic dyes. The scintillators frequently work in high radi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been growing {{interests}} on II-VI semiconductor nanostructures, which are suitable for applications in electronics and optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, UV lasers, sensors, light emitting diodes and field emission displays. II-VI semiconductor nanostructures with different morphologies such as wires, belts, rods, tubes, needles, springs, tetrapods, plates, hierarchical structures and so on, have been widely grown by vapor transport methods. However the process conditions used {{for the growth of}} nanostructures still remains incompatible for device fabrication. The realization of practical nanoscale devices using nanostructured film depends mainly on the availability of low cost and lower processing temperatures to manufacture high purity nanostructures on a variety of substrates including glass and polymer. In this thesis work, studies have been made on the growth and characterization of II-VI semiconductor nanostructures prepared at room temperature, under high vacuum, without employing catalysts or templates. (i) ZnO nanostructured films with different morphology such as flowers, needles and shrubs were deposited at room temperature on glass and polymer substrates by plasma assisted reactive process. (ii) Zn/ZnO core/shell nanowires were grown on Si substrates under optimized oxygen <b>partial</b> pressure. <b>Annealing</b> of this core shell nanowire in high vacuum resulted in the formation of ZnO nanocanals. (iii) ZnS and ZnSe nano and microstructures were grown on Si substrates under high vacuum by thermal evaporation. The morphology, structural, optical properties and composition of these nano and microstructures were investigated by XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman, PL and XPS. The growth mechanism behind the formation of the different nanostructures has been explained on the basis of vapour-solid (VS) mechanism...|$|R
