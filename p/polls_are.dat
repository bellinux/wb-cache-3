50|$|An {{entrance}} <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> a <b>poll</b> that <b>is</b> {{taken before}} voters have cast their votes at the <b>polling</b> stations. It <b>is</b> akin to an opinion poll {{in the sense}} that it asks who the voter plans to vote for or some similar set of questions. The possibility that the prospective voter might change his mind after the <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> very small compared to that of an opinion poll, therefore the margin of error of an entrance <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> expected to be lower than that of an opinion poll. However, the methodology of conducting an entrance <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> closer to that of an exit poll, where actual voters are being queried as opposed to potential voters in an opinion poll.|$|R

25|$|Voter {{demographic}} data for 2016 {{were collected by}} Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News and the Associated Press. The voter survey is based on questionnaires completed by 24,537 voters leaving 350 voting places throughout the United States on Election Day, in addition to 4,398 telephone interviews with early and absentee voters. Trump's crucial victories in the Midwest were aided {{in large part by}} his strong margins among non-college whites â€“ while Obama lost those voters by a margin of 10 points in 2012, Clinton lost this group by 20 percent. The election also represented the first time that Republicans performed better among lower-income whites than among affluent white voters. To some analysts' surprise, Trump narrowed Clinton's margin compared to Obama by 7 points among blacks and African-Americans, 8 points among Latinos, and 11 points among Asian-Americans. Meanwhile, Trump increased his lead with non-Hispanic white voters through 1 percent over Mitt Romney's performance, and American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders shifted their support towards the Republican candidate using the same relative amount. Additionally, although 74 percent of Muslim voters supported Clinton, Trump nearly doubled his support there compared to Mitt Romney, according to the New York Times exit poll. However, exit <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> believed to have overstated sectors of the electorate oftentimes in the past, and further study with additional data is generally recommended by experts, as it {{is considered to be a}} more accurate representation of voting behavior in presidential elections.|$|E
500|$|Another {{example of}} Manne's ability {{to transcend the}} narrow borders of any {{particular}} school is the series of trio albums he recorded with guitarist Barney Kessel and bassist Ray Brown as [...] "The Poll Winners".

Manne even dabbled in Dixieland and fusion, as well as [...] "Third Stream" [...] music. He participated in the revival of that jazz precursor ragtime (he appears on several albums devoted {{to the music of}} Scott Joplin), and sometimes recorded with musicians best associated with European classical music. He always, however, returned to the straight-ahead jazz he loved best.|$|E
