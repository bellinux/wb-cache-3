With European energy and climate targets driving such projects, it is becoming challenging {{to keep up with}} their ever-increasing number. Our contribution demonstrates how combining the expertise on energy efficiency and renewable energies, linguistic text processing and modern information technology can help to respond to this challenge and thereby render research funding more transparent and accessible to the public. We provide an overview of the German energy research funding information system ‘EnArgus’. This web-based system makes it possible to intelligently review and cluster the vast number of <b>publicly-funded</b> energy <b>research</b> projects in Germany carried out since 1970. The core element of the system is an ontology-assisted search engine derived from more than 2, 200 short articles, which were specifically prepared for this purpose. These texts cover energy technologies as well as the related basic terminology and concepts. To illustrate the system, we provide an overview of its structure, its main components and a summary of its evaluation as well as important lessons learned from the project. The results of the evaluation indicate that the system is well suited to help structure and access the growing number of <b>publicly-funded</b> energy <b>research</b> projects...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{widespread}} {{transformation of}} the economic base has seen the decline of traditional manufacturing economies {{and the rise of}} knowledge-based economies. Consequently, conventional manufacturing-oriented industrial policy has become ‘future orientated ’ towards the challenges of the knowledge-based economies, and increasingly replaced by innovation policy. Drawing upon original empirical research on Hamburg’s regional innovation system, this paper unravels how innovation policy has increasingly sought to embed and realise the value of universities and <b>publicly-funded</b> <b>research</b> institutions by positioning them {{at the core of the}} regional innovation system. The outcome is that innovation policy plays an important catalytic role in promoting technology transfer and knowledge exchange. However, the success of this new agenda is shown to depend on its acceptance and adaptation by universities and <b>publicly-funded</b> <b>research</b> institutes. This study of Hamburg reveals how, when effectively achieved, innovation policy as a form of future-orientated industrial policy can restructure local economies as centres of high-technology research and development with strong science-industry links...|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of {{socio-economic}} impact is an emerging theme for <b>publicly-funded</b> academic <b>research.</b> Within this context, the paper {{suggests that the}} concept of institutional research capital be expanded to include the capture and evaluation of {{socio-economic impact}}. Furthermore, it argues that understanding the typology of impacts and the tracking from research to impact will assist the formulation of institutional strategies for capturing socio-economic impact. A three-stage approach is proposed for capturing and planning activities to enhance the generation of high-quality impact. Stage one outlines the critical role of user engagement that facilitates the tracking of such impact. Stage two employs an analytical framework based on the criteria of „depth ‟ and „spread ‟ to evaluate impacts that have been identified. Stage three utilizes the outcomes of the framework to devise strategies, consisting of either further research (to increase depth) or more engagement (to increase spread) that will improve the generation of higher quality impact.

Furthermore, a decline in loan rates stimulated the propensity to develop emissions control techniques, which were simultaneously crowded out by increases in <b>publicly-funded</b> transport <b>research</b> and development.

40|$|AbstractWithin the <b>publicly-funded</b> ZAFH <b>research</b> project SPANTEC light, the Competence Center for Tribology in Mannheim, Germany, {{examines}} the wear mechanisms of hard metal tools when cutting carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic in drilling and milling processes. The research project includes a test series with a tribological model test. The {{development of a}} new tribological simulation model system, a modified pin-on-disc system respectively called as edge-on-disc system, for cutting CFRP with hard metal composites is systematically analyzed and presented in this work. With this model system, a new method for tool wear analysis of the tool materials against CFRP is described. As result, there are further findings on the wear mechanism of the hard metal tungsten carbide in cobalt matrix (WC-Co) compared with carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). Research parameters for the tribological system in this paper are the WC-Co materials, with their WC-grain size and cobalt content, and the carbon fiber orientation. This study introduces a first approach to determine WC-Co wear compared with a CFRP-specimen, unlike most hard metal wear tests. Furthermore it is shown, that properties of the drilling and milling processes can be adapted by altering the model systems rotating speed and normal force. The results originality is also provided by using a variety of WC grain size classes (sub-μm to approximately 7 - 9 μm grain size) and cobalt contents far above usual CFRP-machining properties to show the wear process between carbon fibers and WC-Co in detail...|$|R

40|$|Main points Research {{data are}} an asset {{we have been}} {{building}} for decades, through {{billions of dollars of}} public investment in research annually. The information and communication technology (ICT) revolution presents an unprecedented opportunity to ‘leverage’ that asset. Given this, there is increasing awareness around the world that there are benefits to be gained from curating and openly sharing research data (Kvalheim and Kvamme 2014). Conservatively, we estimate that the value of data in Australia’s public research to be at least $ 1. 9 billion and possibly up to $ 6 billion a year at current levels of expenditure and activity. Research data curation and sharing might be worth at least $ 1. 8 billion and possibly up to $ 5. 5 billion a year, of which perhaps $ 1. 4 billion to $ 4. 9 billion annually is yet to be realized. Hence, any policy around <b>publicly-funded</b> <b>research</b> data should aim to realise as much of this unrealised value as practicable. Aims and scope This study offers conservative estimates of the value and benefits to Australia of making <b>publicly-funded</b> <b>research</b> data freely available, and examines the role and contribution of data repositories and associated infrastructure. It also explores the policy settings required to optimise research data sharing, and thereby increase the return on public investment in research. The study’s focus is Australia’s Commonwealth-funded research and agencies. It includes research commissioned or funded by Commonwealth bodies as well as in-house research within research-oriented agencies wholly or largely funded by the Commonwealth. Government data or public sector information is a separate category of publicly-funded data – although there is some overlap at the margins (e. g. Commonwealth Government funding for Geoscience Australia). Main findings For the purposes of estimation, we explore a range of research funding and expenditure from total Australian Government funding support for research to the sum of government and higher education expenditure on research by sector of execution. The lower bound estimates are based on the labour-cost share of research funding and expenditure ($ 4. 3 billion to $ 6. 4 billion per annum), and upper bound estimates on total research funding and expenditure ($ 8. 9 billion to $ 13. 3 billion per annum) ...|$|E
