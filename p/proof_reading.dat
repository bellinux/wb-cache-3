25|$|Transcription {{fidelity}} {{is achieved}} through multiple mechanisms. RNA polymerases select correct nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate to prevent transcription errors. Only the NTP which correctly base pairs with the coding {{base in the}} DNA is admitted to the active center. RNA polymerase performs two known <b>proof</b> <b>reading</b> functions to detect and remove misincorporated nucleotides: pyrophosphorylytic editing and hydrolytic editing. The former removes the incorrectly inserted ribonucleotide by a simple reversal of the polymerization reaction, while the latter involves backtracking of the polymerase and cleaving of a segment of error-containing RNA product. Elongation factor TFIIS stimulates an inherent ribonuclease activity in the polymerase, allowing the removal of misincorporated bases through limited local RNA degradation. Note that all reactions (phosphodiester bond synthesis, pyrophosphorolysis, phosphodiester bond hydrolysis) are performed by RNA polymerase by using a single active center.|$|E
500|$|Wodehouse {{believed}} {{that one of}} the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that [...] "If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way." [...] He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as [...] "making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before <b>proof</b> <b>reading</b> again and then making a final copy for his publisher.|$|E
60|$|This book {{originally}} owed {{its existence}} to an accident, {{and it was}} printed under circumstances that prevented the usual supervision of the press by the author. The consequences were many defects in plot, style, and arrangement, that were entirely owing to precipitation and inexperience; and quite as many faults, of another nature, {{that are to be}} traced solely to a bad manuscript and worse <b>proof</b> <b>reading.</b> Perhaps no novel of our times was worst printed than the first edition of this work. More than a hundred periods were placed in the middle of sentences, and perhaps five times that number were omitted in places where they ought to have been inserted. It is scarcely necessary to add, that passages were rendered obscure, and that entire paragraphs were unintelligible.|$|E
