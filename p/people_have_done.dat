He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran.|$|E

It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E

The resurrected {{undesirable}} husband is cleverly eliminated. The coincidences are too miraculous to suit a plain newspaperman." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror agreed in premise that {{the plot of the}} film had been done before, but stated, [...] "...the Thanhouser <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it fairly well and added a few details which, while not quite logical, give it some new interest." [...] The Moving Picture World offered a neutral summary of the plot, but concluded that the film [...] "is a graphic illustration of conditions which might arise almost any time, and develops an interestingly dramatic story as it proceeds." [...] One local review of the film called it [...] "splendid", but either by typographical error or for reasons unknown, gives a different story of the plot and even stating that the wife fell to her death by accident when attempting to see her.|$|E
500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dan Brown {{repeatedly}} {{said in his}} defense that history cannot be plagiarized and therefore the accusations of the two authors were false. Leigh stated, [...] "It's not that Dan Brown has lifted certain ideas because a number of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that before. It's rather that he's lifted the whole architecture – the whole jigsaw puzzle – and hung {{it on to the}} peg of a fictional thriller". Dan Brown has admitted some of the ideas taken from Baigent and Leigh's work were indispensable to the book but stated that there were many other sources also behind it. However, he claimed that neither he nor his wife had read Baigent and Leigh's book when he produced his original [...] "synopsis" [...] of the novel. Among Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh's arguments were that the given name of the character Sir Leigh Teabing's is the same of Richard Leigh's surname, and that [...] "Teabing" [...] is an anagram of [...] "Baigent".|$|E
