25|$|The {{microphone}} design {{differs from}} that of a conventional audio system in that the peculiar features of infrasound are taken into account. First, infrasound propagates over vast distances through the Earth's atmosphere as a result of very low atmospheric absorption and of refractive ducting that enables propagation by way of multiple bounces between the Earth's surface and the stratosphere. A second property that has received little attention is the great <b>penetration</b> <b>capability</b> of infrasound through solid matter – a property utilized in the design and fabrication of the system windscreens.|$|E
25|$|The Type 1 Chi-He's 47mm {{high-velocity}} gun had {{a barrel}} length of 2.250 m, a muzzle velocity of , and a <b>penetration</b> <b>capability</b> of 55mm/100 m, 40mm/500, 30mm/1,000 meters; over {{double that of}} the Type 97s low-velocity main gun. It was more reliable and more accurate, but did require the installation of elevation gear (on the earlier Type 97 the gunner had to physically move the gun up or down on his shoulder). In light of these improvements, the gun was adequate against Allied armor. The ammunition {{was the same as}} used with the anti-tank version of the gun. The tanks carried 120 rounds of ammunition with both armor-piercing and armor-piecing high explosive shells. The gun was placed in a three-man turret, which had space for the commander, gun-layer and loader. The gun could be elevated and depressed between +20 and -15 degrees. This gun was used in the Type 97-Kai Shinhoto Chi-Ha tank, and on the Type 3 Ka-Chi Amphibious Tank.|$|E

2500|$|T-55MV - The former Soviet Army tank repair plants number 7 in Kiev {{and number}} 17 in Lviv in the Ukraine have been {{promoting}} the T-55MV {{on the world}} market for several years. The turret, hull front section and side skirts of this version are protected by the Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour capable of withstanding hits from the American M829 120mm armour-piercing depleted uranium ammunition. The main armament of the T-55MV was improved by employing the 9M117 [...] "Bastion" [...] (AT-10 Stabber) ATGM which can be launched through the barrel of the standard T-54/55 rifled gun. With an effective range of 4,000 m, the 9M117 [...] "Bastion" [...] (AT-10 Stabber) ATGM is capable of penetrating armour equivalent to 550mm of steel plate. If the missile is equipped with a tandem warhead, its armour <b>penetration</b> <b>capability</b> increases. The Volna fire control system with its digital ballistic computer was also fitted. Syria was the first country to order 200 of its T-55s upgraded into the T-55MV.|$|E

Penetration of fatty acid itself {{could not be}} considered as sufficient prerequisite for enhancing the penetration of model drug. Differences in physicochemical properties of fatty acids might determine their different affinity to skin lipids and mechanisms of action, thus their <b>penetration</b> <b>capabilities</b> and enhancing effect on lipophilic model drug penetration are different.|$|R

Each sub-munition dart travelling at 1250 m/s has comparable kinetic energy to a shell from a Bofors 40 mm gun and probably has sufficient energy to penetrate the front armour of an infantry fighting vehicle. However, it lacks the armour <b>penetration</b> <b>capabilities</b> of a purpose-built anti-tank guided missile or of a dual purpose missile (such as the Air Defence Anti-Tank System).|$|R

30|$|A new {{application}} {{based on the}} possibility of detecting the presence of an object on the terrain or just under it, exploiting the <b>penetration</b> <b>capabilities</b> of electromagnetic energy within the soil, which are inversely proportional to the carrier frequency, is analyzed in this paper. One current application is in the military field, in particular, to detect the presence of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and pressure-activated mines. Mines and IEDs are often hidden on the terrain or inside the vegetation or are buried within the first few centimeters below the surface, since their devastating effects depend of course on their insertion depth.|$|R

In this paper, these two points are investigated {{with reference to the}} <b>penetration</b> <b>capabilities</b> of L-band over forests.

5000|$|The armor-piercing concept {{calls for}} more <b>penetration</b> <b>capability</b> than the target's armor thickness. Generally, the <b>penetration</b> <b>capability</b> of an armor-piercing round {{increases}} with the projectile's kinetic energy and also with concentration of that energy in a small area. Thus, an efficient means of achieving increased penetrating power is increased velocity for the projectile. However, projectile impact against armor at higher velocity causes greater levels of shock. Materials have characteristic maximum levels of shock capacity, beyond which they may shatter, or otherwise disintegrate. At relatively high impact velocities, steel {{is no longer an}} adequate material for armor-piercing rounds. Tungsten and tungsten alloys are suitable for use in even higher-velocity armor-piercing rounds, due to their very high shock tolerance and shatter resistance, and to their high melting and boiling temperatures. They also have very high density. Energy is concentrated by using a reduced-diameter tungsten shot, surrounded by a lightweight outer carrier, the sabot (a French word for a wooden shoe). This combination allows the firing of a smaller diameter (thus lower mass/aerodynamic resistance/penetration resistance) projectile with a larger area of expanding-propellant [...] "push", thus a greater propelling force and resulting kinetic energy.|$|E
