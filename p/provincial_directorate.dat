40|$|Abstract Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the consistency of death records of Izmir Metropolitan Municipality Directorate of Cemeteries and Izmir <b>Provincial</b> Health <b>Directorate</b> in 2010 and to provide a quantitative estimate of deaths that occurred in Izmir in 2010 through capture-recapture method. Methods: In this descriptive study, we examined whole death records of Izmir <b>Provincial</b> Health <b>Directorate</b> and Izmir Metropolitan Municipality Directorate of Cemeteries in 2010. The records of both institutions were matched exactly to evaluate the consistency of reporting. Missing records which were registered by only Directorate of Cemeteries, but not registered by <b>Provincial</b> Health <b>Directorate</b> were added the database of <b>Provincial</b> Health <b>Directorate.</b> The two source capture-recapture method implemented based on the records of two institutions. The number of deaths by age group and gender and level of completeness of <b>Provincial</b> Health <b>Directorate</b> records were calculated through this method. The observed and calculated numbers of death and summary mortality of measures of <b>Provincial</b> Health <b>Directorate</b> were compared with database of Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT). Results: 8. 9 % of deaths which registered at the Directorate of Cemeteries were missing at <b>Provincial</b> Health <b>Directorate.</b> Missing notifications showed concentration in the younger age groups, mainly stillbirths (98. 6 %) and infant deaths (46. 9 %). Decedents’ residence addresses of records which matched both instuitions were inconsistent. The level of completeness of <b>Provincial</b> Health <b>Directorate</b> records were 88. 6 % for male and 89. 3 % for female according to calculations using capture-recapture method. Calculated infant mortality rate and under five mortality rate were higher than the rates of observed records of <b>Provincial</b> Health <b>Directorate</b> and the TURKSAT data. Conclusions: This study indicates that the death records are insufficient in terms of reliability. Control mechanisms which provided in the system are required to be operated more efficiently to ensure coordination among the institutions and to execute complete and timely notifications.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} total quality management (TQM) implementation in Saudi <b>provincial</b> <b>directorates</b> in two contrasting case studies, a female directorate {{in the north of}} the country -Aljouf province- and a male directorate in the Eastern province, through the views of senior managers. In order to explore the local conditions and challenges of implementing TQM, 40 interviews were conducted alongside unstructured observations in both directorates and institutional and policy document analysis. The journey of the two <b>provincial</b> <b>Directorates</b> towards TQM had few common features and many differences. Having embarked earlier on TQM initiatives - even before the ministerial compulsion - the Eastern Directorate had already gone through some of the issues and challenges encountered by the Aljouf Directorate {{at the time of this}} research. The study also revealed profound differences in the two institutional cultures under focus and in the ways managers felt that TQM was impacting on their professional practice and environment. The research reports their perceptions of the implementation process and compares the two contexts on such challenges as training opportunities, reward systems, workplace relations, and mismanagement practices. The research concludes on a discussion of core issues identified, particularly the level of embeddedness of organisations - including public institutions- in local cultures and socioeconomic contexts, the centrality of actors in reform processes and the question of the universality of management approaches such as TQM and their applicability to public institutions such as education sector.
