Simple {{methods of}} oxidimetric {{determination}} of β-lactam antibiotic cefadroxil in pure powder and in capsules, {{that are based}} on S-oxidation reactions by <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogenperoxomonosulphate</b> acid in weak acid medium to S- oxide with following iodometric quantitative determination of the oxydator reagent excess were developed. Materials and methods. A triple potassium salt of caroate acid, 2 KHSO 5 •KHSO 4 •K 2 SO 4 (commercial «Oxone ® » DuPont, production) was used as oxidizing agent. Results. By the results of reaction kinetics using iodometric titration it was determined that redox reaction between cefadroxil and potassium hydrogenperoxomonosulfate is quantified and a stoichiometric: 1 mol of cefadroxil is per 1 mol of potassium hydrogen. Quantitative oxidation of Sulfur atom was finished in the time that is less than 1 min. The mean recovery of the main substance in the cefadroxil pure substance was 97. 76 %, RSD= 1. 33 % (δ= 1. 31 %), 1 mL of the standard 0. 0200 mol L - 1 sodium tiosulphate solution corresponds to 0. 003634 g of sodium cefadroxil (C 16 H 17 N 3 O 5 S) which should be 95 – 102 % in the pure anhydrous substance. The mean recovery of medical preparation “Cefadroxil”, 500 mg is 100. 06 %, RSD= 0. 96 % (δ= 1. 01 %), which should be 92. 5 – 107. 5 %, in anhydrous preparation. The limit detection is С= 0. 05 mg mL - 1. The advantages of the proposed procedure are the ability to assay cefadroxil by the biologically active part of the molecule (alicyclic and tiomethyl sulfur), good recovery and the accuracy of results. Conclusions. The obtained validation data meet the requirements of the State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine, which indicates the possibility of its introduction in the practice of analytical laboratories analysis, or application during the stepwise control process or manufacturing of drugs quality control during equipment washing </p...|$|E
