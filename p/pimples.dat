5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.

5|$|Smallpox virus {{preferentially}} attacks skin cells, {{causing the}} characteristic <b>pimples</b> (called macules) {{associated with the}} disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear. At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification: ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.|$|E
25|$|Rosacea is a {{long-term}} skin condition that typically affects the face. It results in redness, <b>pimples,</b> swelling, and small and superficial dilated blood vessels.

25|$|Oily skin {{is caused}} by over-active sebaceous glands, that produce a {{substance}} called sebum, a naturally healthy skin lubricant. When the skin produces excessive sebum, it becomes heavy and thick in texture. Oily skin is typified by shininess, blemishes and <b>pimples.</b> The oily-skin type is not necessarily bad, since such skin is less prone to wrinkling, or other signs of aging, because the oil helps to keep needed moisture locked into the epidermis (outermost layer of skin).|$|E

5000|$|In 1912, Fred and Joe Evans {{began working}} at the Ec-Ko studios in Teddington, and {{set up their own}} {{production}} company, Folly Films. [...] Unable to use the Charley Smiler character because of legal threats from Cricks and Martin, Evans devised a new character, <b>Pimple,</b> an accident-prone clown with a tight jacket, baggy pants, big boots, cricket cap, and lank strands of hair around a central parting. The films were scripted by Joe Evans. Early films were often chases; in <b>Pimple</b> and the Snake (1912), <b>Pimple</b> tries to retrieve a snake that has escaped from the zoo, but instead chases a lady's feather boa, causing chaos. By 1913, the comedies were increasingly spoofs of popular films, plays and novels. For example, a series of Lieutenant <b>Pimple</b> films poked fun at the screen exploits of the swashbuckling Lieutenant Daring, hero of more serious melodramas. <b>Pimple's</b> Battle of Waterloo (1913) was a merciless parody of the recent epic film The Battle of Waterloo, which had been characterised by location filming and (for the period) lavish production values. <b>Pimple's</b> version made a virtue of its low-budget filming in the backyard of their premises at Eel Pie Island to ridicule the earlier production. In <b>Pimple</b> in The Whip (1917), another parody, the Evans brothers used pantomime horses and a man wearing a horse head and carrying a stick in each hand to represent the front legs, to re-enact the original movie's thrilling race scenes. [...] The films also made use of jokey and punning intertitles.|$|R
500|$|Acne usually {{improves}} {{around the}} age of 20, but may persist into adulthood. Permanent physical scarring may occur. There is good {{evidence to support the}} idea that acne and associated scarring negatively impact a person's psychological state, worsen mood, lower self-esteem, and are associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Another psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne excoriée, which occurs when a person persistently picks and scratches <b>pimples,</b> irrespective of the severity of their acne. This can lead to significant scarring, changes in the affected person's skin pigmentation, and a cyclic worsening of the affected person's anxiety about their appearance. [...] Rare complications from acne or its treatment include the formation of pyogenic granulomas, osteoma cutis, and solid facial edema. [...] Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to reduce the chances of these poor outcomes.|$|E

The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds.

50|$|Another major theory {{concerning}} {{the origin of}} <b>pimple</b> and prairie mounds argues that they are either coppice dunes or nebkhas formed by the accumulation of wind-blown sediments around clumps of vegetation.
