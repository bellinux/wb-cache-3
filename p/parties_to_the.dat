Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, it would be impossible for them to later deny knowledge of the killings.

Through {{the end of the}} 1970s, the US, UK, and Soviet Union reached agreement on draft provisions prohibiting all testing, temporarily banning PNEs, and establishing a verification system including on-site inspections. However, the sides remained at odds over the precise details of verification and talks would permanently disband with the departure of President Jimmy Carter in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Baxter, {{the leading}} case on {{derivative}} governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd. In Bradken, the High Court upheld {{a claim for}} derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contracts and arrangements.|$|E

However, the mushrooms containing the drug were not specifically included in the convention, due largely to pressure from the Mexican government.|$|E
5|$|Unanimity was {{required}} for the decisions of both the Assembly and the Council, except in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the admission of new members. This requirement was {{a reflection of the}} League's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the League sought solution by consent, not by dictation. In case of a dispute, the consent of the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dispute was not required for unanimity.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not {{a major focus of}} Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

5|$|In his {{judgment}} of 29 January 2008, Justice Woo ordered Pacific Internet to release its subscribers' information {{only to the}} six Japanese companies that were <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> case. He explicitly denied Odex access to this information. He upheld District Judge Lau's decision that Odex was not the correct party to have asked for release of subscriber data. As a result, he directed the company to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$20,000. Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies. The ruling may have set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by {{making it more difficult}} for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloaders.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{remedies}} {{that may}} be sought by an applicant for {{judicial review is a}} declaration, which is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. The Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case, but it is possible they may adopt the test laid down in constitutional law cases. In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2012), the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist for a person have standing to bring a constitutional challenge: (1) he or she must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the first}} months of the Second World War Norwegian {{neutrality}} was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjorden. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality. Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E

5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not {{to go through with}} the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, {{advanced}} to Hadong and captured the village which was lightly defended {{by a group}} of South Korean police, as no military was available due to manpower shortages. The Koreans, members of the NK 6th Division, set up in roads east of the village and began sending probes and scout <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. The move {{was part of a larger}} coordinated operation by the 6th Division to take Chinju, and then Masan, in hopes of flanking the UN lines at their vulnerable southern limit. Thinking the UN units were disorganized and suffering low morale, NK 6th Division commander General Pang Ho San ordered his forces to aggressively advance to Chinju as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{queen conch}} fishery is usually managed under the {{regulations}} of individual nations.

In 2014, the <b>Parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (Cartagena Convention) included queen conch in Annex III of its Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW Protocol).
