50|$|When it was {{introduced}} in 1994, the Airbus A330 was equipped with <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes,</b> part number 0851GR, manufactured by Goodrich Sensors and Integrated Systems. A 2001 Airworthiness Directive required these to be replaced with either a later Goodrich design, part number 0851HL, or with <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> made by Thales, part number C16195AA. Air France chose to equip its fleet with the Thales <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes.</b> In September 2007, Airbus recommended that Thales C16195AA <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> should be replaced by Thales model C16195BA {{to address the problem}} of water ingress that had been observed. Since it was not an Airworthiness Directive, the guidelines allow the operator to apply the recommendations at its discretion. Air France implemented the change on its A320 fleet where the incidents of water ingress were observed and decided to do so in its A330/340 fleet only when failures started to occur in May 2008.|$|R
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|Accidents {{involving}} {{human error}} include American Airlines Flight 965, which {{crashed into a}} mountain in Buga, Colombia, on December 20, 1995, killing 151 passengers and eight crew members with four survivors, and the mid-air collision of DHL Flight 611 near Überlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on July 1, 2002, {{with the loss of}} two on board plus 69 on a Bashkirian Airlines Tupolev Tu-154. The American Airlines Flight 965 crash was blamed on navigational errors by the crew, while the collision of DHL Flight 611 involved air traffic control errors. Accidents attributed to pilot disorientation due to improperly maintained instruments include Birgenair Flight 301 on February 6, 1996, in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, with the loss of all 189 passengers and crew, and Aeroperú Flight 603 on October 2, 1996, off the coast of Pasamayo, Peru, with the loss of all 70 on board. In the Birgenair accident, investigators found that the aircraft had been stored without the necessary covers for its <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> sensors, thus allowing insects and debris to collect within, while in the Aeroperú accident, protective tape covering static vent sensors had not been removed.|$|E
25|$|An {{aircraft}} Machmeter or electronic {{flight information}} system (EFIS) can display Mach number derived from stagnation pressure (<b>pitot</b> <b>tube)</b> and static pressure.|$|E

2500|$|Investigations later {{showed that}} the plane was {{actually}} travelling at [...] at the time. The investigation concluded that one of three <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes,</b> used to measure airspeed, was blocked.|$|R
25|$|Birgenair Flight 301 was {{a flight}} {{chartered}} by Turkish-managed Birgenair partner Alas Nacionales from Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic to Frankfurt, Germany, via Gander, Canada, and Berlin, Germany. On 6 February 1996, the Boeing 757–225 operating the route crashed shortly after take-off from Puerto Plata's Gregorio Luperón International Airport. All 189 {{people on board}} died. The cause was a <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> that investigators believe was blocked by a wasp nest that was built inside it. The aircraft had sat unused for two days without the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> covers in place.|$|E
25|$|Pressure {{distributions}} {{on a test}} {{model can}} also be determined by performing a wake survey, in which either a single <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is used to obtain multiple readings downstream of the test model, or a multiple-tube manometer is mounted downstream and all its readings are taken.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft flight instruments, however, operate using {{pressure}} differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The {{assumption is that}} a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is dependent on altitude as well as speed.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{measurement}} {{avoids the}} need for <b>Pitot</b> <b>tubes,</b> hotwire anemometers or other intrusive Flow measurement probes. The method is capable of measuring an entire two-dimensional cross section (geometry) of the flow field simultaneously.|$|R
500|$|... 1 December 1974 – Northwest Airlines Flight 6231, a Boeing 727, crashed {{northwest}} of John F. Kennedy International Airport during climb {{en route to}} Buffalo Niagara International Airport because of blockage of the <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> by atmospheric icing.|$|R
40|$|The {{gust wind}} tunnel at IDR, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), has been {{enhanced}} {{and the impact}} of the modification has been characterized. Several flow quality configurations have been tested. The problems in measuring gusty winds with <b>Pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> have been considered. Experimental results have been obtained and compared with theoretically calculated results (based on potential flow theory). A theoretical correction term has been proposed for unsteady flow measurements obtained with <b>Pitot</b> <b>tubes.</b> The effect of unsteady flow on structures and laying bodies on the ground has been also considered. A theoretical model has been proposed for a semi-circular cylinder and experimental tests have been performed to study the unsteady flow effects, which can help in clarifying the phenomenon...|$|R
25|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator is a {{differential pressure gauge}} with the pressure reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube,</b> or stagnation pressure, and the static pressure. The <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|E
25|$|All three {{crew members}} on board died when the {{aircraft}} struck the ground following a stall and rapid descent {{caused by the}} crew's reaction to erroneous airspeed readings caused by atmospheric icing. The icing occurred due to failure {{to turn on the}} <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> heating {{at the start of the}} flight. This was one of two Boeing 727s to crash in the United States that day; the other was TWA Flight 514 in northern Virginia, northwest of Dulles airport.|$|E
25|$|Single-seat {{twin-engine}} fighter aircraft prototype. Two built (L6844 and L6845), can {{be distinguished}} from later production samples by the mudguards above the wheels (Though the first production sample (P6966) had them as well), the exhaust system and the so-called 'acorn' on the joint between fin and rudder. L6844 had a distinctive downward kink {{to the front of}} its <b>pitot</b> <b>tube,</b> atop the tail not seen again in following models. L6844's colour was dark grey and not red, as is often stated. L6844 had opposite-rotation engines, L6845 had the same rotation engines as per production machines.|$|E
5000|$|The NTSB report {{would later}} {{determine}} that the method used to clear the <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> was an [...] "...improper maintenance procedure" [...] and {{may have contributed to}} the crash. The chief mechanic, Sam DeThomas, used a small screwdriver and a coat hanger instead of the required procedure to remove the mud dauber nest. DeThomas said the reason he didn't follow the proper procedure (which required disconnecting instruments from the panel and blowing compressed air through the <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes)</b> was passenger impatience. DeThomas told investigators that [...] "I had the problem of people screaming that they wanted to get back on the airplane - not get back on the airplane, but they wanted to go" ...|$|R
500|$|The type's second fatal accident, {{and first}} while in {{commercial}} service, occurred on 1 June 2009 when Air France Flight 447, an A330-200 {{en route from}} Rio de Janeiro to Paris with 228 people on board, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean [...] northeast of the islands of Fernando de Noronha, with no survivors. Malfunctioning <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> provided an early focus for the investigation, as the aircraft involved had Thales-built [...] "–AA" [...] models known to record faulty airspeed data during icing conditions. In July 2009, Airbus advised A330 and A340 operators to replace Thales pitots with equivalents manufactured by Goodrich. Investigators later determined that the inadequate response of the pilots to both a loss of airspeed data from malfunctioning <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> and subsequent autopilot disengagement resulted in Flight 447 entering into an aerodynamic stall.|$|R
50|$|On September 12, 1980, Florida Commuter Airlines flight 65 crashed {{en route}} to Freeport, Bahamas killing all 34 {{passengers}} and crew. The cause {{was determined to be}} due in part to a malfunctioning air speed indicator caused by mud dauber nests that were improperly cleared from the aircraft's <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The rudder {{mass balance}} {{was larger than}} that of {{production}} aircraft, with an angled lower edge cutting further {{into the top of}} the fin. Although the basic wing plan was to stay the same for most production Spitfires, the prototype wing was structurally different: No weapons were fitted and the alclad skinning was laid out in spanwise strips; underneath the port wing the radiator bath started immediately behind the starboard undercarriage bay, with the opening conforming to the angle of the bay. Unlike production aircraft the wingtips were {{an integral part of the}} structure and, for the first series of tests a long <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> projected from near the port wingtip.|$|E
25|$|In early 1937, {{a second}} prototype, which {{received}} {{the serial number}} L7271, was completed; this second prototype had several differences from the first, including the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> being repositioned below the fuselage, a more rounded ventral gun turret, and a slightly modified nose. L7271 later received a pair of Dagger engines and was accordingly re-designated as the HP.53; on 1 July 1937, it performed its first flight after having received the new engines. Another prototype, L4032, was produced {{to serve as the}} production-standard prototype; on 24 June 1938, the third prototype conducted its maiden flight. L4032 differed from the previous two prototypes in that it was powered by a pair of Pegasus XVIII engines, the nose incorporated an optically-flat bomb-aiming panel, as well as the ventral and dorsal gun positions being revised.|$|E
500|$|A blocked <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is a pitot-static {{problem that}} will only affect {{airspeed}} indicators. [...] A blocked <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element. [...] A heated <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{found that}} the flightcrew had not {{activated}} the pitot head heaters and the <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> had become blocked with ice which caused the crew to receive incorrect airspeed readings. The crew, believing the readings were true, pulled back on the control column and raised the nose, which caused the aircraft to stall.|$|R
5000|$|Nose Cone and Q-Ball: The {{nose cone}} of the LES {{contained}} {{an array of}} 8 pressure-measuring <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> in a structure known as the [...] "Q-ball". These sensors were connected to the Command Module and Saturn launch vehicle guidance computers, allowing calculation of dynamic pressure (q) during atmospheric flight, and also the angle of attack {{in the event of}} an abort.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 August 2009, Airbus issued three Mandatory Service Bulletins, {{requiring}} that all A330 and A340 aircraft be fitted with two Goodrich 0851HL <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> and one Thales model C16195BA pitot (or alternatively {{three of the}} Goodrich pitot tubes); Thales model C16195AA <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> were no longer to be used. This requirement was incorporated into Airworthiness Directives issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on 31 August and by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 3 September. The replacement was {{to be completed by}} 7 January 2010. According to the FAA, in its Federal Register publication, use of the Thales model has resulted in [...] "reports of airspeed indication discrepancies while flying at high altitudes in inclement weather conditions", that [...] "could result in reduced control of the airplane." [...] The FAA further stated that the Thales model probe [...] "has not yet demonstrated the same level of robustness to withstand high-altitude ice crystals as Goodrich pitot probes P/N 0851HL." ...|$|R
500|$|The pitot {{pressure}} is {{obtained from the}} <b>pitot</b> <b>tube.</b> [...] The {{pitot pressure}} {{is a measure of}} ram air pressure (the air pressure created by vehicle motion or the air ramming into the tube), which, under ideal conditions, is equal to stagnation pressure, also called total pressure. [...] The <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is most often located on the wing or front section of an aircraft, facing forward, where its opening is exposed to the relative wind. [...] By situating the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> in such a location, the ram air pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less distorted by the aircraft's structure. [...] When airspeed increases, the ram air pressure is increased, which can be translated by the airspeed indicator.|$|E
500|$|... 1 June 2009 – The French {{air safety}} {{authority}} BEA said that <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> icing was {{a contributing factor}} in the crash of Air France Flight 447.|$|E
500|$|... 6 February 1996 – Birgenair Flight 301 {{crashed into}} the sea shortly after takeoff due to {{incorrect}} readings from the airspeed indicator. The suspected cause is a blocked <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> (this was never confirmed, as the airplane wreck was not recovered).|$|E
40|$|Velocity {{profiles}} of propeller and turbine type impellers were measured in both {{air and water}} using a hot wire anemometer probe, and two and three dimensional <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes.</b> These <b>pitot</b> probes were particularly suitable for this work, since they permitted the measurement of velocity and inclination of flow in the turbine jet, from which the radial and tangential velocity components were evaluated. [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|On 5 June 2009, the BEA {{cautioned against}} {{premature}} speculation {{as to the}} cause of the crash. At that time, the investigation had established only two certain facts: the weather near the airplane's planned route included significant convective cells typical of the equatorial regions; and the speeds measured by the three <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> had differed from each other during the last few minutes of the flight.|$|R
