50|$|A common {{example of}} <b>pin-to-pin</b> {{compatible}} devices {{which may not}} be electrically compatible are the 7400 series integrated circuits. The 7400 series devices have been produced on a number of different manufacturing processes, but have retained the same pinouts throughout. For example, all 7405 devices provide six NOT gates (or inverters) but may have incompatible supply voltage tolerances.|$|E
50|$|In other cases, {{particularly}} with computers, devices may be <b>pin-to-pin</b> compatible but made otherwise incompatible {{as a result}} of market segmentation. For example, Intel Skylake desktop-class Core and Xeon E3v5 processors both use the LGA 1151 socket, but motherboards using C230-series chipsets will only be compatible with Xeon-branded processors, and will not work with Core-branded processors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pin-to-pin</b> {{compatible}} devices {{share an}} assignment of functions to pins, but may have differing electrical characteristics (supply voltages, or oscillator frequencies) or thermal characteristics (TDPs, reflow curves, or temperature tolerances). As a result, {{their use in}} a system may require that portions of the system, such as its power delivery subsystem, be adapted to fit the new component.|$|E
50|$|Although devices {{which are}} pin-compatible {{share a common}} footprint, they are not {{necessarily}} electrically or thermally compatible. As a result, manufacturers often specify devices as being either <b>pin-to-pin</b> or drop-in compatible. Pin-compatible devices are generally produced to allow upgrading within a single product line, to allow end-of-life devices to be replaced with newer equivalents, or {{to compete with the}} equivalent products of other manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|The STM32 F4-series is {{the first}} group of STM32 {{microcontrollers}} based on the ARM Cortex-M4F core.

50|$|Microcontrollers, FPGAs, {{and other}} {{programmable}} devices may be <b>pin-to-pin</b> compatible {{from the perspective}} of the program on the device, but incompatible in terms of hardware. For example, the device may take the signal on pin X, negate it, and output the result on pin Y. If the method of configuring a pin remains the same but the package of the device (such as TSSOP or QFN) changes, the program will continue to function but the physical locations of the pins the program works with may change.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers are}} {{typically}} pale yellow, though white or pink forms are {{often seen in}} nature. The flowers are actinomorphic with a superior ovary which later forms a capsule opening by valves to release the small black seeds. The flowers are hermaphrodite but heterostylous; individual plants bear either pin flowers (longuistylous flower: with the capita of the style prominent) or thrum flowers (brevistylous flower: with the stamens prominent). Fertilisation can only take place between pin and thrum flowers. <b>Pin-to-pin</b> and thrum-to-thrum pollination is ineffective.|$|E
50|$|The W65C02S {{may also}} be {{operated}} at non-integral clock rates such as 13.5 MHz (digital SDTV luma sampling rate), 14.31818 MHz (NTSC colour carrier frequency × 4), 14.75 MHz (PAL square pixels), 14.7456 (baud rate crystal), etc., as long as VDD is sufficient to support the frequency. Designer Bill Mensch {{has pointed out that}} FMAX is affected by off-chip factors, such as the capacitive load on the microprocessor's pins. Minimizing load by using short signal tracks and fewest devices helps raise FMAX. The PLCC and QFP packages have less <b>pin-to-pin</b> capacitance than the PDIP package, and are more economical in the use of printed circuit board space.|$|E
5000|$|SPF is a Cadence Design Systems {{standard}} for defining netlist parasitics. DSPF and RSPF {{are the two}} forms of SPF; the term SPF itself is sometimes used (or misused) to represent parasitics in general. DSPF and RSPF both represent parasitic information as an RC network. RSPF represents each net as an RC [...] "pi" [...] model, which consists of an equivalent ”near" [...] capacitance at {{the driver of the}} net, an equivalent [...] "far" [...] capacitance for the net, and an equivalent resistance connecting these two capacitances. Each net has a single [...] "pi" [...] network for the network, regardless of how many pins are on the net. In addition to the pi network, RSPF causes the PrimeTime tool to calculate an Elmore delay for every <b>pin-to-pin</b> interconnects delay.|$|E
50|$|Connecting any two {{computers}} using USB {{requires a}} special proprietary bridge cable. A directly connected <b>pin-to-pin</b> USB type A cable does not work, as USB {{does not support}} such a type of communication. In fact, attempting to do so may even damage the connecting computers, as it will effectively short the two computers' power supplies together by connecting their 5V and GND lines. This can possibly destroy one or both machines and cause a fire hazard since the two machines may not have exactly the same USB source voltage. Therefore, Direct Cable Connection over USB is not possible; a USB link cable must be used, {{as seen in the}} Microsoft knowledge base article 814982. However, with a USB link cable, a program which supports data transfer using that cable must be used. Typically, such a program is supplied with the USB link cable. The DCC wizard or Windows Explorer cannot be used to transfer files over a USB link cable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pin-to-pin</b> {{electrical}} testing {{confirmed that}} Vcc Pins 12, 13, 14, and 15 were electrically common, presumably through the common exterior gold {{panel on the}} package wall. Likewise, Vss Pins 24, 25, 26, and 27 were common. Comparison to the xray images showed that these four pins funneled into a single wide trace on the mini-boards. All of the Vss pins were shorted to the Vcc pins with aresistance determined by the I-V slope at approximately 1.74 ohms, the low resistance indicating something other than an ESD defect.Similarly electrical overstress was considered an unlikely cause of failure as the part had not been under power since {{the time it was}} qualified at the factory. The three-dimensional geometry of the EEPROM module suggested the use of magnetic current imaging (MCI) on three, or more flat sides in order to construct the current path of the short within the module. As noted, the coordinate axes selected for this analysis are shown in Figure 1.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The <b>pin-to-pin</b> {{electrostatic}} discharge (ESD) issue for a differential low-noise amplifier (LNA) was studied in this work. A new design of ESD protection diodes with an embedded silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) was proposed {{to protect the}} giga-hertz differential LNA. The proposed ESD protection design was modified from the conventional ESD protection design without adding any extra device. The SCR path was established directly from one differential input pad to the other differential input pad so the <b>pin-to-pin</b> ESD robustness can be improved. This design had been verified in a 65 -nm CMOS process. Besides, this design had been further applied to a 24 -GHz LNA in the same 65 -nm CMOS process. Experimental results had shown that the proposed ESD protection design for the differential LNA can achieve excellent ESD robustness and good RF performances.

40|$|The lack of {{protection}} for semiconductor bridges (SCBs) against human electrostatic discharge (ESD) presents {{an obstacle to}} widespread use of this device. The goal {{of this research is}} to protect SCB initiators against <b>pin-to-pin</b> ESD without affecting their performance. Two techniques were investigated. In the first, a parallel capacitor is used to attenuate high frequencies. The second uses a parallel zener diode to limit the voltage amplitude. Both the 1 {micro}F capacitor and the 14 V zener diode protected the SCBs from ESD. The capacitor provided the best protection. The protection circuits had no effect on the SCB's threshold voltage. The function time for the CP-loaded SCBs with capacitors was about 11 {micro}s when fired by a firing set charged to 40 V. The SCBs failed to function when protected by the 6 V and 8 V zeners. The 51 V zener did not provide adequate protection against ESD. The parallel capacitor succeeded in protecting SCB initiators against <b>pin-to-pin</b> ESD without affecting their performance. Additional experiments should be done on SCBs and actual detonators to further quantify the effectiveness of this technique. Methods for retrofitting existing SCB initiators and integrating capacitors into future devices should also be explored...|$|E

40|$|We use {{large-scale}} parallel simulations {{to compute}} the motion of superconducting magnetic vortices during avalanches triggered by small field increases. We find that experimentally observable voltage bursts correspond to pulsing vortex movement along branched channels or winding chains, and relate vortex flow images to features of statistical distributions. As pin density is increased, a crossover occurs from interstitial motion in narrow easy-flow winding channels with typical avalanche sizes, to <b>pin-to-pin</b> motion in broad channels, characterized by a very broad distribution of sizes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to compute the}} prob-ability distribution of the delay of a combinational circuit and uses it obtain {{an estimate of the}} yield of the process that manufactures the circuit. We assume a simple delay model assigning a triangular distribution to the delay of a gate and ignore the logical function of the gate and the <b>pin-to-pin</b> delay. The method can handle tree-like circuits as well as circuits with reconvergent fanout in them. The chief advantage of this method over conventional Monte-Carlo simulation is that it is much faster while providing compa-rable quality. ...|$|E

The algorithm accepts the timing characteristics of two chips as input, and generates a combinational interface circuitry to implement communication between them. The algorithm {{consists of two}} parts. In the first part, we determine the direct <b>pin-to-pin</b> connections employing a 0 - 1 ILP formulation to minimize wiring area and dynamic power consumption in the resulting interface circuit. In the second part, we use a novel encoding method to synthesize connections between chips which require additional gates in the interface circuit.
