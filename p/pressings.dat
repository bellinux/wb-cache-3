40|$|In this paper, we {{will present}} {{the impact of the}} {{conditions}} in <b>pressing</b> chambers during the <b>pressing</b> of wooden briquettes. The conditions in <b>pressing</b> chambers can significantly impact the resulting compacting pressure required for the <b>pressing</b> of briquettes. In the introduction, we show which parameters of the <b>pressing</b> chamber during <b>pressing</b> can impact the resulting compacting pressure. The experiment results which are shown in this paper described the detected impact of some important <b>pressing</b> chamber parameters. This experiment aims to detect the <b>pressing</b> chamber length impact and the impact of the way of <b>pressing.</b> By setting the <b>pressing</b> conditions, {{we will be able to}} achieve the suitable resulting compacting pressure with respect to the required final briquettes quality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Groove <b>pressing</b> (GP) is {{a severe}} plastic {{deformation}} technique for producing ultra fine grain sized microstructures in metals and alloys. In the present study, groove <b>pressing</b> and a two-step process of groove <b>pressing</b> followed by cold rolling {{was used to}} investigate the potential of these processes to produce ultra fine grained copper with significantly enhanced strength. Mechanical and microstructure properties were evaluated after groove <b>pressing</b> and after groove <b>pressing</b> followed by cold rolling. The advantages conferred by groove <b>pressing</b> prior to cold rolling on producing copper with enhanced properties has been investigated...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{study was}} an {{analysis}} of the potential to shorten <b>pressing</b> time or reduce <b>pressing</b> temperature for plywood resinated with alcohol- and ester-modified PF resin. Birch and pine plywoods were produced using such modified resin at a temperature range of 135 to  115 [*]°C, at a constant <b>pressing</b> time (4  min) and at <b>pressing</b> times ranging from  240 to 150  s at a constant <b>pressing</b> temperature (135 [*]°C). Tests showed that the application of PF resin modified with polyols and esters makes it possible, under standard <b>pressing</b> conditions, i. e. 135 [*]°C and <b>pressing</b> time of 4  min, to produce plywood with improved properties in comparison to respective control plywoods. Moreover, it was shown that the used modifiers enhance resin reactivity, facilitating an adequate course of resin curing, resulting in the manufacture of plywoods with good properties even at a <b>pressing</b> temperature reduced by  20 [*]°C or <b>pressing</b> time shortened to 150  s...|$|R
50|$|The most {{successful}} release by Spartan Records has been their <b>pressing</b> of Mae's Destination: Beautiful. Their first <b>pressing</b> in 2012 involved {{a mix of}} 500 vinyl LPs including 200 white, 200 navy blue/white swirl, and 100 180 gsm black discs. After completely selling out the first <b>pressing</b> in 2012 they announced another <b>pressing</b> of 500 in 2013 on teal (100), white teal splatter (200) and Teal/white Swirl (200) these also sold out. Due to the popularity of this <b>pressing</b> they released another <b>pressing</b> of 500 copies on glow in the dark vinyl through Hot Topic and that <b>pressing</b> sold out quickly as well. In 2014 a fourth <b>pressing</b> of Destination: Beautiful was released {{as a part of}} Record Sale Day 2014 on Transparent Blue and gold vinyl.

40|$|Creases are marks {{that are}} created {{and left in}} a fabric during gament wear. Pressing is a process to flatten garment panels and sharpen garment edges and pleats. To {{minimize}} crease, the fabric should recover after <b>pressing</b> without creating a creased edge. Whereas, good <b>pressing</b> performance means the creased edge stays sharp after <b>pressing.</b> Good crease recovery and <b>pressing</b> performance appear contradictory. However, crease recovery and <b>pressing</b> performance are different as creases are formed during waer and <b>pressing</b> is carried out using equipment such as iron, <b>pressing</b> machines, etc. The condition, i. e. temperature. The latter has much higher temperature, pressure and humidity.

5|$|The {{nineteen}} {{tracks on}} Wonderwall Music range from {{just over a}} minute in length to five-and-a-half minutes. On some <b>pressings</b> of the 1968 LP, various pieces lacked mastering rills between them; with these selections instead presented as medleys, the number of distinct album tracks was reduced to twelve. On many of the Indian selections, instruments such as sitar, surbahar and harmonium provide a drone-like backing, over which Harrison's chosen instrument plays the main musical theme.|$|E
5|$|Wine was {{commonly}} {{drunk and}} was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially red wine) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape <b>pressings.</b> The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third <b>pressings</b> were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually {{had to settle for}} a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only available choice.|$|E

30|$|The {{metallurgical}} {{phase of}} nanocomposites {{is shown in}} Fig. 3 in the longitudinal and traverse directions relative to the hot <b>pressing</b> direction. There are {{significant differences in the}} metallurgical phase microstructure perpendicular and parallel to the hot <b>pressing</b> direction. The graphite in the black region perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction exhibits a flocculent shape, and the graphite in the black region parallel to the hot-pressing direction exhibits a more slender shape. The reasons for this difference are as follows: The hot <b>pressing</b> sintering process is single-action <b>pressing.</b> Vertical pressure is applied on the composite powder in a cylindrical graphite die. There are significant morphological differences between the graphite perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction and the graphite parallel to the hot-pressing direction, because the graphite is intrinsically fluffy. These differences are maintained after isostatic <b>pressing,</b> because the pressures applied to the composite green body are equal in every direction during isostatic <b>pressing</b> after the hot <b>pressing</b> sintering step. Thus, the morphological differences formed during hot <b>pressing</b> sintering remain.|$|R

40|$|The first {{experiment}} {{studied the}} effects of punishment on rats' lever <b>pressing</b> maintained by a fixed-interval schedule of food reinforcement and on the associated schedule-induced licking. When licking was followed by shock, licking was suppressed but lever <b>pressing</b> was largely unaffected. When lever <b>pressing</b> was followed by shock, lever <b>pressing</b> was suppressed but licking was unaffected. In both cases, the punished behavior recovered its previous unpunished level when the shocks were discontinued. In a second experiment, the rats' lever <b>pressing</b> was maintained by a variable-interval schedule of food reinforcement under which polydipsic licking also developed. Both lever <b>pressing</b> and licking were partially suppressed during a stimulus correlated with occasional unavoidable electric shocks. With a higher shock intensity, both behaviors were suppressed further. Both lever <b>pressing</b> and licking recovered their previous levels when shocks were discontinued. These results show that schedule-induced licking, which {{has been described as}} adjunctive behavior, can be suppressed by procedures that suppress reinforced lever <b>pressing,</b> an operant behavior...|$|R
