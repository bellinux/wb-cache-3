It grew more than ten <b>percent</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. In 2007, SAS revenue was $2.15 billion, and in 2013 its revenue was $3.02 billion. By the late 1990s, SAS was the largest privately held software company. The Associated Press reported that analysts attributed the growth to aggressive R spending. It had the highest ratio of its revenues spent on R in the industry for eight years, setting a record of 34 percent of its revenues in 1993, as it {{was working on a}} new menu-based interface.

This increase in spending did not occur, however. The Defence White Paper 2013 had similar strategic themes, but set out a more modest program of defence spending which reflected the government's constrained finances.

40|$|A {{calculation}} of loss rates is reported for human structural and functional variables from a sub-stantially larger data set than has been previously studied. Data were collected for healthy, non-smoking human subjects of both sexes from a literature search of cross-sectional, longitudinal, and cross-sequential studies. The number of studies analyzed was 469, and {{the total number of}} subjects was 54, 274. A linear model provided a fit of the data, for each variable, that was not significantly different from the best polynomial fit. Therefore, linear loss rates (as a <b>percent</b> de-cline <b>per</b> <b>year</b> from the reference value at age 30) were calculated for 445 variables from 13 or-gan systems, and additionally for 24 variables even more integrative, such as maximum oxygen consumption and exercise performance, that express effects of multiple contributing variables and systems. The frequency distribution of the 13 individual system linear loss rates (as <b>percent</b> loss <b>per</b> <b>year)</b> for a very healthy population has roughly a unimodal, right-skewed shape, with mean 0. 65, median 0. 5, and variance 0. 32.

40|$|A novel {{application}} of age-period-cohort methods {{are used to}} explain changes in vehicle based crash rates in New South Wales, Australia over the period 2003 - 2010. Models are developed using vehicle age, crash period and vehicle cohort to explain changes {{in the rate of}} single vehicle driver fatalities and injuries in vehicles less than 13 years of age. Large declines in risk are associated with vehicle cohorts built after about 1996. The decline in risk appears to have accelerated to 12 <b>percent</b> <b>per</b> vehicle cohort <b>year</b> for cohorts since 2004. Within each cohort, the risk of crashing appears to be a minimum at two years of age and increases as the vehicle ages beyond this. Period effects (i. e., other road safety measures) between 2003 and 2010 appear to have contributed to declines of up to about two <b>percent</b> <b>per</b> annum to the driver-fatality single vehicle crash rate, and possibly only negligible improvements to the driver-injury single vehicle crash rate. Vehicle improvements appear to have been responsible for a decline in per-vehicle crash risk of at least three <b>percent</b> <b>per</b> calendar <b>year</b> for both severity levels over the same period.

25|$|The {{reduction}} in public expenditures, {{which was at}} the heart of the stabilization program, slowed the economy sharply in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Real gross national product declined 1.5 percent in 1979 and 1.3 percent in 1980. The manufacturing and services sectors felt much of the impact of this drop in income, with the manufacturing sector operating at close to 50 percent of total capacity. As the external-payments constraint eased, the economy bounced back sharply. Between 1981 and 1985, real GNP grew 3 <b>percent</b> <b>per</b> <b>year,</b> led by growth in the manufacturing sector. With tight controls on workers' earnings and activities, the industrial sector began drawing on unused industrial capacity and raised output by an average rate of 9.1 <b>percent</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> between 1981 and 1985.
