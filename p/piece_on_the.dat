5|$|Scholars {{have long}} speculated about the {{influence}} – if any – of Hamnet's death upon William Shakespeare's writing. Unlike his contemporary Ben Jonson, who wrote a lengthy <b>piece</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> death of his own son, Shakespeare, if he wrote anything in response, did so more subtly. At the time his son died, Shakespeare was writing primarily comedies, and that writing continued {{until a few years}} after Hamnet's death, when his major tragedies were written. It is possible that his tragedies gained depth from his experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the {{orchestra}} released its first record through Koch, with works by Gian Carlo Menotti, Ronald Lo Presti and Norman Dello Joio. DePreist and the Symphony then issued two special edition albums not available commercially: Romeo and Juliet (1992), featuring Tchaikovsky's Fantasy Overture Romeo and Juliet, and Roman Festivals (1993), a re-issue {{of the performance}} of Respighi's Feste Romane from Bravura. On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 1995, the Symphony released its second album through Koch, with works by Joseph Schwantner and Nicolas Flagello; more than 30 United States radio stations broadcast Schwantner's <b>piece</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> holiday to commemorate the civil rights leader. The album reached a peak position of number three on Billboard Classical Albums chart and remains the Symphony's best-selling album to date. Later that year, to commemorate its centenary, the Symphony released its first compilation album, Centennial Collection, which contained material from previously released recordings. Erich Wolfgang Korngold: The Sea Hawk; Symphony in F-Sharp followed in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Written and {{directed}} by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the theatrical trailer for Citizen Kane differs from other trailers in {{that it did not}} feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-documentary <b>piece</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> film's production. Filmed {{at the same time as}} Citizen Kane itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character. The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of Everett Sloane appearing at first to be running into the camera, which turns out to be the reflection of the camera in a mirror.|$|E

Removing an old design does not affect pieces of that design already on the board or in the reserves of that design.|$|E

He {{advanced}} his men across an open field towards the British, who withdrew into the edge of a forest. There followed an intense fight, and the only artillery <b>piece</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field, which began in the possession of Willett's men, was captured and recaptured repeatedly. For unknown reasons, the militia on Willett's right flank suddenly turned and fled in a panic, and Willett tried to halt the retreat and turn his men.|$|E

25|$|Openings {{are also}} {{classified}} as Static Rook openings, where the offense {{is supported by}} the rook in its original position, and Ranging Rook openings, where the rook moves to the center or left of the board to support an attack there, typically with the idea of allowing the opponent to attack while arranging a better defense and aiming for a counterattack. However, as the most powerful <b>piece</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board, the rook invites attack, and in most cases, especially for weaker players, {{it is a good idea}} to keep the king well away from the rook. Relatedly, the static vs ranging classification corresponds to castle development: static rook positions tend to have castles on the left side of the board while ranging rook positions tend to have castles on the right side.|$|E
