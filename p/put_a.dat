Due to the book release, the two are now business partners, and this relationship could affect Joyce's impartiality while umpiring Galarraga's team. It is similar to the policy that prevented umpire Jim Wolf from being the plate umpire in games that his younger brother Randy pitched in.|$|E

25|$|The fee plugs {{which had}} aired {{in the middle}} of the show on the CBS version were {{featured}} during the closing credits. The ticket plugs were now shown on every episode.

5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> flowing move {{together in the}} opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo.

The Portuguese winger controlled the ball on the chest before hitting the ball just past the far post.|$|E

Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager.
