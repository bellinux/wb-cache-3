30|$|VP shunt allows life-long {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) drainage; however, its malfunction {{is an important}} problem [4, 5]. In pediatric cases, the rate of revision requirement is 16 % within the first month and may be up to 39 % within the first year [5]. Major causes of shunt malfunction include obstruction, infection, and malposition. It {{has been reported that}} free-hand method results in malposition of the shunt in 12.3 – 44 % of cases [3, 5]. Since our case had a unilaterally enlarged ventricle, <b>partial</b> <b>malfunction</b> due to shortness of the proximal catheter was suspected. While free-hand method is performed according to anatomical landmarks, several advanced techniques including stereotaxic navigation, ultrasonography, and endoscopy are recommended {{to improve the quality of}} catheter placement [3, 6]. In the free-hand method, the presence of CSF drainage from the catheter tip does not necessarily mean that the shunt is in correct size and location within the ventricle. In pediatric patients, although endoscopic ventricular catheter placement reduces catheter failure rates, overall failure rates have been reported to be the same [2]. In a comparison of ultrasound with stereotaxic navigation, the speed of set-up, lack of requirement for additional imaging, and visualization in real-time are the important advantages to ultrasound [7]. In terms of proximal catheter position, ultrasound-guided VP shunt or external ventricular catheterization is known to be more successful compared to free-hand method [7 – 9]. However, while an additional burr hole or a larger burr hole is needed with a burr hole-type ultrasound probe for ultrasound guidance in adults [7], transfontanellar ultrasound is a more minimally invasive method in infants with an open fontanelle. Shkolnik and McLone placed a VP shunt with the help of transfontanelle ultrasound in seven hydrocephalic patients, one being a revision. In their practice, the proximal catheter tip is intended to be in front of the foramen Monro [9]. In our revision case, the proximal end of the shunt was placed in the contralateral ventricle, which was dilated, with the help of transfontanelle ultrasound.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the field of}} bio-mimetic robots that resemble the shape of an insect or an aquatic animal, among many others. One bio-mimetic robot serves the purpose of exploring pipelines, spotting any troubled areas or malfunctions and reporting its data. Moreover, the robot is able to prepare for and react to any abnormal routes in the pipeline. In order to move effectively inside a pipeline, the robot’s movement will resemble that of a lizard. When situated in massive pipelines with complex routes, the robot places fixed sensors in several important spots in order to complete its monitoring. This monitoring task is to prevent a major system failure by preemptively recognizing any minor or <b>partial</b> <b>malfunctions.</b> Areas uncovered by fixed sensors are usually impossible to provide real-time observation and examination, and thus are dependant on periodical offline monitoring. This paper provides the Monitoring System that is able to monitor the entire area of pipelines—with and without fixed sensors—by using the bio-mimetic robot.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} architectural styles nowadays is Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). In this type of architecture {{there are a lot of}} dependencies between services, but each service is an independent element of the system. In this situation we need some way to ensure that every service is working correctly and to take actions when something goes wrong to evolve the architecture as fast as we can. For example, if one of the lower level services of the service composition stops working, it could lead to a total or <b>partial</b> system <b>malfunction.</b> In this situation there is a need to be able to build reliable SOA systems. Our proposal, SALMon, is based on monitoring the services for Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. The SALMon architecture is composed of three types of components: Monitors that are composed of measure instruments, the measured quality attributes being taken from an ISO/IEC 9126 - 1 -based service oriented quality model; Analyzers that check the SLA rules; and Decision Makers that perform corrective actions to satisfy SLA rules again. These 3 types of components are mostly technology-independent and they act as services inside of a SOA system making our architecture very scalable and comfortable for its purpose. 1...|$|R
40|$|A fault {{tolerant}} three phase five-level inverter configuration {{for the application}} of islanded photovoltaic (PV) systems is proposed. The {{fault tolerant}} five-level inverter configuration is achieved by stacking a two-level inverter, a three-level neutral point clamped inverter along with three bidirectional switches. This configuration is fed with two DC sources. The proposed configuration shows fault tolerant behavior towards switch open circuit fault in one or more inverter legs. In case of source failure it is able to utilize the healthier source for supplying uninterrupted power to essential loads. During fault the proposed fault tolerant inverter operates as three-level inverter with half of the rated power. The configuration also has the provision of energy balancing among two sources during <b>partial</b> shading or <b>malfunctioning</b> of PV system. The operation of the proposed inverter during different failure modes and energy balancing among two sources are discussed and verified using MATLAB/SIMULINK...|$|R
40|$|In this Master’s Thesis a new Distributed Award Protocol (DAP) for robot {{communication}} and cooperation is presented. Task assignment (contract awarding) is done dynamically with contracts assigned to robots {{based upon the}} best bid received. Instead of having a manager and a contractor it is proposed a fully distributed bidding/awarding mechanism without a distinguished master. The best bidding robots are awarded with contract for execution. The contractors make decisions locally. This brings the following benefits: no communication bottleneck, low computational power requirement, increased robustness. DAP can handle multitasking. Tasks can be injected into system during the execution of already allocated tasks. As tasks have priorities, in the next cycle after taking into account actual bid parameters of all robots, tasks can be re-allocated. The aim is to minimize a global cost function which is a compromise between cost of task execution and cost of resources usage. Information about tasks and bid values is spread among robots {{with the use of}} a Round Robin Route, which is a novel solution proposed in this work. This method allows also identifying failed robots. Such failed robot is eliminated from the list of awarded robots and its replacement is found so the task is still executed by a team. If the failure of a robot was temporary (e. g. communication noise) and the robot can recover, it can again participate in the next bidding/awarding process. Using a bidding/awarding mechanism allows robots to dynamically relocate among tasks. This is also contributes to system robustness. DAP was evaluated through multiple experiments done in the multi-robot simulation system. Various scenarios were tested to check the idea of the main algorithm. Different failures of robots (communication failures, <b>partial</b> hardware <b>malfunctions)</b> were simulated and observations were made regarding how DAP recovers from them. Also the DAP flexibility to environment changes was watched. The experiments in the simulated environment confirmed the above features of DAP...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} self-initiated and {{although}} the research is primarily motivated by {{the interest of the}} researcher, it is relevant in many respects. The rediscovery of the church year {{is one of the most}} remarkable aspects of the twentieth-century reform and renewal of Christian worship. This renewed interest has also been noted in the Dutch Reformed Church, especially in two decisions during 1998 and 2002, in connection with the church year and related lectionaries. In many publications it has been shown that the church year provides a frame of reference, not only with regard to the liturgy and preaching, but also to other communicative acts of the congregation in serving the gospel. A study of the available literature showed that a gap exists concerning the practice of the church year in the church, especially with regard to the preaching. Since the researcher is convinced that the church year can play a valuable role in the preaching of the church, the study was done by means of practical theological methodology by which the dynamic interaction between the theory and practice is studied. A scientific look is taken at the praxis regarding the church year in the preaching of the church by combining a literary approach with an approach by means of an empirical research, which leads to an adjusted theory for the praxis regarding the church year in the preaching of the church. The research problem is stated in chapter 1 and an explanation and formulation of the question under research, as well as the basic hypothesis of the study are stated: The <b>partial</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> regarding the practice of the church year in the preaching of preachers in the Dutch Reformed Church necessitates certain adaptations. The purpose and method of the study is given and the field of the study is demarcated. An explanation of the project design of the study is also given. In chapter 2 the scientific, practical theological and homiletical points of departure are stated together with reflection on insights of Pneumatological, practical-theological ecclesiological, anthropo-logical nature. The changing society and the challenges it poses to preaching is also reflected upon as part of creating a frame of reference for the research. In chapter 3 a theological basic theory for the church year in the preaching is developed. This part of the study, which includes a description and explication of the church year, also functions as a conceptual framework for the empirical part of the study. After the emphasis of the first three chapters on the hermeneutical activity of understanding, which was done through the study of available literature on the church year in order to get a grip on the topic and to formulate a theory, empirical research aimed at an adjusted theory for the praxis of the church year in the preaching of the church, was still needed. Thus, in chapter 4, an empirical investigation, conducted quantitatively, was undertaken. The information that was gathered, helped to understand and explain the praxis under investigation and the results confirmed the hypothesis of the study, namely that there are indeed problems with regard to the functioning of the church year in the preaching of the preachers in the Dutch Reformed Church. Areas in which problems exist was explicated. In chapter 5 the method and instruments which was used, is explained. Hermeneutical interaction takes place between the results of the empirical investigation and the results of the literary investigation. In the strategic component of the study, a new theory of praxis concerning the church year in the preaching as a communicative act of the church, is formulated as regulative activity which intends to change the existing praxis. At the end of the study, it is concluded that the church year can be of service and could be utilised in such a way that the service and activities of the church which is under-taken in accord and in interaction therewith, could be stimulated. Within a context of poverty and continuing change, the church year - if it is valued positively and if it is accentuated in the preaching - could lead to the celebration of God, Who He is, what He has done, is doing and are still going to do.

40|$|Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) is a {{key enzyme}} in lipid transport. It catalyses the {{hydrolysis}} of the triacylglycerol component of chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), providing non-esterified fatty acids for tissue utilization. The gene encoding for LPL has already been identified in several species except the dog. Mutations of the human LPL-gene {{have been shown to}} cause <b>partial</b> or complete <b>malfunction</b> of the enzyme, resulting in accumulation of lipoproteins in the blood. This condition is called familial LPL deficiency. LPL malfunction results in hyperlipoproteinemia, recurrent acute pancreatitis, and ultimately pancreatic insufficiency. Several authors have postulated a genetic cause for pancreatitis in the Miniature Schnauzer. An idiopathic increase in serum triglyceride concentration can also be found in this breed. Based on these findings we were evaluating a possible role of the lipoprotein lipase gene in the development of pancreatitis and hyperlipidemia in the Miniature Schnauzer. First, we identified the genetic sequence of the LPL gene in the dog. We determined clones on the Trace Archive database for the canine genome project that contain the genomic sequence of a particular exon as well as its adjacent intronic regions. Based on these findings we designed primers for each exon using the software Netprimer (www. premierbiosoft. com/netprimer/index. html). Canine subjects were chosen from a pool of 170 Miniature Schnauzers from the database at the Gastrointestinal Laboratory at Texas A&M University. Based on clinical history, serum cPLI concentrations, and serum triglyceride concentrations 21 Miniature Schnauzers were chosen and were selected into a clinically normal control group (9 dogs) and an affected group (12 dogs). DNA was then collected from either white blood cells or mucosal cells of these dogs. After PCR optimization, exon 1 through 9 including the adjacent intronic regions were amplified in all dogs using MasterAmp Extra – Long PCR Kit (Epicentre, WI, USA) and were sequenced in triplicates. Differences in the nucleotide sequences were then compared among the two groups. 10 exonic SNPs and 9 intronic SNPs were identified. Upon analysis, none of these variations could be associated with the disease status. We conclude that pancreatitis associated with hyperlipidemia in the Miniature Schnauzer is not linked to mutations of the lipoprotein lipase gene or its splicing regions...|$|R
40|$|Global Navigation Satellite System&# 146;s (GNSS) known {{shortcomings}} in difficult radio-environments &# 150; signal obstructions and jamming vulnerability &# 150; could pose significant risks in critical location based services (LBS) applications. Off-the-shelf {{systems such as}} &# 145;Spot Satellite Messenger&# 146; are not compliant for E 911 and other emergency response requirements. Despite considerable research and engineering efforts, few techniques have demonstrated promising results. Multiple sensor-based techniques and systems based on Assisted-GNSS (AGNSS) have been proposed {{in order to improve}} the performance of stand-alone GNSS. Improved time-to-first-fix (TTFF), system availability and positioning accuracy are the notable performance gains. Many AGNSS techniques employ proprietary protocols which limit further academic research or pre-deployment testing. The Open Source GNSS Reference Server (OSGRS) &# 150; on the other hand uses a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) based stateless GNSS Reference Interface Protocol (GRIP). For the research described in this thesis, a hardware based GNSS receiver was first used to acquire assistance data. Subsequent versions of OSGRS have seen alternative acquisition approaches using numerous GNSS Casters available over Internet Protocol. A variety of data formats are available, hence OSGRSv 2 is capable of Multiple Assisted GNSS (MAGNSS). Client and server integration, testing and performance benchmarking against competing technologies appeared promising. The system tracked the highest number of satellites, availability and higher accuracy with low TTFF values. Three configurations of multi-GNSS assistance servers allow flexible operation independent of the presence of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) &# 150; a limitation of OSGRSv 1. Iteratively, the server has been augmented with Long Term Evolution (LTE) Positioning Protocol (LPP) and the associated extensions (LPPe) to develop the third generation OSGRSv 3. Interconnection of multiple networks is provided through Internet Protocol (IP) data control gateways for user-specific information exchange. Assistance Model Portfolio of OSGRSv 3 has been expanded with the development of mobile communications interworking criteria. A real network implementation in a controlled mobile network laboratory has been configured. The architecture exploits LTE Radio Access Network (RAN), Transmission, Core and GNSS elements to test the performance of the system. Performance graphs demonstrate that Radio Resource Location Protocol (RRLP) based system lowered the TTFF and improved the satellite availability and positioning accuracy over OSGRSv 1 or OSGRSv 2. Options of selectively choosing which GNSS to use is managed through a source selector switch. Presence of basic networking infrastructure has been a critical limitation of Multiple Assisted GNSS systems. A low infrastructure strategy to augment GNSS with adhoc Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN) has been presented. Pre-programmed fixed sensor nodes are deployed in the test area where a rover sensor node is connected to a GNSS-capable mobile device. Based on the received signal strength, signature indices are generated and autonomous proximity calculations of the rover are performed. The localization information is transferred to GNSS via assistance messages. Experiments were conducted to simulate a reduction in navigation search space, competitive TTFF and improved availability and accuracy. Link quality indicators can effectively provide pre-processed frequency offset, range and coordinate assistance in the absence of IP network, in building coverage (IBC) repeaters or GNSS. Stand-alone sensors based localization demonstrated cm-level accuracy, response sensitivity and reliability. System robustness against <b>partial</b> node <b>malfunction</b> in instances of clocking, time syncing, thermal noise, coordinate decoding and processing issues, was observed. Such errors can arbitrarily eventuate in erroneous localization. Reference Server, Caster and Sensor Networks and MAGNSS can provide cost effective alternatives for generic and specific AGNSS localization applications. The contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows: a. 	GPS, GNSS, AGNSS, RNSS, SBAS and alternative positioning technologies have been reviewed. Several LBS variants have been investigated and shortcomings listed. Alternative navigation, communication and logging techniques have been suggested to BWRS, NSW Police and the VRA. SPOT GNSS Messenger has been performance evaluated. Architecture for a Multiple Sensor based hybrid Multi-GNSS has been developed. b. 	An NTRIP capable OSGRS has been developed. System efficiency has been improved and the system has been integrated with an IP and mobile data network. Several configurations of the OSGRS have been developed to suit varying scenarios. Such configurations have been performance tested and benchmarked. c. 	OSGRSv 3 has been developed by upgrading the previous version of server. The system has been augmented with SMLC, GMLC, RRLP 3 GPP LPP and OMA LPPe functionality. Performance of the OSGRSv 3 vis-à-vis the OSGRSv 2 has been evaluated. The design and architecture of the OSGRSv 4 has been developed. d. 	An autonomous positioning method employing the WSN-enabled AGNSS has been developed and tested. The stand-alone WSN-based positioning method which can mitigate the associated communication, energy-cycle and radio limitations has been developed and employed to benchmark the WSN-enabled AGNSS...|$|R
