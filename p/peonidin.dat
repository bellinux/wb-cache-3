40|$|Chronic low-grade {{inflammation}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in the pathogenesis of obesity, due to its associated chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases and cancer. Thus, targeting inflammation is an attractive strategy to counter the burden of obesity-induced health problems. Recently, food-derived bioactive compounds have been spotlighted as a regulator against various chronic diseases due to their low toxicity, as opposed to drugs that induce severe side effects. Here we describe the beneficial effects of dietary anthocyanins on obesity-induced metabolic disorders and inflammation. Red cabbage microgreen, blueberry, blackcurrant, mulberry, cherry, black elderberry, black soybean, chokeberry and jaboticaba peel contain a variety of anthocyanins including cyanidins, delphinidins, malvidins, pelargonidins, <b>peonidins</b> and petunidins, and have been reported to alter both metabolic markers and inflammatory markers in cells, animals, and humans. This review discusses the interplay between inflammation and obesity, and their subsequent regulation via the use of dietary anthocyanins, suggesting an alternative dietary strategy to ameliorate obesity and obesity associated chronic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Improving the micronutrients in {{food has}} become an {{important}} field of the Second Green Revolution. In recent years, minor bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, pigments and carotenoids, have attracted more and more interest from both researchers and food manufactures as health-promoting and disease-preventing effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies. One of plant pigments, wheat anthocyanins as plant phenolics are increasingly attractive as natural compounds positively affecting consumer´s health and condition moreover wheat is staple food source consumed usually daily. For a purple, blue, or red colour of wheat seed are responsible glycosylated cyanidins, delphinidins, malvinidins, pelargonidins, petunidins, and <b>peonidins</b> located in aleurone layer or pericarp, respectively. Other than white seed colour is not natural for common hexaploid wheat but this trait can be introduced from donors by aimed breeding programs. The way of wheat anthocyanins to provide positive effects for consumer´s physiology is limited due to their specific occurrence in seed parts usually removed during grain milling practice and lower stability during processing to food...|$|R
40|$|Interest in the {{chemistry}} {{and stability of}} flavonoids in foods has been generated by countless epidemiological, in vitro, and in vivo studies that suggest a variety of potential health promoting effects of diets rich in flavonoids. Flavonoids {{have been shown to}} interact with multiple components in beverages including macromolecules, minerals, certain vitamins, and other flavonoids. Furthermore, environmental conditions including light exposure, elevated temperatures, and relative humidity have been shown to modify flavonoid stability. However, specific mechanisms, relative kinetics of degradation reactions and the impact of macromolecules in model beverages and biological fluids on flavonoid stability remain largely unknown. Recently, interest in the application of natural pigments to replace synthetic dyes in beverages has grown. However, there is limited information concerning the impact of prominent beverage ingredients, photo and thermal stress, and the potential mechanisms involved in anthocyanin degradation. Chapter 2 of this dissertation investigates the stability of anthocyanin rich grape and purple sweet potato (PSP) extracts to photo and thermal stresses in ready-to-drink beverage models including hot-fill beverages with varying concentrations of ascorbic acid, a preserved beverage, and a vitamin enriched water beverage. Thermal and photo stress were induced at 40, 60, and 80 oC and 250, 500, and 750 W/m 2, respectively. Increasing concentration of ascorbic acid resulted in more rapid degradation of anthocyanins through thermal stress, but had a protective effect through photo stress. Additionally, PSP was significantly less stable than grape extract in the vitamin enriched water model beverage through photo stress. Furthermore, a potential degradation mechanism involving the formation of monoacylated <b>peonidins</b> from diacylated <b>peonidins</b> under photo, but not thermal, stress was identified. The transfer of dietary flavonoids to human milk and the potential exposure to nursing infants quickly became of interest. Chapters 3 and 4 of this dissertation focuses on the presence of several flavonoids in human milk samples. In our initial screening, samples were collected from 17 women who delivered healthy term babies (37 wk of gestation) at 1, 4, and 13 -wk postpartum intervals. Epicatechin (63. 7 - 828. 5 nmol/L), epicatechin gallate (55. 7 - 645. 6 nmol/L), epigallocatechin gallate (215. 1 - 2364. 7 nmol/L), naringenin (64. 1 - 722. 0 nmol/L), kaempferol (7. 8 - 71. 4 nmol/L),hesperetin (74. 8 - 1603. 1 nmol/L), and quercetin (32. 5 - 108. 6 nmol/L) were present in human milk samples with high inter/intraindividual variability. With the exception of kaempferol, the mean flavonoid content in human milk was not statistically different among lactation stages. In contrast, carotenoids in human milk significantly decreased from weeks 1 to 13 of lactation. In our follow up study, cohorts from the USA, China, and Mexico each comprised of 20 women in each country. Milk samples were collected at 2, 4, 13, and 26 -wk postpartum intervals. Glucuronides of epicatechin, naringenin, kaempferol, hesperetin, and quercetin were the predominant metabolites detected. Despite all efforts, anthocyanins were not detected in any of the 4 cohorts between the 2 studies and their relatively low bioavailability and presence in tissue is likely a contributing factor. The presence of flavonoids in human milk suggested that select flavonoids maintained relative stability in protein rich fluid in order to avoid degradation between emptying through feeding. Previous studies indicated that polyphenols bind to proline rich segments, including those on caseins, and may have a stabilization effect. Chapter 5 investigates the impact of protein rich milk on tea flavan- 3 -ol degradation during thermal treatment. Single strength milk (36. 2 protein per L), quarter strength milk (9. 0 g protein per L), and a zero protein control models were incubated with isolated epigallocatechin gallate and green tea extract at 62 or 37 oC for 180 minutes. Intact flavan- 3 -ols as well as auto-oxidation products including theasinesins (THSNs) and P- 2 dimer concentrations were quantified by LC-MS. In general, greater polyphenol to protein ratios increased first order degradation rates, which consequently decreased the formation of THSNs and P- 2 dimers. The presence of the galloyl and hydroxy moieties increased apparent affinity of flavan- 3 -ols to proteins, thereby stabilizing monomeric flavan- 3 -ols to processing conditions with increasing protein concentrations. In contrast, the absence of these moieties led to no observable interactions to proteins. A thorough understanding of protein-polyphenol interactions may provide further insight to their chemistry in protein rich beverages and biological fluid...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Food ScienceWeiqun WangWe {{previously}} {{selected a}} purple-fleshed sweetpotato p 40 clone {{that has been}} shown to protect against colorectal cancer in a murine model. This study is to identify anthocyanins by using HPLC/MS-MS and assess the stability during various coking conditions. P 40 possesses a high content of anthocyanins up to 13 mg/g dry matter. Total 12 acylated anthocyanins with caffeic, ferulic, and p-hydrobenzoic acid have been identified on either cyanidin or <b>peonidin</b> bases. The top three major anthocyanins are cyanidin 3 -caffeoyl-p-hydroxybenzoyl sophoroside- 5 -glucoside, <b>peonidin</b> 3 -caffeoyl sophoroside- 5 -glucoside, and cyanidin 3 -(6 '' -caffeoyl- 6 ''-feruloylsophoroside) - 5 -glucoside, which account for an half of the total anthocyanin contents. Seven non-, mono-, or di-acylated cyanidin species and five mono- or di-acylated <b>peonidin</b> species contribute for 69 % and 31 % of total anthocyanins, respectively. Over 80 % of total anthocyanins measured by acid hydrolysis were cyanidin derivatives. Therefore, as a cyanidin-predominated variety, p 40 is unique when compared with other reported purple-fleshed sweetpotatoes that usually contain more <b>peonidin</b> than cyanidin.

Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 � 90 �g (mean � SD, n � 4) (0. 077 % of intake/ 4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identified as the original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the first 6 h was 23. 2 � 10. 9 �g (mean � SD, n � 5) (0. 004 % of intake/ 6 h, wt/wt).
