On September 9 of that year, he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister <b>Plenipotentiary</b> to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—a position he held until 1936. From 1936 to 1941, MacMurray served as Ambassador Extraordinary and <b>Plenipotentiary</b> in Turkey.

5|$|He {{resigned}} {{his post}} in 1932 after being requested {{to step back}} by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs, who wished to free some senior diplomatic posts for younger diplomats waiting to be appointed envoy.

5|$|In 1943, Goebbels {{began to}} {{pressure}} Hitler {{to introduce measures}} that would produce total war, including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Hitler finally appointed him as Reich <b>Plenipotentiary</b> for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures {{to increase the number}} of people available for armaments production and the Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|As Germany {{was cut in}} two, Kesselring's command was {{enlarged}} {{to include}} Army Groups Centre, South and South-East on the Eastern Front, and Army Group C in Italy, {{as well as his}} own Army Group G and Army Group Upper Rhine. On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in Berlin. On 1 May, Karl Dönitz was designated German President (Reichspräsident) and the Flensburg government was created. One of the new president's first acts was the appointment of Kesselring as Commander-in-Chief of Southern Germany, with <b>plenipotentiary</b> powers.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Hitler had {{appointed}} Himmler as Minister of the Interior and <b>Plenipotentiary</b> General for Administration (Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung). In August 1944 Hitler authorised him {{to restructure}} the organisation and administration of the Waffen-SS, the army, and the police services. As head of the Reserve Army, Himmler was now responsible for prisoners of war. He was also {{in charge of the}} Wehrmacht penal system, and controlled the development of Wehrmacht armaments until January 1945.|$|E

5|$|During the Second French Empire (1852–70) further {{changes were}} made, {{mainly to the}} interior. Hippolyte de La Rochefoucauld (1804–63), who had been {{minister}} <b>plenipotentiary</b> in Germany and Florence, brought a fine collection of furniture and 18th century Venetian glass chandeliers when he retired. He restored the great stone staircase. Influenced by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc he decided to transform the large East tower into a library. He blocked up the old openings and pierced large new windows in the old walls.|$|E
5|$|Food was {{in short}} supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, with rations {{inadequate}} to meet nutritional needs. The retreating armies had burned the crops {{and much of the}} remainder was sent back to the Reich. In Germany itself, food rations had to be cut in 1942. In his role as <b>Plenipotentiary</b> of the Four Year Plan, Hermann Göring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest was a good one and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, now already {{sixty years}} old, {{he got the}} chance to put his preachings on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch {{government}} appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister <b>Plenipotentiary</b> to Romania, a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips.|$|E

5|$|In April 1864, Brazil sent Minister <b>Plenipotentiary</b> José Antônio Saraiva to {{negotiate}} with Atanasio Aguirre, who had succeeded Berro in Uruguay. Saraiva made an initial attempt {{to settle the dispute}} between Blancos and Colorados. Faced with Aguirre's intransigence regarding Flores' demands, the Brazilian diplomat abandoned the effort and sided with the Colorados. On 10 August 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, Saraiva declared that Brazil's military would begin exacting reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and for most of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only {{served as a}} pretext to worsen relations. On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish <b>plenipotentiary</b> immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German minority would vote on secession. The Poles refused {{to comply with the}} German demands and on the night of 30–31 August in a violent meeting with the British ambassador Neville Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.|$|E

After the establishment of the NDH, Lorković became a member of the temporary government of Slavko Kvaternik known as the Croatian State Leadership. On 16 April 1941, Lorković was named Secretary of the Foreign Ministry in the first government formed by Ante Pavelić, who also served as Foreign Minister. Up to April 1943, he also served as the chief contact between Edmund Glaise von Horstenau, the <b>Plenipotentiary</b> General in the Independent State of Croatia, and the Pavelić cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Paranhos {{began to}} write {{articles}} in support of Brazil's proactive foreign policy, which brought him close to the ruling Conservative party. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paulino Soares de Sousa (later the Viscount of Uruguai), appointed the Conservative Party's main leader, Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later the Marquis of Paraná), as a special <b>plenipotentiary</b> diplomat for the Platine region. Unexpectedly, Carneiro Leão decided to take Paranhos as his secretary, passing over the more experienced members of Brazil's diplomatic corps. On 23 October 1851, both departed for Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{set about}} creating a regional alliance against Rosas, sending a delegation to the region led by Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later the Marquis of Paraná), who held <b>plenipotentiary</b> authority. He was assisted by José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later the Viscount of Rio Branco). Brazil signed a treaty with Bolívia in which Bolivia agreed to strengthen its border defenses to deter any attack by Rosas, though it declined to contribute troops to a war with Argentina.|$|E

50|$|The Treaty {{establishing}} a Constitution for Europe {{was signed in}} Rome on 29 October 2004 by 53 senior political figures from the 25 member states of the European Union. In most cases heads of state designated <b>plenipotentiaries</b> to sign the treaty, but some presidents also signed on behalf of states which were republics. Most designated <b>plenipotentiaries</b> were prime ministers and foreign ministers.|$|R
5|$|To Flores, Brazil's {{military}} operations against the Blanco government represented a priceless opportunity, {{since he had}} been unable to achieve any lasting results during the rebellion. He entered talks with Saraiva, winning the Brazilian government over, after promising to settle their claims refused by the Blanco government. The Brazilian <b>plenipotentiary</b> minister gave instructions to Tamandaré to form a joint offensive with the Colorado leader and overthrow the Blancos. On 20 October, after a swift exchange of letters, Flores and the Brazilian vice-admiral formed a secret alliance.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918 and the proclamation of the First Austrian Republic, diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were established on 25 February 1924. The first Soviet <b>Plenipotentiary</b> in Vienna was Yan Antonovich Berzin. Diplomatic relations were broken in March 1938 after the German invasion of Austria and its incorporation into Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, the USSR and Austria re-established diplomatic relations at the level of political representation, which in 1953 was converted into embassies. The preamble of the Austrian State Treaty, signed on 15 May 1955 by the USSR, United States, United Kingdom, France and Austria, established that the treaty formed the basis of Soviet relations with Austria. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations continued between the Russian Federation and the Austrian state.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Harrison {{moved to}} Ohio, {{where he was}} elected to the United States House of Representatives. In 1824, the state {{legislature}} elected him to the United States Senate. He served a truncated term after being appointed as Minister <b>Plenipotentiary</b> to Gran Colombia in May 1828. In Santa Fe de Bogotá, he spoke with president Simón Bolívar, urging Bolívar to guide his nation toward American-style democracy. Harrison returned to private life on his farm in Ohio until he was nominated for the presidency as one of several Whig Party candidates in the election of 1836. He received more votes than any other Whig, but was defeated by Democrat Martin Van Buren, and returned again to his farm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ambiguous}} {{status of}} the <b>plenipotentiaries</b> was to have unforeseeable consequences within the Nationalist movement when it divided over the treaty's contents in 1921–22. <b>Plenipotentiaries</b> usually have full powers to handle negotiations as they see fit, but de Valera had given them instructions to refer back to his cabinet on any [...] "main question" [...] and with [...] "the complete text of the draft treaty about to be signed", which created difficulties. Subsequently, the anti-treaty side felt that the <b>plenipotentiaries</b> from the existing sovereign republic had somehow been persuaded to agree to accept much less. The pro-treaty side was to argue that after 11 October the negotiations had been conducted on the understanding that, even though the British were not negotiating with a sovereign state, the agreement was a significant first step towards Irish sovereignty.
