The Iron Mountain Mine is known for having the most acidic naturally found water content on Earth, with samples having up to a −3.6 <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> when tested in the early 1990s, which is roughly 100 times the acidity of battery acid. However, this <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> is only found inside and near the mine, as the average pH of water entering the Spring Creek Reservoir is 4.12.|$|E

According to laboratory researchers, changes in humidity, temperature or <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> {{as well as}} starvation periods {{were thought to be}} the triggers in some species. The plasmodia abandon their nutrient intake and crawl, attracted by lighta positive phototaxistowards a dry, light area, to get an optimal spread of the spores. Once the fructification begins, it can not be stopped. If disturbances occur, malformed spore-bearing fruit bodies are often produced.|$|E

Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E

However, the <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> of the electrolyte is ideally about 7 (neutral); and measurements carried out as early as the 1970s have shown that leakage current is increased, due to chemically induced defects, when the <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> deviates from this ideal value. It is known that water is extremely corrosive to pure aluminum and introduces chemical defects. It is further known that unprotected {{aluminum oxide}} dielectrics can be slightly dissolved by alkaline electrolytes, weakening the oxide layer.|$|E

At 25°C, water has a pH of 7 (this varies when the temperature changes: see self-ionization of water).

40|$|Various factors {{affecting}} the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104 were studied. When the pH of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5. 5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously {{adhered to the}} culture vessels. When the organism was cultured in the same medium {{in the absence of}} glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> remained above 6. 5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. Adjusting the final pH of these cultures to below 5. 5 with HCl caused the cells to aggregate. Cells from unsupplemented cultures with final <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> of 6. 7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> ranging from 4. 5 to 8. 0.

25|$|H-Piles are {{structural}} beams {{that are}} driven {{in the ground}} for deep foundation application. They can be easily cut off or joined by welding or mechanical drive-fit splicers. If the pile is driven into a soil with low <b>pH</b> <b>value,</b> {{then there is a}} risk of corrosion, coal-tar epoxy or cathodic protection can be applied to slow or eliminate the corrosion process. It is common to allow for an amount of corrosion in design by simply over dimensioning the cross-sectional area of the steel pile. In this way the corrosion process can be prolonged up to 50 years.|$|E
25|$|Ionic bipolar {{transistors}} {{can be made}} from two conical channels with the smallest opening in nano-scaled dimension. By introducing opposite surface charges at each side, it is able to rectify ionic current as an ionic diode. An ionic bipolar transistor is built by combining two ionic diodes and forming a PNP junction along the inner surface of the channel. While the ionic current is from emitter end to collector end, the strength of the current can be modulated by the base electrode. The surface charge at the channel wall can be modified using chemical methods, by changing the electrolyte concentration or <b>pH</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

The electrolyte of the faulty Taiwanese capacitors was alkaline, with a pH of between 7 and 8. Good comparable Japanese capacitors had an electrolyte that was acidic, with a pH of around 4. As it is known that aluminum can be dissolved by alkaline liquids, but not that which is mildly acidic, an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS) fingerprint analysis of the electrolyte of the faulty capacitors was made, which detected dissolved aluminum in the electrolyte.|$|E

50|$|Water ionizes into {{hydronium}} (H3O+) cations and hydroxide (OH−) anions. The {{concentration of}} ionized hydrogen (as protonated water) is expressed as <b>pH.</b> Low <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> increase {{rate of corrosion}} while high <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> encourage scale formation. Amphoterism is uncommon among metals used in water cooling systems, but aluminum corrosion rates increase with <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> above 9. Galvanic corrosion may be severe in water systems with copper and aluminum components. Acid may be added to cooling water systems to prevent scale formation if the pH decrease will offset increased salinity and dissolved solids.|$|R
25|$|Acidosis is a {{condition}} in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient’s blood expresses a low <b>pH</b> <b>value.</b> Alkalosis is {{a condition}} in which there are too few hydrogen ions, and the patient’s blood has an elevated pH. Normal blood pH falls in the range of 7.35–7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number represents alkalosis. Enzymes, being the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions - are sensitive to pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, subsequently decreasing the rate of many enzymatic reactions, which can have complex effects on HR. Severe changes in pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.|$|E
25|$|The pH {{level of}} a wine is the {{measurement}} {{of the amount of}} free (H+) hydrogen ions. It is related to the titratable acidity {{level of a}} wine but differs in significant ways. Low pH numbers indicate a high concentration of acids in a solution. While pure water is neutral with a pH of 7, wine tends to be more acidic with a pH between 3 and 4. As the acid levels in ripening grapes fall, the concentration of acids are lessening which means the pH level is rising. Yeasts, bacteria, phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins which influence color all have varying tolerance to wines with high pH levels. In general, wines with high <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> tend to have duller colors and less developed flavors and be more prone to wine faults caused by spoilage organisms which makes monitoring the pH levels of grapes during ripening a priority for viticulturists and winemakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} {{chemical}} analysis were confirmed by measuring electrical capacitance and leakage current {{in a long-term}} test lasting 56days. Due to the chemical corrosion, the oxide layer of these capacitors had been weakened, so after a short time the capacitance and the leakage current increased briefly, before dropping abruptly when gas pressure opened the vent. The report of Hillman and Helmold proved {{that the cause of}} the failed capacitors was a faulty electrolyte mixture used by the Taiwanese manufacturers, which lacked the necessary chemical ingredients to ensure the correct pH of the electrolyte over time, for long-term stability of the electrolytic capacitors. Their further conclusion, that the electrolyte with its alkaline <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> had the fatal flaw of a continual buildup of hydroxide without its being converted into the stable oxide, was verified {{on the surface of the}} anode foil both photographically and with an EDX-fingerprint analysis of the chemical components.|$|E
