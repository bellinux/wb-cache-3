25|$|Worcestershire were so weak {{the club}} could not {{compete in the}} Championship in 1919, and their form in 1920 – when they lost three {{successive}} games by an innings and over 200 runs – was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of any county side. Their form, with one remarkable exception, was woeful up to the early thirties. Fred Root, {{one of the first}} exponents of leg theory bowling, took over 1,500 wickets for the county and was a Test standard player in an otherwise fourth-rate team. In Cyril Walters and the Nawab of Pataudi the team acquired its first class batsmen since the Fosters, but both had to give up the game after playing brilliantly in 1933 – when the bowling was briefly very weak.|$|E
25|$|The 1980–81 {{season was}} <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> in the club's history. Rovers won just five league games during the season, and only four home wins in all competitions. The team was relegated {{at the end}} of the season, {{finishing}} in last place, seven points below the other relegated team, Bristol City. The club had also failed to agree an extension to the lease on their stadium, which had had its capacity reduced from 30,000 to 12,500 due to new safety laws, causing fears that they would have to find a new home. On 17 August 1980, a fire started in the South Grandstand in Eastville Stadium, destroying the administrative offices and changing rooms. As a result, Rovers were forced to play five games at Ashton Gate, three in the league and two in the League Cup. This location was not popular with the fans however, who considered this to be enemy territory, and all five games were poorly attended.|$|E

In {{his review of}} the album, Allmusic's Steve Huey wrote [...] "There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well with late-'90s metal and punk fans." [...] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "We had these romantic visions of the music industry, and {{we thought it would be}} cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> thing that could have happened.

His father fought the disease for five years before dying while Wilson was attending Londonderry High School; Wilson today says he had to become a man when {{his father was}} diagnosed. In a 2011 story, ESPN.com writer Elizabeth Merrill said about Wilson's high school years, [...] "He was an honor roll student at Londonderry, but clashed with various authority figures who didn't appreciate his occasional lack of a filter." [...] In the same story, a number of Londonderry faculty speculated that some teachers didn't understand Wilson's life situation at the time. Art Psaledas, an assistant principal at the school, added, [...] "It happened at <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> time anybody could lose your dad.

500|$|The [...] "first-past-the-post" [...] voting system, {{also known}} as the simple {{plurality}} voting system, is used in Singapore for electing the President as well as Members of the Parliament. This system has been criticized as undemocratic because the eventual winner may have won only a minority of the total votes cast, despite having secured the most number of votes in absolute terms among all the candidates. Thus, there might be cases where an elected politician can be said to have won the mandate of only a minority of voters, and that his or her election is therefore not an accurate reflection of the voters' will. As constitutional lawyer Sir William Wade has said: [...] "If it is accepted that a democratic Parliament ought to represent so far as possible the preferences of the voters, this system is <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> that could be devised." ...|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why.

As a rookie in 1949, Box appeared in ten games, principally as a halfback. He rushed for 62 yards on 30 carries and caught 15 passes for 276 yards and four touchdowns. Box later recalled: [...] "I <b>probably</b> was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> halfback in <b>the</b> history of the league." ...|$|R

[...] His review concluded [...] "I'll grudgingly admit, while it is an absolutely dreadful film by nearly every objective measure, Nukie <b>probably</b> isn't <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> E.T. knockoff ever made.

500|$|He scored {{twice in}} his first game back against the York Yeomen and found the endzone again against Western in the conference semi-finals. McMaster won the Yates Cup after {{defeating}} the Ottawa Gee-Gees 30–22, but ended their season with a loss in the Churchill Bowl {{for the second year in}} a row. Aidoo described the 26–7 loss against the Manitoba Bisons as [...] "a horrible game, <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> I've ever played". Aidoo was limited to only 69 carries for 390 yards in the 2001 season, but rushed for eight touchdowns. He was limited by his leg injury throughout the season, missing games and also receiving a reduced number of carries to prevent additional injury. Despite this, Aidoo was selected as one of two Canadians to play in the East–West Shrine Game, an American football post-season game that includes the best players from around the nation. The East–West Shrine Game is widely attended by scouts from the National Football League. Aidoo participated as a fullback for the East team and caught two receptions for four yards.|$|E

The other problem with the term is that it assumes your opponents are disingenuous.

[...] In 1969 three days of rioting swept the Near North Side, and in 1970 a policeman was killed by a suitcase bomb while answering a disturbance call at a house in North Omaha. However, as the 1966 Oscar-nominated documentary A Time for Burning and the 1970s books of Lois Mark Stalvey illustrated, the violence apparently served a purpose as lines of communication were opened between the [...] "West Omaha matron and the black laborer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opeth {{was formed}} in 1990 in Stockholm, Sweden, by David Isberg. Isberg invited Mikael Åkerfeldt (of the {{recently}} disbanded band Eruption) to join Opeth.

They rehearsed in an elementary school using old 60's equipment that they found there. Opeth played a show in February 1991, along with Therion, Excruciate and Authorise, in Stockholm. Only two songs were performed for their set. Åkerfeldt commented about the show: [...] "I reckon it was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> appearance one can have witnessed.

He had long experience in reading men under stress of such emotion. He had no means to vindicate his judgment, but his conviction was that Longstreth {{right then and there}} decided that the thing to do was to kill Lawson. For Duane's part he wondered that Longstreth had not come to such a conclusion before. Not improbably the advent of his daughter had put Longstreth in conflict with himself.|$|R

The then Tottenham Hotspur boss, Harry Redknapp labelled it a [...] "disgrace" [...] after his side's semi-final defeat to Portsmouth. After the 2010 FA Cup Final, Chelsea captain John Terry said, [...] "The pitch ruined the final. It's <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> pitch we've played on all year.

The results show that national strategies for preventing and controlling sexually transmitted infections comprise a limited repertoire of activities that fit with those suggested by the phase specific model.
