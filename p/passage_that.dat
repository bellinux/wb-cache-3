5|$|Each sermon {{begins with}} a scriptural <b>passage</b> <b>that</b> {{reinforces}} the ideas that {{will be discussed in}} the sermon and each was preceded with the same opening prayer (which Swift also delivered). The sermons are plainly written and apply a common-sense approach to contemporary moral issues in Dublin. Swift patterned his sermons on the plain style of the Book of Common Prayer and the Church of Ireland Authorized Version of the Bible.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} have gleaned from this <b>passage</b> <b>that</b> the Wicked Priest and the Teacher of Righteousness followed different liturgical calendars, thus enabling the Wicked Priest {{to travel on}} Yom Kippur; some have even suggested that the Teacher of Righteousness was a schismatic High Priest during the pre-Jonathan intersacerdotium.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile Enver, still {{fearing that}} the Russians {{would accept the}} Ottoman apology, decided to interfere. Just before the message was sent, he {{inserted}} a <b>passage</b> <b>that</b> accused the Russians of instigating the conflict. On 1 November the message arrived in Petrograd. Foreign Minister Sazonov responded with an ultimatum, demanding that the Ottomans expel the German military mission. The Ottomans rejected this proposal.|$|E

5|$|An {{unabridged}} {{edition of}} Anne Frank's work {{was published in}} 1995. This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a <b>passage</b> <b>that</b> had previously been edited out by Otto Frank. When Gail Horalek of Northville, Michigan, learned in March 2013 that her daughter's seventh-grade class was using this edition of the diary in class, she {{filed a complaint with}} the school district asking that an edited version be used instead. Horalek, who described the passage as pornographic, said the school should have obtained prior approval from parents before assigning the book. In 2010, school officials in Culpeper County, Virginia, stopped assigning the unabridged version after similar complaints were lodged.|$|E
5|$|Major General Miles {{traveled}} {{aboard the}} USS Yale. While approaching the Mona <b>Passage</b> <b>that</b> separates Puerto Rico {{from the island}} of Hispaniola to the east, Miles opted to land his troops in the southern region of the island, choosing Guánica as his landing zone. Miles dispatched patrol boats to notify all other convoys of his decision and to order them to proceed to Guanica. Miles' decision to change the invasion site was based on his belief that the town of Fajardo would be fortified and he feared that Spanish coastal gun boats would disrupt a landing at Fajardo.|$|E
5|$|The Hospitium {{is located}} between {{the ruins of}} St. Mary's Abbey Church and the River Ouse and {{is thought to have}} {{originally}} been a guest house for visitors to the abbey of low social rank, or possibly a barn. It was originally {{part of a group of}} buildings in the abbey grounds that included a brew-house, stables, mill and, near the main gate, a boarding school with 50 pupils. The oldest parts of the ground floor were built around 1300, but the upper storey has been extensively restored in modern times. The ruined gateway at the side dates back to the 15th century, and was probably the entrance to a <b>passage</b> <b>that</b> ran towards the water-gate by the river.|$|E

5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{there was}} strong {{interest}} in discovering a Northwest <b>Passage</b> <b>that</b> would permit navigation between the Atlantic (or inland North America) and the Pacific Ocean. Many ships in the area, especially those under Spanish and British command, searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to Hudson Bay or the Missouri River. The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of Bruno de Heceta, who in 1775 sighted the river's mouth. On {{the advice of his}} officers, he did not explore it, as he was short-staffed and the current was strong. He considered it a bay, and called it Ensenada de Asunción. Later Spanish maps based on his discovery showed a river, labeled Rio de San Roque, or an entrance, called Entrada de Hezeta. Following Heceta's reports, British maritime fur trader Captain John Meares searched for the river in 1788 but concluded that it did not exist. He named Cape Disappointment for the non-existent river, not realizing the cape marks the northern edge of the river's mouth.|$|E

60|$|The {{final version}} of this brief but {{laborious}} score has been preserved, and all the stages in its progress have been abundantly annotated. To follow it through in detail, however, would be but weariness. All the salient points in its production fall under one of three heads. There are, first, the <b>passages</b> <b>that</b> {{seem to have been}} produced in co-operation with the sitters. There are, second, the <b>passages</b> <b>that</b> seem to have been produced in independence of the sitters. And there are, third, the <b>passages</b> <b>that</b> seem to have been produced in direct opposition to the sitters. Examples of all three classes follow; perhaps only those of the third and last class are really important.|$|R
