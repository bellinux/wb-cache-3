50|$|The {{research}} {{field of}} organic solar cells (OSC) is divided in two parts.

40|$|The {{millimeter}} and the submillimeter {{wavelengths of}} the electromagnetic spectrum hold a wealth of information about the evolution of the universe. In particular, cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and its polarization carry the oldest information in the universe, and provide the best test of the inflationary paradigm available to astronomy today. Detecting gravity waves through their imprint on the CMB polarization would have extraordinary repercussions for cosmology and physics. A transition-edge hot-electron micro - bolometer (THM) consists of a superconducting bilayer transition-edge sensor (TES) with a thin-film absorber. Unlike traditional monolithic bolometers that make use of micromachined structures, the THM em ploys the decoupling between electrons and phonons at millikelvin temperatures to provide thermal isolation. The devices are fabricated photolithographically and are easily integrated with antennas via microstrip transmission lines, and with SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) readouts. The small volume of the absorber and TES produces a short thermal time constant that facilitates rapid sky scanning. The THM consists of a thin-film metal absorber overlapping a superconducting TES. The <b>absorber</b> <b>forms</b> the termination of a superconducting microstripline that carries RF power from an antenna. The purpose of <b>forming</b> a separate <b>absorber</b> and TES is to allow flexibility in the optimization of the two components. In particular, the absorbing film's impedance can be chosen to match the antenna, while the TES impedance can be chosen to match to the readout SQUID amplifier. This scheme combines the advantages of the TES with the advantages of planar millimeter-wave transmission line circuits. Antenna-coupling to the detectors via planar transmission lines allows the detector dimensions to be much smaller than a wavelength, so the technique can be extended across the entire microwave, millimeter, and submillimeter wavelength ranges. The circuits are fabricated using standard microlithographic techniques and are compatible with uniform, large array formats. Unlike traditional monolithic bolometers that make use of micromachined structures, the THM employs the decoupling between electrons and phonons at millikelvin temperatures to provide thermal isolation. There is no fragile membrane in the structure for thermal isolation, which improves the fabrication yield...|$|R
40|$|To make {{thin film}} {{photovoltaics}} (TFPV) more competitive with classic Si-based devices, research {{is focusing on}} the production of absorber layers. Printable inks containing nanocrystal (NC) precursors are explored, since a variety of NCs can be synthesized in apolar media. When printing photovoltaic absorber layers of NCs such as CIGS, {{the formation of a}} dense thin film is required, which is however hampered by the presence of the organic ligands. Our research focusses on CuInS 2 NCs, for which the original steric stabilizers are exchanged for inorganic moieties containing sulfide or selenide species. This leads to an ink stabilized by charge that, apart from the solvent, doesn’t introduce unwanted components in the film. In CIGS processing, crystal growth is typically promoted by a gas-phase selenization step after film deposition. However, this introduces an additional process step that involves working with toxic gasses in a closed atmosphere. We show that introducing Se-containing moieties to stabilize CuInS 2 dispersions enables us to enhance NC sintering and transformation, without the need for a selenization step. Two inks were prepared: both containing (N 2 H 5) 2 Se capped CIS NCs and one of them containing Se NPs as well. Upon thermal annealing under He atmosphere phase transformation from CIS to CISe was observed with in situ XRD, resulting in a close-to pure CISe phase in both cases.

40|$|Shock waves {{have been}} {{proposed}} in the literature as a mechanism for retinal damage induced by ultra-short laser pulses. For a spherical absorber, we derive a set of linear equations describing the propagation of pressure waves.

The analytical technique used avoids the need for a Laplace transform approach and is easily applied to other absorber profiles. Our analysis suggests that the 'soft' nature of the membrane surrounding retinal melanosomes precludes shock waves as a mechanism for the retinal damage induced by ultra-short pulse lasers. The quantitative estimates of the pressure gradients induced by laser absorption which are made possible by this work, together with detailed meso-scale or molecular modelling, will allow alternative damage mechanisms to be identified.
