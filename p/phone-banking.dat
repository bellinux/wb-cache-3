40|$|At the {{beginning}} of my internship my sole responsibility was to call as many people as I could and talk to them about Propositions 98 and 99. During my entire workday I called from a list out of the office and then transitioned to a <b>phone-bank</b> center after working hours with other staff members. Later, I was paired up with staff members to help with outreach. During the afternoons we went to buildings on the SCEP (Systematic Code Enforcement Program) list given to us by the Los Angeles City Housing Department to inform tenants that they would be having a housing inspection soon. One of my favorite duties was creating new flyers for my organization in both English and Spanish. The challenge was translating the text from English to Spanish using my limited knowledge and other outside sources such as an online translator. Some of my other responsibilities at CES included: speaking with tenants over the phone when they called with any questions, informing landlords that they were on the REAP program (Rent Escrow Account Program) and explain to them what the program is about, as well as other miscellaneous tasks. It was exciting to juggle many jobs at once although there never seemed to be enough to do...|$|R

5000|$|Ekdahl {{described}} {{the effect of}} ORCA as being that “30,000+ {{of the most active}} and fired-up volunteers were wandering around confused and frustrated when they could have been doing anything else to help, like driving people to the polls, <b>phone-banking,</b> walking door-to-door, etc." [...] Campaign workers were left [...] "flying blind", as several put it, unable to identify non-voters or precincts which needed a last-minute robocalling campaign to drive up turnout. The targeted information promised by the campaign did not materialize and only the generic raw vote tallies were available in key areas. According to the Washington Examiner, by late afternoon on election day ORCA was still predicting a Romney victory with somewhere between 290-300 electoral college votes - nearly 100 more than Romney actually received. A Romney campaign official told ABC News, which predicted {{on the eve of the}} election that Obama would win by a 50%-47% margin, [...] "Your numbers don’t matter to us." [...] Without accurate information from ORCA, Republican officials instead turned to using public news sources or calling counties for information on the outcome of votes in those areas.|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} in voter mobilization {{have indicated that}} personal contact is most effective, but that multiple contacts have no apparent additional impact on voter turnout. Yet, a number of theories from social psychology— cognitive dissonance theory, the theory of reasoned action, and {{the theory of the}} self-erasing nature of errors of prediction—would lead us to expect that a targeted follow-up contact, one that cues social norms, should have a greater impact on turnout. We test these theories using four <b>phone-banking</b> field experiments that utilized follow-up calls to committed voters. Contrary to previous studies, we find that this kind of targeted follow up greatly increases the effectiveness of phone-bank campaigns, in some cases almost tripling their effect on voter turnout. P olitical scientists long have argued that mobili-zation is a key variable in voter turnout (Leighley 2001; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993). Recent studies using field experiments have shown the power of personal tactics in mobilizing individuals to vote. In a variety of political and social environments, and targeting a variety of populations, the face-to-face interactions of door-to-door canvassing have provided the strongest boosts to turnout, usually by 7 – 12 per...|$|E
40|$|Wide {{interest}} margins as {{witnessed in}} Kenya {{are a sign}} of a repressed and inefficient financial sector. This paper carries out a cross-country analysis of the determinants of financial market efficiency using panel cointegration with a view to recommending policy options for improving the efficiency of the financial sector intermediation process in Kenya. The study finds that the major contributors to the differences in financial sector inefficiency in Kenya compared to the other countries in the study are high bank operating costs, default risk and financial market structure. The study recommends, among other measures, that the government through the Central Bank need to collaborate with the commercial banks and establish a working credit reference bureau to enable easy identification of credit worthy customers in order to reduce default risk; there is also need by the central bank to license more new banks to increase competition and reduce bank concentration. The study also recommends increased use of technology including <b>phone-banking</b> and e-banking to reduce operation costs of the banks. The paper concludes that contrary to the findings from other cross-country analysis, the factors that lead to financial market in/efficiency varies from one country to the other.

40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} environment, {{researchers and}} service marketers put great effort on developing customers ’ service loyalty {{in order to}} maintain competitive edge. However, there is no consensus on the antecedents in the creation of service loyalty and the domain of service loyalty is not yet clearly defined. This study primarily aims at developing a measurement model of service loyalty that incorporates behavioral, attitudinal, as well as cognitive measures, applying in a process-dominant service (i. e. <b>phone-banking</b> service) and an outcome-dominant service (i. e. Western restaurant dining service). A structural model of service loyalty highlighting the positive and significant relationships among perceived service quality, customer satisfaction and service loyalty is illustrated, in which customer satisfaction is identified as a significant mediator to enhance the impact of perceived service quality on service loyalty. Furthermore, the findings indicate that loyal customers of process-dominant service are comparatively more willing to connect their loyalty status with favorable attitude or preference, whereas loyal customers of outcome-dominant service are comparatively more willing to express as cognitive loyalty. These findings provide insights for future research and management practice on how to cultivate service loyalty, as well as how to maintain and improve service loyalty by improving perceived service quality and customer satisfactio...|$|E
