40|$|Despite being brutally slated at times, Andrzej Kondratiuk’s {{films were}} also often admired and praised by Polish film critics. Their {{inability}} to uniformly categorise and value Kondratiuk’s highly unconventional work {{has led to}} him being set aside, and labelled as, a ‘separate’ filmmaker in Polish film history. This study brings the complex dynamic to light that existed between Andrzej Kondratiuk and the Polish post-war film culture in which his work was constantly corrected, smoothed and polished. The problematic reception that has coloured Kondratiuk’s career is analysed within a framework of the grotesque. Iwona Guść argues that the grotesque devices used by Kondratiuk to undermine established norms were crucial for the developement of the reception process. Her approach, however, does not centre on the formal aspects of Kondratiuk’s films, but rather on the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> they evoked. Guść therefore considers the grotesque as a specific perceptual and cognitive experience elicited by the work itself; an experience in which the violation of expectations and disorientation play a crucial role. This research explores reception documents from the period 1959 to 2009 and thus covers nearly all of Kondratiuk’s professional career. Guść demonstrates that Kondratiuk stubbornly resisted every interpretive strategy the contemporary viewers had in store for him. While critics and censors were continuously trying to turn him into a polished filmmaker, Kondratiuk kept on refuting their efforts by ridiculing nearly all of their judgments and interpretations. He thus made the canonisation of his own work – during the communist as well as during the post-communist period – virtually impossible...|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustics}} of a {{place of}} worship, where the volumetric arrangement of the spaces and the materials are invested with a symbolic importance in the private and communal conversation with the transcendent, often has features that do not fully meet the usual standards precisely because of this pre-eminence of aesthetic criteria over acoustic ones. In {{the case of the}} Great Synagogue of Rome, a place that is important also from an architectural viewpoint, the predominance of aesthetic canon over those strictly acoustic ones is clearly evident, and it is this that causes certain <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> in some areas of the Temple The analysis of the acoustics of the Temple Maggiore, also because of the limited time granted for the survey, was carried out using the combined technique approach, namely the integration of phonometric analyses with data from a simulation programme. To this end, the Ramsete simulation programme was used employing the model of the Synagogue in Ramsete CAD. The phonometric analyses were also used for calibrating the simulation model. From an examination of the data regarding the various acoustic parameters taken into consideration, above all a good uniformity in the distribution of the sound levels emerges, with mean values sufficient for being able to hear the spoken message well. The acoustic analysis carried out inside the main Synagogue of Rome, notwithstanding the small number of acoustic parameters taken into consideration because of the limited time granted for carrying out the work, evidenced a good integration of the architectonic spaces and the usual acoustical requirements for these places of worship, which have been conceived with specific religious ceremonies in mind. In these sectors, in addition to problems of comprehensibility, there are also various acoustic shadow zones. These situations would require the installation of a dedicated and appropriately sized sound system...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} Victorian fiction accommodated and abetted generosity 2 ̆ 7 s {{shift from a}} public to a private virtue {{in the late eighteenth}} and early nineteenth centuries. Chapter One contextualizes the mid-nineteenth-century ideology of giving within gender and class relationships shaped by debates leading to the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. Joseph Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Dissertation on the Poor Laws (1786) and the report of two assistant poor law commissioners (1833) frame the public debate concerning government giving and signal a cultural movement that was transforming generosity into a modern, apolitical, private, feminine ideal. I draw on Jacques Derrida and anthropology to define the ideology of the free gift, whose main tenet is an insistence that true gifts exist only outside economies of time and reciprocity. Literary texts, inevitably bound to time and reciprocity, disclose tenuous but persistent maintenance of this ideology. Charles Dickens 2 ̆ 7 s A Christmas Carol (1843) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost 2 ̆ 7 s Bargain (1848) condemned laissez-faire economic doctrines while validating the social divisions that characterized the New Poor Law era. ^ Chapter Two focuses on Dickens 2 ̆ 7 s Little Dorrit (1855 – 57), in which Amy, a middle-class heroine in prison rags, a model of feminine self-sacrifice who expects no reward, occupies the problematic space of perfect giver, receiver, and gift. Structured as a romance of giving, the novel reveals both the gendered terms of the free gift and the contradictory nature of a middle-class construction of itself as generous benefactor of the poor. ^ Chapters Three and Four consider novels that do not directly focus on issues of poverty but are nonetheless shaped by this ideological shift. In George Eliot 2 ̆ 7 s Middlemarch (1871 – 72), the narrator mediates through rational dissection and generous hermeneutics a bond between the reader and Dorothea intended to, on the one hand, elide the degree to which private acts of kindness have political import, and, on the other, suggest that such acts can lead to a radical way of knowing. In contrast to Dickens and Eliot, Emily Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s Wuthering Heights (1847) explicitly fixates on the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> and reveals the violence not only of uncivilized passion but of civilized giving itself. ...|$|E

40|$|A Análise Crítica do Discurso (ACD) tem sido considerada uma teoria potencial para o entendimento das relações de poder e das ideologias frequentemente presentes no discurso. Vários teóricos concordam que a ACD tem contribuído para a compreensão de inúmeros fenômenos linguísticos que, mormente, retratam hegemonias opacas, uma vez que a linguagem é um instrumento poderoso para a disseminação de conceitos preconcebidos, bem como de ideologias. No entanto, por que a ACD recebeu, nos anos noventa, críticas severas de um conjunto significativo de teóricos? Essas críticas apresentaram uma lista ampla de problemas relacionados aos métodos e abordagens utilizados por analistas críticos do discurso. Dentre essas críticas, os problemas de recepção e representatividade são tidos como os mais frequentes no tratamento dos dados feito pelos pesquisadores. Apesar de tudo isso, a determinação dos analistas críticos do discurso em apresentar uma base metodológica à disciplina teve seus resultados positivos - a ACD é hoje um ramo reconhecido da Linguística Aplicada no exterior, dentro da {{interface}} entre as Ciências Sociais e as Humanidades. Publicações recentes, principalmente as de Fairclough e seus colegas, levaram em consideração algumas dessas críticas, ao responderem pontualmente às mesmas. Contudo, no Brasil tem havido um "silêncio" em relação a essa questão, sobretudo porque os pesquisadores parecem desconsiderar tais críticas. Neste artigo, pretendo "quebrar esse silêncio" e discutir algumas dessas críticas e seus impactos na ACD e sua aplicação em pesquisas brasileiras. O objetivo principal deste artigo é perceber se algumas pesquisas em ACD no Brasil têm apresentado os mesmos problemas postos por esses críticos, através da análise de quatro artigos que usam a ACD como teoria orientadora, publicados em um número especial sobre a ACD de um reconhecido periódico brasileiro intitulado D. E. L. T. A. Os resultados indicaram que alguns dos problemas mostrados por esses críticos também aparecem nos artigos analisados, o que indica que os analistas críticos do discurso brasileiros precisam atentar para a maneira como abordam e tratam seus dados. Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) {{has been}} considered a potential theory for the unveiling of power relations and ideologies commonly found in discourse. Many theoreticians agree {{on the fact that}} CDA has contributed to the understanding of several linguistic phenomena that usually portray obfuscated hegemonies, since language is a powerful tool for disseminating biased assumptions as well as ideologies. Nonetheless, why did CDA attract severe criticisms {{from a wide range of}} scholars in the 1990 s? These critics presented a full list of problems concerning the methods and approaches often utilized by critical discourse analysts. Among the criticisms, <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> and representativeness are claimed to pervade most of the treatment given by CDA researchers to their data. Despite all this, the keenness of critical discourse analysts to display a methodological ground to the discipline has had its positive results - CDA is now a recognized and well-established branch of Applied Linguistics in the international context, within the interface between the Social Sciences and the Humanities. Recent publication, principally from Fairclough and his colleagues, has taken into considerable account some of the criticisms, by responding to these critics accordingly. In Brazil, however, there has been a "deafening silence" about this issue, especially because researchers seem to disregard these criticisms. In this paper, I intend to "break this silence" and bring into discussion some of these criticisms and their impact on CDA and the application of its theory in Brazilian research. The main aim of the paper is to see whether some research on CDA in Brazil has presented the same problems posed by these critics, by analyzing four articles that use CDA as an orienting theory, published in a special issue on CDA from a well-known Brazilian journal entitled D. E. L. T. A. The results have indicated that some of the problems outlined by these critics also appear on the articles analyzed, which shows that critical discourse analysts in Brazil should pay special attention to the way they approach and treat their data...|$|E

40|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> {{or hearing}} <b>of</b> music {{is now a}} matter of the {{greatest}} importance in the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> music education, concerned directly in the existence of music itself. Many researchers of music education have tried to describe diverse arts and styles of music hearing. As Albert Wellek pointed out the different type of inclination of music-hearing between linear or contrapuntal music and polar or cyclic music, different type of music comes into being according to the difference of inclination of music-hearing or sensibility of music. In general, it may be pointed out that two types of music have existed, according to the inclination or sensibility of music hearing. 1. Floating type of music: music of "Period Type"; based on the closed character of "period" (as H. Mersmann's naming, "geschlossene"). Many of music of Japan, Lied and danse music of western-music belong to this type. 2. Fluid or constructive type of music: music of "Motive Type"; based on the open (offene) structure of "motive". By the developed use of thematic motive, European music has reached greatest artistic heights in the 18 - 19 th centuries. In chapter 2, we investigated the development of motive in J. S. Bach's "Inventions" (BWV 772 - 786), and confirmed that all pieces are developed out of one theme, constructed from small motive. Though the techniques of counterpoint used in these pieces are very strict, we can see the contrastive structure in ternary form or distinct section by modulation, foreshadows later classical sonata form. As a concluding remark, we found in the pieces of "inventions" typical model of open motive development, enables us to do the fluid musical experience...|$|R

In his letter Seidler praises the work of the internationally famous architect while noting <b>problems</b> in the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> modern architecture in Australia. The issues raised go beyond the difficult battle to build modern architecture that is a familiar part of the story of Seidler’s career. Seidler’s letter includes questions put to Le Corbusier of cultural identity, expression and propriety in making architecture – a frank admission of particularities in the Australian context.

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> {{the work}} of the prominent Austrian dramatist Franz Grillparzer by Czech audiences. An emphasis is placed upon the plays König Ottokars Glück und Ende, Libussa and Ein Bruderzwist in Habsburg, which are inspired by stories from Czech history and mythology. Up to these days, these plays have never been staged in Czech theatres nor translated into Czech. Czech audiences did not accept them {{because of the way the}} dramatist depicted Czech history and harsh criticism of Czech people which mostly appears in the tragedy König Ottokars Glück und Ende. The first biographical part of the thesis is devoted to the life of the dramatist and the conditions in which his works were written.

40|$|In Proustian aesthetics, the act {{of reading}} {{constitutes}} a fundamental activity in the elaboration of Remembrance of Things Past. The representation of each art form which the novel proposes to synthesize (architecture, painting, and literature) is based on intertextual relationships that unite texts from non literary (Ruskin, Male), literary (Sand, Sevigne, Racine) and philosophical (Schopenhauer) sources, that contribute to a general conception of art that reintegrates the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> art works {{in the context of}} an essentially literary experience. In accordance with Hans-Robert Jauss' theory, the presence of such texts enables the reconstitution of the reader's expectations, and provides the context for the multiple representations of the work of art. Consequently, the implicit and explicit interrelations between the Proustian text and its intertext, perceived as an indication of the readers liberty, introduce different strategies of reading into the novel. Not only does the narrative, through its characters, offers a series of examples that are didactic in nature, but the use of quotations creates dynamics that underscores the specificity of the Proustian act of reading and its interdependence on the act <b>of</b> writing. The <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> the text implied by the Proustian reading of the work of art therefore contributes in making Remembrance of Things Past, not a dogmatic exposition of a theory, but rather a long quest through literary creation for knowledge that transcends Plato's idea of the transmission of meaning through art and of communication through {{the act of}} reading...|$|R

Weak channels can cause high number of retransmissions in order to deliver a packet correctly, which will consume high energy of both the transmitting and the receiving nodes. Error correcting codes (ECCs) {{can be used to}} reduce number of retransmissions, but most ECCs have complex decoding algorithms, which leads to high processing energy consumption at the receiving nodes in the WSN. In this paper, we present a low power consumption decode-and-forward approach for the multi-hop WSNs; a serial concatenation convolutional codes (SCCC) encoder is implemented at the source node while the complex iterative decoding algorithm is shifted to the sink (base station). The intermediate nodes run a Viterbi decoding algorithm to decode only the inner code of the SCCC encoder. We investigate the effect of changing constraint length of both the inner and the outer codes and the effect of changing encoding block size. We show that most packets can be decoded at the base station at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) channels with the penalty of small energy loss in decoding the packet at the nodes in the network.|$|R

40|$|This report {{contains}} six papers {{presented at}} a conf erence on "Literature as cornmunication", arranged by the Department of Cornmunication Studies at the University of Linköping in April 1983. Comrnon to the papers {{is that they}} all deal with <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> literature and present theoretical o r empirical evidence for what goes on when works of literature are understood, interpreted and evaluated. A unifying perspective is that literary texts are given meaning, significance and value through individual reading processes. Two of the papers discuss theoretical issues: one, what constitutes processes of understanding and interpretation and how these processes are related; the other, how a new concept of "literary text" can be established on empirical evidence from response research. The remaining four papers present differentaspects of empirical research: on theatrical performances of works by the Kenyan authorNgugi wa Thiong'o, on criteria of evaluation as used by different groups of readers, on the understanding of metaphors among three groups of young readers, and on the frames of refe rence used by critics in their reviews of literature.

40|$|Three models — the ethnocentric model, the {{adaptation}} {{model and the}} inculturation model — characterize the missionary approaches of the Catholic Church during the whole of its apostolic activity. The article examines the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>reception</b> in the Catholic missions from a historical perspective. The author shows the formation {{and development of the}} diverse forms of cultural accommodation and how the theological, social-political and cultural concepts of various epochs inﬂuenced them. He also examines the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> parallel coexistence of these forms as mental constructions which have overstepped the boundaries of the historical context within which they were formatted. The article speciﬁcally examines the evolution of views on the «Gospel-Culture» dichotomy — from the tabula rasa conception to inculturation, which is one of central points of the contemporary Catholic theological reﬂection. In {{the adaptation}} model, one can see, with certain reservations, the elements of inculturation. However, in the true sense and meaning of the word, inculturation is a reality of {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, whereas its ﬁrst half can be characterized by the transition period from the cultural triumphalism to the new perception of the local, national cultures and to the new interpretation of its drastically diﬀerent ontological status in the process of evangelization. In the article, the author only brushes the too extensive theme of the inculturation, observing it from a Christological perspective and proposing consequently an orientation for further theological reﬂection in this ﬁ eld...|$|R

Phase noise and carrier frequency offset seriously degrade the performances of OFDM systems by destroying orthogonality of the subcarriers. Based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling mechanization, our approach consists in jointly estimating the phase noise, the frequency offset and the transmitted symbols. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the time domain in order to benefit from the redundancy information induced by the cyclic prefix and from the time correlation of the OFDM signal owing to the presence of virtual and/or pilot subcarriers. The algorithm's efficiency is enhanced by incorporating the Rao-Blackwellization technique as well as various sampling improvement strategies. Simulation results, provided in terms of bit error rate (BER) and mean square error (MSE), clearly illustrate the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed estimator...|$|R
