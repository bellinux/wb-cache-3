40|$|<b>Parsalmide</b> [5 -amino-N-butyl- 2 -(2 -propynyloxy) benzamide] is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID), commercialized in Italy until 1985 {{with the}} brand name of Synovial, that has been widely used to treat arthritic patients. In addn., it was shown to spare gastric mucosa. Here we have synthesized a series of novel substituted benzamides related to <b>Parsalmide</b> and have evaluated their activity in vitro on COX- 1 and COX- 2 {{as well as in}} vivo in the carrageenin-induced rat paw edema anti-inflammatory assay. Compds. I (R = CH 2 CH:CMe 2, cyclohexyl, Ph), which showed a favorable profile in vitro and in vivo, were screened in comparison with <b>Parsalmide</b> for gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability in vivo in the rat. Results obtained showed that <b>Parsalmide</b> and compd. I (R = Ph) inhibited both COX- 1 and COX- 2 in vitro and were active in vivo. Both compds. were devoid of gastric effect at the efficacious dose. In addn., both prevented indomethacin-induced gastric damage. Thus, these compds. may guide the definition of a new leading structure with anti-inflammatory activity that may allow designing new safer NSAIDs...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{mutagenicity}} of the anti-inflammatory <b>parsalmide</b> [5 -amino-N-butyl- 2 -(2 -propynyloxy) -benzamide] analogues PA 7 [5 -amino-N-butyl- 2 -cyclohexyloxy-benzamide], PA 10 [5 -amino-N-butyl- 2 -phenoxy-benzamide] and PA 31 [5 -amino-N-butyl- 2 -(p-tolyloxy) -benzamide] {{was determined}} by an Ames Salmonella assay. The experiments were performed by preincubating the compounds in the absence and presence of a post-mitochondrial fraction (S 9) of rat liver homogenate from phenobarbital/beta-naphtoflavone treated rats. No mutagenic effect was observed after direct testing (no S 9 added) in Salmonella typhymurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 102, TA 1535 and TA 1537. However, {{in the presence of}} S 9, the test substances triggered mutagenic responses in strains TA 100 and TA 98. PA 31 presented the strongest mutagenic potential. The reversion rates in the presence of PA 31 were about 2 - 19 fold higher than spontaneous mutation rates. In the presence of PA 7, the reversion increased 2 - 14 -fold over spontaneous rates. While PA 10 showed a relatively mild mutagenic potential, as the number of revertants did not exceed 2. 5 times the number of spontaneous mutations. Mass spectrometric analysis of the in vitro biotransformation showed that S 9 converted (%), regioselectively, PA 7 (19 %), PAIO (7 %) and PA 31 (12 %) into hydroxy-derivatives...|$|E
