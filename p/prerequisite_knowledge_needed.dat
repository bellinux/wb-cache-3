40|$|The {{curriculum}} {{needs for}} quantum computing (QC), quantum information (QI), and quantum encryption (QE) are discussed. QC is {{an application of}} Quantum Mechanics (Messiah 1958) {{to the problem of}} defining a computer using quantum phenomena. QI is an expansion of quan-tum mechanics analogous to classical information theory, and QE is an application of QI. Now that the first venture capital activity in QC (Maney 2003) has occurred, it is time to start considering where, if at all, the interrelated topics QC, QI and QE belong in the Information Systems (IS) curriculum. It is argued that the topics are neither premature nor mature, so that at present they should be inserted only as descriptive topics in a hardware course and a telecommunications course. Although they will probably never be a fitting topic for a full IS course, they already are part of our culture. Soon they may come out of the research labs and begin to affect the business world. There will always be {{the problem of how to}} effectively introduce QC and QI ideas in a “layper-son’s ” overview. I first review the <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>needed</b> to study basic QC and QI as outlined in Nielson (2000). I analogize this to four problems in covering the IS effects of som...|$|E
40|$|Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) {{drive the}} {{behavior}} of industrial control systems according to uploaded programs. It is now known that PLCs are vulnerable to the uploading of malicious code that can have severe physical consequences. What is not understood is whether an adversary with {{no knowledge of the}} PLC’s interface to the control system can execute a damaging, targeted, or stealthy attack against a control system using the PLC. In this paper, we present SABOT, a tool that automatically maps the control instructions in a PLC to an adversary-provided specification of the target control system’s behavior. This mapping recovers sufficient semantics of the PLC’s internal layout to instantiate arbitrary malicious controller code. This lowers the <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>needed</b> to tailor an attack to a control system. SABOT uses an incremental model checking algorithm to map a few plant devices at a time, until a mapping is found for all adversary-specified devices. At this point, a malicious payload can be compiled and uploaded to the PLC. Our evaluation shows that SABOT correctly compiles payloads for all tested control systems when the adversary correctly specifies full system behavior, and for 4 out of 5 systems in most cases where there where unspecified features. Furthermore, SABOT completed all analyses in under 2 minutes...|$|E

Expressed verbally, this knowledge is itself a task. Studies on problem solving let us to identify, on the one hand, the <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>needed</b> to understand {{and learn how to}} accomplish a task, and, on the other hand, the task structure in which the knowledge is embedded. Thus, this approach allows to associate know-how with understanding, learning and with verbal production revision. We point out how two context-based formalism for representing knowledge and reasoning, namely contextual categorization and contextual graphs, can be used for simulating the revision of verbal production of the know-how. The procedural explanation, which can be analyzed in terms of exposition, categorization and implication on the object side to justify the organization of actions in a structure of contextaware goals, is a didactical competence that is not really studied although this competence would help to improve the writing of instructions, and more widely, the teaching of practical knowledge. Thus, we list nine components of the process of revising the verbal production of know-how. Tijus Charles, Ganet Leslie, Brézillon Patrick.

50|$|Bloom's {{original}} theory {{assumes that}} with practice, the slower learners will become faster learners {{and the gap}} of individual differences will disappear. Bloom believes these differences in learning pace occur {{because of lack of}} <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> and if all children have the same <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge,</b> then learning will progress at the same rate. Bloom places the blame on teaching settings where students aren't given enough time to reach mastery levels in <b>prerequisite</b> <b>knowledge</b> before moving on to the new lesson. He also uses this to explain why variance in student learning is smaller in the first grade when compared to students in the 7th grade (the smart get smarter, and the slower fall further behind).

It is often difficult for document users to find all the architectural <b>knowledge</b> they <b>need</b> to do their tasks, and this results in wasted time and mistakes during development. Objective: In this paper we investigate how ontology-based documentation may support users in finding the architectural <b>knowledge</b> they <b>need.</b> Method: We executed a controlled experiment to test for differences in knowledge retrieval efficiency and effectiveness between two groups of master students that used two ontologies built from different understandings of the architectural <b>knowledge</b> <b>needs</b> of document users. Results: Use of the ontology built based on {{a better understanding of}} architectural <b>knowledge</b> <b>needs</b> was significantly more efficient or effective for retrieving part of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>needed</b> by document users. We analysed participants' search actions and identified which organisation of knowledge in the ontologies resulted in efficient and effective knowledge retrieval. Conclusion: We found that an improved understanding of <b>knowledge</b> <b>needs</b> allows for the construction of an ontology from which document users retrieve knowledge more efficiently and effectively. In some cases we found that the ontology support for <b>knowledge</b> <b>needs</b> had to be traded off against ontology design criteria...|$|R
