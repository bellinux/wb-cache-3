40|$|Anti-arrhythmic {{drugs are}} a {{mainstay}} {{in the management}} of symptoms related to arrhythmias, and are adjuncts in prevention and treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. However, they also have the potential for pro-arrhythmia and thus the prediction of arrhythmia predisposition and drug response are critical issues. Clinical trials are the latter stages in the safety testing and efficacy process prior to market release, and as such serve as a critical safeguard. In this review, we {{look at some of the}} lessons to be learned from approaches to arrhythmia prediction in patients, clinical trials of drugs used in the treatment of arrhythmias, and the implications for the design of <b>pre-clinical</b> safety <b>pharmacology</b> testing...|$|R
40|$|Hypericum (St John's Wort) is a {{plant that}} has been used for centuries as a {{medicinal}} herb. Pre-clinical animals studies suggest that hypericum is effective in three major biochemical systems relevant for antidepressant activity, namely the inhibition of the synaptic re-uptake system for serotonin (5 -HT), noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA). It is the only antidepressant capable of inhibiting the re-uptake of 5 -HT, NA and DA with similar potencies. The potencies for monoamine re-inhibition and chronic changes in receptors are also consistent with changes seen with known antidepressants. Behavioral studies suggest that hypericum is active in pre-clinical animal models of depression with comparable effects to known antidepressants. Supporting the <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>pharmacology</b> and efficacy, many clinical studies have shown that hypericum has superior efficacy compared to placebo and comparable efficacy to standard antidepressants in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. The advantage of hypericum over other antidepressants may result from its favorable side-effect profile. Although pre-clinical and short-term clinical studies demonstrate antidepressant activity, the lack of long-term use and efficacy, and the heterogeneity of patients, interventions, extract preparations from previous clinical studies suggests that more careful and controlled studies are needed to determine the long-term efficacy of hypericum in mild-to-moderate depression...|$|E
40|$|Background And Purpose Many of the {{addictive}} {{and rewarding}} effects of nicotine {{are due to}} its actions on the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes expressed in dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic cells. The partial agonists, cytisine and varenicline, are helpful smoking cessation aids. These drugs {{have a number of}} side effects that limit their usefulness. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>pharmacology</b> of the cytisine dimer CC 4. Experimental Approach The effects of CC 4 on nAChRs were investigated using in vitro assays and animal behaviors. Key Results When electrophysiologically tested using heterologously expressed human subtypes, CC 4 was less efficacious than cytisine on neuronal α 4 β 2, α 3 β 4, α 7 and muscle-type receptors, and had no effect on 5 -hydroxytryptamine 3 receptors. Acting through α 4 β 2 and α 6 β 2 nAChRs, CC 4 is a partial agonist of nAChR-mediated striatal dopamine release and, when co-incubated with nicotine, prevented nicotine's maximal effect on this response. In addition, it had low affinity for, and was less efficacious than nicotine and cytisine on the α 3 β 4 and α 7 − nAChR subtypes. Like cytisine and nicotine, CC 4 induced conditioned place preference (CPP), and its self-administration shows an inverted-U dose-response curve. Pre-treatment with non-reinforcing doses of CC 4 significantly reduced nicotine-induced self-administration and CPP without affecting motor functions. Conclusions And Implications Our in vitro and in vivo findings reveal that CC 4 selectively reduces behaviours associated with nicotine addiction consistent with the partial agonist selectivity of CC 4 for β 2 -nAChRs. The results support the possible development of CC 4 or its derivatives as a promising drug for tobacco smoking cessation...|$|E
40|$|Indole- 3 -carbinol (I 3 C), a dietary {{constituent}} {{derived from}} cruciferous vegetables {{has been shown}} to exert anti-tumour and chemopreventive activity in vitro and in vivo. 3, 3 '-diindolylmethane (DIM), an acid condensation product of I 3 C, exerts promising activity and is thought to be partially responsible for the chemopreventive activity of orally administered I 3 C. In order to aid the development of I 3 C or DIM as cancer chemopreventive agents, the <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>pharmacology</b> and cancer chemopreventive activities were explored. An HPLC method was developed and validated to enable accurate pharmacokinetic studies of both compounds. The tissue distribution and pharmacokinetics of I 3 C, DIM and an absorption-enhanced DIM formulation [(BioResponse-DIMÃ¢; BR-DIM) ] were investigated. I 3 C was rapidly absorbed, distributed and eliminated, with peak levels in plasma and tissues occurring within the first 15 min and falling below the limit of detection by 1 h. Acid condensation products and oxidative metabolites were identified in mice that received I 3 C. Following administration of crystalline DIM or BR-DIM, absorption was rapid with maximal plasma and tissue concentrations occurring within 0. 5 - 1 h. In contrast to I 3 C, DIM could be quantified in the plasma and most tissues at all time points up to and including 24 h. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed to characterise the pharmacokinetics of BR-DIM and crystalline DIM. BR-DIM exhibited approximately 50 % higher bioavailability than the crystalline form. In vitro, DIM was more potent at inhibiting the growth of the MDA MB 468 breast cell line than the normal derived HBL 100 line. DIM induced apoptosis and inhibited phosphorylation of protein kinase B in MDA MB 468 cells with higher potency than I 3 C. Neither I 3 C nor DIM, whether administered in the diet or by repeated oral gavage, was able to inhibit the growth of MDA MB 468 xenografts in nude mice. In conclusion, these results further our understanding of the in vivo pharmacology and cancer chemopreventive activity of I 3 C and DIM...|$|E
