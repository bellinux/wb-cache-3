Contrary to common opinion, species pairs of xeric origins are more affected by water deficit than those of mesic origins, probably because the narrower range in mountainous regions of Prince Rupprecht’s larch results in lower adaptation to water deficits, while larger distribution along coastal regions of eastern larch contributes to its higher phenotypic <b>plasticity</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>soil</b> conditions.
