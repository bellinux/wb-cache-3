The NHS began on 5 July 1948, <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> {{the provisions of the}} National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by economist and social reformer William Beveridge. The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments, and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.|$|E

There {{has not been a}} government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707, <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> the terms of the Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.

Today England is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments. In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster, there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.|$|E

With respect to Palestine, the resolution stated that the British were responsible for <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> the terms of the Balfour Declaration. At the request of France, it was agreed that an undertaking was to be inserted in the mandate's procès-verbal that this would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine. The boundaries of Palestine were left unspecified, to [...] "be determined by the Principal Allied Powers." [...] Three months later, in July 1920, the French defeat of Faisal's Arab Kingdom of Syria precipitated the British need to know [...] "what is the 'Syria' for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?" [...] and [...] "does it include Transjordania?" [...] – it subsequently decided to pursue a policy of associating Transjordan with the mandated area of Palestine without adding it to the area of the Jewish National Home.|$|E

2500|$|The Kingdom of Great Britain {{was created}} on 1 May 1707, {{as a result}} of the Acts of Union <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> the terms of the Treaty of Union. At this time, Jethro Tull, a Berkshire farmer, had {{recently}} invented his famous rotating-cylinder seed drill. [...] His 1731 book, The New Horse Hoeing Husbandry, explained the systems and devices he espoused to improve agriculture. [...] The book had such an impact that its influence can still be seen in some aspects of modern farming. Charles Townsend, a viscount known as [...] "Turnip Townsend", retired from Parliament in 1730 and in the years between then and his death in 1738, introduced turnip farming on a large scale. [...] This created four-crop rotation (wheat, turnips, barley and clover) which allowed fertility to be maintained with much less fallow land. [...] Clover increases mineral nitrogen in the soil and clover and turnips are good fodder crops for livestock, which in turn improve the soil by their manure.|$|E
