40|$|The {{postprandial}} morphological {{changes of}} the intestinal epithelium of Burmese pythons were examined using fasting pythons and at eight time points after feeding. In fasting pythons, tightly packed enterocytes possess very short microvilli and are arranged in a pseudostratified fashion. Enterocyte width increases by 23 % within 24 h postfeeding, inducing significant increases in villus length and intestinal mass. By 6 days postfeeding, enterocyte volume had peaked, following {{as much as an}} 80 % increase. Contributing to enterocyte hypertrophy is the cellular accumulation of lipid droplets at the tips and edges of the villi of the <b>proximal</b> and middle <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> but were absent in the distal <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> At 3 days postfeeding, conventional and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed cracks and lipid extrusion along the narrow edges of the villi and at the villus tips. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the rapid postprandial lengthening of enterocyte microvilli, increasing 4. 8 -fold in length within 24 h, and the maintaining of that length through digestion.

50|$|A D-Xylose {{test can}} be performed, {{which is where}} the patient will consume 4.5g of D-xylose, a sugar, by mouth. The urine {{excretion}} of D-Xylose is then measured after 5 hours. The majority of D-Xylose is absorbed normally, and should be found in the urine. If the D-Xylose is found to be low in the urine, this suggests an intestinal malabsorption problem such as bacterial overgrowth of the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> Whipple's Disease, or an autoimmune with diseases such as Celiac's Disease (allergy to gluten) or Crohn's Disease (autoimmune disease affecting the small intestine). With empiric antibiotic treatment after an initial positive D-Xylose test, and if a follow-up D-Xylose test is positive (decreased urine excretion) after antibiotic therapy, then this would signify it is not bacterial overgrowth of the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Since Whipple's disease is so rare, a follow-up positive D-Xylose test more likely indicates a non-infectious etiology and more likely an autoimmune etiology. Clinical correlation is recommended to rule out Whipple's disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{basis of}} many {{functional}} gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) is distension of the intestinal lumen.

After 7 d, diabetic rats were further treated with insulin or 1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol [1, 25 (0 H) 2 D 3 J for an additional 5 - 7 d. Control, diabetic, diabetic + insulin, and diabetic + 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 rats were then killed, their <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> were removed, and villus-tip epithelial cells were isolated and used to prepare brush-border membrane vesicles. Preparations from each of these groups were then analyzed and compared {{with respect to their}} amiloride-sensitive, electroneutral Na+-H+ exchange activity, using 22 Na uptake as well as acridine orange techniques. The results of these experiments demonstrated that (a) H+ gradient-dependent 22 Na uptake as well as Na+ gradient-dependent transmembrane H+ fluxes were significantly increased in diabetic vesicles compared to their control counterparts, (b) kinetic studies demonstrated that this enhanced 'Na uptake in diabetes was a result of increased maximal velocity (V.,.) of this exchanger with no change in apparent affinity (K.) for Na+, (c) serum levels of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 were significantly lower in diabetic animals compared with their control counterparts; and (d) insulin or 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 treatment restored the alterations to control values, without any significant changes in K., concomitant with significantly increasing the serum levels of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 in diabetic animals.

Infection {{is thought to be}} endemic in wild birds with fulminant, fatal disease occurring under the influence of stress, concurrent infections, or immunosuppression. Here, we describe the histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of the cellular infiltrate occurring in captive colonies of American goldfinches and house sparrows. Necropsies were performed on 9 birds, and histologic examination was performed on the intestines of 7 additional birds. Lesions were most severe in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestines.</b> Histologically, the changes ranged from variably intense infiltrates of lymphocytes that filled the lamina propria to sheets of large, atypical cells that expanded and obliterated normal mucosal epithelium and invaded through the wall of the intestine and into the ceolomic cavity. Both the smaller lymphocytes and large atypical cells were immunoreactive for CD 3. Intracellular parasites consistent with Isospora were detected in the large atypical cells, but they were more easily detectable in the more differentiated lymphocytes. Polymerase chain reaction and virus isolation performed on tissues from 7 birds were negative for retroviruses and herpesvirus. The immunohistochemical results of this study and the destructive nature of the cellular infiltrate suggest that the lesion represents T-cell lymphoma. In birds, lymphomas are most often associated with herpes and retroviruses; the absence of these viruses suggests that the parasite initiated neoplastic transformation. Though much work {{needs to be done to}} prove the transformative nature of the lesions, these preliminary results suggest that passerine birds may be susceptible to parasite-associated lymphomas...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{absorption}} of vitamin B 12 by the distal <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> requires binding of vitamin B 12 to {{gastric intrinsic factor}} (IF) to form a macromolecular IF-B 12 complex (1). We have previously demonstrated (2) that this IF-B 12 complex attaches by a process of physical adsorption to brush borders and microvillous membranes isolated from distal but not <b>proximal</b> hamster <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> This pattern of uptake directly supports the concept (3, 4) that a specific receptor for the IF-B 12 complex is situated on the luminal surface of distal small intestinal epithelium. To obtain further information concerning the nature and cell surface location of the IF-B~ 2 receptor, we have attempted to prepare in rabbits an antibody to this receptor.

40|$|Age-specific {{changes in}} {{glycosylation}} of rat intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase {{were analyzed using}} enzyme immunoprecipitated from microvillus membranes of suckling, weaning, and adult rats, and carbohydrate moieties were examined by lectin affinity binding, metabolic labeling, and neuraminidase treatment. Lectin binding indicated the presence of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharide chains containing mannose and galactose throughout development. An age-dependent shift in sialic acid and fucose was seen {{during the period of}} weaning; no fucose was detectable in lactase-phlorizin hydrolase until after the rats were 20 days of age, whereas sialic acid was reduced in adult lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. The presence of sialic acid in suckling intestines and fucose in adult was confirmed by metabolic labeling with appropriate radioactive precursors. Sodium dodecyl phosphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of immunoprecipitated lactase-phlorizin hydrolase from the <b>proximal</b> and mid <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> showed two bands of approximately 220 and 130 kilodaltons in all age groups. In the distal part of the adult <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> lactase-phlorizin hydrolase appeared as two bands of similar size to those found in the proximal and mid portions. In contrast, during the suckling and weaning periods, these distal bands were approximately 225 and 135 kilodaltons. [35 S]-methionine labeling and fluorography of neonatal intestines confirmed these observations. The size difference between <b>proximal</b> and distal <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> was virtually eliminated by neuraminidase treatment. These data indicate that the core structure of microvillus membrane lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, consisting of both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, remains constant during development, although terminal sugars shift from predominantly sialic acid during the suckling period to fucose in adulthood. This alteration in glycosylation of the protein occurs in a different pattern from the postweaning decline in lactase specific activity. Consequently, age-dependent changes in glycosylation cannot account for the decrease in lactase-phlorizin hydrolase-specific activity observed during developmen...|$|R

The production of fluid {{is thought to be}} due to active hypersecretion, passive secretion of proteins secondary to damage to epithelium of the mucosa and capillaries, and a functional ileus which prevents removal of this fluid. Massive fluid production results in extensive reflux, usually produced at a rate of 50-100 mL/min, in addition to distention of the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> dehydration, and possible shock secondary to hypovolemia. Proximal enteritis can also occur with inflammation of other organs in the gastrointestinal tract, including gastritis, ileitis, typhlitis, and colitis.|$|E
50|$|In humans, enteropeptidase is encoded by the PRSS7 gene (also {{known as}} ENTK) on {{chromosome}} 21q21. Some nonsense and frameshift mutations in this gene {{lead to a}} rare recessive disorder characterised by severe failure to thrive in affected infants, due to enteropeptidase deficiency. Enteropeptidase mRNA expression {{is limited to the}} <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> and the protein is found in enterocytes of duodenum and proximal jejunum. Upon secretion from the pancreas into the duodenum, trypsinogen encounters enteropeptidase and is activated. Trypsin then cleaves and activates other pancreatic serine protease zymogens (chymotrypsinogen and proelastases), metalloprotease zymogens (procarboxypeptidases) and prolipases. By means of this simple two-step cascade, the destructive activity of these digestive hydrolases is confined to the lumen of the intestine. The physiological importance of this pathway is demonstrated by the severe intestinal malabsorption caused by congenital deficiency of enteropeptidase. This condition can be life-threatening, but responds to oral supplementation with pancreatic extract.|$|E

40|$|The final {{boundary}} between digested {{food and the}} cells that take up nutrients in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> is a protective layer of mucus. In this work, the microstructural organization and permeability of the intestinal mucus have been determined under conditions simulating those of infant and adult human <b>small</b> <b>intestines.</b> As a model, we used the mucus from the <b>proximal</b> (jejunal) <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> of piglets and adult pigs. Confocal microscopy of both unfixed and fixed mucosal tissue showed mucus lining the entire jejunal epithelium. The mucus contained DNA from shed epithelial cells {{at different stages of}} degradation, with higher amounts of DNA found in the adult pig. The pig mucus comprised a coherent network of mucin and DNA with higher viscosity than the more heterogeneous piglet mucus, which resulted in increased permeability of the latter to 500 -nm and 1 -µm latex beads. Multiple-particle tracking experiments revealed that diffusion of the probe particles was considerably enhanced after treating mucus with DNase. The fraction of diffusive 500 -nm probe particles increased in the pig mucus from 0. 6 % to 64 % and in the piglet mucus from ca. 30 % to 77 % after the treatment. This suggests that extracellular DNA can significantly contribute to the microrheology and barrier properties of the intestinal mucus layer.

The intestinal acidic transferase most probably was identical with glutathione S-transferase Pi, isolated from human placenta. In the hepatic preparation, this isoform was hardly detectable.

50|$|The {{idea that}} a SIBO test should be several hours long and that distal {{overgrowth}} is important is wrong and is {{not supported by the}} scientific literature. The optimal testing is 1 hour. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) occurs as a result of excessive numbers of bacteria inhabiting the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Bacterial concentrations greater than 105 organisms per milliliter is diagnostic for SIBO. We know bacteria are colonizing the proximal and not the distal small intestine for several reasons. First, the gold standard method for detection of SIBO is jejunal aspirates. Intestinal fluid of the proximal intestine is sampled, not distal intestinal fluid. Secondly, the consequences of SIBO are the result of competition between bacteria and the human host for ingested nutrients in the intestine. Various functional consequences of bacterial infiltration cause enterocyte damage in the jejunum such as diminished disaccharidase activity, fat malabsorption, decreased amino acid transport and decreased vitamin B12 absorption. Thus, detection of proximal bacterial overgrowth is critical.|$|E

The role of Pdx 1 in regulating intestinal gene expression has therefore yet to be determined in viable mice with normal pancreatic development. We hypothesized that conditional inactivation of Pdx 1 restricted to the intestinal epithelium would alter intestinal gene expression and cell differentiation. Pdx 1 flox/flox;VilCre mice with intestine-specific Pdx 1 inactivation were generated by crossing a transgenic mouse strain expressing Cre recombinase, driven by a mouse villin 1 gene promoter fragment, with a mutant mouse strain homozygous for loxP site-flanked Pdx 1. Pdx 1 protein is undetectable in all epithelial cells in the intestinal epithelium of Pdx 1 flox/flox;VilCre mice. Goblet cell number and mRNA abundance for mucin 3 and mucin 13 genes in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> are comparable between Pdx 1 flox/flox;VilCre and control mice. Similarly, Paneth cell number and expression of Paneth cell-related genes Defa 1, Defcr-rs 1, and Mmp 7 in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> remain statistically unchanged by Pdx 1 inactivation. Although the number of enteroendocrine cells expressing chromogranin A/B, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (Gip), or somatostatin (Sst) is unaffected in the Pdx 1 flox/flox;VilCre mice, mRNA abundance for Gip and Sst is significantly reduced in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Conditional Pdx 1 inactivation attenuates intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) activity in the duodenal epithelium, consistent with an average 91 % decrease in expression of the mouse enterocyte IAP gene, alkaline phosphatase 3 (a novel Pdx 1 target candidate), in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> following Pdx 1 inactivation.

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, bound to its receptor (VDR) contributes to calcium homeostasis by regulating active calcium absorption in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> However, studying patients with hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) provided investigators {{with a better}} understanding of VDR 2 ̆ 7 s role in calcium homeostasis. HVDRR patients have inactivating mutations in the VDR, and as a consequence they develop hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism and severe rickets. However, these phenotypes can be corrected if the patients are given IV infusions of calcium or dietary calcium. This raises the question of what is the physiological significance of VDR-regulated active calcium absorption if calcium homeostasis can be restored independently of the VDR. ^ In order to distinguish the contribution of VDR in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> to overall calcium homeostasis, I generated transgenic mice expressing the human VDR (hVDR) exclusively in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> of mVDR-/- mice by using an hVDR-expressing transgene driven by the duodenal-specific adenosine deaminase enhancer (hVDR+/mVDR-/-). hVDR+/mVDR-/- mice expressed transcriptionally active hVDR only in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> and responded to 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 by up-regulating expression of TRPV 6 and calbindin D 9 K, genes involved in calcium absorption. Furthermore, ligated duodenal loop assays determined that calcium absorption in hVDR+/mVDR-/- mice was as responsive to 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 as in WT mice. Despite having a functional hVDR in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> hVDR+/mVDR-/- mice were hypocalcemic, had hyperparathyroidism, and were rachitic when fed a normal rodent diet at weaning, as were the mVDR-/- mice. However, when fed a high calcium, phosphorus, and lactose diet (rescue diet), the hVDR+/mVDR-/- mice responded more effectively than the mVDR-/- mice by down-regulation of parathyroid hormone production and by a greater increase in bone mineralization. Furthermore, when three-month-old rachitic mice were fed a rescue diet for 3 weeks, serum calcium and bone mineral content were normalized in hVDR+/mVDR-/- mice, but not in mVDR-/- mice. ^ In conclusion, hVDR expression enabled young mice to better use the rescue diet than mVDR-/- mice. Expression of transgenic hVDR also protected the ability of older mice to respond to the rescue diet despite the absence of the VDR elsewhere in the intestinal tract. I propose that because hVDR+/mVDR-/- mice responded better than mVDR-/- mice to the rescue diet, it is likely that VDR expression in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> is necessary in nutritional (insufficient dietary calcium) and physiological (age) conditions when passive calcium absorption is inadequate. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal tract fistulas are {{relatively}} uncommon {{and can be}} congenital or acquired. Fistulas may communicate {{with a variety of}} anatomic locations, including body cavities, the skin, and other organ systems. Acquired fistulas which communicate with the cardiovascular system are of particular concern, as they may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study reports on three cases of acquired, post-surgical fistula formation involving the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. CASE REPORTS: Case 1 - A 57 -year-old man experienced sudden cardiac death shortly after having a permanent pacemaker placed for atrial fibrillation. Approximately two years earlier, he underwent surgical resection of his esophagus for cancer, and he had a diaphragmatic hernia repair several weeks before death. He also had hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and emphysema. At autopsy, {{the cause of death was}} determined to be upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage due to a gastro-left atrial fistula which developed as a complication following the esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Case 2 – A 67 -year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as a thoracic aortic aneurysm for which she had undergone aortic reconstruction with graft placement, presented to the hospital with massive hematemesis with associated breathing difficulties. Prior to dying, an upper endoscopy revealed a probable esophageal fistula thought to be communicating with the respiratory system. At autopsy, the fistula was found to be communicating with the aorta. Case 3 – A 51 -year-old woman was found unresponsive at home. All resuscitative efforts were unsuccessful. The case was referred for medicolegal autopsy. She had a past history of COPD, gastric bypass surgery, and relatively recent bacterial pericarditis, which required drainage and antibiotic therapy. Autopsy revealed the presence of a gastric fistula involving and traversing the left hemidiaphragm to involve the posterior wall of the left ventricle of the heart. Approximately 500 - 1000 mL of dark blood intermixed with gastrointestinal contents was present within the stomach and <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestines,</b> but no fresh-appearing hemorrhage was evident. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Postoperative gastrointestinal-cardiovascular fistulas {{are relatively}} rare but can result in significant morbidity and mortality. They may develop following gastrointestinal tract or cardiovascular surgery. Clinicians are advised to be aware of these rare, but often fatal, post-operative complications...|$|R

Twenty four weaned piglets, divided into four groups, were fed the same feed except the included fibre: carboxymethylcellulose (group CMC), lignified cellulose (group LIG) and pure cellulose (group CEL). The control group received starch instead of fibre (group KON). Piglets were sacrificed after 13 days of feeding and digesta samples were taken from: stomach, <b>proximal</b> part of <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> distal part of <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> caecum, colon and rectum together. The quantity of microorganisms {{in different parts of}} GIT was estimated by ATP-luciferase assay. The highest concentration (conc.) of microbial ATP was found in large intestine in all groups. Statistically significant effect of different fibres on conc. of microbia...|$|R
40|$|Six {{patients}} with {{rheumatoid factor positive}} rheumatoid arthritis who had shown a marked symptomatic improvement during four weeks of hypoallergic, artificial diet were studied in greater detail. Placebo controlled rechallenges showed intolerance for specific foodstuffs in four patients. In three of these patients biopsies of both the synovial membrane and of the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> were carried out before and during allergen free feeding. In two patients, both with raised serum IgE concentrations and specific IgE antibodies to certain foods, a marked reduction of mast cells in the synovial membrane and <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> was demonstrated. Although the number of food intolerant {{patients with}} RA remains limited and markers of allergic activity are scanty, our observations suggest an underlying immunoallergological mechanism...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGATA 4, a {{transcription}} factor {{expressed in the}} <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> {{but not in the}} distal ileum, maintains proximal–distal distinctions by multiple processes involving gene repression, gene activation, and cell fate determination. Friend of GATA (FOG) is an evolutionarily conserved family of cofactors whose members physically associate with GATA factors and mediate GATA-regulated repression in multiple tissues. Using a novel, inducible, intestine-specific Gata 4 knock-in model in mice, in which wild-type GATA 4 is specifically inactivated in the small intestine, but a GATA 4 mutant that does not bind FOG cofactors (GATA 4 ki) continues to be expressed, we found that ileal-specific genes were significantly induced in the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> (P< 0. 01); in contrast, genes restricted to <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> and cell lineage markers were unaffected, indicating that GATA 4 –FOG interactions contribute specifically to the repression function of GATA 4 within this organ. Fog 1 mRNA displayed a proximal–distal pattern that parallels that of Gata 4, and FOG 1 protein was co-expressed with GATA 4 in intestinal epithelial cells, implicating FOG 1 as the likely mediator of GATA 4 function in the small intestine. Our data are the first to indicate FOG function and expression in the mammalian small intestine...|$|E
40|$|Gastric {{bypass surgery}} (RYGBP) for the {{treatment}} of obesity has proven to clinically reverse type 2 diabetes mellitus. RYGBP involves both gastric reduction and bypass of the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass (DJB) is a surgical procedure that bypasses the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> without gastric reduction and has been shown to improve oral glucose tolerance in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a non-obese animal model of T 2 DM. We hypothesized that DJB may improve oral glucose tolerance in GK rats by improving insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, the main depot for insulin stimulated glucose uptake. DJB was performed on male 10 - 12 week old GK rats (GK-DJB), and sham operations were performed on GK rats (GK-Sham). Insulin stimulated IRS- 1, phospho-serine 307 of IRS- 1, Akt, and phospho-Akt were determined using Western blot. Phospho-Akt was significantly higher in GK-DJB when compared to GK-Sham in soleus and tended to be higher in gastrocnemius (p= 0. 107). Akt was significantly higher in GK-DJB when compared to GK-Sham in gastrocnemius and tended to be higher in soleus (p= 0. 074). Phospho-serine 307 of IRS- 1 and total IRS- 1 were not different between GK-DJB and GK-Sham in gastrocnemius. In conclusion, bypassing the <b>proximal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> (DJB) improves components of skeletal muscle insulin signaling in GK rats, providing mechanistic evidence for the improvement in oral glucose tolerance associated with DJB.   M.

40|$|Biotransformation or drug-metabolising enzymes have an {{important}} function in the detoxication of ingested toxic, carcinogenic, or tumour promoting compounds. Enzyme activity and isoenzyme composition of three biotransformation systems: glutathione S-transferase, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase, and cytochrome P- 450 were studied in normal small and large intestinal mucosa from three kidney donors. The activity of most drug-metabolising enzymes decreases slightly from <b>proximal</b> to distal <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> whereas in the mucosa of the large intestine a sharp fall in activity was observed. The isoenzyme composition {{for each of the}} three biotransformation systems changed from the small to the large intestine. Class Alpha glutathione S-transferases were not expressed in the colon, in contrast to the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> where both Alpha and Pi class isoenzymes are present. In addition, with monoclonal antibodies fewer protein bands for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and cytochrome P- 450 were detected in the colon. In the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> both isoforms P- 450 (4) and P- 450 (5) were present, whereas in the colon only reduced amounts of cytochrome P- 450 (4) could be visualised. For UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, 53 and 54 kDa proteins could be detected in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> but in the colon there was only weak staining of the 54 kDa band. In the normal human colon enzymes are less active and there are fewer isoenzymes present in the mucosa than in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> This implies a lower level of the detoxifying potential in the colon, which might be important in regard to the high rates of carcinogenesis in the colon...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{superoxide}} dismutases (SODs), superoxide reductases (SORs) eliminate {{superoxide anion}} (O(2) (*-)) not through its dismutation, but via reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)) {{in the presence}} of an electron donor. The microaerobic protist Giardia intestinalis, responsible for a common intestinal disease in humans, though lacking SOD and other canonical reactive oxygen species-detoxifying systems, is among the very few eukaryotes encoding a SOR yet identified. In this study, the recombinant SOR from Giardia (SOR(Gi)) was purified and characterized by pulse radiolysis and stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The protein, isolated in the reduced state, after oxidation by superoxide or hexachloroiridate(IV), yields a resting species (T(final)) with Fe(3 +) ligated to glutamate or hydroxide depending on pH (apparent pK(a) = 8. 7). Although showing negligible SOD activity, reduced SOR(Gi) reacts with O(2) (*-) with a pH-independent second-order rate constant k(1) = 1. 0 × 10 (9) M(- 1) s(- 1) and yields the ferric-(hydro) peroxo intermediate T(1); this in turn rapidly decays to the T(final) state with pH-dependent rates, without populating other detectable intermediates. Immunoblotting assays show that SOR(Gi) is expressed in the disease-causing trophozoite of Giardia. We propose that the superoxide-scavenging activity of SOR in Giardia may promote the survival of this air-sensitive parasite in the fairly aerobic <b>proximal</b> human <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> during infection...|$|R
30|$|In contrast, neither mRNA {{expressions}} nor BrdU-positive {{cell number}} in distal intestine were changed by Glu administration. Glu uptake by enterocyte {{depends on the}} existence of suitable transport systems. In mammal, it is reported that transporters responsible for amino acid uptake mainly exist <b>proximal</b> <b>intestine</b> (<b>small</b> intestine; Dave et al. 2004; Broberg et al. 2012). In fish, it is also reported that the absorption rates of amino acids are different from proximal to distal intestine, and proximal intestine uptakes more amino acids than distal intestine in rainbow trout (Bakke-McKellep et al. 2000; Santigosa et al. 2011). It is assumed that insufficient distribution of transporter responsible for Glu import is a reason for ineffectiveness of Glu on distal intestine.|$|R
