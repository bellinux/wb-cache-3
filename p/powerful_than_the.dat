5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appointment}} as project director {{for a new}} indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, substantially resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear. The Nene was larger, heavier and more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned {{for use in the}} Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage with a larger cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal rather than the HeS 011's axial compressor design.|$|E

5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the rifle}} corps were re-established in late 1942 and the {{previous}} organization of artillery at the corps level was reintroduced. As {{a result of the}} halting of 152mm howitzer production, the Red Army corps artillery lacked a weapon more mobile than the heavy 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20) (typically employed by army-level and Reserve of the Main Command artillery units), but more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30).|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania Railroad {{decided to}} replace the P5, and {{instructed}} General Electric and Westinghouse to design an electric locomotive that was more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> P5, capable of speeds of , have a lighter axle load and to be double-ended with a cab {{in the center of}} the carbody. Westinghouse designed the R1 #4800, and General Electric submitted the GG1, then numbered 4899.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new federal government should be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the federal government should be more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> states.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 26 April 1797 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars in which a Spanish convoy of two frigates was trapped and defeated off the Spanish town of Conil de la Frontera by British ships of the Cadiz blockade. The British vessels, the ship of the line HMS Irresistible and the Fifth-rate frigate HMS Emerald, were significantly more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Spanish frigates, which were on the last stage of a voyage carrying treasure from Havana, Cuba, to the Spanish fleet base of Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} {{of a change in}} weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.|$|E

5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and his policy of rollback in Korea failed. The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, which was much more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Soviets' atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|According to {{archaeologist}} Karl Lorenz, who excavated several Natchez settlements, {{another factor}} that complicated relations between the Natchez and the colonists {{was the fact that}} the French did not well understand the Natchez political structure. The French assumed that the Great Sun, the chief of the Grand Village, also held sway over all the other Natchez villages. In truth, each village was semi-autonomous, and the Great Sun's power only extended to the villages of Flour and Tioux (with which the Grand Village was allied) and not to the three pro-British villages of White Apple, Jenzenaque and Grigra. When the Great Sun died in 1728 and was succeeded by his inexperienced nephew, the pro-British villages became more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> pro-French villages centered at Natchez.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Type 34-class destroyers {{began in}} 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the {{armament}} limitations of the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Kriegsmarine now expected it {{to serve as a}} small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well-thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high-pressure boilers, were an over-complicated design that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, NSB started leasing SJ T44-locomotives from Sweden to {{supplement}} the Di 3. In 1992, {{the decision was made}} to order 12 Di 6 and 20 Di 8 to replace the Di 3. The former was based on the Di 4 and had twice the power of the Di 3. The Di 8 was slightly more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Di 3, and were intended for freight trains. Both series were put into service in 1996, but the Di 6 proved to have so many technical problems that they were returned to Siemens in 1998. The Di 3 units had been set aside and some had been scrapped, but the return of the Di 6 forced NSB to put the units back into service.|$|E
5|$|In December 1959, Manekshaw was {{appointed}} the commandant of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. Soon, {{he was in}} middle of an unwanted controversy that almost ended his career. In May 1961, Thimayya resigned as the COAS, and was succeeded by General Pran Nath Thapar. Earlier in the year, Major General Brij Mohan Kaul was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as the Quarter Master General (QMG) by Defence Minister Menon against the recommendation of Thimayya. This incident had led to Thimayya's resignation. Within no time, Kaul was made the Chief of General Staff (CGS), the second highest appointment at Army Headquarters after the COAS. Kaul soon became close to Nehru and Menon, and even more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> chief himself. This was not liked by senior army officials, including Manekshaw. He made a few derogatory comments on the political leadership, which led him to be marked as an anti-national.|$|E
5|$|Ra.One is a 2011 Indian superhero film {{directed}} by Anubhav Sinha, and starring Shah Rukh Khan, Arjun Rampal, Kareena Kapoor, Armaan Verma, Shahana Goswami and Tom Wu in pivotal roles.The script, written by Anubhav Sinha and Kanika Dhillon, originated {{as an idea}} that Anubhav Sinha got {{when he saw a}} television commercial, and which he subsequently expanded. The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a motion sensor-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) is more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them.|$|E

5|$|The Victor B.1 was {{powered by}} an {{arrangement}} of four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines. The engines were embedded in pairs into the aircraft's wing root; {{because of the high}} mounted position of the wing, the tail had to adopt a high mounting to maintain clearance of the jet turbulence, however the airbrakes were ideally situated {{to take advantage of this}} phenomenon. Difficulties were encountered with the Sapphires when stationed in tropical environments; several engines were destroyed by the turbine blades striking the outer engine casing. The Victor B.2 adopted the newer Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan; the Conway at one point held the distinction of being the most powerful non-afterburning engine outside of the Soviet Union, and were significantly more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> preceding Sapphire engines employed upon on the B.1.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations. However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> two next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> ones that open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult to pry open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E
