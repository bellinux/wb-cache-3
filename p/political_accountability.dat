It has been regarded by one academic commentator as the litmus test of how liberal the standing rules within a legal regime are.

The political ideology dimension is dichotomized based on whether a bureaucrat's political ideology is congruent or incongruent with his/her overhead politicalprincipals. The bureaucratic accountability dimension is also dichotomized between accountability to the overhead <b>political</b> principals and <b>accountability</b> to the public sentiment. With the given dimensions, the exit, voice, loyalty, and silence scenarios are discussed as possible bureaucratic behaviors. In addition, the stay scenario is discussed for passive bureaucrats regardless of the two dimensions. By incorporating studies on bureaucrats' <b>political</b> views, <b>accountability,</b> and Hirschman's bureaucratic behaviors, this study expects {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of bureaucrats...|$|R

40|$|This article explores how {{political}} representation is enacted in governance networks, where interdependent actors from government, business, {{and civil society}} coproduce public policy. A combined dramaturgical and discourse analysis considers how representation is staged, performed, and articulated in {{a case study of}} recent Dutch energy reforms. The findings suggest that networks produce a kind of "democratic soup" where actors and institutions enact alternative meanings of representation that sit uncomfortably alongside representative democracy's emphasis on <b>political</b> authorization, <b>accountability,</b> and responsiveness. These democratic attributes appear to be decoupled from representation in governance networks and thus need to be secured through other means...|$|R

In this paper I will argue that such a view is inaccurate.
