5|$|Congestion <b>pricing</b> {{has also}} been {{implemented}} for scheduled airline services. The British Airports Authority (BAA) has been a pioneer in implementing congestion <b>pricing</b> {{for all types of}} commercial aviation. In 1972 implemented the first peak <b>pricing</b> policy, with surcharges varying depending on the season and time of the day, and by 1976 raised these peak charges. London-Heathrow had seven <b>pricing</b> structures between 1976 and 1984. In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case.|$|E
5|$|Congestion <b>pricing</b> {{has also}} been {{implemented}} in urban freeways. Between 2004 and 2005, Santiago de Chile implemented the first 100% non-stop urban toll for a freeway passing through a downtown area, charging by the distance traveled. Congestion <b>pricing</b> has been used since 2007 during rush hours {{in order to maintain}} reasonable speeds within the city core.|$|E
5|$|Congestion <b>pricing</b> or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road <b>pricing</b> to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This <b>pricing</b> strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion <b>pricing</b> concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E

30|$|The export <b>prices</b> of {{five major}} rice markets {{are used in}} this study which were taken from the Food and Agricultural Organisation’s Global Information Early Warning System (GIEWS) database. The <b>prices</b> are {{measured}} in a common currency, namely monthly FOB export <b>prices</b> in nominal US dollars. The Thai and Vietnamese <b>prices</b> are the five per cent broken rice <b>prices,</b> the American <b>price</b> is the two to four per cent broken <b>price,</b> the Argentinean <b>price</b> is the ten per cent broken <b>price,</b> and the Pakistani <b>price</b> is the twenty five per cent broken <b>price.</b> The <b>prices</b> are therefore seen as representing the higher quality indica grades of rice apart from the Pakistani <b>price.</b> While the higher quality Pakistani <b>price</b> was not available, it is assumed that the higher quality Pakistan <b>price</b> closely follows <b>price</b> movements in the lower quality Pakistani <b>price</b> since this is the case for Thai and Vietnamese rice export <b>prices.</b> The Uruguayan export <b>price</b> is probably a more important rice <b>price</b> for South American markets than the Argentinean <b>price,</b> however, data was only available from 2006 which would have severely cut the available number of observations included in the study therefore the study assumes that Argentinean <b>prices</b> are related to Uruguayan <b>price</b> movements and are therefore suitable for the analysis. Indian export <b>prices</b> are also available; however, due to the Indian government’s policy of temporal rice export bans there are many breaks in the <b>price</b> series therefore Indian <b>prices</b> cannot be included in the study.|$|R
5|$|Implementation of {{congestion}} <b>pricing</b> {{has reduced}} congestion in urban areas, but has also sparked criticism and public discontent. Critics maintain that congestion <b>pricing</b> is not equitable, places an economic burden on neighboring communities, {{has a negative}} effect on retail businesses and on economic activity in general, and represents another tax levy.|$|E
5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road congestion <b>pricing</b> {{are found}} {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers. Autoroute A1 in Northern France {{is one of the}} few cases of congestion <b>pricing</b> implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As congestion <b>pricing</b> has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility congestion <b>pricing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{concerns}} {{have also been}} expressed regarding the effects of cordon area congestion <b>pricing</b> on economic activity and land use, as the benefits are usually evaluated from the urban transportation perspective only. However, congestion <b>pricing</b> schemes have been used with the main objective of improving urban quality and to preserve historical heritage in the small cities.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between live and carcass <b>prices</b> and the seasonality of live, carcass, and wholesale cut <b>prices.</b> Results using Omaha live <b>prices</b> suggested a unidirectional relationship between live and carcass <b>prices,</b> with farm <b>prices</b> leading carcass <b>prices</b> by 3 weeks. In contrast, the results generated using live <b>prices</b> from the St. Joseph terminal market suggested a bidirectional relationship. Live and carcass <b>prices</b> from 1987 to 1992 were found to be highly correlated. The average monthly <b>price</b> spread between the Omaha live <b>price</b> and the USDA carcass <b>price</b> ranged from $ 14. 02 to $ 23. 18 cwt, with an average spread of $ 17. 53 cwt. The spread has changed only marginally from 1987 to 1992. Loin <b>prices</b> were found to follow the seasonal <b>price</b> pattern of live and carcass <b>prices,</b> except that they declined to a greater degree in October and November. Ham <b>prices</b> also followed the seasonal <b>price</b> trend of live and carcass <b>prices,</b> except that they increased to a greater extent during Thanksgiving and Christmas. The increased support of ham <b>prices</b> in the fall tended to offset the seasonal weakness in loin <b>prices.</b> Seasonality of spare rib <b>prices</b> was evident, with the high <b>prices</b> occurring during the outdoor cooking season (May, June, and July).

5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} <b>pricing</b> is a fee or {{tax paid}} by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area.

50|$|The diagram shows <b>price</b> {{points at}} the points labeled A, B, and C. When a vendor {{increases}} a <b>price</b> beyond a <b>price</b> point (say to a <b>price</b> slightly above <b>price</b> point B), sales volume decreases by an amount more than proportional to the <b>price</b> increase. This decrease in quantity-demanded more than offsets the additional revenue from the increased unit-price. As a result, total revenue (<b>price</b> multiplied by quantity-demanded) decreases when a firm raises its <b>price</b> beyond a <b>price</b> point. Technically, the <b>price</b> elasticity of demand is low (inelastic) at a <b>price</b> lower than the <b>price</b> point (steep section of the demand curve), and high (elastic) at a <b>price</b> higher than a <b>price</b> point (gently sloping part of the demand curve).
