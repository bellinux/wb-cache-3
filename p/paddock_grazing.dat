A cow is only physically milked for about 10 minutes a day depending on her milk letdown time and the amount of milkings per day.|$|E

This study focused on two areas of grazing management, the first {{an assessment of the}} indicators leaf stage, pre-grazing yield and grazing residual. In summary, 49 % of measured paddocks were grazed too soon based on leaf stage, 62 % were grazed outside the recommended pre-grazing yield, and 48 % of measured paddocks were not grazed to a desirable height. The second part of the study provided an insight into farmer decision making at an operational level of grazing management with three key components identified. These were: 1) The recruitment of paddocks into a grazing plan; 2) The shuffling of the <b>paddock</b> <b>grazing</b> sequence within the grazing plan; and 3) The management of individual grazing events before, during and after the event. An improved understanding by rural professionals of grazing management decision making would result in extension strategies which generate increased farmer engagement, adoption of grazing management technologies and improved on-farm productivity. falseonline at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|In 2001 and 2002, {{pastures}} at the ISU Rhodes Research and Demonstration Farm were grazed {{to determine}} the effects of stocking treatment on nutrient and sediment loss from pastureland. Treatments included an ungrazed control (UG), summer hay harvest with winter stockpiled grazing (HS), continuous stocking to a residual height of 2 inches (2 C), rotational stocking to a residual height of 2 inches (2 R), and rotational stocking to a residual height of 4 inches (4 R). At three times in 2001 (late spring, mid-summer, and fall) and four times in 2002 (early spring, late spring, mid-summer, and fall), rainfall simulations were conducted at 6 sites within each paddock and 6 sites in a buffer zone down slope from each paddock. Run-off was collected and analyzed for total sediment, total phosphorus, and dissolved phosphorus. Simultaneous to each rainfall simulation, ground cover, penetration resistance, surface roughness, slope, contents of phosphorus and moisture of the soil, and the sward height and mass of forage were measured. In years 1 (late spring 2001 through early spring 2002) and 2 (late spring 2002 through fall 2002), mean concentrations of sediment in runoff did not differ between ungrazed or <b>grazed</b> <b>paddocks.</b> Mean concentrations of total P in the run-off were greater (P 3 ̆c. 05) in <b>paddocks</b> <b>grazed</b> to 2 inches by continuous or rotational stocking than in paddocks that were ungrazed, grazed to 4 inches by rotational stocking or harvested as hay and grazed as stockpiled forage.

Tanzania subjected to different rotational stocking intensities. Treatments corresponded to two post-grazing conditions (residues of 25 and 50 cm) associated with a pre-grazing condition of 95 % sward canopy light interception during regrowth (LI). The grazing time increased linearly with {{the duration of the}} occupation period (475 to 630 minutes/day). On <b>paddocks</b> <b>grazed</b> down to a residue of 25 cm, the bite rate increased linearly along the occupation period, with an average of 42. 5 bites/minute.

However, grazing at 25 cm residue resulted in greater herbage removal (68. 0 vs. 45. 6 %) and greater grazing efficiency (90. 4 vs. 49. 8 %) than grazing at 50 cm residue. Post-grazing residues of Tanzania guineagrass under rotational stocking management may be set at either 25 or 50 cm, since the herbage intake was not affected within this grazing intensity range.

40|$|Historical {{stocking}} {{methods of}} continuous, season-long grazing of pastures with little account of growing conditions have caused some degradation within grazed landscapes in northern Australia. Alternative stocking {{methods have been}} implemented to address this degradation and raise the productivity and profitability of the principal livestock, cattle. Because information comparing stocking methods is limited, an evaluation was undertaken to quantify the effects of stocking methods on pastures, soils and grazing capacity. The approach was to monitor existing stocking methods on nine commercial beef properties in north and south Queensland. Environments included native and exotic pastures and eucalypt (lighter soil) and brigalow (heavier soil) land types. Breeding and growing cattle were grazed under each method. The owners/managers, formally trained in pasture and grazing management, made all management decisions affecting the study sites. Three stocking methods were compared: continuous (with rest), extensive rotation and intensive rotation (commonly referred to as 'cell grazing'). There were two or three stocking methods examined on each property: in total 21 methods (seven continuous, six extensive rotations and eight intensive rotations) were monitored over 74 paddocks, between 2006 and 2009. Pasture and soil surface measurements {{were made in the}} autumns of 2006, 2007 and 2009, while the <b>paddock</b> <b>grazing</b> was analysed from property records for the period from 2006 to 2009. The first 2 years had drought conditions (rainfall average 3. 4 decile) but were followed by 2 years of above-average rainfall. There were no consistent differences between stocking methods across all sites over the 4 years for herbage mass, plant species composition, total and litter cover, or landscape function analysis (LFA) indices. There were large responses to rainfall in the last 2 years with mean herbage mass in the autumn increasing from 1970 kg DM ha(- 1) in 2006 - 07 to 3830 kg DM ha(- 1) in 2009. Over the same period, ground and litter cover and LFA indices increased. Across all sites and 4 years, mean grazing capacity was similar for the three stocking methods. There were, however, significant differences in grazing capacity between stocking methods at four sites but these differences were not consistent between stocking methods or sites. Both the continuous and intensive rotation methods supported the highest average annual grazing capacity at different sites. The results suggest that cattle producers can obtain similar ecological responses and carry similar numbers of livestock under any of the three stocking methods...|$|E

40|$|In my bachelor's thesis I give an {{overview}} of sheep farming and grazing using sheepdogs. In the first part, I focus on rearing sheep [...] especially {{on the characteristics of}} types and breeds reared for profit, on nutrition, housing and grazing. In the second part, I focus on rearing sheepdogs, especially on their characteristics and selected breeds, choice of pups, upbringing, care, and problem behaviour. I have tried to point out the differences in temperament and type of sheepdogs compared with regularly reared dog breeds. Sheep farming has a long tradition in the Czech Republic and remains an important sector of livestock production. The importance of sheep farming lies mainly in the versatile usableness of sheep (meat, milk, wool and by-products, e. g. manure) and, in the recent years, also in ecological farming. Sheep are being reared in sheepfolds or adapted buildings. Sheep are typical grazing animals. There are various grazing systems: set stocking, <b>paddock</b> <b>grazing,</b> strip grazing, and grazing of sheep in combination with other farm animals. To feed sheep, we usually either let them graze or [...] in the winter [...] feed them hay; alternatively we use sillage, high-energy feeds or root crops. There are a large number of breeds of sheep used for grazing. Based on their purpose, we distinguish combined breeds (e. g. Merino, Merinolandschaf, Tsigai), meat- (e. g. Suffolk, Charollais, Texel) and milk-breeds (e. g. East Friesian sheep), and prolific breeds (e. g. Romanov sheep). Both pure breeding and crossbreeding are being used. Together with the return to sheep grazing, breeders are increasingly using sheepdogs for the protection of their herds. A sheepdog can independently guard a herd and its constant presence deters predators, stray dogs and thieves. Sheepdogs live with herds on pastures. The breeds used include Bernese Mountain Dog, Caucasian, Anatolian Shepherd Dog and Central Asian Shepherd Dog. These dogs are strong and massive, confident, and fearless even when facing large predators. These breeds have no tests of performance so we choose pups from litters where the parents work and use their instincts on a daily basis. These dogs have genetic dispositions for guarding and only need time for the development of their skills. Training sheepdogs is therefore focused primarily on managing unwanted behaviour and upbringing near herds of sheep so that the dog can form a strong bond with sheep...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{individual}} paddock performance can assist management decisions {{and contribute to}} improved productivity and profitability of dairy farms. Annual paddock performance is typically assessed by estimating the net herbage accumulation through regular „farm walks,? {{but this is not}} a routine practice on many dairy farms. The aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that automated daily records of milk production could be used in conjunction with the number of cow grazing events to rank paddocks according to their annual net herbage accumulation. This required the assignment of herd milk yield values at AM and PM milkings to the corresponding <b>paddock</b> <b>grazed,</b> along with records of the number of cows present. Automated recording of grazing events was required and achieved using GPS devices on a small number of cows per herd. The minimum requirement of GPS devices was tested by a simulation process to determine suitability for this task. The simulation process identified that three GPS units were required per herd of cows, with each fixing one position per paddock entered. The units needed have a 95 % circular error probable of 6 m (+/- 6 m) or better. Prior to field trials, the DairyNZ Whole Farm Model was used to collect two seasons of data. Milk yield data, number of cows in the herd and <b>paddock</b> <b>grazed</b> were used to test the hypothesis. The number of grazing events for each paddock was a good predictor of the ranking of net herbage accumulation per paddock, with an r value of 0. 92. Prediction using milk yield was also reliable (r = 0. 82). Following the modelling results, a year-long field trial was conducted on a commercial dairy farm between December 2011 and 2012 to further test the hypothesis. All measures of performance had similar spreads of data (> 100 %); however no measures ranked paddocks in a similar order to that of herbage accumulation. Consequently no association was evident between the ranking order of <b>paddocks</b> by <b>grazing</b> events and herbage accumulation, likewise no association between milk production and herbage accumulation. There was a significant association between calculated pasture eaten and herbage accumulation however this method failed to identify the poorest performing paddocks. Two probable reasons that no method accurately ranked paddock performance in terms of herbage accumulation were; the accuracy of estimated herbage accumulation figures and the accuracy of the estimated figures of supplements fed in the paddock and the level of wastage occurring. The extent that pasture management practices and preferences have on dictating the measured performance is also unknown and may have also been a leading factor in the poor correlation. Furthermore, ambiguity surrounds the relationship between daily intake and daily milk production and how long it takes for feed eaten to be harvested as milk. A clearer understanding of why the performance measures do not match is required before they can be used as a proxy for herbage accumulation...|$|R

Cows were allowed to <b>graze</b> inside selected <b>paddocks</b> at monthly periods throughout the fall and winter. For a grazed and ungrazed comparison, grazing exclosures were used inside the <b>grazed</b> <b>paddocks</b> while one paddock was left ungrazed for a control. The use of this design was to determine if grazing had any adverse effects on soil characteristics and at what date and weather conditions did they occur. Also equal portions of the fields went to no tillage and disked soil the following year before soybean planting to compare effects of corn residue grazing on tillage treatments. Soil was analyzed for soil bulk density, moisture, penetration resistance, roughness, texture, and type. Corn crop residues were also collected for yield, cover and composition. The following year, soybeans were harvested using a combine equipped with a yield monitor and global positioning system. Crop residue grazed at the Atlantic site had a decrease in the organic matter yield in <b>grazed</b> <b>paddocks,</b> but no difference in the nutritional quality of residue between <b>grazed</b> and ungrazed <b>paddocks.</b> Soil bulk density data collected from the Atlantic site showed {{a significant difference between the}} 0 - 4 and 4 - 8 inches depths (P 3 ̆c. 01) and tillage treatments (P=. 04) apparently caused by soil types because no tillage treatment was given until the following spring. Bulk density and penetration resistance ratios inside and outside exclosures did not differ between periods grazed indicating there was no effect of grazing on soil compaction. However, there was an effect of grazing period on soil roughness. Like the Atlantic site, crop residue organic matter yields at Chariton decreased over the winter. Unlike the Atlantic site, there was an increase in concentrations of NDF and ADF and a decrease in CP concentration in crop residue for the <b>grazed</b> <b>paddocks</b> over the ungrazed paddocks. Pre-grazing, post-grazing and post-planting corn crop residue cover did not differ between <b>paddocks</b> <b>grazed</b> and ungrazed, but was different between tilled and no tilled plots after soybeans were planted.

40|$|In 2001 (year 1) and 2002 (year 2), {{three blocks}} of five 1 -ac <b>paddocks</b> were <b>grazed</b> by beef cows on hills at the Iowa State University Rhodes Research and Demonstration Farm to {{determine}} the effects of grazing management on phosphorus (P) and sediment runoff from pastureland. Grazing management treatments included an ungrazed control, summer hay harvest with winter stockpiled grazing, grazing by continuous stocking to a residual sward height of 2 in., rotational stocking to a residual sward height of 2 in., and rotational stocking to a residual sward height of 4 in. At four times (late spring, mid-summer, early autumn, and early the subsequent spring) in each year, rainfall simulations were conducted at 6 sites within each paddock and 6 sites in a buffer zone down slope of each paddock. Rainfall simulators dripped at a rate of 2. 8 in. /hr over a 5. 4 - ft 2 area for a period of 1. 5 hours. Runoff was collected and analyzed for total sediment, total P, and total soluble P. Simultaneous to each rainfall simulation, ground cover, penetration resistance, surface roughness, slope, the contents of P and moisture of the soil, sward height and forage mass were measured. Losses of sediment, total P, and total soluble P were greater from <b>grazed</b> <b>paddocks</b> than ungrazed paddocks in year 1. However, in year 2, losses of sediment, total P, and total soluble P from <b>paddocks</b> <b>grazed</b> by rotational stocking to a sward height of 4 in. or harvested as hay during the summer and grazed during winter did not differ from ungrazed paddocks. In both years, losses of sediment, total P, and total soluble P from the buffer area immediately or 30 ft below the paddocks were lower than within the paddocks. Of the physical measurements, the proportion of ground cover was most highly related to sediment loss. Soil Bray- 1 P concentrations did not differ between treatments, but were related to the losses of total and total soluble P. Results imply that sediment and phosphorus losses in pasture runoff may be reduced by managing rotational stocking to maintain adequate sward height and/or using vegetative buffer strips along pasture streams. Such management practices are particularly important in pastures on soils with high P concentrations...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} grazing trials were {{conducted}} on high elevation summer range near Cedar City, Utah. Cattle and sheep were stocked alone and in common in. 4 hectare (ha) paddocks. Stocking rates were. 76 ha/AUM in 1981 and. 60 ha/AUM in 1982. Vegetation measurements were taken before and after grazing treatments to quantify vegetation disappearance. Diet samples were collected from esophageally fistulated sheep in the <b>paddocks</b> before <b>grazing</b> treatments were applied. After a predetermined level of forage utilization was achieved, the paddocks were re-sampled by the esophageally fistulated sheep to examine diets consumed from the forage-reduced vegetation. Behavioral observations were made throughout the trials on sheep grazing alone and with cattle. The length of time sheep spent at a feeding station, feeding station interval, was measured. Sheep ate less grass and more forbs and shrubs than cattle. Cattle showed a strong reluctance to browse snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus) even when the herbaceous vegetation was greatly reduced. Utilization of grasses, forbs and shrubs in the common use paddocks did not represent an average of the utilization by cattle and sheep each grazing alone. Cattle and sheep grazing together used more forage, especially snowberry, than calculated from single use averages. The diets of esophageally fistulated sheep were altered by the various grazing treatments. Diets consumed from previously ungrazed paddocks were higher in forbs, in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and crude protein (CP) and lower in fiber than those diets consumed after <b>paddocks</b> had been <b>grazed.</b> Sheep consumed diets higher in IVOMD but lower in CP in <b>paddocks</b> previously <b>grazed</b> by sheep than where cattle had grazed alone or in commonly <b>grazed</b> <b>paddocks.</b> Sheep selected diets from the remaining herbaceous layer when grazing after sheep but ate mostly snowberry when grazing after cattle. Diets of sheep consumed subsequent to common use grazing were intermediate containing both snowberry and grasses. Sheep adjusted their feeding behavior as the grazing trials progressed by {{increasing the number of}} brief feeding station intervals. This trend was consistent regardless of whether sheep grazed alone or in common with cattle. However, when sheep grazed with cattle, longer feeding station station intervals persisted further into the grazing trials indicating that amounts of acceptable forage per feeding station were not reduced as quickly as when sheep grazed alone...|$|R
40|$|For {{three years}} {{beginning}} in 1999, a 96 -acre field near Atlantic, Iowa {{was used to}} {{study the effects of}} corn residue grazing by beef cows on soil characteristics and soybean yields in subsequent years. Each winter, cows were allowed to graze corn crop residues inside selected paddocks in four sub-fields over five monthly periods. To compare the effects of <b>grazing,</b> one <b>paddock</b> was left as an ungrazed control. At the end of grazing in the spring, soil bulk density, moisture content, and penetration resistance were measured inside and 15 ft outside twelve grazing exclosures in each paddock. Soil surface roughness, texture, and type were also measured in twelve locations in each paddock. Corn crop residues were collected for yield, cover, and composition at the initiation, middle and termination of grazing. Precipitation and soil temperature also were recorded throughout the grazing season. Each following year, soybeans were planted in replicated subfields with disking or no tillage and harvested using a combine equipped with a yield monitor and global positioning system (GPS). Cattle grazing corn crop residue has shown no effect on soil bulk density, but there has been a measurable effect on penetration resistance in <b>paddocks</b> <b>grazed</b> in October and November (P 3 ̆c 0. 05).

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the effect of different livestock grazing treatments on breeding bird densities in a salt marsh habitat. To avoid an experiment on the large scale needed to directly measure grazing effects on bird densities, we followed a two-step approach. First, we measured vegetation micro-patterns (mosaic of lower vegetation and taller patches at 4 × 4 m) around Common Redshank Tringa totanus and Eurasian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus nests and at random sites paired with these nests sites to judge suitability of micro-patterns for nest building. Secondly, we measured micro-patterns at 120 permanent plots in five different experimental grazing treatments to determine how grazing affects micro-patterns. We compared low stocking density of both cattle and of horses, high stocking density of cattle and of horses, and intermittent grazing with a high stocking density of cattle (i. e. yearly intervals of grazing and no grazing). Redshank and Oystercatcher nests occurred in sites with taller vegetation and more pronounced micro-patterns than found at random sites. <b>Paddocks</b> <b>grazed</b> with low densities of livestock or with a high density intermittent grazing treatment had micro-patterns preferred by the birds. We conclude that Redshanks and Oystercatchers may benefit in terms of potential nest sites from grazing at low livestock densities or at intermittent stocking densities through effects of grazing on micro-patterns in the vegetation. ...|$|R

The <b>paddock</b> A was <b>grazed</b> all year round, whereas the <b>paddock</b> B was <b>grazed</b> in spring and autumn and cut in summer for hay. At both paddocks, Lolium perenne, Trifolium repens and Taraxacum sect. Ruderalia dominated the community of total 43 and 47 species (paddock A and B, respectively). Among the sowing species, Lolium perenne, Festuca pratensis, Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra and Trifolium repens increased its cover on both paddocks, while Phleum pratense increased its cover only at paddock B. Lolium multiflorum decreased it cover at both paddocks. Most of arable field weeds disappeared (paddock A) or decreased its cover (paddock B). The cover of herb layer was higher at paddock A than at paddock B, whereas the number of species (N), the diversity (H) and the equitability (J) was higher at paddock B than at paddock A.

30|$|Kangayam {{grassland}} in {{the tropical}} region of south India has been sustainably managed for over {{one hundred and fifty}} years. In a region with meagre rainfall, growing grass is the farmers' main vocation. Between 1855 and 1881, the majority of government 'wastelands' were given on lease to farmers who organized the land into <b>grazing</b> <b>paddocks</b> and fenced with hedges of Balasmodendron berryi. Numerous wells were dug in the grazing lands to provide water for drinking to animals and to some extent for irrigation. Between July and February, the animals are exclusively grazed by rotating between <b>paddocks.</b> The <b>grazing</b> lands are cultivated every 4 to 5 years and sorghum is sown and made into hay for animal feeding between March and June. In several places, the Cenchrus dominated grassland is also sown with legumes like Phaseolus trilobus {{to improve the quality of}} forage. Security of land tenure coupled with technological interventions has sustained the productive capacity of the grassland for over a century. The grassland also has a stable human population and healthy female to male ratio. It offers a model for replication elsewhere under similar low rainfall conditions.|$|R

40|$|Elephantgrass shows a high {{stocking}} rate {{only during the}} rainy season. Forage production is drastically reduced in the dry season. One of the alternatives to minimize this problem is the supplementation with sugarcane plus urea. In this trial the main goal was to estimate the dry matter intake (DMI) of elephantgrass, chopped sugarcane plus 1 % urea and their degradability in three lactating (11. 6 kg/milk/day) rumen fistulated crossbred cows (472 kg/L. W.) grazing elephantgrass during the dry season. The cows had access during three consecutive night to the <b>paddocks</b> <b>grazed</b> every 30 days in a {{stocking rate}}, of 4. 5 cows/hectare. Between the two milking times, cows received chopped sugarcane plus 1 % urea. The DMI was on average 1. 01 %/L. W. for the elephantgrass and 0. 88 %/L. W. for the sugarcane plus 1 % urea. Total DMI, taking into account both roughage and concentrate (2 kg/cow/day) was 2. 25 %/L. W. The effective rumen degradability (ED), considering the rate of passage in the rumen of 5 %/hour was 44. 46 % for elephantgrass and 41. 94 % for sugarcane plus 1 % urea, DM. The elephantgrass ED crude protein was 48. 58 % and its neutral detergent fiber 33. 82 %. During the dry season lactating crossbred cows grazing elephantgrass have to receive a roughage supplement and concentrate to produce around to 12 kg of milk per day...|$|R
40|$|Relatively short grazing {{periods in}} a pure legume pasture {{can be an}} {{alternative}} for increasing animal performance in medium-quality tropical pastures. Thus, {{the aim was to}} evaluate the herbage intake and animal performance of steers grazing dwarf elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv.

Twelve steers (219 ± 28. 8 kg LW) were divided into four groups and assessed during three consecutive grazing cycles, from January to March 2013. The crude protein and neutral detergent fiber contents were 158 and 577 g/kg dry matter (DM) for dwarf elephant grass and 209 and 435 g/kg DM for forage peanut, respectively. The pre-grazing height and leaf mass of dwarf elephant grass and forage peanut were 94 cm and 2782 kg DM/ha and 15 cm and 1751 kg DM/ha, respectively. The herbage intake (mean = 2. 7 ± 0. 06 % LW) and average daily weight gain (mean = 1. 16 ± 0. 31 kg/day) were similar for both treatments.
