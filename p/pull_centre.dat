50|$|There {{are four}} common types of cold chisels. These are the flat chisel, {{the most widely}} known type, {{which is used to}} cut bars and rods to reduce {{surfaces}} and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and <b>pulling</b> over <b>centre</b> punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.|$|R

40|$|Part 4 : Project Management, Engineering Management, and Quality ManagementInternational audienceFor many {{globally}} dispersed organisations, {{the home}} base (HB) {{is a historic}} locus of integrative and coordinating efforts that safeguard overall performance. However, the dynamism of global operations networks is increasingly <b>pulling</b> the <b>centre</b> of gravity away from the HB and dispersing it across the network, challenging the HB’s ability to sustain its centrality over time. To counteract this tendency, this paper addresses {{the gap in the}} literature regarding the development of the network management capability of the HB within the context of its network. Data was collected through a retrospective longitudinal case study of an intra-organisational operations network of one OEM and its three foreign subsidiaries. The findings suggest a row of strategic roles and corresponding managerial capabilities, which the HB needs to develop depending on the changing subsidiaries’ competencies and HB-subsidiary relationships...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{increasing}} competition and internationalization, many Western European cities have invested in exhibition facilities. Surprisingly, many new exhibition centres emerge in the urban periphery. An assessment of the 34 largest exhibition centres in Western Europe shows that only 16 are still centrally located while 18 now have a peripheral location. This is a drastic break from the traditional location of these centres in inner city cores. Behind this observation of spatial change is {{a complex set of}} dilemmas about investments in current or new locations. A fresh analytical model (based on assumptions of path dependency) is constructed and employed to analyse time and place specific determinants and opportunities. Two contrasting cases are selected in comparable German cities. Frankfurt decided to renew its facilities in the centre of the city, whereas Munich opened a relocated exhibition centre in 1998. Based on these case studies, the paper concludes that there is no autonomous force <b>pulling</b> exhibition <b>centres</b> towards the periphery, but it is rather a misfit between the central location and new physical, functional, spatial, and institutional demands that causes a facility to move...|$|R

50|$|The WTO Conference {{commenced}} {{at around}} 3:00 p.m. Hong Kong time. The protests were largely peaceful throughout. The demonstrations started with around one hundred Koreans {{jumping into the}} Victoria Harbour to try to swim to the Conference and Exhibition Centre where the talks were being held. Police in boats prevented the Koreans from swimming to the Convention <b>Centre,</b> <b>pulled</b> {{them out of the}} water, provided them with emergency heat blankets, and brought them back to the central area. Then the activists approached the police force with a burning coffin, and conflicts broke out. In less than five minutes, the police began to use pepper spray to dispel the activists. Nine people were injured, including two police and Legislative Council councillor Leung Kwok Hung. The majority of protesters were peaceful, though, chanting slogans and playing instruments. A group invited into the talks protested during an opening speech. John Tsang, Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology said that he was displeased that the protests had involved violence.|$|R

40|$|Pastoral {{nomadism}} {{as a way}} of life is {{no longer}} as prevalent as it once was, but it is still an important phenomenon in the Middle East. In the last few decades, the rate of sedentarization among nomads has increased as a result of technological progress in agriculture and pastoralism, as well as political, social, ecological, and economic factors. This study focuses on the Qashqa'i nomads of Iran and their migration as an example for the Middle East. It deals with both nomadic and sedentary Qashqa'i people and examines the causes and consequences of their migration. Push-pull theory, is used as an analytical framework for the research. As a part of the methodology, logit models are employed in statistical analysis. A survey questionnaire was administered in order to develop a comprehensive picture of nomadic people at the places of origin and destination. The research attempts to generate several 'general profiles' of nomads depending upon their location [...] either at the place of origin or at the place of destination. These profiles can be used to increase understanding of the causes and consequences of Qashqa'i migration, as well as the processes of cultural change which occur when nomadic people 'settle' in urban areas. For the Qashqa'i the major economic, social, and environmental push factors are poverty, lack of educational institutions, and hardship of climate. The main <b>pull</b> factors are <b>centred</b> around their desire to improve educational, job, and accessibility criteria. The research also revealed that Qashqa'i culture is slowly adapting to urban ways. An examination of public migration policy shows that a more systematic approach is needed to questions of inter- and intra-regional development and migration issues...|$|R
40|$|I {{present an}} organic {{description}} of the regimes of collisionless tidal streams and define the orderings between the physical quantities that shape their morphology. Three fundamental dichotomies are identified {{in the form of}} dimensionless inequalities. These govern i) the speed of the stream's growth, ii) its internal coherence, iii) its thickness or opening angles. The mechanisms that regulate such main properties are analysed. The slope of the host's density profile influences the speed of the stream's growth, in both length and width, as steeper profiles enhance differential streaming. Internal coherence is the requirement for the appearance of substructure in tidal debris, and I concentrate on the `feathering' typical of GC streams. Overdensities are associated with minima in the relative streaming velocity of the stream members. For streams with high circularity, these are caused by the epicyclic oscillations of stars; however, for highly non-circular progenitor's orbits, substructure is caused by the oscillating differences in energy and actions with which material is shed at different orbital phases of the progenitor. This modulation results in different streaming speeds: the streakline of material shed between two successive apocentric passages is folded along its length, <b>pulled</b> at its <b>centre</b> by the faster streaming of particles released near pericenter, which are therefore more widely scattered. When the stream is coherent enough, this mechanism is potentially capable of generating a bimodal profile in the density distributions of the longer wraps of more massive progenitors, which I dub `bifurcations'. The conditions for internal coherence are explored and I comment on the cases of Palomar 5, Willman 1, the Anticenter and Sagittarius' streams. Analytical methods are accompanied by numerical experiments, performed using a purposely built generative model, also presented here. Comment: 18 pages, submitted to MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Wild species {{related to}} {{agricultural}} crops make agricultural systems {{around the world}} more resilient. Crop wild relatives (CWR) represent the largest pool of genetic diversity from which to draw when new variation for desired traits is required in domesticated varieties. They contribute towards {{the development of new}} crop varieties, particularly those adapted to predicted climate change scenarios. Although CWR are generally inedible, are not used for fuel or fodder, and very few have documented medicinal properties, they support global food production systems from behind the scenes. Placing an economic value on their contributions has had the effect of <b>pulling</b> CWR onto <b>centre</b> stage, and wild species are in fact beginning to garner international attention. The {{question is whether or not}} estimating their value in terms of the development of new varieties adequately represents their total value, and in particular the adaptive capacity they provide to agroecosystems. What are the implications of exclusively measuring their direct use value? This thesis explores the space where agrobiodiversity, climate change, advanced crop breeding and economics meet in order to address this question. Two distinct but related research questions are discussed in sequence. The first asks: to what extent are CWR being used today within crop improvement programs under the auspices Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) ? The main findings are that CWR are being used to a greater extent today than ever before, and that a positive trend is likely to continue in light of both technological advancements and intensifying environmental pressures. Research findings are relevant to the conservation community advocating for increased investment and will help inform policy decisions involving trade-offs and priority setting among conservation objectives. The second question arises in light on the first: what are the implications of increased use of CWR in breeding? Implications include increased conservation investment and an emerging conservation paradigm that is focused exclusively on facilitating future use of selected species closely related to socio-economically important crops rather than the breadth of diversity that exists today. This diversity is threatened with extinction by range of environmental and anthropogenic forces. The positive feedback between use and conservation will continue to the extent that required genetic variation is available. This thesis argues that increased use will likely not incite sufficient levels of conservation. Conservation is a reflection of the way humans value biodiversity. CWR are valued for their instrumental use in crop breeding but less so for the resilience they lend to agroecosystems, and not at all for their intrinsic value. Understanding the dynamic between valuation and conservation is useful for making projections into the future and will help inform course corrections at the relatively early stage of the conservation investment game. Policy recommendations stem from a greater recognition of the resilience value provided by the breadth of CWR diversity, agrobiodiversity more broadly defined, and the importance of conserving it both in situ and ex situ. The availability of genetic variation for agricultural crops in the long term and by extension any meaningful contributions towards achieving sustained food production, depend upon it...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{areas are}} {{changing}} – a population turnaround was first {{identified in the}} 1970 ’s (Beale 1975). Since that time more and more research has uncovered the numbers and types of people moving into rural areas (Boyle 1995, Boyle and Halfacree 1998, Bolton and Chalkley 1998) {{and the impact of}} this migration (Bell 1994 Cloke and Goodwin 1992). Keeble and Tyler (1995) began to address the economic capacity of in-migrants highlighting that many rural businesses are owned by in-migrants. Stockdale, Short and Findlay (1999) identified that on average for each self-employed in-migrant 2. 4 jobs are created. In recent years the policy focus on rural areas has centred on endogenous development, Stockdale (2006) argues in-migrants are essential for this approach to be successful. This research has combined literature from migration studies, with entrepreneurship literature, to examine the economic activity choices of in-migrants; with a particular focus on self-employment. Migration studies focus on where people choose to migrate to and the impact they then have on the area. Entrepreneurship literature focuses on the types of people who chose to become self-employed and the impact of various factors on their decision making. This research has utilised concepts from both literature sources to examine lifetime migrant’s economic activity in rural areas (defined under the ONS rural – urban classification). Powys and Gwynedd are two local authority areas in rural Wales that have interesting economic and migration patterns. They were selected as study areas as they represent areas of varying degrees of inward migration, self-employment, accessibility to major transport networks and levels of Welsh speaking. This research charts the economic activity of households across these local authorities in order to understand what impact individual, household and area level influences have on in-migrants economic activity. A postal survey of 597 households in the case study areas was used to explore the research questions; ‘what are the differences in the current economic activity of migrants and non-migrants in rural labour markets in Wales; and why do these differences exist?’ The conclusions of this research make three key contributions to knowledge: 1. 	In-migrants and non-migrants in the case study areas selected have broadly similar levels of economic activity rates. There are no statistically significant differences in economic activity choices between the two groups. 2. 	Some in-migrants (at similar levels to non-migrants) become self-employed and start a business. These businesses are often different to that of non-migrants, they tend to be largely based from home and prefer to employ family members. 3. 	Many in-migrants do not move into rural areas with the intention of becoming self-employed this is mobilised often up to a decade after the move. The findings of this research {{play a key role in}} understanding why in-migrants make the economic activity choices they do in rural areas. – Through a combination of push and <b>pull</b> factors that <b>centre</b> on the individual (age, nationality, employment history), the household (household structure, tenure) and the area (labour market, levels of Welsh speaking) in-migrants make economic activity choices that for some, result in self-employment. The businesses created by in-migrants differ slightly from that of non-migrant owned businesses. In-migrant owned businesses are most likely to be based from or closer to home than non-migrants. They often employ family member and tend to be younger than non-migrant owned businesses. They do not appear more likely to create jobs than non-migrant owned businesses. This is an important finding given the importance of in-migrant owned rural businesses in much recent rural debate (Bosworth 2008, Bosworth 2010, Stockdale 2006) ...|$|R
