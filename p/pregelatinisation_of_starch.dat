In the case of surface tension and conductivity, it is observed that the starch nanoparticles can lower the surface tension between water and gas and have a very weak effect on the conductivity.

40|$|Starch {{is a type}} of carbohydrate, {{consumed}} within foods or added into foods {{after being}} isolated from its source. It also can be modified and then added into food products. One of the modifications <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> cross-linking, improves its thickening properties. Starch is modified not only for food but also industrial purposes. The concept <b>of</b> incorporating <b>starch</b> into plastic products also requires modification <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> because <b>of</b> its negative effects on water absorption and solubility of starch-plastic composite. ^ Cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> in a batch system takes a long time and requires a drying process. Cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> by reactive extrusion can reduce reaction time and eliminate the need for a drying process. The objectives of this study were to cross-link starch with phosphorus in an extruder, thereby reducing water absorption and solubility <b>of</b> <b>starch.</b> ^ In the first part, starch was extruded with water, 0. 2 M sodium hydroxide and 2. 5 % sodium trimetaphosphate. The effects of moisture content of the feed and screw speed of the extruder on mean residence time, phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> water absorption index, and water solubility index <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> were examined. Cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> with incorporated phosphorus, was confirmed by paste viscosity measurement.

Cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> with 0. 2 M sodium hydroxide and 2. 5 % sodium trimetaphosphate reduced the water solubility index but did not reduce the water absorption index significantly. ^ In the second part, starch was extruded with higher concentrations of sodium hydroxide and sodium trimetaphosphate.

In a reconstitution study, replacement <b>of</b> insoluble <b>starch</b> with soluble starch decreased the viscosity of pastes and reduced the stickiness of gels. Rice amylopectin fine structure was found to significantly correlate with paste breakdown. Proportion of long chains of amylopectin was negatively correlated and proportion of short chains positively correlated with paste breakdown. Influences <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) and other granule-associated proteins on rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pastes and gels were studied using a normal and three isogenic waxy (a waxy null and two GBSS-containing waxy mutants) maize starches. Starch granule-associated proteins, especially GBSS, reduced paste breakdown and viscosity <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pastes. The viscoelasticity of pastes and gels was greatly reduced as more starch-granule-associated proteins were removed. Light microscopy of pastes suggested that starch granule-associated proteins influence the rheology of pastes through increasing the rigidity <b>of</b> gelatinized <b>starch</b> granules. The study indicated that starch granule-associated proteins, especially GBSS, can significantly change the rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pastes and gels despite its low concentration in <b>starch</b> pastes. Location <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granule-associated proteins was revealed using a protein specific dye with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Starch granule-associated proteins {{were found to be}} concentrated in internal concentric rings in potato, maize, and wheat <b>starches.</b> Observation <b>of</b> granule proteins at different optical depths of field showed that proteins were distributed in discrete spheres. Amylose-free potato and waxy corn starch granules showed no internal protein spheres, indicating that the protein spheres are composed of GBSS and are likely associated with location of amylose. GBSS was also found to be strongly associated with isolated gelatinized granule remnants of normal potato, maize and wheat starches while virtually no protein was found in remnants of amylose-free potato and waxy maize starch. Starch granule-associated proteins, including GBSS, were found to be partially lost during alkaline extraction <b>of</b> rice <b>starch.</b> Variation in amount of loss in GBSS and other granule-associated proteins was found among different rice lines.

40|$|Abstract Background Starch is the {{principle}} constituent of potato tubers and is of considerable importance for food and non-food applications. Its metabolism has been subject of extensive research over the past decades. Despite its importance, {{a description of the}} complete inventory of genes involved in starch metabolism and their genome organization in potato plants is still missing. Moreover, mechanisms regulating the expression <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> genes in leaves and tubers remain elusive with regard to differences between transitory and storage starch metabolism, respectively. This study aimed at identifying and mapping the complete set <b>of</b> potato <b>starch</b> genes, and to study their expression pattern in leaves and tubers using different sets of transcriptome data. Moreover, we wanted to uncover transcription factors co-regulated with starch accumulation in tubers in order to get insight into the regulation <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> metabolism. Results We identified 77 genomic loci encoding enzymes involved in starch metabolism. Novel isoforms of many enzymes were found. Their analysis will help to elucidate mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> biosynthesis and degradation. Expression analysis <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> genes led to the identification of tissue-specific isoenzymes suggesting differences in the transcriptional regulation <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> metabolism between potato leaf and tuber tissues. Selection of genes predominantly expressed in developing potato tubers and exhibiting an expression pattern indicative for a role in starch biosynthesis enabled the identification of possible transcriptional regulators <b>of</b> tuber <b>starch</b> biosynthesis by co-expression analysis.

Compared to native starch, the RS content <b>of</b> heat-moisture treated <b>starches</b> increased significantly. The RS level of HMT- 20 was the highest <b>of</b> all the <b>starches.</b> Birefringence was displayed clear at the center <b>of</b> native <b>starch.</b> For HMT starches, pronounced birefringence was exhibited on the periphery <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules; however, birefringence disappeared at the centre <b>of</b> some <b>starch</b> granules. The shape <b>of</b> HMT <b>starches</b> hadn’t been changed and the integrity <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules was preserved for all the conditions. Concavity could be observed on HMT starches under scanning electronic microscopy. After HMT, apparent amylose contents were increased and starch macromolecule was degraded in comparison with those <b>of</b> native <b>starch.</b> There was a reduction in swelling power on HMT starches, but the solubility <b>of</b> HMT <b>starches</b> was higher than that <b>of</b> native <b>starch.</b> Both <b>of</b> native and HMT starches showed A-type X-ray diffraction pattern. Furthermore, there is a higher intensity {{at the peak of}} 15. 0 and 22. 9 Å than those <b>of</b> native <b>starch.</b> Keywords—resistant starch, mung bean (Phaseolus radiatus) starch, heat-moisture treatment, physicochemical properties I...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that part <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> is resistant to human amylases and escapes undigested to large bowel. This fraction <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> is resistant starch. Recent {{studies have shown that}} resistant starch may be a substrate for bacterial flora of the colon and serves as prebiotic.
