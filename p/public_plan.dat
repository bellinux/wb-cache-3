5|$|The Students' Building was {{designed}} by the New York City architecture firm of McKim, Mead & White, representing their only project at Vassar College. The plans were drawn up by young architect Joseph Herenden Clark, a recent graduate of the Columbia School of Architecture who, upon hearing the requirement that the structure be made from brick with white trim and a slate roof, recalled Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia. Clark had studied Christ Church, which George Washington attended, during his days at Columbia. He trekked to Alexandria to study the interior and exterior {{of the church and}} ultimately the designs for the Students' Building, his first <b>public</b> <b>plan,</b> were inspired by its architecture and features. Bishop and Company were contracted to construct the Students' Building, an example of the Southern colonial revival style. It sits on the north edge of campus due south of the college's North Gate and southeast of residential quad dorms like Lathrop House. Noyes House was built in 1958 and rests immediately to the southeast of the Students' Building.|$|E

40|$|In several states, <b>public</b> pension <b>plans</b> {{are at risk}} of {{insolvency}} {{within a}} decade. These risks are significant, and the solutions currently contemplated are likely to fall short of what is necessary to contain the problem. If <b>public</b> pension <b>plans</b> do become insolvent, it seems likely the federal government will bail them out. This Article proposes that the federal government prepare for the prospect of federal financial support of <b>public</b> pension <b>plans</b> by instituting an optional regulatory regime for public pensions. If a state elects not to participate, its <b>public</b> pension <b>plans</b> would be ineligible for federal financial support. In states that do elect to participate, <b>public</b> <b>plans</b> would be eligible for federal financial support in the event of severe financial distress. All <b>public</b> <b>plans</b> in these states would be subject to a federal regulatory regime similar to ERISA, including minimum funding requirements. Congress could also authorize sponsors of regulated plans to revise existing employees’ retirement benefits with respect to future services, an option that is available to private employers. This flexibility would allow for much more significant pension reforms on {{the state and local level}} since in many states pension reforms can only alter the benefits of new hire...|$|R
