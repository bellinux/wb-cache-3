40|$|Early adopters of {{advanced}} in-vehicle technologies (Adaptive Cruise Control, night vision, <b>park</b> <b>aid,</b> and navigation systems) were interviewed {{in an effort}} to assess the extent to which drivers come to understand the performance capabilities and limitations of these types {{of advanced}} systems, and to understand how systems are influencing driver behavior (modifying behavior in potentially positive or negative ways). Despite access to a wide array of information about their in-vehicle system, responses to knowledge-based questions about the systems themselves suggest that key information was not necessarily acquired nor understood by a large number of drivers. Many drivers held misconceptions about the performance capabilities of their advanced systems, suggesting that drivers’ mental models of how these systems function and perform do not always match reality. For example, 99 % of ACC system owners did not know that the system ignores stopped vehicles. Similarly, 41 % of <b>park</b> <b>aid</b> system owners did not know that the system warning is tied solely on the distance to objects and {{does not take into account}} their closing speed. Self-reported data also provided evidence of behavioral adaptations. Results suggest that additional efforts are needed to increase driver understanding of how these systems operate, particularly for safety-related aspects...|$|R

In the first study, twenty participants rated the perceived urgency of 6 warning tone pulse rates ranging from 1 to 8 Hz and a solid tone. The results indicated a strong differentiation of perceived urgency between the 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 4 Hz, and 6 Hz pulse rates. The majority of participants perceived the 6 Hz and higher rates as very urgent. The second study examined 6 tone frequencies ranging from 500 Hz- 1500 Hz.

30|$|The use of {{innovative}} driver support systems in vehicles (e.g., collision warning, <b>parking</b> <b>aid,</b> and lane keeping systems) is increasing rapidly and the systems {{are becoming more}} and more advanced. Due to a more complex in-vehicle environment (e.g., navigation system, mobile phone), there is an increased risk of distracting the driver from the driving task. Existing driver support systems frequently utilize auditory information and may to some extent exclude drivers with hearing loss. Thus, due to the low level of knowledge in the field of hearing and transport, there is a need to describe the population of road users with hearing loss and their limitations and needs with respect to safe mobility. This study is the first step of a project initiated at VTI regarding hearing loss, traffic safety and mobility and the purpose is to compare how individuals, with and without hearing loss, experience safety and mobility in transport situations.|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of new vehicles are being equipped with backup proximity sensors. These sensors detect the presence and proximity of objects in the pathway of the reversing vehicle and warn the driver through an audible signal. This report investigates the performance capabilities and potential safety effectiveness of these systems in reducing the risks to small children and other pedestrians from reversing vehicles. These sensor systems are primarily designed and marketed as parking aids. However, some are being promoted as safety systems {{with the potential to}} reduce or prevent collisions with pedestrians, especially small children. The performance capabilities of six commercial reversing aid systems were evaluated in laboratory tests. Four systems were fitted to the vehicles as standard equipment. Two systems were purchased from aftermarket companies and installed on the test vehicles. All six systems used ultrasonic sensor technology. Laboratory tests consisted of 3 -dimensional mapping of the detection zones, the system response time, and the effects of dust / dirt on sensor performance. In terms of detection area performance, <b>parking</b> <b>aid</b> systems sacrificed detection distance and height in order to suppress false or nuisance alarms. The durability and reaction time results revealed there were no substantial performance differences between the systems. The safety benefits of these devices were then estimated based on these test results...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of vehicles on the road {{goes hand in hand}} with a rising number of traffic related accidents. As such there is a requirement to increase the level of safety provided to both the driver and other road users alike. The ultimate goal would be to realise autonomous vehicles on today’s roads. However few companies are able to provide a fully-fledged autonomous vehicle. That said many manufacturers are able to supply various advanced driver assistance systems in order to increase both the safety level and performance of the vehicle. Currently many different assistance systems are available that utilise a range of sensors, with great variation in cost. Not all vehicles have all sensors fitted, though there has been wide market acceptance of the ultrasonic <b>parking</b> <b>aid.</b> This sensor is low cost and also benefits from an ease of retrofitting, where not fitted as standard. Ultrasonic sensors however can only provide short range distance measurement and as such their uses are limited. This thesis takes ideas from CTFM ultrasound used in mobile robotics and applies them to low costs ultrasonic sensors found in the automotive industry, with the intention to provide additional functionality. In particular the specific challenge of driving surface recognition is considered. The experimental methods for data collection are presented alongside the classification techniques used. This thesis shows that low cost narrowband ultrasonic transducers can be used as an input for the classification of driving surfaces...|$|E
