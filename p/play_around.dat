5|$|Kan'ami Kiyotsugu {{and his son}} Zeami Motokiyo brought Noh to what is {{essentially}} its present-day form during the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573). Kan'ami was a renowned actor with great versatility fulfilling roles from graceful women and 12-year-old boys to strong adult males. When Kan'ami first presented his work to 17-year-old Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was a child actor in his <b>play,</b> <b>around</b> age 12. Yoshimitsu {{fell in love with}} Zeami and his position of favor at court caused Noh to be performed frequently for Yoshimitsu thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Mikan {{became so}} {{dominant}} that the NBA {{had to change}} its rules of play {{in order to reduce}} his influence, such as widening the lane from six to twelve feet ("The Mikan Rule"). He also {{played a role in the}} introduction of the shot clock; and in the NCAA, his dominating <b>play</b> <b>around</b> the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending. Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA's future, which would be dominated by tall, powerful players.|$|E

5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and {{expected}} the Rovers to <b>play</b> <b>around</b> them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that {{made it difficult for}} the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E
5|$|White's sophomore {{season with}} the Golden Gophers began as a disappointment. He did not record his first goal until the last weekend of November in the Golden Gophers' fourteenth game of the season. However, White quickly turned his <b>play</b> <b>around,</b> scoring four goals in the Golden Gophers' next ten games, {{including}} the game-winning goal 1:38 into overtime at the 2009 Dodge Holiday Classic to lead the Golden Gophers to a 3–2 victory over Northeastern University.

He finished the 2009–10 season with nine goals and eight assists in thirty-nine games for the Golden Gophers.|$|E
5|$|In August and September 2006, Streep starred onstage at The Public Theater's {{production}} of Mother Courage and Her Children at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park. The Public Theater production {{was a new}} translation by playwright Tony Kushner (Angels in America), with songs in the Weill/Brecht style written by composer Jeanine Tesori (Caroline, or Change); veteran director George C. Wolfe was at the helm. Streep starred alongside Kevin Kline and Austin Pendleton in this three-and-a-half-hour <b>play.</b> <b>Around</b> the same time, Streep, along with Lily Tomlin, portrayed the last two members {{of what was once}} a popular family country music act in Robert Altman's final film A Prairie Home Companion (2006). A comedic ensemble piece featuring Lindsay Lohan, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline and Woody Harrelson, the film revolves around the behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film grossed more than US$26million, the majority of which came from domestic markets.|$|E

25|$|Bräde or svenskt brädspel ("Swedish tables") is {{a variant}} played in Sweden. Players starts with all 15 of their {{checkers}} on opposite {{corners of the}} board, and <b>play</b> <b>around</b> counter-clockwise. Besides bearing off, {{there are several other}} ways to win, such as arranging all of one's checkers in certain pre-determined patterns, or by hitting so many checkers that one's opponent can not bring them in again. Additional points are awarded for a victory while one's opponent has checkers on the bar. Brädspel is played without the doubling cube. Interest in brädspel experienced a resurgence following the recovery of a 17th-century board from the wreck of the Vasa.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Brennan is the Terriers {{head coach}} {{with the highest}} winning {{percentage}} {{and he was also}} elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975. Brennan helped make the Terriers into a popular team during New York City's Basketball glory days of the 1940s and 50s. Due to their popularity the Terriers would <b>play</b> <b>around</b> 2 or 3 games a year at Madison Square Garden and the Terrier's were one of the few programs hosting big Division I games in Brooklyn at the Park Slope Armory, their home court. Brennan's 1942 squad averaged 59 points per game, which was quite high during those years. The Terriers also had the first college player to score 20 or more points at Madison Square Garden, Vincent T. Agoglia. He did it twice in the 1941–1942 season, first against LaSalle College of Philadelphia. Brennan ended his head coaching career with a 90–46 (66.2%) record over 7 seasons.|$|E
25|$|A centre forward (main striker) has the key task {{of scoring}} goals {{and for this}} reason acts as {{the focal point of the}} {{majority}} of attacking play by a team. As such, how well a striker is performing tends to be measured purely on goals scored despite the fact that they may be contributing in other ways to a team's success. A traditional centre forward was required to be tall in height and strong physically in order to be able to win the ball in the area from crosses and attempt to score with either their feet or head, or to knock the ball down for a teammate to score. Whilst these assets are still an advantage, in the modern game speed and movement are also required as there is more interplay when attacking. In a 4–4–2 or 4–4–1–1 formation the centre forward is often paired with a second striker who may <b>play</b> <b>around</b> him or in a slightly withdrawn role respectively, though it is not unknown to play two recognised centre forwards.|$|E

A staff writer for Portrait Magazine stated that [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was {{a great way to}} end Teenage Dream and that it showcases the singer's voice quite well, as she has [...] "lyrics to work for instead of ones to just <b>play</b> <b>around</b> with."

500|$|According to Brungardt, the {{recording}} of the project's earlier songs, [...] "Heart Attack", was critical in their decision for the album. The song was recorded during Saadiq's break from touring for The Way I See It and had originally featured that album's sound, {{with which they were}} not satisfied. When they revisited the song, Saadiq reconstructed the original recording after stripping track's individually recorded instrument parts, {{with the exception of the}} vocals and some of its drums. In an interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt said of their approach, [...] "We wanted to evolve the songs, and I wanted to evolve the engineering, as well. On The Way I See It, everything was pretty much tube pre's and tube compressors. On this one, I wanted to <b>play</b> <b>around</b> with some of the more solid-state gear".|$|E
500|$|Internationalist was {{recorded}} at Melbourne's Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by American producer Nick DiDia {{for the first}} time. As the band had already prepared [...] "about 30 or 40" [...] songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. Bassist John Collins said of DiDia; [...] "Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was {{that he wanted to}} record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didn't want to <b>play</b> <b>around</b> too much." [...] As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was mixed by DiDia soon after. [...] Powderfinger used the extra time to play table tennis, which was the band's recreation of choice during the Internationalist and Odyssey Number Five recording sessions.|$|E

PC Gamer, when reviewing the first game, commented on the fact that players will likely experience familiarity with the setting due to restaurants such as Chuck E. Cheese's. They also noted that while [...] "the AI isn't some masterwork of procedural unpredictability, it would [...] head straight to you and eat your face off, or it'll <b>play</b> <b>around</b> like an innocent child before closing in for the kill.
