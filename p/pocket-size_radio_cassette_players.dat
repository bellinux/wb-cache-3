25|$|The blast {{fragments}} included {{parts of}} a <b>radio</b> <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> and {{a small piece of}} circuit board. This rang alarm bells within the intelligence communities in Britain, the U.S., and West Germany, as the West German police had recovered a Semtex bomb hidden inside a Toshiba <b>radio</b> <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> in an apartment in Neuss, West Germany, in October 1988, two months before PA 103 exploded. The bomb, one of five, had been in the possession of members of the Damascus–based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC), led by Ahmed Jibril, a former Syrian army captain. Feraday travelled to West Germany to examine this bomb, and though he found that the Lockerbie fragments did not precisely match the Toshiba model, they were similar enough for him to contact Toshiba. With the company's help, DERA discovered there were seven models in which the printed circuit board bore exactly the same details as the Lockerbie fragments.|$|R

25|$|Using {{the damage}} to {{adjacent}} container AVN7511 to guide them, the investigators concluded that the explosion had occurred about 13inches (330mm) {{from the floor of}} AVE4041 and about 25inches (640mm) from the skin of the fuselage. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigators then conducted a series of tests in the United States, at which Alan Feraday of Britain's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) is understood to have been present. The tests involved using metal containers loaded with luggage, and detonating plastic explosive within Toshiba <b>radio</b> <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> in garment-filled suitcases, so as to replicate the sooting and pitting pattern of AVE4041.

John Bedford, one of Pan Am's loader-drivers at Heathrow, was able to give evidence about the precise location within PA 103 of the baggage container, as well as the location of suitcases inside it, all of which helped investigators piece together how the bomb suitcase came to be there.

40|$|AIDS {{remains a}} major problem in Kenya, and it is often women and girls who bear the brunt of the pandemic. They have no rights to own {{property}} such as land, and are physiologically at greater risk of catching HIV/AIDS. They are generally less well educated and only a handful are employed, and so are socio-economically more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infection. Many women also suffer from malnutrition. To help address these problems, the Kenya AIDS Intervention Prevention Project Group (KAIPPG) has established community-based informal learning centres, called nutritional field schools, in six of its 28 project sites in western Kenya. Each field school caters for 30 participants, giving priority to orphans, widows, low-income women and older vulnerable children from HIV/AIDS affected households. The participants are taught about nutrition, and receive training in relevant skills and techniques to enable them to care for people living with AIDS, to maximize crop yields and, generally, to become economically and socially empowered. Using the GenARDIS grant, KAIPPG organized a health and agriculture community radio network for women who had completed the training. The participants were organized into six radio listening groups, and were trained in the use of audio and video recording equipment to enable them to exchange information such as on farming techniques, and to raise public awareness about HIV/AIDS. The groups were also trained in photography and the use of drama and traditional oral storytelling as tools for learning, education and development. A <b>radio</b> <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> and a mobile phone was distributed to each of the groups, and the participants were encouraged to communicate with national FM radio stations - to respond to programmes, obtain information, and share their experiences with a wider audience. Each group prepared and recorded on tape a presentation, song, poem, role-play or story on a relevant topic of their choice. One women´s group, for example, performed a play about farming and the preparation of nutritious food for people living with HIV/AIDS. Another group sang traditional songs on planting, harvesting and the preparation of sweet potatoes. The tapes were then exchanged among the groups so that each group was able to learn about the work of the others. Each group also set up an information kiosk stocked with the tapes they had produced and other information. KAIPPG hopes to translate the tapes into English and French, and to release the content also on diskettes and CD-ROM. mailto:kaippg@africaonline. co. ke James Onyango is executive director of a target=_new href=[URL] KAIPPG, an NGO that works in rural communities of Kenya {{to address the problem of}} HIV/AIDS using an holistic approach.
