40|$|A new {{section of}} main road Route Nationale 7 has been under {{construction}} since 2007 between La Pacaudiere and Changy (Loire, France). This new way is 8 km long and goes across fine soils, essentially plastic clay and clay-sand. This clay-sand had {{to be treated with}} 1 % lime and 5. 5 % cement in order to build a capping layer of 40 cm. The top of the embankments had to be treated with lime to get a EV 2 modulus over 35 MPa. At the beginning of the roadwork, the clay-sand was put on a special area to be homogenized and treated with 1 % lime. After then, the building company proposed another technical solution to build the capping layer : using a hydraulic binder instead of cement and increasing the mechanical performances of the top of the embankments (EV 2 over 50 MPa), to reduce the thickness of the capping layer to 35 cm. A trial was made in 2008 to compare both solutions. After treatment and compaction, the measurements by gamma densitometer with two probes showed that the average compaction rate {{at the bottom of the}} layer was 92 % for the project solution and 98 % for the building company solution. This last solution was accepted because compaction rate must be over 96 % at the bottom of the layer. Unfortunately, the laboratory study showed that the soil treated with the hydraulic binder had bad mechanical performances in case of less compaction or less moisture content. The building company, on the advice of LRPC from Lyon, has made the layer with high performance working machines such as an in-situ moistening machine, a <b>pulvimixer</b> and powerful compactors. Results of daily moisture content and gamma densitometer tests showed that the realisation objectives had been reached. Moreover, diametral compression tests showed that mechanical performances had been reached too...|$|E
