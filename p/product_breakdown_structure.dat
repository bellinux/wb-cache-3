50|$|Specifying the {{importance}} of the project, Project Initiation Documentation identifies that it is the contract between the project management and sponsor. The aim of PID is understanding the premises of the project. The correct format of PID represents the understanding of the background, objectives and benefits. A good project manager is not only interested in delivering an output or a capability to their customer, but interested in the wider context and the benefits that this capability will ultimately bring about. PID identifies what is in scope within the project with the use of flow diagrams and <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structures.</b> The pivotal role plays the identification of responsibilities, which implies roles of project manager, team leader, sponsor, supplier, user representative, stakeholders and members of steering committee.|$|R

40|$|Many shipyards {{today have}} made {{technological}} changes to their production facilities {{over the past}} decades. However, the building methodology has remained the same. Implementing a lean manufacturing approach to shipyards requires analysis of the present shipyard facilities. Likewise, the lean compliance level needs to be measured. After this, the steps for lean transformation are determined. In this work, {{a case study of}} a shipyard with a traditional panel-block assembly process is transformed to a lean one which follows one piece fl ow. The integration of group technology, a <b>product</b> work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (PWBS) and lean manufacturing yields optimal results illustrated through risk analysis. This is best demonstrated through the analysis of man-hours in assembling a typical shipbuilding block ready for erection...|$|R

50|$|The Product {{flow diagram}} (PFD) is a {{graphical}} {{representation of the}} order by which a sequence of products is created according to Product based planning principles. It {{is related to the}} <b>Product</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (PBS).|$|E
5000|$|Product-based {{planning}} {{is intended to}} ensure that all of the necessary products are identified and captured, and begins by identifying a <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> which is then repeatedly refined until all of the requisite products are identified. The PBS is thus a hierarchical family tree of all the products and sub-products that comprise the final end-product.|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) {{requires a}} design process {{that involves the}} design of aircraftâ€™s components such as fuselage, wing, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer, ailerons, elevators, tail, and wing. The process takes a long time. Therefore, the distribution of structural works based on their characteristics and classifications by considering their design attributes and manufacturing processes is required. This research aims to find the optimal time and critical path of the assembly process of an UAV based on <b>product</b> work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (PWBS) and critical path method (CPM). The result reveals that the optimal assembly time is 139 minutes. Finally, the application of product-oriented structural work distribution and the optimization of the assembly activities involved in the critical path successfully minimize {{the duration of the}} assembly process...|$|R

40|$|Many shipyards today {{contract}} vessels {{based on}} the traditional Lump Sum Fixed Price (LSFP) contract. Even though the construction of vessels from contract to delivery lasts from a year to longer, there are limited mechanisms available to mitigate for risk during the project evolution, {{especially in the case}} of prototype vessels, which are being built by the shipyard for the first time and include much uncertainty with regards to project drawings, detailed material lists and man-hours. Shipbuilding is definitely a large engineering construction project (LECP). Therefore it is logical to analyse how LECPs are contracted and managed in other industries which successfully minimize contract risk and constantly ensure profit in its business. In this paper two new shipbuilding-contracting models are presented and applied in a generic case study of contracting the newbuilding of a prototype vessel. The Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) and the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract models are demonstrated as improving the contracting process while yielding positive results for production, both in relation to the core capabilities of the shipyard as well as the sub-contracted activities in vessel production. Likewise a <b>product</b> work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> PWBS is shown as the model for shipyard business that very well complements the advanced contracting models. Finally a new contract risk analysis method using Monte Carlo simulation is developed to demonstrate how to practically analyse and compare the contracting methods in a case study so that shipyard management could choose the contracting model with the least amount of risk...|$|R
50|$|The matrix is {{typically}} created with a vertical axis (left-hand column) of tasks (e.g., from a {{work breakdown structure}} WBS) or deliverables (e.g., from a <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> PBS), and a horizontal axis (top row) of roles (e.g., from an organizational chart) - as illustrated in the image of an example responsibility assignment (or RACI) matrix.|$|E
5000|$|Once a <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> {{has been}} created, work can then begin on {{creating}} a product flow diagram (PFD) (or product flowchart) which identifies {{the order of}} precedence of products and will typically include multiple and complex parallel paths. For practical purposes this flowchart {{is essentially the same}} as the PERT chart used for critical path scheduling and leads naturally {{to the development of a}} project schedule.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to understand that in this context the term 'product' includes intermediate documentary products that are essential to the work of delivering the project. In this sense the <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> is a great deal more than simply an exploded view of the final end-product. Products included might also be products required to manage the project such as paper-based products and quality products such as approvals or quality checks on earlier made products. Examples include such things as requirement specifications, design approvals, test documentation, safety certifications, and so on.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{subdivision}} of work units in PERT another tool was developed: the Work <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure.</b> The Work <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> provides [...] "a framework for complete networking, the Work <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> was formally introduced {{as the first}} item of analysis in carrying out basic PERT/COST." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{principle}} of construction {{is the use}} of an Applied ontology based in an Upper ontology. In practice these ontologies take on the form of <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures</b> such as the Work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure.</b> Usually these <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures</b> form Metadata to represent a construction activity. In practice this requires a Semantic integration approach to construction data so to capture the project status.|$|R
5000|$|A work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> permits summing of {{subordinate}} {{costs for}} tasks, materials, etc., into their successively higher level [...] "parent" [...] tasks, materials, etc. For each {{element of the}} work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure,</b> {{a description of the}} task to be performed is generated. This technique (sometimes called a system <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure)</b> is used to define and organize the total scope of a project.|$|R
5000|$|... the PFD is a {{planning}} aid, not {{an outcome of}} planning (like a PERT Chart which looks similar), {{this is a common}} cause of confusion among the project managers- the PFD should contain all of the products of the <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> (equivalent to a Work Breakdown Structure)- the PFD should be kept as simple/ high-level as possible for it to make sense (if additional detail is required, creating a supplementary, detailed PFD can be useful)- all products should be 'linked into' the PFD, even if it's only to the start and the finish products- it's vital not to get too 'hung up' on nuances such as the nature of each logical linkage in setting up a PFD ...|$|E
50|$|Figure 1 {{illustrates}} the concepts {{that are important}} to the structure of a product. This is a meta-data model, which can be used for modeling the instances in a specific case of product structuring.The core of the product structure is illustrated by the product components (s) and their relationships. Thus, this involves the linking between items related to the product.The assembly can consist of subassemblies and parts, whereas subassemblies can also consist of other subassemblies or part. Thus this is typically hierarchically ordered. These concepts are generalized into the concept of item. This classification is overlapping, because a subassembly could be a part in another assembly configuration.Due to differentiation and variation of items several concepts must be indicated into the <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure.</b> Three concepts are involved in this differentiation, namely alternatives, variants and revisions. An alternative of an item is considered as a substitute for that particular item, whereas a variant is another option of an item which the consumer can choose. When an error occurs at a part or subassembly, it needs to be revised. This revision indicates the change history of the item.|$|E
50|$|If {{the work}} {{breakdown}} structure designer attempts to capture any action-oriented details in the WBS, the designer will likely include either too many actions or too few actions. Too many actions will exceed 100% of the parent's scope and too few will fall short of 100% of the parent's scope. The best way {{to adhere to the}} 100% rule is to define WBS elements in terms of outcomes or results, not actions. This also ensures that the WBS is not overly prescriptive of methods, allowing for greater ingenuity and creative thinking {{on the part of the}} project participants. For new product development projects, the most common technique to ensure an outcome-oriented WBS is to use a <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure.</b> Feature-driven software projects may use a similar technique which is to employ a feature breakdown structure. When a project provides professional services, a common technique is to capture all planned deliverables to create a deliverable-oriented WBS. Work breakdown structures that subdivide work by project phases (e.g. preliminary design phase, critical design phase) must ensure that phases are clearly separated by a deliverable also used in defining entry and exit criteria (e.g. an approved preliminary or critical design review).|$|E
40|$|Developing a work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> is an {{important}} step during the initial phase of the project that once the basic scope have been identified, initial work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> can be created with a limited scope of information. A work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> is the basis for planning and managing the key areas within a project. If work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> is not designed properly, it can {{have an impact on the}} whole project as work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> serves as the basis of planning. The impact for not proper of the work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> is not clear work assignments and goals difficult to achieve. Experienced project managers know that there are many things wrong or not right in the project no matter how he managed the planning and execution of their work. Unfortunately for inexperienced planners, they can not anticipate what will happen if they do not prepare properly planning. Proper planning should be done to avoid problems that cannot be expected in the future. If not, many problems will arise, especially during construction. Thus, planner must understand and know how to develop a work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> correctly. For inexperienced planners, there may be some problems in the planning process. In general, an inexperienced planner has problems in the initial stage. He could not identify which one should be done first. Therefore, this study was come out to study the process flow of work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> during the planning stage. The objectives of this study are to define the process flow of work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> based on case study, to identify the similarity on process flow of work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> among case study and to suggest the suitable process flow of work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> that can be use for inexperienced planner. In this study, data collection is carried out by interviews. Three of the contractors involved in the planning process will be selected, for this case study. Then, an interview with three project managers will be conducted. As a result, three case studies has similar process flow but different in the sequence only. Difference sequence based on their experience factor. This research hopes to contribute to the planning of inexperience, especially in developing work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> in the right way...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> is {{traditionally}} {{a method of}} identification of the products of a project in a tree structure. It is a tool used to assess, plan, document, and display the equipment requirements for a project. It {{is part of a}} product based planning technique, and attempts to break down all components of a project in as much detail as possible, so that nothing is overlooked. The PBS for ground systems at the Kennedy Space Center is being developed to encompass the traditional requirements including the alignment of facility, systems, and components to the organizational hierarchy. The Ground Operations <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> is a hybrid in nature in that some aspects of a work breakdown structure will be incorporated and merged with the Architecture Concept of Operations, Master Subsystem List, customer interface, and assigned management responsibility. The Ground Operations <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> {{needs to be able to}} identify the flexibility of support differing customers (internal and external) usage of ground support equipment within the Kennedy Space Center launch and processing complex. The development of the <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> is an iterative activity Initially documenting the organization hierarchy structure and relationships. The <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> identifies the linkage between the customer program requirements, allocation of system resources, development of design goals, and identification logistics products. As the <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> progresses the incorporation of the results of requirement planning for the customer occurs identifying facility needs and systems. The mature <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> is baselined with a hierarchical drawing, the <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> database, and an associated document identifying the verification of the data through the life cycle of the program/product line.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a cost estimating framework for electrical, electronic and electromechanical (EEE) components obsolescence, {{which represents the}} main source of obsolescence issues, owing to the increasingly short life cycle of these types of component. The framework comprises several areas: component complexity levels, obsolescence management levels, obsolescence resolution profiles and obsolescence cost metrics. Several studies, based on the literature and on interaction with numerous obsolescence management experts from industry, have been employed in this research, following a systematic approach. The framework is able to estimate the non-recurring cost of obsolescence during the contracted period within the inservice phase. This is based on the information available at the bidding stage concerning the <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (PBS) and the obsolescence management strategy deployed.

40|$|AbstractSlip-form technology, an {{automatic}} formwork system, has many benefits in construction industries and can shorten the construction time and reduce costs. However, slip-form {{systems have been}} designed using 2 D drawing methods, which hinders the utilization of project information and impedes essential communication between project participants. The application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology, especially the parametric modeling method, can be an efficient solution. This study presents the beneficial effects of applying BIM technology {{to the design of}} a slip-form system. First, classification of a tapered slip-form was defined, based on <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Structure</b> (PBS) in a top-down approach. Then, working from the defined classification, 3 D parametric models of a slip-form were constructed using the script language, SmartPart of Allplan (BIM tool). Finally, the established parametric model was tested by carrying out two different-height cases of tapered concrete pylons, automatically. This parametric design system could also be utilized to improve an efficiency of a formwork process...|$|E
