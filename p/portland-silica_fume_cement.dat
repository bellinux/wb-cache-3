While the use of FBEC bars in concrete is debated among the concrete technologists, contractors and owners are using them as one of the methods to enhance the useful service-life of reinforced concrete construction. Several studies have been conducted at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals to develop methodologies for enhancing concrete durability under severe environmental conditions of the region. One of the studies has been to evaluate the usefulness of FBEC bars under local conditions, which are characterized by high chloride contamination in concrete and elevated environmental temperature. The effect of high chloride concentration and elevated temperature in conjunction with damage to the FBEC on the corrosion of the substrate metal was studied in plain and silica <b>fume</b> <b>cement</b> concretes.
