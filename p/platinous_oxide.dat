40|$|The anodic {{decomposition}} of hydrogen peroxide {{has been investigated}} {{over a wide range}} of conditions. In alkaline, neutral, and acid solutions at all the anode materials investigated hydrogen peroxide is quant i tat ively decomposed, provided the current density is not too high, in accordance with the formal equation H~O,. + 2 F = 2 H + + O~. In alkaline solution {{there appears to be a}} common process, occurring at a low potential, involving the HO ~ ion, which can be simply fornlulated as HO ~ [...] 2 e = H + + O 2; this takes place rapidly and, in general, the rate of the total anode reaction is governed by diffusion. In neutral and acid solutions this process does not take place at appreciable speed, but there appears to be a common process, occurring at a high potential, which can be formulated as an interact ion of the OH radical with the H 202 molecule. P lat inum anodes in neutral and acid solutions show a specific behavior which is at t r ibuted to chemical interaction of hydrogen peroxide with <b>platinous</b> <b>oxide,</b> which is primari ly formed on the anode surface...|$|E
