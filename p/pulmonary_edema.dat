5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity. The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds.

5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema.</b> The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.|$|E
5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{pulmonary}} hemodynamics after mitral valve repiacement in 30 patients, {{during the first}} 18 post-operative hours, did show elevated pulmonary vascular resistance from rhe pre-operative leveis {{in the majority of}} them. This rise varied directly,wirh the bypass time and was associated with increased right ventricular work, intrapulmonary shunt and more severe ultrastr 4 ctural lesions of the alveolar-capillary membrane. The pulmonary vas cular resiscance had tendency to lower tu the pre-operative values at the end of 18 hours. The microscopic changes, very similar with the observed on shock lung, fat emboli and in ali non-hemodynamic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edemas,</b> may well be due to excessive and prolonged stimu lation of catechoiamines, microemboli and hypoxia. The control of perfusion pressure, better synthetic surfaces and oxygenators, and the use of assisted ventiiation with positive end-expiratory pressure must be investigate to precise their exact role on the alterations of the puimonary microcirculation after open hearr surgery. Puimonary complications are a frequent cause of morbiiity and mortality after open-heart surgery, in spite of ali the progress noted on the prevention and post-operative care (1, 2).

5|$|Although strenuous and {{requiring}} physical fitness, {{none of the}} conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, {{even those who are}} acclimatized. In serious cases, it can lead to high-altitude <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E
5|$|In fatal {{cases of}} {{ordinary}} smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth {{days of the}} illness. The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating immune complexes, overwhelming viremia, or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors. In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema.</b> In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death. In flat smallpox modes of death {{are similar to those}} in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating sepsis.|$|E

40|$|Interstitial {{pneumonia}} (IP) frequently {{occurs in}} patients with scrub typhus, but its clinical significance is not well known. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate interstitial pneumonia as a marker of severity of the disease for patients with scrub typhus. We investigated clinical parameters representing the severity of the disease, and the chest radiographic findings for 101 patients with scrub typhus. We then compared these clinical factors between patients with and without IP. We also studied the relationship between IP and other chest radiographic findings. The chest radiography showed IP (51. 4 %), pleural effusion (42. 6 %), cardiomegaly (14. 9 %), <b>pulmonary</b> alveolar <b>edema</b> (20. 8 %), hilar lymphadenopathy (13. 8 %) and focal atelectasis (11. 8 %), respectively. The patients with IP (n= 52) had higher incidences in episode of hypoxia (p= 0. 030), hypotension (p= 0. 024), severe thrombocytopenia (p= 0. 036) and hypoalbuminemia (p= 0. 013) than the patients without IP (n= 49). The patients with IP also had higher incidences of pleural effusion (p< 0. 001), focal atelectasis (p= 0. 019), cardiomegaly (p< 0. 001), <b>pulmonary</b> alveolar <b>edema</b> (p= 0. 011) and hilar lymphadenopathy (p< 0. 001) than the patients without IP.

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema,</b> or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} features of latrodectism are similar for all species of Latrodectus spiders and is generally characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may be painful, but sometimes only {{feels like a}} pin prick or mild burning sensation. Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local sweating and sometimes piloerection (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema,</b> respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects can range from {{a few hours to}} days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.|$|E
5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; {{after a number of}} hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema,</b> or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died within hours of a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nematodes of the {{superfamily}} Metastrongyloidea {{affect the}} respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems of domestic carnivores and are uncommonly detected in wild animals. This report describes the lesions associated with pulmonary parasitism by nematodes of the superfamily Metastrongyloidea {{in a wild}} crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) in the Federal District, Brazil. Grossly, there was <b>pulmonary</b> hyperemia, <b>edema,</b> and emphysema. Microscopically, there was granulomatous arteritis associated with intravascular metastrongylid. The anatomical location, characteristic lesion, and histological features of the parasite suggested that the nematode {{involved in this case}} is Angiostrongylus vasorum.

25|$|Patulin is toxic {{primarily}} through affinity to sulfhydryl groups (SH), {{which results in}} inhibition of enzymes. Oral LD50 in rodent models have ranged between 20 and 100mg/kg. In poultry, the oral LD50 range was reported between 50â€“170mg/kg. Other routes of exposure are more toxic, yet less likely to occur. Major acute toxicity findings include gastrointestinal problems, neurotoxicity (i.e., convulsions), <b>pulmonary</b> congestion, and <b>edema.</b>|$|R
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10â€“15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema),</b> swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E
5|$|Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is {{a protein}} that helps T {{cells of the}} immune system attack {{pathogens}} and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema.</b> IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth.

40|$|Helminthostachys zeylanica (L.) Hook. is {{plant that}} has been used in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine for centuries for the treatment of inflammation, fever, pneumonia, and various disorders. The aims of the present study are to figure out the possible effectiveness of the component Ugonin M, a unique flavonoid isolated from H. zeylanica, and to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which it works in the LPS-induced ALI model. In this study, Ugonin M not only inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as NO, TNF-Î±, IL- 1 Î², and IL- 6, as well as infiltrated cellular counts and protein content in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) -induced acute lung injury (ALI) mice, but also ameliorated the severity of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edemas</b> through the score of a histological examination and the ratio of wet to dry weight of lung. Moreover, Ugonin M was observed to significantly suppress LPS-stimulated protein levels of iNOS and COX- 2. In addition, we found that Ugonin M not only obviously suppressed NF-ÎºB and MAPK activation via the degradation of NF-ÎºB and IÎºB-Î± as well as ERK and p 38 MAPK active phosphorylation but also inhibited the protein expression level of TLR 4. Further, Ugonin M treatment also suppressed the protein levels of MPO and enhanced the protein expressions of HO- 1 and antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and CAT) in lung tissue of LPS-induced ALI mice. It is anticipated that through our findings, there is strong evidence that Ugonin M may exert a potential effect against LPS-induced ALI mice. Hence, Ugonin M {{could be one of the}} major effective components of H. zeylanica in the treatment of inflammatory disorders...|$|R
5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema,</b> high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema,</b> and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Afferent {{signals are}} sensory {{neuronal}} signals that ascend to the brain. Afferent neurons significant in dyspnea arise {{from a large}} number of sources including the carotid bodies, medulla, lungs, and chest wall. Chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and medulla supply information regarding the blood gas levels of O2, CO2 and H+. In the lungs, juxtacapillary (J) receptors are sensitive to <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>edema,</b> while stretch receptors signal bronchoconstriction. Muscle spindles in the chest wall signal the stretch and tension of the respiratory muscles. Thus, poor ventilation leading to hypercapnia, left heart failure leading to interstitial edema (impairing gas exchange), asthma causing bronchoconstriction (limiting airflow) and muscle fatigue leading to ineffective respiratory muscle action could all contribute to a feeling of dyspnea.|$|R
