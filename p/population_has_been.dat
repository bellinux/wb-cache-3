5|$|As of 2016, {{the town}} had 630 residents, a {{significant}} decline since the 2008 population of 714.

5|$|Chadderton's <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{described}} as broadly working class with pockets of {{lower middle class}} communities, particularly in the northeast of the town, near the border with Royton.

5|$|Indonesia's <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{increasing}} rapidly {{since the}} 1815 eruption, reaching 222 million in 2006, of which 130 million were living on Java.

50|$|The genus Sparisoma {{is fairly}} successful, but <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> falling {{somewhat}} because of overfishing {{and other human}} activities. However, as mentioned above, it is the main grazer of algae, but since <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> falling, the coral reefs may be at risk, because too much algae is deleterious to coral.|$|R
5|$|Only a {{few small}} populations of B.acanthopoda exist. Until 1999, it was thought to occur only in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region, in the {{vicinity}} of Woodanilling and Katanning; since then, a <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found in the Jarrah Forest region, south of Darkan.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the recent}} years, the house sparrow <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{on the decline}} in many Asian countries, and this decline is quite evident in India. To promote the {{conservation}} of these birds, in 2012, the house sparrow was declared as the state bird of Delhi.|$|E

5|$|Deptford's <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> mainly {{associated}} with the docks since {{the establishment of the}} Royal Docks by Henry VIII, though there has also been some market gardening and potteries. When the docks were thriving as the main administrative centre of the British Navy, so the area prospered, and fine houses were built for the administrative staff and the skilled shipbuilders, and a few grand houses like Sayes Court and Stone House on Lewisham Way were erected.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi, {{also known}} as Gorgas's oryzomys or Gorgas's rice rat, is a rodent in the genus Oryzomys of family Cricetidae. First {{collected}} as a living animal in 1967, it is known from only a few localities, including a freshwater swamp in the lowlands of northwestern Colombia and a mangrove islet in northwestern Venezuela. It formerly occurred {{on the island of}} Curaçao off northwestern Venezuela; this extinct <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described as a separate species, Oryzomys curasoae, but does not differ morphologically from mainland populations.|$|E

5|$|Roughly {{one-third of}} the world's <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis, with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year. However, most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause TB disease, and 90–95% of infections remain asymptomatic. In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active. In 2010, 8.8 million new cases of TB were diagnosed, and 1.20–1.45 million deaths occurred, most of these occurring in developing countries. Of these 1.45 million deaths, about 0.35million occur in those also infected with HIV.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough has an {{extensive}} though sometimes fragmented range, estimated at 1–10millionsquare kilometres (0.4–3.8million sq mi), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 260,000 to 620,000 individuals in Europe. The Corsican <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> estimated to comprise about 2,500 birds. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{red deer}} <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{the subject of}} {{research}} for many years, recently {{under the leadership of}} Tim Clutton-Brock of the University of Cambridge. These efforts are based at the remote bay of Kilmory in the north of the island. It has been important in the development of sociobiology and behavioural ecology, particularly in relation to the understanding of aggression through game theory.|$|E

5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the large}} number of {{introduced}} species that harm Lord Howe's native flora and fauna, feral pigs and cats were eradicated by the early 2000s. The goat <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reduced to just a few animals, and there are ongoing efforts to control rodents and introduced plants. In July 2012 it was announced by the Australian federal Environment Minister Tony Burke and the New South Wales Environment Minister Robyn Parker that the Australian and NSW Governments would each contribute 50% of the estimated A$9 million cost of implementing a rodent eradication plan for the island, using aerial deployment of poison baits. The plan was put to a local vote and is considered controversial. A recovery program has restored the Lord Howe woodhen numbers from only 20 in 1970 to about 200 in 2000, which is close to carrying capacity.|$|E
5|$|The American kestrel {{is likely}} the most {{abundant}} falcon in North America, although its total population is difficult to quantify, as local populations can change quickly due to resource availability. Count data from the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicate that the North American breeding population is experiencing long-term and gradual but sustained declines, with some regions, such as New England and coastal California, exhibiting more rapid declines. Count data from raptor migration corridors also indicate regional population declines and largely corroborate BBS data. The North American <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> estimated at 1.2 million pairs, with the Central and South American populations being as large. A smaller estimate is 236,000 birds wintering in North America. A population increase occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, probably due to deforestation for agriculture. The resulting pastures provided an ideal habitat for kestrels.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Rockies {{ecoregion}} supports 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a {{high concentration}} of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish of Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> making a recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is {{native to}} Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Today it is extinct in Malawi, but has been successfully reintroduced in Namibia. The southern limit of the blue wildebeest range is the Orange River, while the western limit is bounded by Lake Victoria and Mt Kenya. The blue wildebeest is widespread and is being introduced into private game farms, reserves and conservancies. For this reason, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) rates the blue wildebeest as being of Least Concern. The <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> estimated to be around {{one and a half}} million and the population trend is stable.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} Cameroon contain {{some of the}} highest {{population}} density of forest elephants of any nation, and Nki is no different, with an elephant density of roughly 2.5 per square kilometer for Boumba Bek and Nki combined. The <b>population</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> steadily rising, from 1,547 in 1998 to 3,000 in 2006. Gorillas are also reported to abundant; there are an estimated 6,000 adults in Nki. The park is also home to diurnal primates, such as the threatened crested monkey, De Brazza monkey, and the black colobus, who reportedly only live east of the Dja River.|$|E
