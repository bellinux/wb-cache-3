Its main purpose is to prevent the international transport and spread of disease and insects that could negatively affect plants or ecosystems.ISPM 15 affects all wood packaging material (pallets, crates, dunnages, etc.) requiring that they be debarked and then heat treated or fumigated with methyl bromide and stamped or branded, with a mark of compliance. This mark of compliance is colloquially known as the [...] "wheat stamp". Products exempt from the ISPM 15 are made from an alternative material, like paper, plastic or wood panel products (i.e. OSB, hardboard, and plywood).|$|E

40|$|AbstractWood {{packaging}} materials {{are commonly used}} in international trade, but they are susceptible to various pest and plant diseases. To reduce reinfestation {{and the spread of}} pests, The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) has implemented International Standard <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>Measure</b> No. 15 (ISPM No. 15) since 2002, regulating the phytosanitary measures of wood {{packaging materials}}. Indonesian Government has ratified ISPM No. 15 with Regulation of Ministry of Agriculture No. 12, 2009 about the requirement and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measure</b> methods for wood packaging materials in Republic of Indonesia. Unfortunately, ISPM No. 15 was ratified without considering the facts that ISPM No. 15 was developed adjusting to European climate, which is much different from that of Indonesia. Overall, Indonesian climate is more extreme while it needs great investment on infrastructure resources to apply Heat Treatment (HT) and Fumigation to meet ISPM No. 15. On the other hand, more than 95 % of wood packaging products are still supplied by Non Manufacture Wood Packaging (NMWP). NMWP is supplied by small and medium manufacturer which uses fresh-cut wood materials with moisture content above 80 %. Furthermore, work equipments and the quality of human resources are still limited, then it is difficult to implement proper treatment method to meet ISPM No. 15. Based on these problems, Semi Permanent Imunization Treatment has been proposed to be an alternative treatment to meet ISPM No. 15 for wood packaging material. S. P. I. T method involves quality control of wood packaging product; make-up process; wood packaging treatment by biopesticide product; mark; container clean up and pre-stuffing treatment; and the issue of Semi Permanent Immunization Treatment (S.

The Sanitary and <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>measure</b> was introduced to avert the impact on trade and provide a harmonised system of quality standards. However, disease, health and safety impacts, which lead to the destruction or harm of raw material, play a part in the cost of high quality protection of trade.

The empirical simulation draws upon results by compounding welfare loss from consuming in an economy with low or no health and safety standards. The assessment is based on how much would an individual be willing to pay to have higher assurance of quality food, hence a safe and healthy food commodities market? The pure economic welfare losses from low standard levels are quite considerable. The results in this paper provide on average, individuals would permanently give up to approximately 8 percent of their current level of consumption to have produce that has a higher health and safety assurance.

40|$|The {{production}} of an agricultural commodity involves {{a sequence of}} processes: planting/growing, harvesting, sorting/grading, postharvest treatment, packing, and exporting. A Bayesian network has been developed to represent the level of potential infestation of an agricultural commodity by a specified pest along an agricultural production chain. It reflects the dependency of this infestation on the predicted level of pest challenge, the anticipated susceptibility of the commodity to the pest, the level of impact from pest control measures as designed, and any variation from that due to uncertainty in measure efficacy. The objective of this Bayesian network is to facilitate agreement between national governments of the exporters and importers {{on a set of}} phytosanitary measures to meet specific <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measure</b> requirements to achieve target levels of protection against regulated pests. The model can be used to compare the performance of different combinations of measures under different scenarios of pest challenge, making use of available measure performance data. A case study is presented using a model developed for a fruit fly pest on dragon fruit in Vietnam; the model parameters and results are illustrative and do not imply a particular level of fruit fly infestation of these exports; rather, they provide the most likely, alternative, or worst-case scenarios of the impact of measures. As a means to facilitate agreement for trade, the model provides a framework to support communication between exporters and importers about any differences in perceptions of the risk reduction achieved by pest control measures deployed during the commodity production chain...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{biological}} control {{has been successfully}} used in various continents to manage many invasive alien plants originating from Europe, but this approach is still not widely adopted in Europe, despite its advantages (sustainable, effective, efficacious, good safety record) compared to chemical and manual control of weeds. Following the publication in April 2015 of the EFSA PLH Scientific Opinion on the risk posed to plant health in the EU by the intentional release of the bud-galling wasp Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae for {{the control of the}} invasive alien plant Acacia longifolia, the EFSA PLH Panel is publishing this statement on the procedure to follow should similar requests be made in future. Ideally what is required for an EFSA Opinion on a risk assessment of a BCA release is: (i) host specificity tests of a plant list agreed in advance by an appropriate body; (ii) a risk assessment for plant health produced using a standardized template for the whole of the EU or at the least for an appropriate bio-climatic area within the EU; and (iii) consideration of benefits. This process could be facilitated by an expert working group that would be available to advise the applicant at regular intervals. The role of EFSA is best suited to providing a peer review of a weed BCA risk assessment for the EU considering that peer review of applications prepared by researchers specialized in a particular BCA is the procedure adopted for BCA risk assessment in the countries that have much experience with using exotic BCAs of weeds.

The Panel compared several definitions of soil and growing media and used, in this opinion, the current definition for growing media of the International Plant Protection Convention. In Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC, no specific definition of soil and growing media is provided but growing media are described in two different ways. From the soil and growing media and/or components thereof identified through extensive literature searches, the Panel distinguished eight groups of soil and growing media and assessed the probability of association of these groups with harmful organisms. A total of 207 scientific publications were reviewed by the Panel {{in order to identify}} and rate the effectiveness of options that could reduce the risk of entry of pests posed by the import of soil and growing media. A detailed description and evaluation of the requirements for soil and growing media laid down in current EU legislation on plant health and in a few other regions of the world is provided. The Panel found that the ‘prohibition of import’ is the only <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measure</b> with a very high effectiveness and a low uncertainty. The effectiveness of the phytosanitary measures ‘pest free production site and preparation of consignment’ is rated as moderate to high with an uncertainty rated as medium to high.

40|$|International {{trade of}} plants and plant {{products}} {{is one of the}} major vectors for the introduction and spread of exotic pests of plants. Some of these pests may affect agricultural production and/or limit access to international export markets. Phytosanitary inspections {{of plants and}} plant products at border ports are an important <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measure</b> to ensure compliance with importing countries’ requirements. Measures are formulated by undertaking Pest Risk Analysis (PRA). In many developing countries however, the undertaking of PRAs is affected by limited national phytosanitary capacity and resources. This thesis provides insights that may facilitate more effective phytosanitary regulation, particularly the undertaking of PRAs where limited data and expertise are available for this purpose. The Plant Quarantine and Phytosanitary Service (PQPS), the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) of Zambia is a case in point. In light of the above, a simplified PRA procedure was developed, one that is internationally acceptable and easily applied day-to-day with the resources available in a developing country like Zambia. The developed procedure focused on Pest Risk Assessment, the second stage of a PRA as guided by international standards. This stage is key to formulating phytosanitary measures. The procedure is entirely qualitative and relates to particular risk elements. The risk elements used in the simplified procedure were identified for inclusion after a detailed review of PRAs conducted by NPPOs of various developed countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the USA as well as one of the Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RPPO), the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO). The review evaluated the different steps of stage two of these PRAs, specifically, entry, establishment, spread and consequences of the pest(s). Selection of risk elements for inclusion in the procedure was based on their consistent usage in the PRAs reviewed. The procedure was developed to be easy to apply and being user-friendly, with straightforward questions requiring a yes or no response. The procedure developed in this study avoids the burden of misinterpretation of levels of risk through ratings or scoring. As such, the procedure has the potential to be applied by the NPPOs of other developing countries, including Zambia’s PQPS. The procedure can provide PQPS with science-based PRAs to support the application of phytosanitary measures on imported plants and plant products. Use of the procedure was then tested, using Zambia’s import of South African maize (Zea mays) seed for sowing in a comparative study. However, having a suitable PRA procedure is one thing but ensuring there is the capacity to apply it routinely is another. Additional effort was therefore made to identify the essential PRA process components necessary for a NPPO to have an internationally acceptable PRA system. Essential components of a PRA system were determined through the aforementioned comprehensive review of publicly available PRAs as well as NPPOs and RPPOs documented procedures. The essential components included: •	Presence of a PRA unit; •	Collaboration with specialists from all relevant plant health fields, whether in the NPPO or outside; •	Access to published sources of PRA relevant information and the availability of up-to-date data sets; •	Objective, if not independent technical peer review of each PRA; and •	Risk communication and consultation with stakeholders, including potential trading partners(s). As the case in point, the phytosanitary capacity of Zambia’s NPPO, the PQPS was examined in relation to its PRA system. Two questionnaires were designed specifically for this purpose. The questionnaires provided the means to survey PQPS staff to obtain information on: •	Phytosanitary activities at border ports; •	International trade patterns; •	The current PRA process; •	The availability of PRA experts; •	PQPS staffing; •	Availability of and access to sources of information relevant to PRAs; and •	Laboratory and inspection facilities. The questionnaires were applied between November 2011 and June 2012 at the PQPS head office in Lusaka and Zambia’s border ports. Border ports were Katima Mulilo, Chirundu, Copperbelt, Mwami, Nakonde, Victoria Falls and the main airport, the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA). Survey results showed that Zambia’s phytosanitary capacity is challenged in relation to PRA processes. The Zambian NPPO does not have staff specifically tasked with conducting PRAs and a PRA unit is not established in its structure. At the time of the survey, PQPS had a staff comprising 26 Plant Health Inspectors (PHIs). Presently, PHIs located at the border ports conduct ad hoc analyses of the risks associated with imported plants and plant products at the same time they complete phytosanitary inspections. In summary, there was little doubt that Zambia’s PRA process needs to be improved. The phytosanitary capacity of its NPPO is lacking and ideally will require significant injection of funds in the long term. In the absence of additional funding, however, improvements could still be made to its PRA process. The effectiveness of Zambia’s phytosanitary regulatory system will depend on its capacity to undertake PRAs. It is recommended that the effectiveness of Zambia’s system could be improved by: (i) restructuring PQPS so as to utilise some of its in-house tertiary qualified personnel located centrally in Head Office to focus on PRAs; (ii) applying routinely the newly developed PRA procedure at Head Office to develop scientifically justified measures to imports of plants and plant products; (iii) utilising the expertise of other centrally located plant health specialists in the PRA process; (iv) clarifying the inspection roles of PQPS border staff; and (v) establishing clearer communication channels with PHIs located at the border ports thereby enabling them to respond consistently to Head Office directives relating to phytosanitary measures required for imported plants and plant products...|$|E

This study evaluates the economic justification of the currently applied <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> against {{potato spindle tuber viroid}} (PSTVd). It assesses the impact of an unregulated EU infestation, while accounting for uncertainty due to scarcity of data. Expert opinions were elicited to describe the possible range of PSTVd spread. Stochastic simulations, based on the assessments of separate experts, indicated that the direct impacts exceed the costs of current <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> (€ 5. 6 M/year) with a probability of 44 %, but with large differences between experts making it hard to justify the measures solely by the expected savings in direct impacts. The direct impact on potato producers was estimated with partial budgeting. This impact is 2. 1 M€, based on an assumed prevalence of PSTVd of 0. 73 %, while the direct impact on tomato producers was estimated at 3. 5 M€. The total economic impact, considering price changes and higher costs for consumers, was estimated at 4. 4 M€ for potatoes and 5. 7 M€ for tomatoes. Consumers bore 92 % of the total costs of invasion in the case of potato and 77 % in the case of tomato. If the presence of PSTVd would imply export restrictions, resulting in an annual loss of more than 1 % of the total EU export value of potatoes and tomatoes, the cost of current <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> would also be justified. The potential economic impacts of PSTVd into the European Union are therefore demonstrably of importance when considering market effects or export losses but questionable if only accounting for the direct losses. The large degree of uncertainty in the prevalence of disease contributes to the justifiability of measures based on the precautionary principle. The assessment approach can be useful for assessing the economic justification of <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R
