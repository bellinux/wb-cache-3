5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels.</b> Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

40|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> {{is one of}} a {{large number}} of plant {{components}} for which stress analyses must be performed. A <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> experiences mainly two types of stresses, primary stresses and secondary stresses. Primary stresses are because of <b>pressure</b> inside <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> and secondary stresses are because of thermal loading. Thermal loading is considerable in a <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> which handles hot fluid. Typically liquid metal reactors (LMR) have thermo-mechanical loadings. Analytically, induced stresses are calculated using <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> theory or ASME codes. In this project induced stresses are calculated using ANSYS coupled field analysis for thermo-mechanical loading. The results are then compared with analytical results. This work demonstrates usage of commercial FEA tool over analytical approach. Analytical solutions such as ASME and Japanese Code give empirical relationships to calculate thermal stress. Use of FEA tools is not very popular in <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> industries. FEA of this kind of loading requires coupled field analysis.

25|$|A fire {{extinguisher}} {{is an active}} fire protection device used to extinguish or control small fires, often in emergency situations.

25|$|In {{conventional}} light-water reactor (LWR) designs, {{the entire}} fissile core {{is placed in}} a large pressure vessel. The amount of heat that can be removed by a unit of a coolant {{is a function of}} the temperature; by pressurizing the core the water can be heated to much greater temperatures before boiling, thereby removing more heat and allowing the core to be smaller and more efficient. Building a pressure vessel of the required size is a challenge.

40|$|Superconducting radio {{frequency}} (SRF) cavities made from niobium and cooled with liquid helium are becoming {{key components of}} many particle accelerators. The helium vessels surrounding the RF cavities, portions of the niobium cavities themselves, and also possibly the vacuum vessels containing these assemblies, generally fall under the scope of local and national <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> codes. In the U. S., Department of Energy rules require national laboratories to follow national consensus <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> standards or to show "a level of safety {{greater than or equal}} to" that of the applicable standard. Thus, while used for its superconducting properties, niobium ends up being treated as a low-temperature <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> material. Niobium material is not a code listed material and therefore requires the designer to understand the mechanical properties for material used in each <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> fabrication; compliance with <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> codes therefore becomes a problem.

Decommissioning {{would take more than}} 30 years, because the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels</b> of the reactor vessels are damaged also. After the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, some 70 percent of the fuel rods had melted. There, the retrieval of the fuel was started in 1985, and completed in 1990. The work at Fukushima was expected to take significantly longer because of the far greater damage and the fact that 4 reactors would need to be decommissioned all at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of the core shroud is to direct the current of water flow inside of the reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel.</b> Cold water is pumped into the reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> from an outside water source.
