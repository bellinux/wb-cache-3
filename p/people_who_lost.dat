25|$|Experts on {{the ground}} in Japan agree that mental health {{challenges}} are the most significant issue.

Behavioral changes can follow, including poor dietary choices, lack of exercise and sleep deprivation, all of which can have long-term negative health consequences. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their homes, villages and family members, and even just those who survived the quake, will likely continue to face mental health challenges and the physical ailments that come with stress.

25|$|As Tsubasa is {{connected}} with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar.

The characters of Fai D. Flowright and Kurogane were created in order to have adult characters who would side with Syaoran, who was much younger and was still in development during the series' start.

Although Kurogane was the only character who did this at first, the authors also planned to make Syaoran do this.|$|E
25|$|August 13: Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who {{ran against}} Ryutaro Hashimoto for the {{presidency}} of the Liberal Democratic Party in 2001, made a campaign pledge to visit the shrine on an annual basis regardless of the criticism it would cause, which won him support among nationalists and helped him become prime minister from 2001 to 2006. He paid his respect at the Yasukuni shrine on August 13, 2001, as a Prime Minister {{for the first time in}} 5 years since the last Hashimoto's visit. This and following Koizumi's annual visits drew extensive criticism from other East-Asian countries, particularly the People's Republic of China, where the visits stoked anti-Japanese sentiment and influenced power struggles between pro-Japanese and anti-Japanese leaders within the Chinese Communist Party. The Japanese government officially viewed the visits by Koizumi as private visits in an individual capacity to express respect and gratitude to the many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their lives in the war, and not for the sake of war criminals or to challenge the findings of the Tokyo war crimes tribunal.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and the South Australian Aborigines Progress Association (SAAPA) {{unveiled}} {{a plan to}} build a cairn on the cliffs at Waterloo Bay to [...] "commemorate a massacre of 250 Aboriginal people by white settlers in 1846". It was intended that the cairn would be part of a national mourning campaign by Aboriginal people, timed to coincide with the bicentenary of the landing of Captain James Cook at Botany Bay in New South Wales in 1770. John Moriarty, the deputy president of SAAPA, said that [...] "the Elliston massacre was part {{of the history of the}} West Coast Aboriginal population, despite strenuous efforts by the relatives of the whites involved to discredit what is a well-known fact". The chairman of the District Council of Elliston, J. B. Cameron, said that the council would agree to the cairn being built if it could be proved that the massacre took place. He also said that a memorial to Aboriginal <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their lives in the early development of the area might be built. Foster et al. note that this offer was presumably on the condition that there would not be any reference to the alleged massacre at Waterloo Bay. This story, published in The Advertiser, resulted in a series of letters to the newspaper, from people with a range of differing viewpoints about the massacre story.
