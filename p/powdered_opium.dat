2500|$|In the United States, opium {{tincture}} is marketed {{and distributed}} by several pharmaceutical firms, each producing a single {{formulation of the}} drug, which is deodorized. [...] Each mL contains 10mg of anhydrous morphine (the equivalent of 100mg of <b>powdered</b> <b>opium),</b> other opium alkaloids (except noscapine), and ethanol, 19%.

6000|$|... "It was {{the first}} link in my chain of reasoning. <b>Powdered</b> <b>opium</b> {{is by no means}} tasteless. The flavor is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible. Were it mixed with any {{ordinary}} dish the eater would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson, have caused curry to be served in the trainer's family that night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose that he happened to come along with <b>powdered</b> <b>opium</b> upon the very night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the flavor. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes eliminated from the case, and our attention centers upon Straker and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for supper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to that dish without the maid seeing them? ...|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{preparation}} (besides smoking), include processing into regular opium tincture (tinctura opii), laudanum, paregoric (tinctura opii camphorata), herbal wine (e.g., vinum opii), <b>opium</b> <b>powder</b> (pulvis opii), <b>opium</b> sirup (sirupus opii) and opium extract (extractum opii). Vinum opii {{is made by}} combining sugar, white wine, cinnamon, and cloves. Opium syrup is made by combining 997.5 part sugar syrup with 2.5 parts opium extract. Opium extract (extractum opii) finally {{can be made by}} macerating raw opium with water. To make opium extract, 20 parts water are combined with 1 part raw opium which has been boiled for 5 minutes (the latter to ease mixing).|$|R
5000|$|Lu Xun (1927:111, tr. Sailey 1978:424) claimed, [...] "most of {{the famous}} men Wei-Chin took drugs." [...] Based upon {{historical}} accounts of hanshisan users, scholars generally associate the drug with the scholar-gentry social class. However, Akahori Akira (1989:93) proposes an economic class distinction between users of the two popular drugs during the Three Kingdoms period. Only the [...] "rich and powerful" [...] could afford the rare Chinese alchemy ingredients for dan (丹 [...] "cinnabar") elixirs of immortality - [...] "Common folk instead took drugs that were easier to get, like cold-food powder (which, though actually less toxic, would cause {{a greater number of}} deaths)." [...] In addition, Lu Xun compared the ingestion of hanshisan <b>powder</b> to <b>opium</b> addiction in China during the nineteenth century.|$|R
50|$|Diarrhoea {{accompanied}} by significant cramping or intestinal cramping alone {{may benefit from}} either adding another smooth-muscle agent to the protocol such as dicycloverine, papaverine, or orphenadrine (which accomplishes several things at once since it is an antihistamine as noted above). Such cases may also benefit from a switch to paregoric, laudanum, <b>powdered</b> or granulated <b>opium,</b> or belladonna-and-opium suppositories, as {{all of the above}} include many drugs thatwork together and have non-narcotic alkaloids like papaverine and other components like oils, waxes, resins etc. which work elsewhere in the body. Pantopon (opium alkaloids hydrochlorides) and similar preparations have much of the advantages of whole opium in injectable form.|$|R
6000|$|Holmes {{shook his}} head. [...] "A clever counsel would tear {{it all to}} rags," [...] said he. [...] "Why should he take the horse out of the stable? If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there? Has a {{duplicate}} key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him the <b>powdered</b> <b>opium?</b> Above all, where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid {{to give to the}} stable-boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{a quarter}} of a mile from the stables John Straker's {{overcoat}} was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut, inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear, however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognized by the maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger who had visited the stables. Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman. As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of <b>powdered</b> <b>opium,</b> while the people at the house partook of the same dish on the same night without any ill effect.|$|E

50|$|Holmes's powers {{unravel the}} mystery, and lay bare what villainies there {{are to be}} exposed. He visits the milliner's shop in London and determines, using Straker's photograph, that Straker posed as Derbyshire. This {{establishes}} his motive: he had a mistress with expensive tastes, and tried to influence the race's outcome to earn himself a large sum of money. The curried mutton was a clue, also; only such a spicy dish could have masked the taste of <b>powdered</b> <b>opium,</b> and {{it was impossible for}} Simpson to arrange a highly seasoned meal that evening for his purposes. Therefore, someone in the household must have conceived the idea—namely, Straker himself.|$|E

Straker's pockets contained two interesting items: a tallow candle and a milliner's bill for (among other things) a 22-guinea dress, made out to one William Derbyshire. There is the curious incident with the dog, and a problem with the sheep kept at the stable: a shepherd tells Holmes that three of his animals have recently become suddenly lame.|$|E

30|$|Opium and opium {{alkaloids}} reference standards were prepared as previously described (The Japanese pharmacopoeia 2006).
