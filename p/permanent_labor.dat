50|$|There {{has indeed}} {{been a great}} {{paradigm}} shift since the 1940s in the way firms utilize the temporary worker. Throughout the Fordist era, temporary workers made up a rather marginal proportion of the total labor force in North America. Typically, temporary workers were white women in pink collar, clerical positions who provided companies with a stop-gap solution for permanent workers who needed a leave of absence, when on vacation or in illness. In contrast, in the Post-Fordist period, characterized by neoliberalism, deindustrialization and {{the dismantling of the}} welfare state, these understandings of temporary labor began to shift. In this paradigm, the idea of the temporary worker as a stopgap solution to <b>permanent</b> <b>labor</b> became an entirely normative employment alternative to permanent work.|$|E

The role of transnational mothering within a neoliberal spectrum affects the exploitation of women through the deprivation of their citizen rights, by extracting the benefits of immigrant's labor while minimizing or eliminating any obligations, whether social or fiscal to the society or state. Migrant women of Third World countries are not drawn from their countries to the advancing economy of the First World, rather drawn from their economies that have been disrupted and distorted by Western colonial incursions, leaving many to be torn free of their roots and recruited to countries to fill its non <b>permanent</b> <b>labor</b> needs, preventing competition with native workers; fulfilling the complementary void. Transnational mothering is viewed as an accommodation for both classes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system of}} land tenure {{has been cited}} {{as one of the}} reasons that Mexico failed to develop {{economically}} during the colonial period, with large estates inefficiently organized and run and the [...] "concentration of land ownership per se caused waste and misallocation of resources." [...] These causes were posited before a plethora of studies of the hacienda and smaller agrarian enterprises as well as broader regional studies were done in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These meticulous studies of individual haciendas and regions over time demonstrates that hacienda owners were profit-seeking entrepreneurs. They had the advantage of economies of scale that smaller holders and Indian villages did not in cultivation of grains, pulque, sugar, and sisal and in ranching, with cattle and sheep. Great haciendas did not completely dominate the agrarian sector, since there were products that could be efficiently produced by smaller holders and Indian villages, such as fruits and vegetables, cochineal red dye, and animals that could be raised in confined spaces, such as pigs and chickens. Small holders also produced wine, cotton and tobacco. In the eighteenth century, the crown created a tobacco monopoly on both cultivation and manufacturing of tobacco products.As Spanish agrarian enterprises developed, acquiring title to land became important. As the size of the indigenous labor force dropped and as the number of Spaniards seeking land and access to labor increased, a transitional labor institution called repartimiento ("allotment") developed, in which the crown allotted indigenous labor to Spaniards on a temporary basis. Many Spanish landowners found the system unsatisfactory since they could not count on receiving an allocation that suited their needs. The repartimiento for agriculture was abolished in 1632. Large-scale landed estates or haciendas developed, and most needed both a small <b>permanent</b> <b>labor</b> force supplemented by temporary labor at peak times, such as planting and harvesting.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{permanent}} and temporary immigration and remittance under the coexistence of unionized and non-unionized manufacturing firms in a two-sector economy. The impacts of immigration {{as well as}} remittance on respectively wages, employment, the union-nonunion wage gap and national welfare are analyzed. It is found that permanent immigration brings positive effects on most variables (except the competitive wage), but enlarges the wage gap and causes income redistribution. The effects of temporary immigration diverge depending on which sector immigrants are allowed to work in and which good is remitted more heavily. In particular, if temporary immigrants work in manufacturing only, then all wages and the union-nonunion wage gap fall.

He was {{the author}} of The Sociology of Colonial Virginia (1960) and The Sociology of the Bay Colony (1976), {{covering}} American history of the period between 1600 and 1770. Among Talpalar's merits is his emphasis in describing characters and human values predominant in the colony, and how they influenced the ideological background for the war. He supported that a change in these values was determinant for the establishment of slavery in Virginia, when the original Puritan rulers that dominated the political scene before 1660 were replaced by the rules of Cavaliers. This transition was the basis for the shift from traditional indentured servitude to slavery (temporarily versus <b>permanent</b> unfree <b>labor)</b> that was implemented in the colony.

Discontinuous retirement incentives in the Social Security System, and changes in laws affecting mandatory retirement and Social Security benefits allows the exogenous effect of retirement on happiness to be estimated.
