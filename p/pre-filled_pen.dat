40|$|AbstractPurposeClinical {{trials of}} the PCSK 9 {{inhibitor}} alirocumab, an every 2 week injectable monoclonal antibody, have shown significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol. However, many patients requiring lipid-lowering therapy are not experienced with self-injected medication. This study assessed patient and physician perceptions of 2 alirocumab delivery devices. Methods 400 participants (200 physicians, 200 patients) were included from 6 countries. Physicians (99 primary care physicians [PCPs]; 101 specialists) had mean practice experience of 17. 8 years and an average of 797 hypercholesterolemic patients. Participating patients had LDL-C levels above their goal {{and at least one}} of the following: familial hypercholesterolemia, statin intolerance, high cardiovascular risk, and/or diabetes. Mean patient age was 58. 5 years, 51 % were female, and 25. 5 % had injectable medication experience. Following device instruction and demonstration, participants tested either a <b>pre-filled</b> <b>pen</b> or pre-filled syringe, using both 75 and 150 mg doses of single-blinded placebo into a prosthetic pad. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaire. FindingsParticipant acceptance of both devices was positive, with 83 - 100 % agreeing with ease-of-use statements. After testing, physicians estimated that 66 % (pen) and 58 % (syringe) of their patients would be willing to self-inject using the device (relative increases from pre-testing of 22 % and 16 %, respectively; both P< 0. 05). Specialist estimates were higher than PCP estimates: for the pen, 60 % versus 47 % (pre-testing), respectively, and 72 % versus 61 % (post-testing); for the syringe, 57 % versus 43 % (pre-testing), 63 % versus 54 % (post-testing; all P< 0. 05, specialist vs PCP). After testing, 72 % (pen) and 63 % (syringe) of patient-participants were very willing to self-inject (relative increases from pre-testing of 26 % [P< 0. 05] and 11 %, respectively); 96 % (pen) and 93 % (syringe) were either very willing or somewhat willing to self-inject. The proportion of patients aged < 60 years who were very willing to self-inject with either device was numerically (but not statistically) higher compared with those â‰¥ 60 years. Initially, patients with injectable medication experience were generally more willing to use the pen than injection-naive patients; after testing there was no difference between groups. No significant differences were observed in responses to the 2 different doses. ImplicationsResponses from physicians and patients to <b>pre-filled</b> <b>pen</b> and syringe devices were positive. Devices were considered easy to operate, with most patients willing to use and accept self-injection. Patient willingness to self-inject increased after demonstration and testing. Results suggest that, in clinical practice, alirocumab administration by either <b>pre-filled</b> <b>pen</b> or syringe would not deter most physicians from prescribing or most patients from self-administering...|$|E
40|$|Exenatide (Byetta) is a {{synthetic}} derivative of exendin- 4 and an agonist of receptors of glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1). It is {{resistant to the}} rapid inactivation by dipeptidylpeptidase- 4 and acts as an incretin mimetic. It stimulates insulin secretion by the B cell in a glucose-dependent manner whereas it inhibits glucagon secretion. Exenatide improves mainly postprandial glucose concentrations and lowers glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1 c)) levels, without being directly responsible for hypoglycaemia or requiring mandatory home blood glucose monitoring. Furthermore, it slows down gastric emptying and promotes sustained body weight reduction, even in absence of frequently reported nausea following treatment initiation. Exenatide is recommended and reimbursed in Belgium {{for the treatment of}} type 2 diabetes, in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, in patients not adequately controlled with maximal tolerated doses of these oral glucose-lowering agents. Exenatide is presented as <b>pre-filled</b> <b>pens</b> for subcutaneous injection. The recommended initial dose is 5 microg before morning and evening meals, to be up titrated to 10 microg twice daily. Exenatide may represent a valuable alternative to insulin therapy, especially in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes and not ready to perform home blood glucose monitoring.
