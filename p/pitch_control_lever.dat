5000|$|A {{carburetor}} is used {{to provide}} the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most {{likely to occur in}} conditions of a low 11 °C (20 °F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the [...] "dew point spread"), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control {{is used to}} supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> <b>lever.</b> Pulling the control up slides a gate valve near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a [...] "carburetor heat assist" [...] which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).|$|E

50|$|The {{collective}} <b>pitch</b> <b>control,</b> or collective <b>lever,</b> {{is normally}} {{located on the}} left side of the pilot's seat with an adjustable friction control to prevent inadvertent movement. The collective changes the pitch angle of all the main rotor blades collectively (i.e., all at the same time) and independent of their position. Therefore, if a collective input is made, all the blades change equally, and as a result, the helicopter increases or decreases its total lift derived from the rotor. In level flight this would cause a climb or descent, while with the helicopter pitched forward an increase in total lift would produce an acceleration together with a given amount of ascent.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{nonlinear}} model predictive controller with individual <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> for a floating {{offshore wind turbine}} is presented. An aerodynamic model of the collective <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> approach is extended by describing pitching and yawing moments based on rotor disk theory.

An extended cost functional for individual <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> is proposed based on the collective <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> approach. The controller is evaluated in aero-servo-hydro-elastic simulations of a 5 MW reference wind turbine disturbed by a three-dimensional stochastic turbulent wind field.

40|$|<b>Pitch</b> <b>Control</b> plays a {{significant}} role for a large wind turbine. This study investigates a novel robust hydraulic <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system of a large wind turbine. The novel hydraulic <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system is driven by a novel high efficiency and high response hydraulic servo system. The pitch controller, designed by two degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) motion control with feedback linearization, is developed to enhance the controllability and stability of the <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system. Furthermore, the full-scale testbed of the hydraulic <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system of a large wind turbine is developed for practically experimental verification. Besides, the wind turbine simulation software FAST is used to analyze the motion of the blade which results are given to the testbed as the disturbance load command. The 2 -DOF pitch controller contains a feedforward controller with feedback linearization theory to overcome the nonlinearities of the system and a feedback controller to improve the system robustness for achieving the disturbance rejection. Consequently, the novel hydraulic <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system shows excellent path tracking performance in the experiments. Moreover, the robustness test with a simulated disturbance load generated by FAST is performed to validate the reliability of the proposed <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. A {{wind turbine}} {{needs to be}} {{controlled}} to ensure its safe and optimal operation, especially during high wind speeds. The most common control objectives are to limit the power and rotational speed of the wind turbine by using <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> Aero Energy is a company based in Potchefstroom, South Africa, that has been developing and manufacturing wind turbine blades since 2000. Their most popular product is the AE 1 kW blades. The blades {{have a tendency to}} over-speed in high wind speeds and the cut-in wind speed must be improved. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system for wind turbines. A prototype active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system had to be developed for the AE 1 kW blades. The objectives of the control system are to protect the wind turbine from over-speeding and to improve start-up performance. An accurate model was firstly developed to predict a wind turbine’s performance with active <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> The active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> was implemented by means of a two-stage centrifugal governor. The governor uses negative or stalling <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> The first linear stage uses a soft spring to provide improved start-up performance. The second non-linear stage uses a hard spring to provide over-speed protection. The governor was manufactured and then tested with the AE 1 kW blades. The governor achieved both the control objectives of over-speed protection and improved start-up performance. The models were validated by the results. It was established that the two-stage centrifugal governor concept can be implemented on any wind turbine, provided the blades and tower are strong enough to handle the thrust forces associated with negative <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> It was recommended that an active <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system be developed that uses positive pitching for the over-speed protection, which will eliminate the large thrust forces. Keywords: <b>pitch</b> <b>control,</b> wind turbine, centrifugal governor, over-speed protection, cut-in wind speed, blade element-momentum theory, rotor, generator, stall, feathering. Master...|$|R

A variable incidence canard with a large travel range was the most effective means of obtaining the required <b>pitch</b> <b>control,</b> although very large deflections may be required on highly unstable configurations. Control laws were developed for cases where the high angle of <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> requirement is not met, but they can limit aircraft roll capability and thus compromise maneuverability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt can {{be greatly}} {{beneficial}} {{to remove the}} swashplate of conventional helicopter, because the swashplate is usually complicated, aerodynamically resistive, and obstacle of more complex <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> for improving performance. The present technologies for helicopter vibration reduction are usually narrow in effective range or requiring additional actuators and signal transfer links, and more effective technology is desired. Helicopter blade <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system, which is removed of swashplate and integrated high-frequency <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> function for active vibration reduction, is likely the suitable solution at current technical level. Several potential implementation schemes are discussed, such as blades being directly or indirectly driven by actuators mounted in rotating frame and application {{of different types of}} actuators, especially implementation schemes of electro-mechanical actuator with or without gear reducer. It is found that swashplateless blade <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system based on specially designed limited angle direct-drive motor (LADDM) is a more practical implementation scheme. An experimental prototype of the finally selected implementation scheme has been designed, fabricated and tested on rotor tower.
