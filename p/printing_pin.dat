40|$|Normalization of {{the data}} of cDNA {{microarray}} is an obligatory step during microarray experiments due to the relatively frequent non-specific errors. Gener-ally, normalization of microarray data {{is based on the}} null hypothesis and variance model. In the Yang’s model (Yang et al., 2001), at least two types of noises are included. The one is additive noise and the other is multiplicative noise. Usually, background is considered as one of additive noise to the signal and the variation between the signal pixels is the representative multiplicative noise. In this study, the relation between the signal (spot intensity minus background intensity) and background was observed and the influence of background on normalization as a representative additive factor was investigated. Although the relation has not been considered as a factor affecting the normalization, it could improve the accuracy of microarray data when the normaliza-tion was carried out considering signal/background ratio. The background dependent normalization de-creased the number of genes whose expression lev-els were changed significantly and it could make their distribution more consistent through the whole range of signal intensities. In this study, <b>printing</b> <b>pin</b> dependent normalization was also carried out regarding the <b>printing</b> <b>pin</b> as a representative multi-plicative noise. It improved the distribution of spots in the Cy 3 -Cy 5 scatter plot, but its effect was slight. These studies suggest that there are some influ-ences of the signals on the local backgrounds and they must be considered for the normalization of cDNA microarray data...|$|E
40|$|Two-color DNA {{microarray}} {{data has}} proven valuable in high-throughput expression profiling. However microarray expression ratios (log 2 ratios) {{are subject to}} measurement error from multiple causes. Transcript abundance {{is expected to be}} a linear function of signal intensity (y = x) where the typical gene is nonresponsive. Once linearity is confirmed, applying the model by fitting log-scale data with simple linear regression reduces the standard deviation of the log 2 ratios. After which fewer genes are selected by filtering methods. Comparing the residuals of regression to leverage measures can identify the best candidate genes. Spatial bias in log 2 ratio, defined by <b>printing</b> <b>pin</b> and detected by ANOVA, can be another source of measurement error. Independently applying the linear normalization method to the data from each pin can easily eliminate this error. Less easily addressed is the problem of cross-homology which is expected to correlate to cross-hybridization. Pair-wise comparison of genes demonstrate that genes with similar sequences are measured as having similar expression. While this bias cannot be easily eliminated, the effect this probable cross-hybridization can be minimized in clustering by weighting methods introduced here...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{expression}} profiling using microarrays {{has become}} an important genetic tool. Spotted arrays prepared in academic labs {{have the advantage of}} low cost and high design and content flexibility, but are often limited by their susceptibility to quality control (QC) issues. Previously, we have reported a novel 3 -color microarray technology that enabled array fabrication QC. In this report we further investigated its advantage in spot-level data QC. Results We found that inadequate amount of bound probes available for hybridization led to significant, gene-specific compression in ratio measurements, increased data variability, and <b>printing</b> <b>pin</b> dependent heterogeneities. The impact of such problems can be captured through the definition of quality scores, and efficiently controlled through quality-dependent filtering and normalization. We compared gene expression measurements derived using our data processing pipeline with the known input ratios of spiked in control clones, and with the measurements by quantitative real time RT-PCR. In each case, highly linear relationships (R 2 > 0. 94) were observed, with modest compression in the microarray measurements (correction factor Conclusion Our microarray analytical and technical advancements enabled a better dissection of the sources of data variability and hence a more efficient QC. With that highly accurate gene expression measurements can be achieved using the cDNA microarray technology. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Successful {{microarray}} experimentation {{requires a}} complex interplay between the slide chemistry, the <b>printing</b> <b>pins,</b> the nucleic acid probes and targets, and the hybridization milieu. Optimization of these parameters and a careful evaluation of emerging slide chemistries are {{a prerequisite to}} any large scale array fabrication effort. We have developed a 'microarray meter' tool which assesses the inherent variations associated with microarray measurement prior to embarking on large scale projects. Findings The microarray meter consists of nucleic acid targets (reference and dynamic range control) and probe components. Different plate designs containing identical probe material were formulated to accommodate different robotic and pin designs. We examined the variability in probe quality and quantity (as judged {{by the amount of}} DNA printed and remaining post-hybridization) using three robots equipped with capillary <b>printing</b> <b>pins.</b> Discussion The generation of microarray data with minimal variation requires consistent quality control of the (DNA microarray) manufacturing and experimental processes. Spot reproducibility is a measure primarily of the variations associated with printing. The microarray meter assesses array quality by measuring the DNA content for every feature. It provides a post-hybridization analysis of array quality by scoring probe performance using three metrics, a) a measure of variability in the signal intensities, b) a measure of the signal dynamic range and c) a measure of variability of the spot morphologies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Microarrays {{were first}} {{developed}} to assess gene expression but are now {{also used to}} map protein-binding sites and to assess allelic variation between individuals. Regardless of the intended application, efficient production and appropriate array design are key determinants of experimental success. Inefficient production can make larger-scale studies prohibitively expensive, whereas poor array design makes normalisation and data analysis problematic. Results We have developed a user-friendly tool, SimArray, which generates a randomised spot layout, computes a maximum meta-grid area, and estimates the print time, in response to user-specified design decisions. Selected parameters include: the number of probes to be printed; the microtitre plate format; the <b>printing</b> <b>pin</b> configuration, and the achievable spot density. SimArray is compatible with all current robotic spotters that employ 96 -, 384 - or 1536 -well microtitre plates, and can be configured to reflect most production environments. Print time and maximum meta-grid area estimates facilitate evaluation of each array design for its suitability. Randomisation of the spot layout facilitates correction of systematic biases by normalisation. Conclusion SimArray is intended to help both established researchers and those new to the microarray field to develop microarray designs with randomised spot layouts that are compatible with their specific production environment. SimArray is an open-source program and is available from [URL]. </p...|$|E
40|$|Microarrays {{allow the}} {{expression}} level {{of thousands of}} genes to be measured simultaneously. This study will address analytical issues predominantly concerned with eDNA arrays. These include normalisation and data preprocessing, leading to an assessment of cluster analysis and the integration of database information to elucidate functional classes of biological relevance. This is then extended further to classify genes of unknown function using Markov Random Fields. I Modelling of uneven surface trends were considered in a new 2 D-normalisation method which outperformed the popular loess method which concentrated on <b>printing</b> <b>pin</b> effects. With respect to cluster analysis, a new method to identify the number of clusters in higher dimension da~a is proposed which provides a visual way of determining at which point over-fitting of the data will occur. Once partitioned, functional information was incorporated to find enrichment of classes in clusters using a new application of X 2 bootstrapping, which provides a very robust way of identifying these groups. A novel use of correspondence analysis {{was applied to the}} contingency tables produced from the cluster over class analysis which was used to show that functionally related groups were acting in concert when scrutinising the projection' of these classes onto three dimensions. The last part of this study attempted the use of Markov Random Fields to assign function to genes of unknown function using M. tuberculosis and E. coli data. The ability to determine function from the data used in this work was limited, but the method implemented in this study showed improvement over previous attempts.

5000|$|Characters {{were printed}} using a 5x7 dot matrix array of wires; the device {{from which it}} derived {{the shape of the}} {{character}} was a metal plate, called the [...] "code plate," [...] with space for 1960 pins (35 pins times 56 printable characters). If the dot was not to be printed in a given character, the pin was machined off. By correctly positioning the plate and pressing it against one end of the array of printing wires, only the correct wires were pressed against the ribbon and then the punched card. (This printer mechanism was generally considered by IBM Customer Engineers to be difficult to repair. One of the most common problems was wires breaking in the tightly curved narrow tube between the code plate and the ribbon - extracting the fragments and replacing the bundle of 35 wires was very tedious). The printing mechanism was prone to be damaged if a user attempted to duplicate [...] "binary" [...] cards with non-standard punch patterns. These could cause the code-plate positioning mechanism to try to shift the plate beyond its intended range of motion, sometimes causing damage. Turning off printing did not actually prevent the damage, as many people assumed, because the code-plate mechanism remained engaged with the punch unit and shifted the code plate. Turning off printing only suppressed pressing the <b>printing</b> <b>pins</b> into the ribbon and card.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: •	Investigate {{and extend}} the {{narrative}} potential of photographic and digital media. •	Produce media outcomes that activate dialogue on ecological issues. Overview: River / Road is a documentary project that visually investigates the ecology of a specific region, i. e. a 20 km tract of land and river connecting Hamilton and Ngaruawahia. The two centres are connected by River Road, an artery spanning a great diversity of urban and rural spaces; suburbs, new housing developments, farming, a land fill site and Turangawaewae Marae. The Waikato, a parallel artery, also offers a range of sites and activities; wildlife, recreation, industrial discharges. This tract of land and river offers a suitably diverse but discrete area for fieldwork. The research project is structured in three distinct phases: •	Stage One (2007 - 2008) involves background research and fieldwork, i. e. observational photography. During this stage a ‘topographical’ methodology was developed and employed. A mapping methodology anchored the photographic component around a series of nodes plotted along the river and road arteries, at approximately 700 metre intervals from start to finish. This resulted in 29 geographic nodes for photographic investigation, with each node yielding one photograph from the river and one photograph from the road. This pseudo-scientific ‘transect’ sampling technique was modeled on conventional biological field surveys. The methodology is also rooted {{in the tradition of}} topographic documentary surveys. •	Stage Two (2008 - 2009) involved a rigorous testing of the narrative potential of these photographs through the development and application of various editing and design strategies. Images were assessed for aesthetic value and content value. The major outcome was an exhibition of 58 prints, including wall maps and a digital interactive touchscreen computer at the Waikato Museum. Digital <b>prints</b> were <b>pinned</b> to the wall in sequence, without captions. Simon Nicholls was commissioned as a research assistant to design a touchscreen interactive computer display; this orientated viewers by locating photographs on a satellite map, offering written text to identify and discuss content. •	Stage Three (2010). A collaborative research project (photographer, designer, writer) will see the production of a manuscript for publication. Project outcomes are designed to activate dialogues on contestable issues such as kaitiakitanga, urban planning values, industrial development, ecological restoration and environmental values...|$|R

Mixtures {{of a model}} substrate (Dglucose) / inhibitor (D-glucal) couple have been inkjet printed on a target enzymatic monolayer (glucose oxidase) linked to a functionalized silicon oxide solid surface [1]. It has been possible to fabricate microarrays with quality factors as high as those of conventional <b>pin</b> <b>printing</b> spotting. By a simple horseradish-based colorimetric enzymatic assay, the detection of biological activity at the single spot has been proved. The figure shows a scheme of the platform: molecular inks of the enzymatic substrate or a substrate/inhibitor mixture are dispensed on the enzymatic-rich surface with detection at the single spots. Optical intensity measurements showed a competitive inhibition mechanism at the solid-liquid interface, along with overcompeting effects at lower inhibitor concentrations [2]. This methodology is extended to CYP 450 enzymes like CYP 3 A 4, {{one of the main}} targets for the phase I drug metabolism. In this respect, sol-gel enzymatic encapsulation strategies inside a polymer matrix prepared by MTMOS (methyltrimethoxysilane) precursors [3] or alginate are envisioned.

40|$|This {{research}} report takes {{a close look}} at pre-paid calling cards, a product which many consumers rely on - particularly people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Our research findings show that consumers looking to buy a pre-paid calling card are participating in what is essentially a lottery. With little useful information available about each card at the point-of-sale consumers run the very-real risk of purchasing a card that offers poor value for money. Pre-paid calling cards allow consumers to purchase credit for phone calls, which can be accessed via the unique <b>PIN</b> <b>printed</b> on each card. These products are primarily used to make international calls and to date, have received very little attention from regulators and academics. ACCAN commissioned ACA Research, a market research consultancy company, to conduct market research, product testing and desk research to determine if pre-paid calling cards work well for consumers. Key findings include: 	Only 28 % cards had any sort of in-store information about rates, terms and conditions. Only 17 % of cards had easy-to-find information in stores.    	 94 % of salespeople could not give the customer any information about calling rates, 100 % of salespeople could not provide information about terms and conditions. 	 40 % of cards had significant quality problems including failure to activate, poor call quality and instances where the number of minutes provided was significantly less than the number advertised. 	No cards’ actual rate per minute matched the advertised headline per-minute rate. The average actual rate per minute was 46. 78 cents with an average of 22. 04 cents difference between the advertised and the actual rate. This research paints a picture of a market in need of intervention. The final section of this paper explores alternative regulatory options, drawing on international examples in the hope of starting a discussion about the best way to move forward. Ultimately, the market should work well not just for consumers but for the calling card providers who are offering quality products. Currently it is difficult for consumers to identify the cards on the market which do offer great value along with simple and fair terms and conditions.

After {{his release from}} {{juvenile}} detention center, Pazhani had his name changed and left India to complete his education abroad. After his graduation he returned to India {{and is now a}} well established scientist. Siddarth uses the medical field for the wrong reasons and his own profit. Sengalvarayan is now the incumbent health and welfare minister in the minority government headed by the party leader. At that time Angelina, a Swiss pharmaceutical company owner and activist tries to make generic medicines for life-threatening diseases available in India at low cost affordable by poor people. Siddharth's assassin kills Angelina before she can sign the agreement document with the government and shoots Mithran at the same time. While he is recovering from the gunshot wound in the hospital, an electronic bug (GPS + audio transmitter) is implanted during surgery. Through the bug, Siddharth listens all of Mithran's plans and continuously monitors his whereabouts and whatever he talks via audio transmission. Then comes evidence against Siddharth in the form of Manimekalai (Abhinaya). She was a scientist at Siddharth's research lab, where a seaweed that can cure diabetes is found abundantly in the oceans. Siddharth tries to sell the technology and rights to extract medicine from the seaweed to multinational pharmaceutical companies but is opposed by Manimekalai. So Siddharth arranges goons and the goons rape and kill her. But before being killed, she records a video and stores it in an SD card so that someone will find it. But before Mithran can find the card, Siddharth finds out and assigns Vicky (Vamsi Krishna) to recover the card, but Mithran tells Jana to get the card. He successfully gets the card after a fight with Vicky, but through the bug Siddharth knows this and kills Jana. Mithran comes back to his special house where he finds a pin has been changed in a picture which {{turns out to be the}} picture of Ananya Miss world of 2011 and a close acquaintance of Siddharth whose girlfriend Shilpa (Mugdha Godse) was also part of that event. Mithran doubts whether Siddharth himself would have come to his house. Mahima checks the finger <b>prints</b> on the <b>pin</b> keeping the gun case Mithran received from Siddharth in his posting ceremony and the finger prints match. A flashback reveals that Siddharth killed Shilpa's father so that she would not participate in the competition and as she will not have a ticket to go to her father's funeral he requests to take her in his chartered flight and wins her over. Mithran frantically searches for the bug which he eventually finds out and removes.|$|R

40|$|The term reverse {{transfection}} {{comes from}} the invention and development of a microarray-driven gene expression system by Junald Ziauddin and David M. Sabatini in 2001. As DNA are printed on a glass slide for transfection process to occur before the addition of adherent cells, {{the order of addition}} of DNA and adherent cells is a reverse of that of conventional transfection. Hence the word “reverse” is used. ### Reverse Transfection Process **Preparation of transfection mix for printing onto a slide** DNA-gelatin mixture can be used for printing onto a slide: Gelatin powder is first dissolved in sterile MilliQ water to form 0. 2 % gelatin solution. Purified DNA plasmid is then mixed with gelatin solution and the final gelatin concentration is kept greater than 0. 17 %. Besides the use of gelatin, atelocollagen and fibronetin are also successful transfection vectors for introducing foreign DNA into the cell nucleus. **Printing of DNA-gelatin mixture onto a slide** After the DNA-gelatin mixture preparation, the mixture is pipetted onto a slide surface and then the slide is put into a petri dish with a cover. A drying chemical is added into the dish to dry up the solution. Finally, cultured cells are poured into the dish for plasmid uptake. However, with the invention of different types of microarray printing system, hundreds of transfection mixes containing different DNA of interest can be printed on the same slide for the uptake of plasmids by cells. There are 2 major kinds of microarray printing systems manufactured by different companies: Contact and non-contact printing system. An example of non-contact printing system is Piezorray Flexible Non-contact Microarraying System. It uses pressure control and a piezoelectric collar to squeeze out consistent drops of approximately 333 pL volume. The PiezoTip dispensers do not contact the surface to which the sample is dispensed, thus contamination potential is reduced and the risk of disrupting the target surface is eliminated. An examples of contact printing system is SpotArray 72 (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Inc) contact spotting system. Its printhead can accommodate up to 48 pins and creates compact arrays by selectively raising and lowering subsets of <b>pins</b> during <b>printing.</b> After <b>printing,</b> the <b>pins</b> are washed with a powerful pressure-jet pin washer and then vacuum-dried, eliminating carryover. Another example of contact printing system is Qarray system (Genetix Inc). It has three types of printing systems, QArray Mini, QArray 2 and QArray Max. After printing, the solution is allowed to dry up and the DNA-gelatin is sticked tightly at the position on the array. Use of HybridWell for reverse transfection of gelatin-DNA into cells on a slide Firstly, the adhesive from the HybriWell is peeled off and then attach the HybriWell over the area of the slide printed with the gelatin-DNA solution. Secondly, pipette 200 ul of transfection mix into one of the ports of HybriWell. The mix will distribute evenly over the array. Incubate the array at particular temperature and time length depending on the types of cells used. Thirdly, pipette away the transfection mix and pull off the HybriWell using a thin tipped forceps. Fourthly, put the printed slide treated with transfection reagent into a square dish with the printed-side facing up. Fifthly, gently pour the harvested cells onto the slides (don’t pour directly on the printed areas). Finally, place the dish in a 37 oC, 5 % CO 2 humidified incubator and incubate overnight. **Other transfection reagents for reverse transfection** Effectene Reagent is used in conjunction with the Enhancer and the DNA condensation buffer (Buffer EC) to achieve high transfection efficiencies. In the first step of Effectene–DNA complex formation, the DNA is condensed by interaction with the Enhancer in a defined buffer system. Effectene Reagent is then added to the condensed DNA to produce condensed Effectene–DNA complexes. The Effectene–DNA complexes are mixed with medium and directly added to the cells. Effectene Reagent spontaneously forms micelle structures that show no size or batch variation, as found with preformulated liposome reagents. This unique feature ensures excellent reproducibility of transfection complex formation. The process of highly condensing DNA molecules and then coating them with Effectene Reagent is a particularly effective way to transfer DNA into eukaryotic cells. **Advantages and disadvantages of reverse transfection techniques** The advantages of reverse transfection than conventional transfection are: Firstly, the addition and attachment of target cells to the DNA-loaded surface can lead to higher probability of cell-DNA contact, potentially leading to higher transfection efficiencies. Secondly, less labour-intensive and saving materials. Less DNA is required for the success of transfection. Thirdly, high throughput screening: each time hundreds of genes can be expressed in cells together on a single microarray for studying gene expression and regulation. Fourthly, parallel cell seeding in a single chamber for 384 experiments together with no physical separation between experiments increases the screening data quality. Well-to-well variations occur in experiments done in multiwall dishes. Fifthly, exact replicate arrays can be produced as same sample source plate can be dried and printed on different slides for storage at least 15 months without apparent loss of transfection efficiency. There is a disadvantage of using reverse transfection: Reverse transfection is more expensive because highly accurate and efficient microarray printing system is needed to print the DNA-gelatin solution onto the slides. Firstly, applications with different cell lines have so far required variations in the protocols to manufacture siRNA or plasmid arrays, which involves a considerable amount of development and testing. Secondly, possibility of cross-contamination of the array spots when spot densities increase; therefore, optimization of the array layout is important...|$|R
