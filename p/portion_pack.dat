50|$|The single-serve or single-cup coffeemaker {{has gained}} {{popularity}} in recent years. Single-serve brewing systems let {{a certain amount}} of water heated at a precise temperature go through a coffee <b>portion</b> <b>pack</b> (or coffee pod), brewing a standardized cup of coffee into a recipient placed under the beverage outlet. A coffee <b>portion</b> <b>pack</b> has an air-tight seal to ensure product freshness. It contains a determined quantity of ground coffee and usually encloses an internal filter paper for optimal brewing results. The single-serve coffeemaker technology often allows the choice of cup size and brew strength, and delivers a cup of brewed coffee rapidly, usually {{at the touch of a}} button. Today, a variety of beverages are available for brewing with single-cup machines such as tea, hot chocolate and milk-based specialty beverages.Single-cup coffee machines are designed for both home and commercial use.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes the}} full-scale {{installation of the}} wastewater treatment system at the <b>Portion</b> <b>Pack</b> Industries (Division of Heinz) plant in Chatsworth, California. The plant manufactures various products including salad dressing, sauces, ketchup, mayonnaise, honey mustard, toppings, condiments and other snack food products. More than twenty different products are manufactured at the same facility. Produced wastewater, therefore, varies on an hourly, daily and seasonal basis. Wastewater resulting from the manufacturing process contains significant amounts of suspended solids (TSS), fats, oil and grease (FOGs), and suspended and dissolved organics (COD and BOD), with occasional high salinity (sodium chloride). TSS and FOGs can sediment and deposit in pipes, pumps and tanks at the municipal treatment plant (POTW). It is therefore advisable to remove such contaminants on site and avoid costly fees and fines. Pilot studies indicated that hybrid centrifugal dissolved air flotation (the GEM System) can almost completely remove TSS and FOGs and significantly reduce COD and BODs. In Spring 2007, a system including large underground equalization tanks, screen, coagulation, flocculation, GEM System flotation, sludge draining and pH controls was installed. The treatment system removes TSS and FOGs to less than 20 and 1 mg/l respectively, while producing sludge with more than 20 % solids loading. The system responds very fast (within minutes) to changes in wastewater quality. CODs and BODs are also reduced (50 - 75 % reductions). Contaminants removal results in significant savings in fees and fines...|$|E

40|$|Food {{manufacturers}} {{are looking for}} new preservation techniques that don’t influence the fresh-like characteristics of products. Non-thermal pasteurisation of food with Pulsed Electric Fields (often referred to as PEF) is an emerging technology, where the change of the food is less than with thermal pasteurisation. With this method, pasteurisation is realised by electroporation of bacterial membranes, which prolong the shelf-life of the product. Existing PEF treatment {{is based on the}} application of the electric field prior to packaging. To avoid re-contamination of the product during packaging, it is packed aseptically (i. e. sterile). The goal of this research is to determine whether it is technologically possible to generate enough electric field in already packaged food products. This will make aseptic packaging machines superfluous. During this research it has been proved {{that it is possible to}} generate sufficient electric field in already packaged products and to reduce the initial amount of bacteria with 99. 9999 %. For the realisation of this technique, which is called PEF in-pack, an electrically-conductive plastic packaging material is used. To reduce the required electrical power during treatment, the technique can only applied on relatively small deformable packages up to 200 ml. To show how this technique can be introduced into existing food production lines, product cases have been worked out. <b>Portion</b> <b>packs</b> for liquid food and pharmaceuticals, for example, are possible product applications.

40|$|Abstract: The prime {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop a preservation method for garlic paste that could prevent adverse quality changes and render the paste more shelf stable. Three separate batches of fresh garlic bulbs of two Sudanese varieties (Dongla and Berber) harvested in December 2011 were collected, peeled manually, separated into individual sound cloves, divided into 5 equal portions and crushed in a blender until a smooth puree was obtained. Before crushing, portions were assigned randomly to chemical treatments (T 0 - T 4). Each garlic treated portion was subdivided into 2 equal <b>portions,</b> <b>packed</b> in glass containers,, stored at 25 C or 40 C for 6 months and analyzed at an interval of 2 months. Parameters measured were, proximate composition, pH, viscosity, sugars, total soluble solids (TSS), tannic acid and carbohydrates (CHO). Berber var. had high (p 0. 05) tannins but numerically low pH than Dongola var. These two components could render Berber var. less vulnerable to spoilage than Dongola. Irrespective of storage period, Dongola var. had higher (p 0. 05) reducing and total sugars while Berber had higher (p 0. 05) non reducing sugar. Also Irrespective of the chemical treatments (T 0 - T 4) moisture, fat, ash and crude fiber contents increased (p 0. 05) while TSS, CHO and protein contents decreased (p 0. 05) with the increase of the storage period. Treatments T 0 - T 4 caused variable effects increasing (TSS and crude fiber) or decreasing (moisture) some of the parameters measured...|$|R

40|$|Packaging {{plays an}} {{important}} role in protecting and preserving the quality of food and is therefore significant in any food manufacturing and distribution process. The shelf life of any food is limited due to the occurrence of many deteriorative processes and reactions within the food material. These include physical and chemical reactions and interactions between food and the ambient environment across the packaging material. Milk powder like any other food, is prone to such reactions and interactions with package resulting in degradation of its edible quality due to changes in smell, colour and texture, which ultimately renders it nutritionally and economically unacceptable. During distribution and storage the packaging system needs to stabilize the powder by ensuring optimum storage conditions are maintained. To ensure maximum shelf life it is essential to apply packaging systems that are optimally designed, to meet the requirements with respect to manufacturing as well as product protection in the distribution environment. In this thesis, the interactions between ambient environmental conditions, packaging material properties and the shelf life of a particular filled milk powder were investigated. Consequently, the requirements for a packaging system that can provide a two-year shelf life for the powder were determined. The filled milk powder is manufactured and packaged in bulk in Europe, imported into Africa via sea freight containers to be repacked into small <b>portion</b> <b>packs</b> and distributed in multiple African countries. Because of Africa's tropical conditions the packaged product is exposed to rather high levels of relative humidity and temperature during transportation and storage which influences the stability of the powder. The storage stability of the filled milk powder along with the barrier characteristics of the packaging was assessed in order to evaluate the theoretical shelf life of the powder in its current packaging system...|$|R

Breast {{portion of the}} dressed birds obtained from three different sources, viz. market/road side slaughtered chicken (MSC), retail slaughtered chicken (RSC), and scientifically slaughtered chicken (SSC), were cut into chunks, divided into 250 g <b>portions,</b> <b>packed</b> in polyethylene bags, stored at – 18 ± 1 ºC and evaluated at 30 days intervals for changes in quality attributes. Frozen storage had no marked influence on pH change of the samples. SSC samples had higher extract release volume (15. 34 ± 0. 08 to 13. 45 ± 0. 93 ml) than MSC (13. 00 ± 0. 19 to 9. 91 ± 0. 97 ml) and RSC samples (13. 65 ± 0. 24 to 11. 70 ± 1. 21 ml). There was significant increase (P< 0. 05) in thiobarbituric acid of all three sample types during storage but values were well below the threshold level of spoilage. SSC samples showed lower tyrosine content throughout frozen storage compared to MSC and RSC samples. A significant decline in microbial load, viz. total viable count, coliform count, psychrophilic count and yeast and moulds count were noticed during frozen storage. Organoleptic attributes, viz. appearance, flavour, texture and overall palatability were not affected due to frozen storage except juiciness in MSC samples which decreased (P< 0. 05) from 6. 53 ± 0. 13 to 5. 96 ± 0. 11 on 90 days of storage.

50|$|The dealer {{takes all}} of the cards in the pack, {{arranges}} {{them so that they}} are in a uniform stack, and shuffles them. In strict play, the dealer then offers the deck to the previous player (in the sense of the game direction) for cutting. If the deal is clockwise, this is the player to the dealer's right; if counterclockwise, it is the player to the dealer's left. The invitation to cut is made by placing the pack, face downward, on the table near the player who is to cut: who then lifts the upper <b>portion</b> of the <b>pack</b> clear of the lower portion and places it alongside. (Normally the two portions have about equal size. Strict rules often indicate that each portion must contain a certain minimum number of cards, such as three or five.)

40|$|Changes in {{physical}} (colour), chemical (moisture content and proteolysis index), texture and sensory characteristics of differently <b>packed</b> <b>portioned</b> Parmigiano Reggiano cheese were monitored during {{three months of}} storage at 4 °C. Packaging conditions were under vacuum (UV) and in modified atmosphere (MA) with 50 : 50 (MA 1) and 30 : 70 (MA 2) CO 2 /N 2 ratios. The results showed, in general, substantial changes in the differently packed products. All samples underwent proteolysis phenomena together with changes in the textural and sensory characteristics. The UV packed sample showed the occurrence of an oil dropping up phenomenon which caused significant changes in product characteristics such as an increase of cohesion, sourness and yellowness. The MA packed samples showed different textural behaviour (MA 2 sample evolved towards a more cohesive and friable structure than MA 1) and a similar evolution of the flavour profile that, after 90 days of storage, determined a softer taste than the unpacked cheese.

Packs tested included foil sealed thickened pudding, foil sealed thickened water, tetra pack, dessert, custard, jam, cereal, honey sachet and cheese portions. Results Honey sachets, cheese portions, foil sealed thickened pudding and tetra packs were the most difficult packs to open, with 15 % of cheese portions unable to be opened in either the bed or chair posture. Although grip strength was consistent for each posture, pinch grips and dexterity were adversely affected by the bed posture. Lying in a hospital bed required greater pinch strength and dexterity to open packs. Conclusions Eating in a seated position when in hospital has been shown to improve intake. The present study demonstrates that eating in a seated posture is also advantageous for opening the food and beverage packs used in the NSW hospital food service and supports the notion that patients should sit to eat in hospital...|$|R
40|$|The {{red meat}} supply chain relies upon {{packaging}} at varies {{stages of the}} supply chain, to protect, contain, distribute, promote and sell its products. Food safety compliance and product integrity are also paramount. Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), who deliver marketing, research and development services for Australia&# 039;s cattle, sheep and goat producers are interested in understanding the role packaging plays and the trends within the red meat supply chain {{that enable them to}} help position Australian red meat producers, both domestically and in export. This report presents a review of current and emerging packaging technologies and trends related to red meat (beef, veal, sheep, goat and mutton). The review comprised of a desk-top literature review, attendance at local packaging conference held in May and June 2014 in Australia and interviewing a suite of stakeholders across the red meat supply chain. Emerging packaging technologies included in this review are modified atmosphere (MAP) and vacuum packaging; active packaging that incorporates specific compounds into a packaging material, on its surface, onto the product directly or as a separate co-packaged component; and intelligent packaging technologies such as integrity and freshness sensors, time-temperature indicators and radio frequency identification tags (RFIDs). Existing knowledge of these technologies are presented alongside challenges and barriers but also opportunities to exploit. Sustainability, supply chain and consumer trends and issues were also explored.

40|$|Larger {{portions}} {{as well as}} larger packs {{can lead}} to larger prospective consumption estimates, larger servings and increased consumption, described as 'portion-size effects' and 'pack size effects'. Although related, the effects of <b>pack</b> sizes on <b>portion</b> estimates have received less attention. While {{it is not possible}} to generalize consumer behaviour across cultures, external cues taken from pack size may affect us all. We thus examined whether <b>pack</b> sizes influence <b>portion</b> size estimates across cultures, leading to a general 'pack size effect'. We compared portion size estimates based on digital presentations of different product pack sizes of solid and liquid products. The study with 13, 177 participants across six European countries consisted of three parts. Parts 1 and 2 asked participants to indicate the number of portions present in a combined photographic and text-based description of different pack sizes. The estimated portion size was calculated as the quotient of the content weight or volume of the food presented and the number of stated portions. In Part 3, participants stated the number of food items that make up a portion when presented with packs of food containing either a small or a large number of items. The estimated portion size was calculated as the item weight times the item number. For all three parts and across all countries, we found that participants' portion estimates were based on larger <b>portions</b> for larger <b>packs</b> compared to smaller packs (Part 1 and 2) as well as more items to make up a portion (Part 3); hence, portions were stated to be larger in all cases.
