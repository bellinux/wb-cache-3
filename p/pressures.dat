5000|$|The Bernoulli {{equation}} {{applicable to}} incompressible flow {{shows that the}} stagnation <b>pressure</b> {{is equal to the}} dynamic <b>pressure</b> plus static <b>pressure.</b> Total <b>pressure</b> is also equal to dynamic <b>pressure</b> plus static <b>pressure</b> so, in incompressible flows, stagnation <b>pressure</b> is equal to total <b>pressure.</b> (In compressible flows, stagnation <b>pressure</b> is also equal to total <b>pressure</b> providing the fluid entering the stagnation point is brought to rest isentropically.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Blood <b>pressure</b> is a gauge <b>pressure,</b> {{which means}} it is {{measured}} relative to ambient <b>pressure.</b> To calculate blood <b>pressure,</b> {{it has to be}} summed to ambient <b>pressure</b> for calculating when blood will boil. This is similar to a flat automobile tire: even with zero gauge <b>pressure,</b> a flat tire at altitude of the Armstrong limit would still have an absolute <b>pressure</b> (<b>pressure</b> relative to a perfect vacuum) of , that is, it will have the ambient <b>pressure</b> at the altitude where the 6.3 kPA <b>pressure</b> level occurs (about 18 km), both inside and out of it. If one inflates the tire to non-zero gauge <b>pressure,</b> this internal <b>pressure</b> is in addition to those [...] of ambient <b>pressure.</b> This means that for an individual with a diastolic low blood <b>pressure,</b> typically , the person's blood <b>pressure</b> would be , the sum of the blood <b>pressure</b> and the ambient <b>pressure.</b> This <b>pressure</b> is more than twice the ambient <b>pressure</b> at the Armstrong limit. This extra <b>pressure</b> is more than sufficient to prevent blood from outright boiling at 18 km while the heart is still beating.|$|R
30|$|However, {{when the}} {{difference}} (skeleton <b>pressure)</b> between the overburden <b>pressure</b> and fluid <b>pressure</b> (pore <b>pressure,</b> formation <b>pressure)</b> is decreased, the elastic {{parameters of the}} skeleton decrease and their corresponding velocities are decreased as well. In such case, the fluid <b>pressure</b> is increased on {{the expense of the}} skeleton <b>pressure,</b> and abnormal high <b>pressure</b> is generated.|$|R

5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma {{that needs to}} be near the surface of the earth. The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas.

50|$|In physiology, intrapleural <b>pressure</b> (also called intrathoracic <b>pressure)</b> {{refers to}} the <b>pressure</b> within the pleural cavity. Normally, the <b>pressure</b> within the pleural cavity is {{slightly}} less than the atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> in {{what is known as}} negative <b>pressure.</b> When the pleural cavity is damaged/ruptured and the intrapleural <b>pressure</b> becomes equal to or exceeds the atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> pneumothorax may ensue.|$|R
40|$|Mean {{arterial}} <b>pressure</b> and intracranial <b>pressure</b> {{were measured}} serially in six infants with intracranial hypertension (intracranial <b>pressure</b> greater than 20 mm Hg), and cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> was calculated from their difference. Overall, mean arterial <b>pressure</b> increased with rising intracranial <b>pressure</b> at a mean rate of 0. 20 mm Hg/mm Hg. This caused a fall in cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> with increasing intracranial <b>pressure</b> at a mean rate of 0. 80 mm Hg/mm Hg overall, although cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> was well maintained in one infant. Thus {{the rise in}} blood <b>pressure</b> was usually insufficient {{to compensate for the}} increase in intracranial <b>pressure.</b> In infants with acute encephalopathy vigorous blood <b>pressure</b> support is as important as lowering intracranial <b>pressure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Stroke-related tissue <b>pressure</b> {{increase}} in the core and penumbra determines regional cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> (rCPP) defined as a difference between local inflow <b>pressure</b> and venous or tissue <b>pressure,</b> whichever is higher. We previously showed that venous <b>pressure</b> reduction below the <b>pressure</b> in the core causes blood flow diversion–cerebral venous steal. Now we investigated how transition to collateral circulation after complete arterial occlusion affects rCPP distribution. Methods—We modified parallel Starling resistor model to simulate transition to collateral inflow after complete main stem occlusion. We decreased venous <b>pressure</b> from the arterial <b>pressure</b> to zero and investigated how arterial and venous <b>pressure</b> elevation augments rCPP. Results—When core <b>pressure</b> exceeded venous, rCPPinflow <b>pressure</b> in the core. Venous <b>pressure</b> decrease from arterial <b>pressure</b> to <b>pressure</b> in the core caused smaller inflow <b>pressure</b> to drop augmenting rCPP. Further drop of venous <b>pressure</b> decreased rCPP in the core but augmented rCPP in penumbra. After transition to collateral circulation, lowering venous <b>pressure</b> below <b>pressure</b> in the penumbra further decreased rCPP and collaterals themselves became a pathway for steal. Venous <b>pressure</b> level at which rCPP in the core becomes zero we termed the “point of no reflow. ” Transition from direct to collateral circulation resulted in decreased inflow <b>pressure,</b> decreased rCPP, and a shift of point of no reflow to higher venous loading values. Arterial <b>pressure</b> augmentation increased rCPP, but only after venous <b>pressure</b> exceeded point of n...|$|R
5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial <b>pressures</b> of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial <b>pressures</b> of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial <b>pressures,</b> or shorter exposures to very high partial <b>pressures,</b> can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|E

50|$|This sensor {{measures}} the <b>pressure</b> relative to atmospheric <b>pressure.</b> A tire <b>pressure</b> gauge {{is an example}} of gauge <b>pressure</b> measurement; when it indicates zero, then the <b>pressure</b> it is measuring {{is the same as the}} ambient <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
5|$|At high <b>pressures</b> (more {{than about}} 20atm or twoMPa), {{a mixture of}} helium and oxygen (heliox) can lead to {{high-pressure}} nervous syndrome, a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding {{a small amount of}} nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.|$|E

5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is {{a method}} by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high <b>pressures,</b> as the growth typically occurs at <b>pressures</b> under 27 kPa.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure.
