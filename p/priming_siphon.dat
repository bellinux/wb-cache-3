40|$|A self {{activated}} siphon, {{which is}} also known as self siphon or self <b>priming</b> <b>siphon,</b> is simulated using molecular dynamics (MD) method in order to study its behavior, especially why it has a critical height that prevents fluid from flowing through it. The trajectory of the fluid interface with air in front of the flow or the head is also fitted the trajectory modeled by parametric equations, which is derived from geometry construction of the self siphon. Numerical equations solved using MD method is derived from equations of motion of the head which is obtained by introducing all considered forces influencing the movement of it. Time duration needed for fluid to pass the entire tube of the self siphon, τ, obtained from the simulation is compared quantitatively to the observation data from the previous work and it shows inverse behavior. Length of the three vertical segments are varied independently using a parameter for each segment, which are N 5, N 3, and N 1. Room parameters of N 5, N 3, and N 1 are constructed and the dependency of τ to these parameters are discussed...|$|E
50|$|Large siphons {{may be used}} in {{municipal}} waterworks and industry. Their size requires control via valves at the intake, outlet and crest of the siphon. The <b>siphon</b> may be <b>primed</b> by closing the intake and outlets and filling the siphon at the crest. If intakes and outlets are submerged, a vacuum pump may be applied at the crest to <b>prime</b> the <b>siphon.</b> Alternatively the <b>siphon</b> may be <b>primed</b> by a pump at either the intake or outlet.|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} {{retrieval}} of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells by density-gradient medium based centrifugation for subsequent {{analysis of the}} leukocytes on an integrated microfluidic "Lab-on-a-Disc" cartridge. Isolation of white blood cells constitutes a critical sample preparation step for many bioassays. Centrifugo-pneumatic siphon valves are particularly suited for blood processing as they function without need of surface treatment and are 'low-pass', i. e., holding at high centrifugation speeds and opening upon reduction of the spin rate. Both 'hydrostatically' and 'hydrodynamically' triggered centrifugo-pneumatic siphon valving schemes are presented. Firstly, the geometry of the pneumatic chamber of hydrostatically <b>primed</b> centrifugo-pneumatic <b>siphon</b> valves is optimised to enable smooth and uniform layering of blood {{on top of the}} density-gradient medium; this feature proves to be key for efficient Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell extraction. A theoretical analysis of hydrostatically primed valves is also presented which determines the optimum priming pressure for the individual valves. Next, 'dual siphon' configurations for both hydrostatically and hydrodynamically <b>primed</b> centrifugo-pneumatic <b>siphon</b> valves are introduced; here plasma and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells are extracted through a distinct siphon valve. This work represents a first step towards enabling on disc multi-parameter analysis. Finally, the efficiency of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells extraction in these structures is characterised using a simplified design. A microfluidic mechanism, which we termed phase switching, is identified which affects the efficiency of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell extraction...|$|R
50|$|A siphon {{makes use}} of the {{difference}} in the height between the intake and the outlet to create a pressure difference needed to remove excess water. <b>Siphons</b> however require <b>priming</b> or the removal of air in the bend {{in order for them to}} function and most siphon spillways are designed with a system that {{makes use of}} water to remove the air and automatically <b>prime</b> the <b>siphon.</b> One such design is the volute siphon which makes use of water forced into a spiral vortex by volutes or fins on a funnel that draw air out of the system. The priming happens automatically when the water level rises above the inlets that are used to drive the priming process.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the upper}} {{reservoir}} {{is such that}} the liquid there can rise above {{the height of the}} siphon crest, the rising liquid in the reservoir can [...] "self-prime" [...] the siphon and the whole apparatus be described as a [...] "self-siphon". Once <b>primed,</b> such a <b>siphon</b> will continue to operate until the level of the upper reservoir falls below the intake of the siphon. Such self-priming siphons are useful in some rain gauges and dams.|$|R
50|$|A siphon {{spillway}} in a dam {{is usually not}} technically a siphon as it is generally used to drain elevated water levels. However, a {{siphon spillway}} operates as an actual siphon if it raises the flow higher than {{the surface of the}} source reservoir, as sometimes is the case when used in irrigation. In operation, a siphon spillway is considered to be 'pipe flow' or 'closed duct flow'. A normal spillway flow is pressurized by the height of the reservoir above the spillway whereas a siphon flow rate is governed by the difference in height of the inlet and outlet. Some designs make use of an automatic system that uses the flow of water in a spiral vortex to remove the air above to <b>prime</b> the <b>siphon.</b> Such a design includes the volute siphon.|$|R
50|$|A {{plain tube}} {{can be used}} as a siphon. An {{external}} pump has to be applied to start the liquid flowing and <b>prime</b> the <b>siphon.</b> This can be a human mouth. This is sometimes done with any leak-free hose to siphon gasoline from a motor vehicle's gasoline tank to an external tank. (Siphoning gasoline by mouth often results in the accidental swallowing of gasoline, or aspirating it into the lungs, which can cause death or lung damage.) If the tube is flooded with liquid before part of the tube is raised over the intermediate high point and care is taken to keep the tube flooded while it is being raised, no pump is required. Devices sold as siphons often come with a siphon pump to start the siphon process.|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} centrifugal microfluidic platforms pumping {{is restricted}} to outward fluid flow, resulting in potential real estate issues for embedding complex microsystems. To overcome the limitation, researchers utilize hydrophilic channels to force liquids short distances back toward the disk center. However, most polymers used for CD fabrication are natively hydrophobic, and creating hydrophilic conditions requires surface treatments/specialized materials that pose unique challenges to manufacturing and use. This work describes a novel technology that enjoys the advantages of hydrophilic fluidics on a hydrophobic disk device constructed from untreated polycarbonate plastic. The method, termed suction-enhanced siphoning, is based on exploiting the non-linear hydrostatic pressure profile and related pressure drop created {{along the length of}} a rotating microchannel. Theoretical analysis as well as experimental validation of the system is provided. In addition, we demonstrate the use of the hydrostatic pressure pump as a new method for <b>priming</b> hydrophobic-based <b>siphon</b> structures. The development of such techniques for hydrophobic fluidics advances the capabilities of the centrifugal microfluidic platform while remaining true to the goal of creating disposable polymer devices using feasible manufacturing schemes. close...|$|R
40|$|Centrifugal {{microfluidics}} {{has emerged}} as a unique approach to the development of integrated total analysis systems for medical diagnostics. However, despite its many advantages, the platform has a size limitation due to the centripetal pumping mechanism in which fluids can only be moved {{from the center of the}} disc to the rim. This limits the footprint of the microfluidic network to one radius of the disc, and this in turn limits the amount of space available to embed complex assays. In order to overcome this space limitation problem, we are developing new techniques to pump fluids back toward the center of the disc as to allow greater path lengths for the fluidic network. This study presents a novel pumping mechanism for centrifugal microfluidics utilizing a combination of centrifugation and pneumatic compression. Pneumatic energy is stored during high-speed centrifugation with sample fluids trapping then compressing air in specially designed chambers. The accumulated pneumatic energy is released by spinning down, which expands the trapped air and thus pumps liquids back toward the center of the CD. This newly developed method overcomes current limitations of centripetal pumping avoiding external manipulation or surface treatments. In this article, we explore the design of appropriate chambers to induce pneumatic pumping and analytically describe the mechanics behind the pumping action. For proof of principle, we have applied pneumatic pumping to <b>siphon</b> <b>priming...</b>|$|R
