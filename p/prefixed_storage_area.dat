The <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> was more expensive to maintain and had a larger staff than the market itself, though refrigerating the basement <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> was thought to be well worth the high cost. It allowed merchants to keep seasonal products in stock all year round for the first time. Third parties also leased the <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> for storing other goods.

In this paper we present a formal definition of the <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> network design problem. We summarise an approach from Hewlett-Packard Laboratories for solving this problem that considers all possible network components and uses mixedinteger programming to select a design. We also summarise a preprocessing method that significantly reduces the size of this formulation. We then present a new formulation that uses generic components instead of including all possible components. We modify the preprocessing method to provide an cost function for the generic components. The size of our generic formulation is a significant reduction from the size of the Hewlett-Packard formulation. We compare the two formulations using a small example <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> network design problem. Key words: Integer programming; network design; <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> networks...|$|R
