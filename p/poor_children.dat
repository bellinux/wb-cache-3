5|$|He was {{not only}} {{concerned}} with higher education, but also with primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for <b>poor</b> <b>children.</b> In those schools, students would learn to read and learn basic maths and the catechism. He thought that this would help to raise people willing to work, and reduce laziness.|$|E

5|$|Dickens {{was touched}} by the lot of <b>poor</b> <b>{{children}}</b> in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered after seeing children working in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by {{a visit to the}} Field Lane Ragged school, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.|$|E

5|$|In 1832 the Gibraltar Public School, a free English-language {{establishment}} for <b>poor</b> <b>children,</b> {{was set up}} in a government-owned {{building on}} Flat Bastion Road. Funded by the contributions of wealthy people in the colony, it was open to children of all faiths. By 1833, there were 181 boys and 99 girls at the school. After boys were excluded in 1897, it continued as a school for girls into the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{there was a}} school for <b>poor</b> <b>children,</b> which moved in a {{four-year}} cycle between Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys, Bryncroes and Y Rhiw. The Elementary Education Act 1870 provided for local school boards, but was opposed by the established church. The process of establishing boards was lengthy, and the government had to enforce the regulations in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw; the national school opened at Y Rhiw in 1877 and had 74 pupils on its register; it closed in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Eva {{was well}} {{received}} in Spain, where she visited the tombs of Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the Capilla Real de Granada.

During her visit to Spain, Eva handed out 100-peseta notes to many <b>poor</b> <b>children</b> she met on her journey. She also received from Franco the highest award given by the Spanish government, the Order of Isabella the Catholic.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to meet the UN's goal of {{reducing}} the number of hungry people in the world by half by 2015, Ambassador McGovern formulated detailed plans, urging delivery of more surplus food to foreign school-lunch programs and the establishment of specific targets such as had been done in old American programs. He began working again with fellow former Senator Bob Dole to convince the Senate to support this effort, as well as expanded school lunch, food stamps, and nutritional help for pregnant women and <b>poor</b> <b>children</b> in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Robert Raikes, Trimmer {{also became}} {{active in the}} Sunday school movement, {{founding}} the first Sunday school for <b>poor</b> <b>children</b> in Old Brentford in 1786. She {{and two of the}} ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the <b>poor</b> <b>children</b> of the neighborhood. Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer's Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil. The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls. While some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately. The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—"a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desired them". Trimmer's schools became so well known and admired that Raikes, Trimmer's initial inspiration, recommended those who needed assistance organizing a Sunday school to turn to Trimmer; even Queen Charlotte asked Trimmer's advice on founding a Sunday school at Windsor.|$|E

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. <b>Poor</b> <b>children</b> in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Vick {{has been}} a {{principal}} in two charitable foundations, the Michael Vick Foundation and The Vick Foundation. In June 2006, Vick, along with his brother Marcus and mother Brenda, established The Vick Foundation, a nonprofit organization to support at-risk youth with after-school programs in the Metro Atlanta and Hampton Roads areas. The announcement of the new organization came just {{before the start of}} the foundation's first fundraiser, the Michael Vick Golf Classic. The inaugural event was held at the prestigious Kingsmill Golf Course in James City County near Williamsburg, Virginia in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter, and raised more than $80,000 for charity. According to its 2006 federal tax return, the Michael Vick Foundation provided 100 backpacks to <b>poor</b> <b>children</b> in Newport News and paid for an after-school program. The foundation spent 12% of its 2006 budget – $20,590 of $171,823 – on charitable programs and paid its fundraiser, Susan Bass Roberts, a former spokeswoman for Vick, $97,000. The foundation ceased operations that year. One of Vick's financial advisors withdrew $50,000 – most of the remaining funds – from its checking account in 2008.|$|E
