The remaining four rows are better <b>proportioned.</b> The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better <b>proportioned.</b> The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.|$|E

The game {{builds on the}} visual changes brought to the series by Final Fantasy VII, including use 3D graphics and pre-rendered backgrounds, while also departing from many Final Fantasy traditions. It is the first Final Fantasy to use realistically <b>proportioned</b> characters consistently, feature a vocal piece as its theme music, forego the use of magic points for spellcasting, and deviate from the series' traditional means of increasing a character's power.|$|E
5|$|The forelimb {{bones of}} azhdarchids and ornithocheirids were unusually long {{compared}} to other pterosaurs, and, in azhdarchids, {{the bones of the}} arm and hand (metacarpals) were particularly elongated. Furthermore, as a whole, azhdarchid front limbs were <b>proportioned</b> similarly to fast-running ungulate mammals. Their hind limbs, on the other hand, were not built for speed, but they were long compared with most pterosaurs, and allowed for a long stride length. While azhdarchid pterosaurs probably could not run, they would have been relatively fast and energy efficient.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{the medieval}} parish church of St Mary in Old Town, another {{remarkable}} church building in Eastbourne is the redbrick St Saviour's and St Peter's. Originally consecrated under the former name in 1872, it was designed by George Edmund Street but merged with St Peter’s in 1971 when the latter was made redundant and demolished. The Catholic Church of Our Lady of Ransom is a generously <b>proportioned</b> building with a tall Gothic interior. One of the windows commemorates the exiled Polish-Lithuanian nobleman, Prince Lev Sapieha, {{who lived in the}} town, and there is much other artwork in the building. The recently formed Personal Ordinariate of Anglicans reconciled to the Catholic Church meets at St Agnes, another Victorian Gothic building.|$|E
5|$|ITC Garamond {{was created}} by Tony Stan in 1975, and follows ITC's house style of unusually high x-height. It was {{initially}} intended {{to serve as a}} display version but has been used for text, in which its tight spacing and high x-height gives it a somewhat hectoring appearance. As a result, it has proven somewhat controversial among designers; it is generally considered poorly <b>proportioned</b> for body text. It remains the corporate font of the California State University system in printed text. As seen below, it was also modified into Apple Garamond which served as Apple's corporate font from 1984 until replacement starting in 2002 with Myriad. Publishers using it included O'Reilly Media and French publisher Actes Sud.|$|E

Simultaneously, the drive for enhanced realism across all major design aspects which started with the preceding series continued for Joe 90. Main character puppets from Captain Scarlet were re-used for Joe 90 with the exceptions of the Captain Scarlet and Captain Blue marionettes. Few new puppets were constructed, the only notable exceptions being Professor McClaine (sculpted by Mary Turner), Joe (sculpted by Tim Cooksey), and Mrs Harris.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the facial divine <b>proportion</b> {{and its relationship}} with facial attractiveness in North Indian population. Materials and Methods: For evaluation of various facial <b>proportions,</b> standardized frontal facial photographs of total 300 subjects between 18 and 30 years of age were obtained. Black and white copies of these photographs were presented {{in front of an}} evaluation jury for assigning scores of facial attractiveness and finally 130 attractive subjects were selected. These subjects were divided into two groups, Group I (attractive females n = 65) and Group II (attractive males n = 65) and they were further analyzed for various parameters of facial <b>proportions.</b> Unpaired Student′s t-test was used to compare both groups. Results: Group I showed that five of seven vertical facial <b>proportions</b> were close to divine <b>proportion</b> (1. 618) whereas only two vertical <b>proportions</b> in Group II were close to it. Transverse facial <b>proportions</b> in both groups deviated more from divine <b>proportion</b> (1. 618) and were closer to silver <b>proportion</b> (1. 414). Conclusions: Most of the facial <b>proportions</b> of attractive females in the North-Indian population were close to the divine <b>proportion.</b> Thus, facial divine <b>proportion</b> could be an important factor in the perception of facial attractiveness of North-Indian attractive females...|$|R

50|$|A simple {{example of}} a {{binomial}} distribution is the set of various possible outcomes, and their probabilities, {{for the number of}} heads observed when a (not necessarily fair) coin is flipped ten times. The observed binomial <b>proportion</b> is the fraction of the flips which turn out to be heads. Given this observed <b>proportion,</b> the confidence interval for the true <b>proportion</b> innate in that coin is a range of possible <b>proportions</b> which may contain the true <b>proportion.</b> A 95% confidence interval for the <b>proportion,</b> for instance, will contain the true <b>proportion</b> 95% of the times that the procedure for constructing the confidence interval is employed. Note that {{this does not mean that}} a calculated 95% confidence interval will contain the true <b>proportion</b> with 95% probability. Instead, one should interpret it as follows: the process of drawing a random sample and calculating an accompanying 95% confidence interval will generate a confidence interval that contains the true <b>proportion</b> in 95% of all cases. If we were to take 100 different samples and compute a 95% confidence interval for each sample, then (approximately) 95 of the 100 confidence intervals will contain the true <b>proportion.</b> In practice, however, we select one random sample and generate one confidence interval, which may or may not contain the true <b>proportion.</b> Each observed interval may over- or underestimate the true <b>proportion.</b>|$|R
5|$|However, the two western towers left of {{the church}} display an unusual detail in the painting. The uniformly <b>proportioned,</b> large, square windows {{depicted}} there {{are associated with the}} Italian Renaissance, which was introduced in Sweden in 1572 during reconstruction of Kalmar Castle. While the construction works of Gustav Vasa are poorly documented, the presence of these windows in Stockholm in 1535 is unlikely. It seems more credible that this part of the painting had been damaged before 1632, forcing the copyist to rely on another source. As the two square and crenellated towers in the painting are depicted much as they appear on a copperplate of Stockholm produced by Frantz Hogenberg around 1560–1570, the painting thus probably renders this part of the castle as it appeared while the reconstruction was still under way, before its completion in the 1580s.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation console saw {{the release}} of three main Final Fantasy games. The 1997 title Final FantasyVII {{moved away from the}} {{two-dimensional}} (2D) graphics used in the first six games to three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics; the game features polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds. It also introduced a more modern setting, a style that was carried over to the next game. It was also the second in the series to be released in Europe, with the first being Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Final Fantasy VIII was published in 1999, and was the first to consistently use realistically <b>proportioned</b> characters and feature a vocal piece as its theme music. Final FantasyIX, released in 2000, returned to the series' roots by revisiting a more traditional Final Fantasy setting rather than the more modern worlds of VII and VIII.|$|E
5|$|Xiaoming Wang and Richard H. Tedford, {{one of the}} {{foremost}} authorities on carnivore evolution, proposed that the genus Canis was the descendant of the coyote-like Eucyon davisi and its remains first appeared in the Miocene 6million years ago (Mya) in the southwestern USA and Mexico. By the Pliocene (5Mya), the larger Canis lepophagus appeared in the same region and by the early Pleistocene (1Mya) C.latrans (the coyote) was in existence. They proposed that the progression from Eucyon davisi to Clepophagus to the coyote was linear evolution. Additionally, C.edwardii, C.latrans, and C. aureus form together a small clade and because C.edwardii appeared earliest spanning the mid-Blancan (late Pliocene) to the close of the Irvingtonian (late Pleistocene), it is proposed as the direct ancestor of the coyote. Johnston describes C.lepophagus as having a more slender skull and skeleton than the modern coyote. Ronald Nowak found that the early populations had small, delicate, narrowly <b>proportioned</b> skulls that resemble small coyotes and appear to be ancestral to C.latrans.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, Kitase knew {{he wanted}} a {{thematic}} combination of fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed to include a cast of characters {{who appeared to be}} ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director Tetsuya Nomura and art director Yusuke Naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically <b>proportioned</b> characters—a departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game, and the use of motion capture technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's full motion video sequences. The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 minutes longer than the FMV sequences in VII. Motion capture was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture. A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of VII, and the aim for more realistic characters. A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, {{veterinarian}} {{and professor}} Veikko Rislakki (then Svanberg) proposed a different theory in his doctoral thesis. He argued that {{three types of}} wild horses existed in Europe, one of which he {{believed to be the}} Przewalski's Horse. Rislakki believed this unrefined and notably large-headed type was the horse the early Finns encountered about 1000 BCE. He suggested that the Finns later encountered other peoples and horses south of the Gulf of Finland, and that these peoples had better <b>proportioned</b> horses with a shorter muzzle and wider forehead, descended from the Tarpan. In addition, Rislakki suggested that the Finns came across European horses of Spanish and French origin during the first few centuries CE, larger in size and with narrow foreheads. Rislakki believed that his craniometric examinations, carried out in the 1920s, proved the influence of all these three horse types. Almost 20 years later, during the Continuation War, Rislakki also measured Karelian horses, and proposed they also came from an original Northern European animal descended from the Tarpan. Modern studies have discredited theories suggesting modern domesticated horse breeds descending from the Tarpan or the Przewalski's horse. The modern Konik horse resembles the extinct Tarpan however.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} hosts {{a maximum}} of 16 players. The game features three standard game modes along with modes exclusive to each system: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Sabotage (exclusive to Xbox and PC), The Hunt (exclusive to PC, PS2 and GameCube), and Power-Up (exclusive to PC and PS2). Depending on the platform, players in online and offline modes (against bots) range from 4 to 16. The GameCube version {{does not have any}} online modes, while the PC version excludes the multi-screen modes but includes a map editor. There are 13 maps on Deathmatch plus one additional on Team Deathmatch, while 5 on Capture the Flag and 3 on Sabotage. The player can choose from among 10 different character appearances, but 99 more are available in unofficial skin packs for PC players, the most recent being 2.0. Four additional animal skins (shark, duck, bat, dog, seagull) may be downloaded. As their bodies are not realistically <b>proportioned,</b> new or inexperienced players may face difficulty in distinguishing the skin's exact body. Cheating in both multiplayer and singleplayer is possible, as the software does not include any anti-cheat protection.|$|E

5|$|The tall flint {{tower of}} StMichael's at Ocklynge {{is one of}} Eastbourne's landmarks. The church was consecrated in 1902 and built {{on the site of}} the mission hall where the {{nonsense}} writer Lewis Carroll (the clergyman CL Dodgson) is known to have preached during his holidays in the town. All Souls, in Italian style, is a finely <b>proportioned</b> building with an Evangelical church tradition. Holy Trinity also has a strong history of Evangelism, particularly during the early 20th century when Canon Stephen Warner was the vicar for 28 years. There is a Greek Orthodox Church converted from a 19th-century Calvinistic chapel. The Strict Baptist Chapel in Grove Road is an interesting building, despite its rather grim street frontage. The United Reformed Church in Upperton Road has tall rogue Gothic windows set in red brick walls. Several other denominations have similarly interesting church buildings, including some of 20th century design, such as the Baptist Church in Eldon Road. The copyrights of many well-known hymns used in the English-speaking world are handled by Kingway's Thankyou Music of Eastbourne.

40|$|Background: The width {{ratio of}} teeth is an {{important}} factor in dental and facial esthetics. The Golden <b>proportion</b> (62 %) and the recurring esthetic dental <b>proportion</b> (RED) are two theories in this field that have been suggested to create harmony among anterior teeth. These have rarely been studied among the Iranian population. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the Golden <b>proportion</b> and RED <b>proportion</b> in students, staff, and patients of Shahed dental school. Patients and Methods: This study was conducted with 116 subjects in Shahed dental school photographs of the subject’s anterior teeth were taken from the frontal view. The perceived width ratios of canine to lateral incisor and lateral incisor to central incisor were calculated. In this study, the Golden <b>proportion</b> was evaluated within the range of 0. 55 – 0. 64. To evaluate the existence of the RED <b>proportion</b> in each subject, the width ratio of canine to lateral incisor was compared with the width ratio of lateral incisor to central incisor. Results: The Golden <b>proportion</b> existed in 25 % of the perceived width ratios of lateral incisor to central incisor, and 2. 1 % of the width ratios of canine to lateral incisor in natural dentition. The RED <b>proportion</b> existed in 18. 5 % of subjects, and the most recurring <b>proportion</b> was 0. 73 in these subjects. Conclusions: The Golden <b>proportion</b> and the RED <b>proportion</b> cannot be used as constant <b>proportions</b> to create a harmonious <b>proportion</b> throughout the width of maxillary anterior teeth...|$|R
