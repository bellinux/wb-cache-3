50|$|The {{simplest}} {{vane pump}} has a circular rotor rotating inside a larger circular cavity. The centers {{of these two}} circles are offset, causing eccentricity. Vanes are allowed to slide {{into and out of}} the rotor and seal on all edges, creating vane chambers that do the <b>pumping</b> <b>work.</b> On the intake side of the pump, the vane chambers are increasing in volume. These increasing-volume vane chambers are filled with fluid forced in by the inlet pressure. Inlet pressure is actually the pressure from the system being pumped, often just the atmosphere. On the discharge side of the pump, the vane chambers are decreasing in volume, forcing fluid out of the pump. The action of the vane drives out the same volume of fluid with each rotation. Multistage rotary-vane vacuum pumps can attain pressures as low as 10−6 mbar (0.0001 Pa).|$|E
50|$|An {{empirical}} and approximate statement, {{applicable to}} the speed and density ranges herein covered, is that the friction torque (m. e. p.) increases as a linear function of speed at Q constant, air density, and as a linear function of air density at a constant speed. This applies to both the Liberty 12-cylinder and the Hispano-Suiza 8-cylinder engines. The true relations of friction torque, engine speed, and air density are much more complex and cannot be deduced from the available information. It is known, however, that the friction torque is such that the friction horsepower wdl increase with engine speed raised to {{between the first and}} second power, approaching the square of the speed at the higher speeds. The exact relation is dependent on the engine, as well as on the speed and air density. Also, at a given speed, the friction horsepower increases with some varying power of the air density because of the change of the <b>pumping</b> <b>work.</b> The friction horsepower at constant speed is found to increase slightly more rapidly than does the density.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{fundamental}} Le Chatellier principle, gas producing reactions can be pushed at lower temperatures if an appropriate vacuum is applied. A basic thermodynamic analysis {{is used to}} predict the effect of pressure decrease on the temperature and exergy cost of a reaction with gaseous products.

The exergy analysis for conducting these reactions with non-renewable resources showed that due to the high exergy cost of fossil fuel generated electricity the application of vacuum would increase the overall exergy cost of these reductions. If the heat needed for the reactions could be produced through renewable resources, such as concentrated solar radiation, then the use of vacuum would have a positive effect in the cases of high temperature reductions of Al 2 O 3, MgO and CaO, where a significant decrease in reaction temperature is observed as more exergy is spent in <b>pumping</b> <b>work...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) is {{predominantly}} used in {{waste heat recovery}} applications because of their low temperature working range. The main efficiency enhancement operation in an Organic Rankine Cycle is reducing the <b>pump</b> <b>work.</b> The <b>pump</b> converts electrical energy to flow energy. This input reduced and output maintained {{at the same level}} gives us a more efficient waste heat recovery system. The <b>pump</b> <b>work</b> can also be achieved by using a material that has the ability to expand on heating and revert back to its original state on cooling. The expansion property of the material is used to compress and drive the operating fluid through the cycle. Material that was observed to possess such properties was Phase Change Material. Conventionally PCM were used as thermal storage to preheat the working fluid in an ORC but a novel idea is to make the PCM utilize the heat rejected from the condenser and do the <b>pump</b> <b>work.</b> This paper discusses the various desirable properties of PCM to perform <b>pump</b> <b>work</b> efficiently and also the general layout and working of ORC system using PCM.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis reports original research on a novel internal combustion (IC) engine charge air system concept called Turbo-Discharging. Turbo-Discharging depressurises the IC engine exhaust system so that the engine gas exchange <b>pumping</b> <b>work</b> is reduced, thereby reducing fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. There is growing concern regarding the human impact on the climate, part of which is attributable to motor vehicles and transport. Recent legislation has led manufacturers to improve the fuel economy and thus reduce the quantity of CO 2 generated by their vehicles. As this legislation becomes more stringent manufacturers are looking to new and developing technologies to help further improve the fuel conversion efficiency of their vehicles. Turbo-Discharging is such a technology which benefits from the fact it uses commonly available engine components in a novel system arrangement. Thermodynamic and one-dimensional gas dynamics models and experimental testing on a 1. 4 litre four cylinder four-stroke spark ignition gasoline passenger car engine have shown Turbo-Discharging to be an engine fuel conversion efficiency and performance enhancing technology. This {{is due to the}} reduction in <b>pumping</b> <b>work</b> through decreased exhaust system pressure, and the improved gas exchange process resulting in reduced residual gas fraction. Due to these benefits, engine fuel conversion efficiency improvements of up to 4...|$|E

This phenomenon is due to the impedance difference along the tube. At the compression location, 1 exx_i/ - 1 exL_i. [...] of 0.1, the impedance at the right end tube is smaller as compared to the left end tube. Therefore, the water would tend to move towards the region with lesser impedance. As the water flow through the tube, pressure gradient between both reservoirs changes as well, creating a higher pressure in the right reservoir. With higher pressure in the right reservoir, the forces required to overcome the fluid inertia in the reservoir hence increases, thus required longer time to reach a higher pressure head.|$|E

40|$|A control {{structure}} is proposed and investigated for coordinatedcontrol of EGR valve and VGT position in heavy duty diesel engines. Main control goals are {{to fulfill the}} legislated emission levels, toreduce the fuel consumption, and to fulfill safe operation of theturbocharger. These goals are achieved through regulation ofnormalized oxygen/fuel ratio and intake manifoldEGR-fraction. These are chosen both as main performance variables andfeedback variables since they contain information about when it ispossible to decrease the fuel consumption by minimizing the pumpingwork. Based on this a novel and simple <b>pumping</b> <b>work</b> minimizationstrategy is developed. The proposed performance variables are also strongly coupled to theemissions which {{makes it easier to}} adjust set-points, e. g. dependingon measured emissions during an emission calibration process, since itis more straightforward than control of manifold pressure and air massflow. Further, internally the controller is structured to handle thedifferent control objectives. Controller tuning is important forperformance but can be time consuming and to meet this end a method isdeveloped where the controller objectives are captured in a costfunction, which makes automatic tuning possible even though objectivesare conflicting. Performance trade-offs are necessary and areillustrated on the European Transient Cycle. The proposed controlleris validated in an engine test cell, where it is experimentallydemonstrated that the controller achieves all the control objectivesand that the current production controller has at least 26 % higherpumping losses compared to the proposed controller. © 2009 IEEE.

40|$|Abstract: Modern {{diesel engines}} are seeing {{increasing}} system and after-treatment complexity {{which can lead}} to significant increases in the exhaust back pressure (EBP). This increases the amount of trapped residuals, raising the charge temperature but reducing the oxygen concen-tration. In this work, these effects of the EBP on diesel engine performance and emissions under conventional and low-temperature diesel combustion (LTC) regimes were investigated. Increasing the EBP resulted in higher <b>pumping</b> <b>work</b> for both combustion modes. While for conventional diesel combustion the effect of the EBP on combustion and emissions were not significant, for LTC the higher back pressures influenced the combustion and emissions for-mation processes. At low-load conditions, the increase in the charge temperature advanced combustion; at intermediate-load conditions, the reduction in the oxygen concentration delayed it. Smoke emissions were significantly reduced by a higher back pressure at intermediate-load conditions...|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{recognized that the}} paths for improving fuel consumption (BSFC) in a spark-ignition engine at part-load require more advanced valve actuation strategies, which largely affect the <b>pumping</b> <b>work.</b> Since several years, many different solutions have been proposed, characterized by different levels of complexity, effectiveness, and cost. Valve systems currently available on the market allow for variable phasing (VVT - Variable Valve Timing), and/or lift (VVA - Variable Valve Actuation). Usually VVT devices are applied on intake and exhaust camshafts, in the “phased” or “unphased” configuration, as well. VVA devices are instead commonly mounted on the intake camshaft. More recent VVA systems also allow for a double intake valve lift during a single engine cycle (multi-lift), or may include a small intake pre-lift during the exhaust stroke. The latter solutions may determine further BSFC reductions. Alternatively, an external- EGR circuit can be considered, as well...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Development {{trend of}} modern HSDI diesel engine is now {{focusing}} on low fuel consumption and emission because of {{strong interest in}} global environmental protection. Two big branches of criteria for modern diesel engine development are down sizing and down speeding. Down sizing keeps engine operation condition to the direction of higher load and thus pursuing for better thermal efficiency. But this may cause degraded vehicle dynamic performance because of reduced back up torque. Down speeding keeps engine operation condition to the direction of slightly higher load and lower engine speed. Therefore reduction of back up torque can be limited within flat torque area. This study analyzed fuel economy effect of down speeding on a vehicle powered by HSDI diesel engine in aspect of engine friction work, intake and exhaust <b>pumping</b> <b>work,</b> exhaust hat loss and thermal loss of fuel leakage of fuel injection system.
