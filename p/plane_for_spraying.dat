This article reviews the principal modeling challenges posed by sprays, and discusses the capabilities of different modeling approaches by classifying them according to the basis for their statistical representation and the level of closure. The article goes on to provide guidelines for their comparative assessment and also a perspective on the outlook <b>for</b> <b>spray</b> modeling. Multiphase flow simulation approaches that are used <b>for</b> <b>spray</b> computations are classified according to scale, accuracy, computational cost and problem complexity. The requirements of a simulation method to be successfully used <b>for</b> <b>spray</b> computation are then discussed.

40|$|Effects of Watering Temperature on Seedling Growth of Chili (Capsicum annum L.) ABSTRACT. Researches of {{temperature}} effect on plant {{have yet to}} provide obvious results of how leaf temperature and media temperature differs plant growth. The research of objectives are to study effects of water temperature irrigated to media and water temperature sprayed to the leaves on Chili seedling growth. Completely randomized block design {{was used in the}} research. The factor studied were water temperature for watering media and water temperature <b>for</b> <b>spraying</b> seedling leaves. The result showed that water temperature <b>for</b> <b>spraying</b> seedling leaves significantly affected all variables observed, including seedling height, seedling diameter, leaf size, wet weight of seedling, wet weight of the roots, dried weigh of seedling, and dried weigh of the roots. Water temperature for watering media did not significantly affect all variables observed. There were significant interactions between water temperature for watering media and water temperature <b>for</b> <b>spraying</b> seedling leaves on seedling diameter and leaf size. Water temperature of 120 C for watering media in combination with normal water temperature <b>for</b> <b>spraying</b> seedling leaves was the best treatment combination, while water temperature of 120 C for watering media in combination with 120 C water temperature <b>for</b> <b>spraying</b> seedling leaves was the worst treatment...|$|R

The Argos airport, located in an homonymous area (Aerodromio) in the outskirts of the city is also worth mentioning. The area it covers was created in 1916-1917 and was greatly used during the Greco-Italian War and for the training of new Kaberos school aviators for the Hellenic Air Force Academy. It also constituted an important benchmark in the organization of the Greek air forces in southern Greece. Furthermore, the airport was used by the Germans for the release of their aerial troops during the Battle of Crete. It was last used as a landing/take off point <b>for</b> <b>spray</b> <b>planes</b> (<b>for</b> agricultural purposes in the olive tree cultivations) up until 1985.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the 2008 - 9 production year in West Azerbaijan province (Uromia Township). The Energy Ratio, Energy Productivity, Economic Productivity and Mechanization Index were estimated for apple production. Data were collected using random sampling for 80 face-to-face respondents. Results showed that the highest share of energy consumption belongs to packaging (57 %) followed by irrigation (16 %). The highest share of expenses was found to be 34 % and 30 % for labour and packaging, respectively. Mechanization was considered at three levels including level 1 <b>for</b> <b>spraying</b> only, level 2 <b>for</b> <b>spraying</b> and plotting, and level 3 <b>for</b> <b>spraying</b> and fertilizing operations. The Energy Ratio was found to be less than one for all mechanization levels having the highest value in level 2 (0. 58). The highest economic productivity was calculated as 1. 9 for level 2.
