The microbiological process of detoxification and transformation of toxic organic pollutants is a promising method for foodstuffs decontamination. Some basidiomycetes, such as the Pleurotus eryngii species complex, include several important commercial edible varieties that can detoxify <b>polycyclic</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> and a range of wastes and pollutants. We investigated the potential role of P. eryngii, one of the most consumed mushrooms, in the decontamination of FB 1 in maize. In addition, selected antioxidant enzymes, (soluble peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase), primarily involved in control of cell hydrogen peroxide levels, and lignin degradation, were analyzed, to evaluate their contributions to the molecular mechanisms of FB 1 by P. eryngii. FB 1 decontamination by P. eryngii and involvement of CAT and POD enzymes in the control of toxic decontamination levels of H 2 O 2 were demonstrated. A consistent reduction of FB 1 was observed at different incubation times. The average decrease levels of FB 1, with respect to the control cultures, ranged from 45 to 61 % (RSD < 15 %).

The rational design of catalysts may greatly benefit of computational aid, provided state-of-the-art methodologies are employed. The case of metal catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of alkynes/alkynes-nitriles to benzene/pyridine is investigated in detail, due to the paramount importance of these reactions for the synthesis of cyclic and <b>polycyclic</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Catalysts of general formula Cp’M are considered, where Cp’ is the cyclopentadienyl anion or the cyclopentadienyl moiety of larger polycyclic aromatic/heteroaromatic ligands, and M=Co, Rh, Ir. Energy profiles of the whole cycles {{with a number of}} intermediates ranging from 5 to 9 connected by the corresponding transition states are computed and the catalyst performance is evaluated based on its turnover frequency (TOF), by implementing the equations of the energy span model. TOF values are related to peculiar structural features of the Cp’M fragment, i. e. to the M-Cp’ bonding mode which results in slippage phenomena during the catalytic cycle. In fact, the metal is never coordinated to the five carbon atoms ring in highly symmetric fashion (eta 5), but is slipped and the amount of this distortion changes during the various steps of the catalysis.

40|$|The {{investigations}} of negatively charged molecular {{systems have been}} {{a subject matter of}} vivid research interest over decades. This is not surprizing, because mono- and multiple anions are ubiquitous in the living species and {{play an important role in}} chemistry, biochemistry and the solid state materials. In contrast to the situation occurring in the liquid solutions and solids, where anions are stabilized by the interactions with the environment, they are highly elusive in the gas phase (GP) due to electron repulsion. Building on our previous study, where it was shown that some cyanated radialenes are capable of forming dianions in the GP 1, we are reporting on the results obtained in investigating some larger monocyclic and <b>polycyclic</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> dressed by the CN and CF 3 groups. For that purpose we have employed DFT–B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +G(d) metod, which has been validated first on some experimentally known dianions. Subsequently, it was conclusively shown that alternating CF 3 and CN substituents in cyclooctatetraene lead to its highly pronounced electron affinity. Moreover, its dianion is stable against the electron detachment. The latter is strongly enhanced in octacyanooctatetraene. The origin is identified in the aromaticity of the ring possessing 10 p electron, which is additionaly vigorously supported by the anionic resonance with the CN groups. The same conclusions hold for 14 p electron dianions of biphenylene and dicyclobuteneoctatetraene fully cyanated by the 8 CN groups and some related systems. The present results might be important pertaining to the design of new organic materials exhibiting conductive properties. 1 I. Despotović, Z. B. Maksić, J. Mol. Struct.

30|$|CNT are {{carbonaceous}} adsorbents with hydrophobic surfaces that exhibit strong adsorption affinities {{to organic}} compounds[24 – 30]. Thereby, {{a combination of}} chemical and physical interactions {{play a major role}} for adsorption processes. CNT have uniform structural units but are prone to aggregate, forming bundles of randomly tangled agglomerates because of the strong van der Waals forces along the length axis[31]. The outermost surface, inner cavities, interstitial channels, and peripheral grooves of CNT constitute four possible sorption sites for organic compounds[30]. Nanotechnology has initiated different types of nanomaterials to be used in water technology in recent years that can have promising outcomes. Nanosorbents such as CNT have exceptional adsorption properties and can be applied for removal of heavy metals, organics, and biological impurities[28, 32]. CNT, as adsorbent media, are able to remove heavy metals such as Cr 3 +[33], Pb 2 +[34], and Zn 2 +[35], metalloids such as arsenic compounds[36], <b>organics</b> such as <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> (PAH)[24, 29], pesticides[37], and a range of biological contaminants including bacteria[38 – 40], viruses[41, 42], cyanobacterial toxins[43, 44] as well as natural organic matter (NOM)[45 – 47]. The success of CNT as an adsorbent media in the removal of biological contaminants, especially pathogens is mainly attributed to their unique physical, cytotoxic, and surface functionalizing properties[28].|$|R

In this work, a previously established electrochemical displacement method was utilized to measure the binding constant (Kb) of 26 hydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs) with DNA. Eighteen OH-PAHs induced more than 50 % signal reduction in the displacement measurement with calf thymus DNA, and Kb calculated from the IC 50 value is between 8. 3 × 105 and 3. 0 × 106 M- 1. Other eight OH-PAHs induced less than 50 % signal reduction. For the latter compounds, IC 50 values were obtained by fitting the displacement curve with a bi-exponential decay function and extrapolating it to 50 % signal. Kb was then calculated, and was found to be in the range of 4. 5 × 105 and 7. 6 × 105 M- 1. Measurements with polydG∙polydC (pdGC) and polydA∙polydT (pdAT) demonstrate that the OH-PAHs have no obvious selectivity toward DNA base pairs. In atomic force microscopy, a clear morphological change of calf thymus DNA from linear type to condensation form was observed after binding with 9 -hydroxyfluorene. The change is similar to the one observed with the DNA-intercalating electrochemical indicator, suggesting that 9 -hydroxyfluorene binds with DNA also by intercalation. An examination of the relationship between the molecular structure characteristics of the 26 OH-PAHs and their DNA-binding affinity revealed that the most positive net atomic charge on a hydrogen atom (q+H) correlated significantly with Kb at 0. 05 level, with sig. (2 -tailed) of 0. 015. The correlation suggests that hydrogen bonding may play an important role in DNA/OH-PAH binding interaction. It was further revealed that Connolly accessible area (CAA), Connolly molecular area (CMA), and Connolly solvent-excluded volume (CSEV) of the nine hydroxybenzo[a]pyrenes correlated significantly with Kb at 0. 01 or 0. 05 level, with sig. (2 -tailed) 0. 019, 0. 012 and 0. 009, implying that steric effect might be an important factor in the binding of differently substituted OH-PAH with DNA...|$|R
