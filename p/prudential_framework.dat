There are multiple clearly identifiable channels: reduced demand for long-term investment, a tightening <b>prudential</b> <b>framework</b> for lending, upward adjustment of risk perception, complex transition of the financial system, and increasing macroeconomic, sovereign and regulatory risk. Some of the identified channels are potentially dangerous spillovers from the crisis that entail {{the risk of a}} downward spiral (eg increasing regulatory risk), while others are efficient market responses (eg reduced investment demand, correction of pricing of risk).

However, a differentiation among banks from different trading partners through decisions on the 'equivalence' of consolidated supervision by certain non-European authorities with European supervision, may be saved under the GATS provisions on recognition. Nonetheless, lack of transparency in these decisions may remain problematic. Even if the prudential carve-out provides a broad exception for prudential measures, it may not necessarily justify this deficiency. The article illustrates how the European rules comply with GATS requirements and how consistency could further be ensured.

40|$|In the {{economic}} environment {{that has been}} emerging {{over the last couple}} of decades, it is more likely that the occasional build-up of financial imbalances, typically in the form of unsustainable credit and asset price booms, will occur against the background of low and stable inflation, posing a potential threat to financial and macroeconomic stability. This means that the scope for monetary policy to lean against the build-up may be more constrained than in the past, when those imbalances would normally develop alongside rising inflation. This puts a premium on a strengthening of the macroprudential orientation of <b>prudential</b> <b>frameworks,</b> designed to restrain the build up of the imbalances and to make the financial system better able to withstand their unwinding. In this paper, we review the progress made in this direction in recent years. We conclude that there is now a much keener awareness of the importance of a macroprudential orientation but that progress in making it operational, while considerable, has been slower. The main obstacles are of an analytical and, above all, institutional/political economy nature. We suggest ways in which these obstacles could be addressed and underline the potential complementary role that adjustments in monetary policy frameworks could play. financial stability, price stability, financial imbalances, macroprudential, financial regulation and supervision, monetary policy...|$|R

40|$|Trade finance, {{particularly}} {{in the form of}} short-term, self-liquidating letters of credit and the like, has received relatively favourable treatment regarding capital adequacy and liquidity under Basel III, the new international <b>prudential</b> <b>framework.</b> However, concerns have been expressed over the potential "unintended consequences" of applying the newly created leverage ratio to these instruments, notably for developing countries' trade. This paper offers a relatively simple model approach showing the conditions under which the initially proposed 100 % leverage tax on non-leveraged activities such as letters of credit would reduce their natural attractiveness relative to higher-risk, less collateralized assets, which may stand in the balance sheet of banks. Under these conditions, the model shows that leverage ratio may nullify in part the effect of the low capital ratio that is commensurate to the low risk of such instruments. The decision by the Basel committee on 12 January 2014 to reduce the leverage ratio seems to be justified by the analytical framework developed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address three questions: (1) Does global finance require a common {{prudential}} standard? (2) Does global finance require international cooperation in overseeing the system’s safety and soundness? And (3), does global finance require notification, cooperation and coordination of dynamic regulatory-policy adjustments? Our answer {{to the first question}} is that global finance does require a common prudential standard, defined as a level of required resilience, applied appropriately to all parts of the financial system. Without adoption of a common resilience standard, the international financial system will fragment and balkanize. In addressing the second question, we explain why shared, collective analysis is necessary to identify and mitigate stability-threatening shortfalls against that standard for resilience. This will be possible only with increased public and private transparency. Finally, we examine the daunting, but essential, task of implementing a dynamic <b>prudential</b> <b>framework</b> that maintains the system’s resilience even as its structure and risk-taking behaviors change.

40|$|Located in an {{environment}} of high uncertainty, supervisors in Lebanon have decided to comply with regulations issued by the Basel Accords and to monitor the new Basel Committee <b>prudential</b> <b>framework.</b> This thesis focuses on the Lebanese banking sector and on Basel II specific aspects in the Lebanese context. Four research areas are covered : 1. Evaluation of the capitalization level of Lebanese banks as required by Basel II prudential standards. 2. Lebanese sovereign risk analysis {{and its impact on the}} sustainability of banks through the measurement of probability of default of the Lebanese state on its Eurobonds denominated in U. S. dollars. 3. Examining the question of bank balance sheet procyclicality generated by the accounting and <b>prudential</b> <b>framework,</b> and by contextual factors specific to the resilience of the Lebanese banking sector. 4. Evaluation of the adaptation level of the Lebanese banking sector to new risk management approaches by estimating the probability that banks will well manage their risks. From a comparative analysis of the regulatory and economic capital, we found that 14 banks have a high economic capital relative to regulatory capital under Basel II in 2005. We also observed that the risks faced by Lebanese banks are primarily related to credit risk and sovereign risk in particular. Applying the valuation model of default risk, developed by Merrick (2001), and based on a review of scientific literature, we proposed a synthetic measure of credit risk of the Lebanese US dollar denominated Eurobonds. The results show that changes in the probability of default and recovery rates are explained by the trust vis-à-vis the market and state. Based on a review of the scientific literature, we have developed theories of economic fluctuations and financial instability. The analyses of procyclicality in the Lebanese context have shown that the factors leading to a balance sheet procyclicality in the Lebanese banking sector are atypical. We have also shown the resilience of the Lebanese banking sector to recent shocks and crises. Through a survey conducted between November 2009 and February 2010, we assessed the level of adaptation of the Lebanese banking sector to new risk management approaches. The results show that some banks have become more aware of the importance of developing proper risk management practices. Therefore, other banks remain in a precarious stage...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of cross-sector and {{cross-border}} integration, European financial systems have become more interwoven, both nationally and internationally. More particularly, they have become more complex in terms of risk interdependencies. Financial stability is obviously affected by these financial changes. Based on a critical analysis of the current European <b>prudential</b> <b>framework?s</b> ability to face this new risk profile, we argue in favour of an holistic approach to the financial safety net through {{the concept of a}} regulatory regime which is wider than the prevailing set of rules established by regulatory agencies. More precisely, this paper investigates two essential and interdependent aspects of a coherent and global financial safety net in Europe that favours the complementarities between prudential policy in a narrow sense (set of rules established by regulatory agencies, monitoring and supervision), market discipline and bank resolution policy. On one hand, {{on the basis of the}} American experience of prompt corrective action policy, we suggest promoting stronger complementarities between public financial regulation and market discipline. On the other hand, we plead for an institutionalisation of insolvency procedures for pan-european financial groups. Indeed, the European situation is characterized by a damaging heterogeneity of national insolvency regimes even though the European Directive on the Reorganization and Winding-Up of Credit Institutions provides a legal framework dealing with the crossborder aspects of European bank insolvency. This Directive undoubtedly represents an important development in the framework of E. U. banking laws but it does not constitute a panacea and does not completely achieve its goals. In particular, it does not eliminate all the conflicts of interest between Member States concerning all the cross border aspects of bank insolvency.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{growth in}} recent decades {{of international trade and}} investment flows has precipitated a massive increase in the demand for financial intermediaries and markets to facilitate and manage this process. This rising demand, combined with non-linearities in financial services supply, such as scale and agglomeration economies, has seen a tendency for the booming financial services industry to concentrate in particular geographical centres. Using a conceptual model drawn from the International Financial Centre (IFC) literature, this paper analyses the development of two cities in Asia with stated IFC intentions: Mumbai, India and Shanghai, China. The comparison shows that common strengths include high rates of current income growth, real sectors that are linked to international markets and financial sectors that are large even by established IFC standards. Weaknesses include the microeconomic business environment, the <b>prudential</b> <b>framework</b> surrounding firms and financial markets and the overwhelming domestic focus of their sizeable financial sectors.

40|$|A {{sufficient}} {{and appropriate}} degree of central bank independence is widely acknowledged {{to be necessary}} for the goal of achieving price stability. However, despite the levels of independence claimed to be enjoyed by several central banks, recent events indicate shifts in focus of monetary policy objectives by various prominent central banks. The impact of political and government influences on central banks' monetary policies has been evidenced from the recent financial crisis – and in several jurisdictions. Many central banks have adjusted monetary policies having been influenced by political pressures which have built up {{as a result of}} the recent crises. However such lack of absolute independence (from political spheres) could prove symbiotic in the sense that, despite the need for a certain degree of independence from political interference, certain events which are capable of devastating consequences, namely, a drastic disruption of the system's financial stability, need to be responded to as quickly and promptly as possible. Is it possible for a central bank with absolute independence to operate effectively – particularly given the close links between many central banks and their Treasury in several countries? It may be inferred that central banks' crucial roles in establishing a macro <b>prudential</b> <b>framework</b> provide the key to bridging the gap between macro economic policy and the regulation of individual financial institutions. This however, on its own, is insufficient – close collaboration and effective information sharing between central banks and regulatory authorities is paramount. ...|$|E

Moreover, the model features endogenous balance sheet choices and a novel formulation of the targeted leverage ratio, in which assets are risk-weighted by risk-sensitivity measures. The results highlighted in this paper are important along two dimensions. First of all, the presence of endogenous LTV ratios exacerbates the procyclicality of lending conditions. Second, the model contributes to deeper understand the role of <b>prudential</b> regulatory <b>frameworks</b> in affecting business cycle fluctuations and in restoring macroeconomic and financial stability.
