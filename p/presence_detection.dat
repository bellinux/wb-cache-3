40|$|We propose an {{approach}} to quantum phase estimation that can attain precision near the Heisenberg limit without requiring single-particle-resolved state detection. We show that the "one-axis twisting" interaction, well known for generating spin squeezing in atomic ensembles, can also amplify the output signal of an entanglement-enhanced interferometer to facilitate readout. Applying this interaction-based readout to oversqueezed, non-Gaussian states yields a Heisenberg scaling in phase sensitivity, which persists in the <b>presence</b> of <b>detection</b> noise {{as large as the}} quantum projection noise of an unentangled ensemble. Even in dissipative implementations [...] e. g., employing light-mediated interactions in an optical cavity or Rydberg dressing [...] the method significantly relaxes the detection resolution required for spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit.

40|$|Abstract. In this article, device-free human <b>presence</b> <b>detection</b> method {{based on}} {{principal}} components analysis of the radio signal strength variations is proposed. The method increases user awareness for automated power management interaction in residential power saving systems. Motivation comes from a need for decreasing the installation complexity and development costs induced by the integration of specific human <b>presence</b> <b>detection</b> sensors. The method exploits {{the fact that a}} human body interferes with radio signals by introducing irregularities in the radio signature which indicate possible human presence. By analyzing radio signals between radio transceivers embedded in 2. 4 GHz wireless power outlets, the original environment is not visually modified and a certain level of sensorial intelligence is introduced without additional sensors. The analysis of the signal strength variations in principal components space enhances the detection accuracy level of human <b>presence</b> <b>detection</b> method, retaining low installation costs and improving overall energy conservation...|$|E

The recognition time we have achieved in case of the <b>presence</b> of edge <b>detection</b> method is 1. 698 seconds and less than a second in case of none. Our suggested method includes the partitioning of the input gesture into different blocks and by using the block brightness measurement to strike the right gesture. Each gesture has been represented by a feature vector with many features controlled by the block size which in turn decides the speed and accuracy rate of the recognition. We also have modified the edge detection method in order to enhance the edges to obtain more refined and clear edges by applying a filling operation after segmentation and before edge operation. Our study also includes the application of different block sizes for generalization of the study and also can decide which block size can get good recognition rates...|$|R

Our simulation study showed that {{in the absence of}} an association between the vaccine and the outcome, <b>presence</b> of <b>detection</b> bias and differential exposure misclassification could account for elevated risk estimates. These may play a major role, particularly in alert situations when observation times are limited and the disease has a long latency period.

Overall, these simulations provide useful insights for the design and interpretation of future studies...|$|R
