40|$|SETTING: In {{developing}} countries, tuberculosis {{is diagnosed}} by identification of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on sputum smears. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate {{the quality of}} AFB microscopy, the Mexican Secretary of Health National Reference Laboratory implemented <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> for its network of 637 laboratories. DESIGN: A total of 586 (92 %) laboratories were inspected and 430 technicians evaluated by <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> consisting of 10 slides with known numbers of AFB. Results were {{compared with those of}} slide rechecking and with <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> performed 2 years later. RESULTS: Of the 430 technicians evaluated by <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> in 1998, 196 (46 %) scored less than 80 % and received intensive training in 1999. From a previous mean score of 65 % their results increased to 90 % (P < 0. 0001). In 2001, they again underwent <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing,</b> and the mean score was 83 %. The main factors affecting <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> results were the type of laboratory in which the microscopists worked and the number of low-positive slides (1 - 9 / 100) in the test. Laboratories whose work was rechecked had better scores (P = 0. 002). <b>Proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> scores and the estimated sensitivity of the microscopist's laboratory were associated (P = 0. 01).

Many university graduates in mainland China and Hong Kong take this exam before looking for a job.

Applicants of some positions, e.g. telephone operators, may be required to obtain a certificate. People raised in Beijing are sometimes considered inherently 1-A (A score of at least 97%) and exempted from this requirement. As for the rest, the score of 1-A is rare. According to the official definition of proficiency levels, people who get 1-B (A score of at least 92%) are considered qualified to work as television correspondents or in broadcasting stations. 2-A (A score of at least 87%) can work as Chinese Literature Course teachers in public schools. Other levels include: 2-B (A score of at least 80%), 3-A (A score of at least 70%) and 3-B (A score of at least 60%). In China, a proficiency of level 3-B usually cannot be achieved unless special training is received. Even though many Chinese do not speak with standard pronunciation, spoken Standard Chinese is widely understood to some degree.|$|E

Where several schemes operate in the same analytical sector, there are risks that assessments of performance may be in conflict. Performance assessment for the determination of trace elements such as aluminum in serum is particularly important due to the high risk of contamination and therefore erroneous results. The objectives of this work were (1) to compare several mathematical models to establish a predefined standard deviation for proficiency assessment and (2) to evaluate the influence of instrumental methods and <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> scheme on the assessment of performance for serum aluminum measurements. For this purpose, three samples {{were sent to the}} participants of four <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> schemes. Assigned values were calculated according to algorithm A according to ISO 13528 and standard deviation for proficiency assessment according to three methods based on individual variability, state of the art or previous <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> results. The method based on individual variability produced a more stringent standard deviation compared to analytical imprecision based {{on the state of the}} art. The instrumental methods gave similar results, whereas significant differences were observed between the four <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> schemes indicating that harmonization of the standard deviation for proficiency assessment fails to allow transferability from one <b>proficiency</b> <b>testing</b> scheme to another and that additional factor(s) contribute to variability in performance assessment. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
