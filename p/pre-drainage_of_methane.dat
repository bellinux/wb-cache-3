40|$|Collectively, marine sediments {{comprise}} the largest reservoir <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> on Earth. The flux <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> {{from the sea}} bed to the overlying water column is mitigated by the sulphate-dependent anaerobic oxidation <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> by marine microbes within a discrete sedimentary horizon termed the sulphate–methane transition zone. According to conventional isotope systematics, the biological consumption <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> leaves a residue <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> enriched in 13 C (refs 1, 2, 3). However, in many instances the methane within sulphate–methane transition zones is depleted in 13 C, consistent with the production <b>of</b> <b>methane,</b> and interpreted as evidence for the intertwined anaerobic oxidation and production <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> 4, 5, 6.

Residual methane became progressively enriched in 13 C at sulphate concentrations above 0. 5 mM, and progressively depleted in 13 C below this threshold. We attribute the shift to 13 C depletion during the anaerobic oxidation <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> at low sulphate concentrations to the microbially mediated carbon isotope equilibration between methane and carbon dioxide.
