This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the pathogenesis of oxidative stress in steroid-induced avascular necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH) and at exploring the mechanism and protective effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on early SANFH. Methods. 80 adult New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into control group, model group, and PNS group. In model group, equine serum was injected into auricular vein; then methylprednisolone was injected into gluteus. In PNS group, PNS was applied for 14 consecutive days before methylprednisolone management. At different time points, serum and femoral heads were <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> T-AOC, <b>SOD,</b> GSH-PX, ·OH, and MDA determination. Two weeks after steroid management, all femoral heads were assessed with MRI and HE staining. Results. Typical early osteonecrosis symptoms were observed in model group. Our results showed that PNS could significantly ameliorate the decrease of T-AOC level, improve SOD and GSH-PX activity, suppress ·OH ability, and augment MDA level. Besides, PNS improved MRI and pathological changes of the femoral head, markedly reducing the incidence of osteonecrosis. Conclusion. Based on our research, we found oxidative stress played a positive role in the occurrence of SANFH where reactive oxygen species was the direct cause. PNS could protect rabbits against early steroid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head by its antioxidative effect...|$|R

Because mitochondria are a primary site of ROS generation {{and also a}} primary target of ROS attack, they have become a major focus area of aging studies. Here, we employed yeast genetics to identify mitochondrial antioxidant genes that are important for replicative life span. We found that among the known mitochondrial antioxidant genes (TTR 1, CCP 1, SOD 1, GLO 4, TRR 2, TRX 3, CCS 1, SOD 2, GRX 5, PRX 1), deletion SOD 1 (Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase), SOD 2 (Manganese-containing superoxide dismutase), and CCS 1 (Copper chaperone), shortened the life span enormously under normal conditions. The life span decreased 40 % <b>for</b> <b>sod</b> 1 mutant, 72 % <b>for</b> <b>sod</b> 2 mutant, and 50 % for ccs 1 mutant. When a respiratory carbon source was used in addition to sod 1, sod 2 and ccs 1, deletion of CCP 1 (cytocrome c peroxidase) also lead to a decrease in life span which decreased% 79 <b>for</b> <b>sod</b> 1 mutant, 87 % <b>for</b> <b>sod</b> 2 mutant, 51 % for ccs 1 and 65 % for ccp 1 mutant. Deletion of the other genes {{had little or no}} effect on life span for both conditions. To further investigate the role of these antioxidant genes molecular damages on lipids, proteins, and DNA were detected in mutants. The results showed that level of lipid peroxidation was usually lower when cells were grown under normal conditions. If cells were grown in respiratory substrate glycerol, deletion of CCS 1, SOD 2, GRX 2, CCP 1, TRR 2 and PRX 1 genes increased cellular lipid peroxidation levels by 87 %, 73 %, 65, 48 %, 30 % and 16 % respectively. Protein carbonylation levels were 34 % higher for ccp 1 and 87 % higher for grx 2 mutants compared to WT cells when the cells were grown under normal conditions. However, it increased 65 % for ccs 1, 61 % for prx 1, 57 % for glo 4, 55 % for ccp 1, 49 % <b>for</b> <b>sod</b> 1, 37 % <b>for</b> <b>sod</b> 2, 33 % for grx 2, 18 % for trx 3, 17 % for grx 5 and 7 % for trr 2 when the cells were grown in the presence of glycerol. Q-PCR assay showed that deletion of CCS 1 and PRX 1 lead to DNA damages in mitochondrial DNA. Our overall results showed that some of the antioxidant mitochondrial mutants lived shorter and accumulated extensive molecular damages in the presence of respiratory carbon source...|$|R

40|$|Hemoglobin-based oxygen {{carriers}} (HBOCs) {{are being developed}} as oxygen and plasma volume-expanding therapeutics though their potential to promote oxidative tissue injury has raised safety concerns. Using a guinea pig exchange transfusion model, we {{examined the effects of}} polymerized bovine hemoglobin (HbG) on the transcriptional regulation, activity, and expression of the renal antioxidant enzymes; superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). HbG infusion downregulated the mRNA levels <b>for</b> genes encoding <b>SOD</b> isoforms 1 - 3, GPx 1, GPx 3, GPx 4, and CAT. This transcriptional suppression correlated with decreased enzymatic activities <b>for</b> <b>SOD,</b> CAT, and GPx. Immunostaining revealed decreased protein expression of SOD 1, CAT, and GPx 1 primarily in renal cortical tubules. DNA methylation analyses identified CpG hypermethylation in the gene promoters <b>for</b> <b>SOD</b> 1 - 3, GPx 1, GPx 3, and GPx 4, suggesting an epigenetic-based mechanism underlying the observed gene repression. HbG also induced oxidative stress as evidenced by increased renal lipid peroxidation end-products and 4 -HNE immunostaining, which could be the result of the depleted antioxidant defenses and/or serve as a trigger for increased DNA methylation. Together, these findings provide evidence that the renal exposure to HbG suppresses the function of major antioxidant defense systems which may have relevant implications for understanding the safety of hemoglobin-based products...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Growth, {{immunological}} characteristics, and carcass traits {{were measured}} in early- and late-feathering chickens maintained under three feeding regimens.

Absolute BW, feather weight, and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) weights were lower <b>for</b> <b>SOD,</b> after 45 days of age, than for AL and RL chickens. Relative to BW, however, GIT and liver weights, at 45 days of age but not 64 days of age, were heavier <b>for</b> <b>SOD</b> than <b>for</b> AL and RL chickens. Percentage of carcass lipid was lower <b>for</b> <b>SOD</b> than <b>for</b> AL and RL chickens. Generally, carcass traits and components of the GIT were similar for Regimens AL and RL at 45 and 64 days of age. Exceptions were lower percentages for carcass lipid and liver lipid for RL than AL chickens at 64 days of age. There was a significant feeding regimen by age interaction for heterophil to lymphocyte ratios caused by a greater increase in ratios with age for AL than <b>for</b> RL and <b>SOD</b> chickens. At 37 days of age, AL chickens had lower antibody titers to SRBC than SOD or RL chickens that did not differ. The AL chickens had reduced bursa of Fabricius and thymus weights relative to BW, indicative of immunological involution, along with reduced livability, compared with RL and SOD chickens, which did not differ in livability. Early- and late-feathering chickens were similar for most of the traits measured. One exception was higher antibody titers to SRBC in early- than late-feathering chickens.
