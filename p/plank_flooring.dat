60|$|Daniel Davidson {{was engaged}} in a very {{important}} conversation with old Duncan McKay {{at the time the}} formidable troop of North-Westers swept through the settlements. The old man was seated in the hall, parlour, drawing-room--or whatever you choose to call it--of Ben Nevis House. It was an uncarpeted, unpainted, unadorned room with pine <b>plank</b> <b>flooring,</b> plank walls, a plank ceiling, a plank table, and a set of plank chairs. Ornament was dispensed with in the hall of Ben Nevis House; for although Elspie would fain have clothed it with a little feminine grace, its proprietor would not hear of such proposals.|$|E
60|$|Tables {{and chairs}} were a luxury that still {{remained}} {{to be introduced}} at Fort Chimo, when the men found leisure from more urgent duties to construct them. Therefore the dining-table in Stanley's hall was composed of three large packing-cases turned bottom up. There was no cloth wherewith to cover its rough boards; {{but this was a}} matter of little importance to the company which assembled round it, punctually at the hour of four. In place of chairs there were good substantial nail-kegs, rather low, it is true, and uncommonly hard, but not to be despised under the circumstances. Owing to the unusual demand for dishes, the pewter plates and spoons and tin drinking-cups--for they had little crockery--were of every form and size that the store contained; and the floor on which it all stood was the beaten ground, for the intended <b>plank</b> <b>flooring</b> was still growing in the mountain glens.|$|E

60|$|Still Poe did {{maintain}} his leading position among the scholars at that Virginian academy, and several still living have favored us with reminiscences of him. His feats in swimming to which Colonel Preston has alluded, {{are quite a}} feature of his youthful career. Colonel Mayo records one daring performance in natation which is thoroughly characteristic of the lad. One day in mid-winter, when standing {{on the banks of}} the James River, Poe dared his comrade into jumping in, in order to swim to a certain point with him. After floundering about in the nearly frozen stream for some time, they reached the piles upon which Mayo's Bridge was then supported, and there attempted to rest and try to gain the shore by climbing up the log abutment to the bridge. Upon reaching the bridge, however, they were dismayed to find that its <b>plank</b> <b>flooring</b> overlapped the abutment by several feet, and that it was impossible to ascend it. Nothing remained for them but to let go their slippery hold and swim back to the shore. Poe reached the bank in an exhausted and benumbed condition, whilst Mayo was rescued by a boat just as he was succumbing. On getting ashore Poe was seized with a violent attack of vomiting, and both lads were ill for several weeks.|$|E
