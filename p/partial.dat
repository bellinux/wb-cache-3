5|$|A <b>partial</b> eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a <b>partial</b> eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. <b>Partial</b> eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, <b>partial</b> eclipses (and <b>partial</b> stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E

5|$|As a first {{approximation}} {{only the}} inert gasses {{are taken into}} account. For oxygen <b>partial</b> pressures above 2.4 bar, the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood exceeds the amount that the body can use, and the hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen in both the veins and the arteries. If more oxygen is added, the <b>partial</b> pressure of oxygen in the venous blood rises.|$|E
30|$|The two mixture <b>partials</b> {{that result}} in the {{greatest}} correlation are selected (first and third in Table 1). Those are the mixture <b>partials</b> for which the frequency variations are more alike, which indicates that they both belong mostly to a same source. In this case, possible coincident <b>partials</b> have small amplitudes compared to the dominant <b>partials.</b>|$|R
30|$|Most {{techniques}} {{proposed in}} the literature can only reliably resolve colliding <b>partials</b> {{if they are not}} coincident. Klapuri et al. [26] explore the amplitude modulation resulting from two colliding <b>partials</b> to resolve their amplitudes. If more than two <b>partials</b> collide, the standard interpolation approach as described later is used instead. Virtanen and Klapuri [27] propose a technique that iteratively estimates phases, amplitudes, and frequencies of the <b>partials</b> using a least-square solution. Parametric approaches like this one tend to fail when the <b>partials</b> are very close, because some of the matrices used to estimate the parameters tend to become singular. The same kind of problem can occur in the strategy proposed by Tolonen [16], which uses a nonlinear least-squares estimation to determine the sinusoidal parameters of the <b>partials.</b> Every and Szymanski [28] employ three filter designs to separate partly overlapping <b>partials.</b> The method does not work properly when the <b>partials</b> are mostly concentrated in the same band. Hence, it cannot be used to estimate the amplitudes of coincident or almost coincident <b>partials.</b>|$|R
30|$|This {{is because}} the {{mixtures}} in Table 4 were generated using instruments playing the same notes, and higher <b>partials</b> {{in that kind of}} mixture {{are more likely to be}} strongly dominated by one of the instruments—most instruments have strong low <b>partials,</b> so they will all have significant contributions in the lower <b>partials</b> of the mixture. Mixture <b>partials</b> that are strongly dominated by a single instrument normally result in better amplitude estimates, because they correlate well with the reference <b>partials,</b> explaining the results shown in Table 4.|$|R

50|$|<b>Partials</b> whose {{frequencies}} are not integer multiples of {{the fundamental}} {{are referred to as}} inharmonic <b>partials.</b> Some acoustic instruments emit a mix of harmonic and inharmonic <b>partials</b> but still produce an effect on the ear of having a definite fundamental pitch, such as pianos, strings plucked pizzicato, vibraphones, marimbas, and certain pure-sounding bells or chimes. Antique singing bowls are known for producing multiple harmonic <b>partials</b> or multiphonics.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In a {{situation}} where multiple sound sources are concurrently active, the signals of the individual sources often overlap in time and in frequency. This is particularly likely for voiced instruments where the frequencies {{of some of the}} <b>partials</b> of one single note coincide with the frequencies of some of the <b>partials</b> of another instrument playing a harmonically related note. A source separation algorithm suitable for musical applications must address the problem of overlapping <b>partials.</b> A method is proposed for the separation of overlapping narrow-band <b>partials</b> in multi-channel mixtures. The method is based on the observation that, for many instruments, all the <b>partials</b> of a single note have similar temporal envelopes. For narrow band <b>partials</b> these similarities can be exploited in order to estimate demixing matrices in the frequency domain. Effectively, one can recover estimates of the original <b>partials</b> from a multi-channel mixture where they overlap. The method is computationally efficient in that it works on highly downsampled narrow frequency bands. It performs well for closely spaced and colliding <b>partials,</b> and (to some extent) also for frequency modulations such as vibrato effects.

50|$|An {{overtone}} is any frequency {{greater than}} the fundamental frequency of a sound. Using the model of Fourier analysis, the fundamental and the overtones together are called <b>partials.</b> Harmonics, or more precisely, harmonic <b>partials,</b> are <b>partials</b> whose frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental (including the fundamental which is 1 times itself). These overlapping terms are variously used when discussing the acoustic behavior of musical instruments. (See etymology below.) The model of Fourier analysis provides {{for the inclusion of}} inharmonic <b>partials,</b> which are <b>partials</b> whose frequencies are not whole-number ratios of the fundamental (such as 1.1 or 2.14179).|$|R

5|$|<b>Partial</b> {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, <b>partial</b> agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a <b>partial</b> agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that <b>partial</b> agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a <b>partial</b> agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E

40|$|When {{instruments}} play together, different <b>partials</b> {{will often}} overlap {{in time and}} frequency. This is particularly likely for harmonic instruments. We present a new method for the separation of overlapping <b>partials</b> in multi-channel mixtures. The method {{is based on the}} obsewation that when a harmonic instrument plays a note. all the <b>partials</b> have similar shapes, i. e. common onset. offset. anplitude and frequency modulation. For nmow band partidls we devise a method to estimate a demixing matrix that can recover the original Source <b>partials</b> from the multi-channel mixture where they overlap. The method is computationally efficient in that it works on highly downsampled narrow frequency bands and it performs equally well for closely spaced <b>partials</b> as for crossing <b>partials,</b> e. g. due to frequency modulations such as vibrato effects. It is able to separate <b>partials</b> in mixtures with a high number of or,erlapping panials, such as two instruments playing notes where the fundamental frequencies are in fifth (32) or octave (2 :l) relation. 1...|$|R

Second, we explain how the relations of residual PS (i. e., PS with PC <b>partialled</b> out) differ from those of PS, and how to interpret these differences. In this, we also discuss suppressor effects and how mutual suppression affects the relations of both PS and PC with outcomes. Furthermore, we provide recommendations of how to report and interpret findings of analyses <b>partialling</b> out the effects of PS and PC. We conclude that, if properly understood and reported, there is nothing to be concerned about when <b>partialling</b> PS and PC. On the contrary, <b>partialling</b> is essential if we want to understand the shared, unique, combined, and interactive relations of the different dimensions of perfectionism...|$|R
