5|$|After {{entering}} the Florida Straits, the hurricane {{turned to the}} northeast, producing tropical storm winds along the Florida Keys. High rainfall caused flooding, while three tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged houses in the Miami area. The hurricane reached peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) on October6 while moving through the Bahamas. It subsequently weakened and became extratropical on October8. The former hurricane lashed the coast of Nova Scotia with high winds and rain, leaving about $1million (1933CAD) in damage. Rough seas sank several ships and killed nine <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> The remnants of the hurricane eventually dissipated on October9 {{to the south of}} Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|During {{high school}} and college, Shehri was deeply {{religious}} and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many young <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Wail's father {{was a friend of}} Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.|$|E
5|$|Fort George Island {{is located}} in Duval County, several miles {{northeast}} of downtown Jacksonville. It is a marsh island {{at the mouth of}} the St. Johns River, surrounded by tidal estuaries, Little Talbot Island, and the Nassau River. The north Atlantic coast of Florida had been inhabited for approximately 12,000 years when Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León landed near Cape Canaveral in 1513. The Spanish met the Saturiwa, a Timucua tribe, who were the largest group of indigenous <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> numbering about 14,000. Bands of Timucua extended into central Florida and south Georgia. An estimated 35 chiefdoms existed in the territory, and their societies were complex with large villages sustained by fishing, hunting, and agriculture, but they frequently warred with each other and unrelated groups of Native Americans. The Spanish concentrated their efforts of exploration and settlement on the Gulf Coast of Florida. By 1562, Jean Ribault led French explorers to the mouth of the St. Johns River where they built a garrison in 1564, calling it Fort Caroline. Within 200 years the population of the indigenous people of Florida was decimated by disease and constant fighting. They left behind evidence of their existence in massive middens or shell mounds filled with discarded food byproducts. On Fort George Island, the shells were primarily oysters.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 7th centuryBC, the Iron-Age Etruscan civilization (Latin: Etrusci) was dominant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Like most of <b>the</b> other <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>the</b> Romans warred against the Etruscans. By the close of the century, the Romans had lost their struggle for independence, and the Etruscans had conquered Rome, establishing a military dictatorship, or kingdom, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|R
50|$|Billy Drumley {{is remembered}} by many Aboriginal elders and local <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> of Beaudesert, Tamborine, Nerang and Southport. He {{was known for}} {{performing}} rain dances to calm down storms and would speak in Aboriginal language.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, Woodruff {{moved to}} Dunedin {{to take up}} a {{position}} as the Chair of Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, New Zealand's only medical school at that time. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and St Andrews University in Edinburgh. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (graft versus host disease). Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there were not enough <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually large}} wind field uprooted many {{thousands}} of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. Two <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> died due to falling trees—one in New Kent County {{and one in the}} city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor car accidents. Additionally, most gas stations were closed, due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable. Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues, the longest it has ever been closed during a school term. Likewise, Norfolk State University, Regent University, Tidewater Community College and Eastern Virginia Medical School all experienced significant closing times due to both storm damage and a lack of electricity.|$|E

50|$|As <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of vegetation, {{considerable}} loss {{of wildlife}} has occurred {{beginning with the}} settlement of native <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> millennia ago.
