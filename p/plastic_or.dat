5|$|Many {{types of}} {{reinforcement}} can increase wall strength, such as <b>plastic</b> <b>or</b> wire mesh and reinforcing rods of steel or fiberglass or bamboo. Earth resists compression well but is weak when twisted. Tensile reinforcement must span potential damage points and be well-anchored to increase out-of-plane stability. Bond beams at wall tops are vital {{and must be}} well attached to walls.|$|E
5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed {{light machine}} gun. It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, usually a {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from M27 linked belts. Belts are typically held in a hard <b>plastic</b> <b>or</b> soft canvas box attached to {{the underside of the}} weapon.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of <b>plastic,</b> <b>or</b> by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E

5|$|Residential {{buildings}} {{are limited to}} four stories above street level and if possible another four stories below, according to the Greater Amman Municipality regulations. The {{buildings are}} covered with thick white limestone or sandstone. The buildings usually have balconies on each floor, {{with the exception of}} the ground floor, which has a front and back yard. Some buildings make use of Mangalore tiles on the roofs or on the roof of covered porches. Hotels, towers and commercial buildings are either covered by stone, <b>plastic</b> <b>or</b> glass.|$|E
5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often {{takes into account}} environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear <b>plastic</b> <b>or</b> the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E
5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, <b>plastic</b> <b>or</b> other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|E

The core technology employed by establishments in this subsector {{is that of}} <b>plastics</b> <b>or</b> rubber product production. Plastics and rubber are combined in the same subsector because plastics are increasingly {{being used as a}} substitute for rubber; however the subsector is generally restricted to the production of products made of just one material, either solely <b>plastics</b> <b>or</b> rubber.
