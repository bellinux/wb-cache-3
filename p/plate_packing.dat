50|$|The API {{separator}} {{was developed}} by the API and the Rex Chain Belt Company (now Siemens). The first API separator was installed in 1933 at the Atlantic Refining Company (ARCO) refinery in Philadelphia. Since that time, virtually all of the refineries worldwide have installed API separators as a first primary stage of their oily wastewater treatment plants. The majority of those refineries installed the API separators using the original design based on the specific gravity difference between oil and water. However, many refineries now use plastic parallel <b>plate</b> <b>packing</b> to enhance the gravity separation.|$|E
50|$|Coalescing <b>plate</b> <b>pack</b> {{separators}} {{work very}} differently from centrifugal separators. With the <b>plate</b> <b>packs,</b> water is {{fed into the}} separator through gravity through the inlet pipe, then the mixture is spread evenly through the separation chamber where the coalescing <b>plate</b> <b>packs</b> are. In the <b>plate</b> <b>packs</b> the oil will rise because of their buoyancy and coalesce {{on the underside of}} the plates and form globules of oil that rise to the surface. From there the waste oil globules go into the clean water chamber and are discharged through the lower portion of the separator.|$|R

The project {{is located in the}} cadastral Holostřevy, a small village near the town of Plzen. Construction will be visible from the highway D 5, which is widely used by German, Austrian and Czech drivers and her attendance and payback will be more effectiv. And the architectural appearance shoud be also contribute. Project documentation has been prepared in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The building is functionally, operationally and structurally divided into two parts. The first part is called "zázemí" (background). It is the skeleton construction of reinforced concrete with cross reinforced the <b>plate.</b> <b>Packing</b> construction is only between the base and the ceiling and itsn't supporting. In the "zázemí" there are dressing rooms, sanitary facilities, but also a café. The second part is a "hala" (hall). It only serves to playing tennis. The supporting construction is a lamellar wood trusses and central column in "zázemí" supporting it. It is interesting that on the 2 nd floor which serves as a grandstand, are formed two parts, one of which serves as an auditorium for interior court and the other as an auditorium for exterior court...|$|E
40|$|The liquid {{chillers}} are refrigeration {{systems that}} remove heat from a secondary refrigerant. The secondary refrigerant, such as water, is then {{distributed to the}} location where refrigeration is needed. The main components of chiller are a compressor, an expansion valve and two heat exchangers: the evaporator and the condenser. The scope of this thesis was to research the chiller systems and the evaporation of the refrigerant 134 a in the flooded plate and shell evaporator. The plate and shell heat exchanger consist of a <b>plate</b> <b>pack</b> inside a shell. The experimental research focuses {{on the effect of}} the plate surface roughness. The plates of the <b>plate</b> <b>pack</b> were roughened with glass ball blasting in terms of increased heat transfer. The tests were carried out with the R 134 a chiller plant and the thermosiphon system: first, using a standard <b>plate</b> <b>pack</b> and then, treated <b>plate</b> <b>pack.</b> No significant improvements in heat transfer coefficient were observed. However, the significant effect of the oil was noticed in the R 134 a chiller tests. The thermosiphon test was carried out with pure refrigerant (R 134 a and NH 3) and, as a result, muchhigher heat transfer coefficients were achieved. The present technology of the chiller is concentrated on R 134 a, but it may be assumed that a shift towards natural refrigerants can take a place in near future. In the future research, more attention shall be focused on the applications used with natural refrigerants as well as the oil behaviour. The roughened plate surface does not prove to be beneficial in the heat transfer, thus, the research shall target on plate macro structure or pattern, to further improve the heat transfer...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{fossil fuels}} such as coal, {{gas and oil}} are still major {{candidates}} to fulfill the energy requirement but their depletion at sharp rate due to increase in demand is at alarming condition. High prices and environmental pollution issues associated with fossil fuels has diverted thefocus {{of the world to}} find out the new energy roots. Biomass is one of energy candidates, environment friendly, which can be utilized to generate heat and power. Biomass can be converted into useful products by thermochemical process such as gasification. This study focuses on to design and development of pilot scale updraft gasifier with gas cleaning unit. Performance analysis in terms of producer gas composition, LHV of producer gas, A/G,G/F, gasifier efficiency and gasification efficiency for different biomass materials at different air flow with and without the <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> was studied. Other main objective was to find out energy potential of mango pit shell as new biomass material and its comparison with coconut shell, ginisyria (Gliricidia sepium) and a mixture of 50 %, 25 %, 25 % coconut shell, mango pit shell and Gliricidia sepium respectively as an arbitrary selection. Bench scale updraft gasifier was designed and fabricated. Elemental analysis for each biomass was performed in laboratory to find out the properties such as moisture contents, ash contents, volatile matters etc. Reactor was operated successfully, producer gas and other useful byproducts was obtained. Producer gas was analyzed for compositional analysis as major product and reactors performance parameters was calculated. It has been observed that biomass we utilized contains the sufficient energy potential. In case of without <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> at ER of 0. 2 LHV (MJ/Nm 3) of producer gas was 4. 40, 3. 35, 4. 20, 3. 14 for coconut shell, mango pit shell, ginisyria and mixture respectively. When air flow rate increased, ER increased up to 0. 25 it was observed that LHV of producer gas has been decreased. With <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> experiments it has been found that LHV of producer gas at ER of 0. 2 is 4. 02, 3. 29, 3. 70, and 3. 21 for coconut shell, mango pit shell, ginisyria and mixture respectively. In <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> case as well with increase of air flow decrease in LHV of producer gas was observed. Collectively without <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> results obtained are good as compare to with <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> case. Gasifier thermal efficiency for different biomass has been found in the range of assumed designed value which was 70 %. Bio-char and black condensate was obtained as valuable by products which can be utilized for different applications.
