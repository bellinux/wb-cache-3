50|$|MMP-1 has an archetypal {{structure}} {{consisting of}} a <b>pre-domain,</b> a pro-domain, a catalytic domain, a linker region and a hemopexin-like domain. The primary structure of MMP-1 was first published by Goldberg, G I, et al. Two main nomenclatures for the primary structure are currently in use, the original one from which the first amino-acid starts with the signalling peptide and a second one where the first amino-acid starts counting from the prodomain (proenzyme nomenclature).|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Earlier {{studies of}} protein {{structure}} revealed closed loops with a characteristic size 25 â€“ 30 residues and ring-like shape {{as a basic}} universal structural element of globular proteins. Elementary functional loops (EFLs) have specific signatures and provide functional residues important for binding/activation and principal chemical transformation steps of the enzymatic reaction. The goal of this work is to show how these functional loops evolved from <b>pre-domain</b> peptides and to find a set of prototypes from which the EFLs of contemporary proteins originated...|$|E
