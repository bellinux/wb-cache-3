50|$|<b>Pedestrian</b> <b>refuges</b> {{or small}} {{islands in the}} middle of a street may be added when a street is very wide, as these {{crossings}} can be too long for some individuals to cross in one cycle. These <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges</b> may consist of building new concrete traffic islands {{in the middle of}} the road; extending an existing island or median strip to the crosswalk to provide a refuge; or simply cutting through the existing island or median strip where the median is already continuous.|$|R
5000|$|A refuge island, {{also known}} as a <b>{{pedestrian}}</b> <b>refuge</b> or pedestrian island, is a small section of pavement or sidewalk, completely surrounded by asphalt or other road materials, where pedestrians can stop before finishing crossing a road. It is typically used when a street is very wide, as the pedestrian crossing can be too long for some individuals to cross in one traffic light cycle, they can often been seen on roads with higher speed limits also.|$|E
50|$|The 18th-century {{bridge at}} Builth Wells carries heavy {{vehicles}} on the A470. It has six fine masonry spans, with relatively small round cutwaters, which are fitted on the upstream side with stout steel fenders to provide protection from debris. The centre of the bridge has a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuge</b> on each side. The arches have been reinforced by a layer of concrete in the soffit. The bridge was built in 1775 and widened in 1925.

Runtime: 71 : 32 minutesSally Flocks is the President and CEO of PEDS, an {{advocacy}} {{organization dedicated to}} making metro Atlanta safe and accessible for all pedestrians. Sally founded PEDS in 1996 after brain surgery enabled her to control a seizure disorder that had prevented her from driving during most of her adult life. Sally’s efforts as President of PEDS have prompted changes at the local, regional and state levels in Georgia, including making high-visibility crosswalk markings the state standard, publication of a state pedestrian facilities design guidebook, and installation of in-street crosswalk signs, red light cameras, <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuge</b> islands and HAWK signals. Sally’s presentation will discuss the need for increased investment in sidewalk maintenance in the City of Atlanta and for safe crossings at transit stops throughout the region. Sally served previously on the Board of Directors of America Walks and on the steering committees of Complete Streets and the Safe Routes to School National Partnership...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the steady reduction in mortality and morbidity from collisions involving motor vehicle occupants, relatively little {{progress has been made}} in controlling motor vehicle/pedestrian collisions. Engineering modifications are the most effective means of reducing such collisions, but mainly because of their cost, and public apathy about pedestrian safety, are too rarely employed. A modest experiment in community action was undertaken by attempting to induce the authorities of 10 small cities to apply for state funds to create a single model <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuge</b> in their respective communities. Our hope was that this model would later lead to more widespread improvements. The key elements of the campaign were organizing local pedestrian safety task forces, compiling local pedestrian injury statistics, and publicizing the stories of pedestrian injury victims. At the conclusion of the planning process, all 10 target communities submitted grant applications and all 10 received full grant funding. Five projects were completed as planned, two are under con-struction, and the plans for three were abandoned. Pedestrian safety is not an issue that captures public attention. To make progress, goals must be modest, and a dedicated constituency must be developed. “Victim advocacy ” is a vital part of this process. Progress in injury control requires concerted community action...|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} {{constructed}} of Old Red Sandstone ashlar. It has three arches, with two piers in water. The piers form <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges</b> on the bridge.

40|$|Commission’s (MTC) Transportation 2030 Plan {{calls for}} full {{consideration}} {{of the needs of}} non-motorized travelers during project development, design, construction, and rehabilitation. In part, the Call to Action says that: …bicycle facilities and walkways must be considered, where appropriate, in conjunction with all new construction and reconstruction of transportation facilities. This report evaluates how often these facilities are included in the design and construction of various transportation projects throughout the region based on interviews with project managers. It does not attempt to differentiate between different non-motorized improvements, such as bike lanes versus the shared-lane making (sharrow), or ladder crosswalks versus <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuge</b> islands. Based on the evaluation, this report makes eleven recommendations for increasing the routine consideration of such facilities in the future. Recommendations include improving review and design strategies to ensure that transportation projects routinely accommodate bicycles and pedestrians. The evaluation in this report {{is the result of a}} review of existing non-motorized policies, 35 interviews with transportation project managers and over 30 interviews with other bicycle and pedestrian public agency employees and non-motorized transportation advocates in the Bay Area. Of the 35 project managers interviewed, 21 of them referenced a bicycle and/or pedestrian planning document for the projects ’ planning. The report also includes three case studies. The report’s recommendations for MTC, Caltrans District 4, and cooperating agencies are listed below and sorted by category. POLIC...|$|E

50|$|A {{packhorse}} {{bridge is}} a bridge intended to carry packhorses (horses loaded with sidebags or panniers) across a river or stream. Typically a packhorse bridge consists {{of one or}} more narrow (one horse wide) masonry arches, and has low parapets so as not to interfere with the horse's panniers. Multi-arched examples sometimes have triangular cutwaters that are extended upwards to form <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{has three}} arches of 42 ft span, and is 22 ft clear over the river. The total {{length of the}} bridge is 146 ft. The width between the {{parapets}} is 13 ft, but the cutwaters are carried up to form semi-hexagonal <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges.</b> The piers and abutments are made from block masonry, {{and the rest of}} the structure is made from rubble.|$|R
5000|$|The old Leckwith Bridge {{dates from}} at least the early 16th century, {{referred}} to in 1536 as being [...] "soundly built of stone". It was probably partially rebuilt in the 17th century and the central arch being rebuilt during the 18th century. The bridge has three arches built of rubblestone. The roadway is approximately 2.75m (9 feet) in width, {{with the addition of}} <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges</b> above pointed cutwaters between each arch.|$|R
5000|$|During 2009, Main Street {{underwent}} a major renovation {{with the road}} resurfaced, <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges</b> in strategic locations and new footpaths with garden beds.

50|$|Crickhowell Bridge {{is unusual}} (due to the 1828 alterations) {{in that it}} has a {{different}} number of arches upstream (12) from downstream (13). On the (original) downstream side, the arches are recessed, though not on the upstream side. The bridge has V-shaped cutwaters to both sides with <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges</b> above. Construction is of rubble masonry with flat coping stones on the parapets. The bridge is 128 m long and has a minimum width of 4 m between parapets.|$|R
50|$|Teston Bridge {{is built}} of coursed rag-stone with ashlar capping stones to the parapets. The bridge is narrow, only {{wide enough to}} permit traffic to pass in one {{direction}} {{at a time and}} the parapets feature <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges</b> continued up from the cutwaters on each side. It carries the B2163 road, which is crossed on the level by the Medway Valley Line just west of the bridge. The crossing was the site of , which was open from 1909-59.|$|R
2500|$|The {{bridge was}} built of red brick {{supplied}} from a kiln that Gibbs had built on Clifton Heath to service his other modernisations. Scott's design has six gothic arches with spans from [...] to [...] The five brick piers have triangular cutwaters which extend upwards to provide <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges.</b> The {{total cost of}} the construction was £3,617 (equivalent to £ today) which was met by Gibbs, the unusually low tolls being levied only to meet the cost of ongoing maintenance. The bridge opened in 1867 with its builder, Richard Casey, as toll keeper.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{crosses the}} old county {{boundary}} between Cumberland and Westmorland {{and is one}} of the oldest bridges in the county still in daily use. It was built in 1425 after the Bishop of Durham, Thomas Langley, offered indulgences to anyone contributing towards its construction, and was widened in 1875. It is a slightly humpbacked three-arched bridge made of grey sandstone with alterations in red sandstone. The solid parapets include <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges</b> above the pillars. Like the village, the bridge stands partly in Yanwath and Eamont Bridge parish and partly in Penrith.|$|R

50|$|In a lane diet, {{the width}} of a lane is {{decreased}} to reduce vehicle speeds and yield space for other use. Typically vehicular travel lane widths are narrowed to no more than ten feet, and left turn (in countries where drivers use the right-hand side of the road) storage lanes to nine or ten feet. Resulting space can be applied to <b>pedestrian</b> <b>refuges,</b> medians, sidewalks, shoulders, parking, or bike lanes. Lane width guidelines in the United States are offered as a range and lane diets fall within this range.|$|R
