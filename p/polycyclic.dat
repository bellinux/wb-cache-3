5|$|On June 6, 2013, {{scientists}} at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan.|$|E
5|$|Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe later {{proposed}} {{the identification of}} bicyclic aromatic compounds from {{an analysis of the}} ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175Å, thus demonstrating the existence of <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in space.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{chemicals}} such as {{vinyl chloride}} and hydrogen peroxide, and environmental chemicals such as <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons found in smoke, soot and tar create a huge diversity of DNA adducts- ethenobases, oxidized bases, alkylated phosphotriesters and crosslinking of DNA, {{just to name}} a few.|$|E
5|$|Oil spills have {{devastating effects}} on the environment. Crude oil {{contains}} <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which {{are very difficult to}} clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.|$|E
5|$|The {{oil shale}} waste heaps pose a {{spontaneous}} ignition risk {{due to their}} remaining organic content. The waste material, particularly semi-coke, contains pollutants including sulphates, heavy metals, and <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), {{some of which are}} toxic and carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|Crinipellis zonata is saprobic, {{living on}} the debris or roots of hardwoods; it {{contains}} wood-decaying enzymes that can break down the <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene. The mushrooms grow individually or in small clusters, {{and can be found}} between August and September. In North America, it is distributed east of the Rocky Mountains, and has been recorded as far west as Indiana and Texas. In Europe, it has been collected in Portugal. It has also been collected in South Korea.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, NASA {{scientists}} reported that, for {{the first}} time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the Universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds, according to the scientists.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, complex DNA and RNA nucleotides, {{including}} uracil, cytosine and thymine, {{were reportedly}} {{formed in the}} laboratory under outer space conditions, using starter chemicals, such as pyrimidine, an organic compound commonly found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), {{is one of the}} most carbon-rich compounds found in the Universe and may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds.|$|E
5|$|Louis Fieser – {{organic chemist}} and {{professor}} emeritus at Harvard University renowned as the inventor of a militarily effective form of napalm. His award-winning research included work on blood-clotting agents including the first synthesis of vitamin K, synthesis and screening of quinones as antimalarial drugs, work with steroids leading to the synthesis of cortisone, and study {{of the nature of}} <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres was {{the first}} tyre {{manufacturer}} {{in the world to}} fully eliminate high-aromatic oils from its production process. Used as plasticising agents in tread production and to facilitate the compounding of rubber, they contain <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a carcinogen, and have been replaced by low-aromatic oils. In 2006, Nokian Tyres received a commendation in the Finnish round of the European Business Awards for the Environment.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 2013, {{scientists}} at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan, a possible precursor for life. On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.|$|E
5|$|These <b>polycyclic</b> {{hydrocarbons}} also {{activate the}} AH receptor, {{but less than}} TCDD and only temporarily. Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor. This phenomenon {{can be viewed as}} adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|Building {{blocks of}} DNA (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) {{may have been}} formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E
5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor {{present in all}} cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; in fact {{it has been shown}} that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic <b>polycyclic</b> hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond {{to each other in}} various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E
5|$|Many comets and asteroids {{collided}} with Earth {{in its early}} stages. Many scientists think that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4 billion years ago brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth's oceans, {{or at least a}} significant portion of it. Others have cast doubt on this idea. The detection of organic molecules, including <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons, in significant quantities in comets has led to speculation that comets or meteorites may have brought the precursors of life—or even life itself—to Earth. In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the amino acids that make up proteins through shock synthesis. In 2015, scientists found significant amounts of molecular oxygen in the outgassings of comet 67P, suggesting that the molecule may occur more often than had been thought, and thus less an indicator of life as has been supposed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>polycyclic</b> groups generalize metacyclic {{groups by}} {{allowing}} {{more than one}} level of group extension. A group is <b>polycyclic</b> {{if it has a}} finite descending sequence of subgroups, each of which is normal in the previous subgroup with a cyclic quotient, ending in the trivial group. Every finitely generated abelian group or nilpotent group is <b>polycyclic.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Polycyclic</b> animals {{reproduce}} intermittently {{throughout their}} lives.|$|E
25|$|Noetherian groups {{need not}} be finite {{extensions}} of <b>polycyclic</b> groups.|$|E
25|$|Environmentalists have {{reported}} heavy contamination from <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons and believe arsenic levels {{to be well}} above legal limits.|$|E
25|$|Diels-Alder {{reaction}} of furan with arynes provides corresponding derivatives of dihydronaphthalenes, which are useful intermediates in synthesis of other <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic compounds.|$|E

25|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to some chemicals such as asbestos, cadmium, lead, chlorinated solvents, petrochemicals and PAH (<b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbon) has been examined by multiple studies with inconclusive results.|$|E
25|$|Anthracene, as {{many other}} <b>polycyclic</b> {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons, is generated during combustion processes. Exposure to humans happens mainly through tobacco smoke and ingestion of food contaminated with combustion products.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polycyclic</b> {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAH) {{are known to}} be abundant in the Universe, including in the interstellar medium, in comets, and in meteorites, and {{are some of the most}} complex molecules so far found in space.|$|E
25|$|In April 2013, NASA {{reported}} that complex organic chemicals could arise on Titan based on studies simulating {{the atmosphere of}} Titan. In June 2013, <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected in the upper atmosphere of Titan.|$|E
25|$|Besides this {{standard}} definition by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, in some authors' usage the term alkane {{is applied to}} any saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the cycloalkanes) or <b>polycyclic.</b>|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{observations}} of c-C3H2 in dense clouds {{have also found}} concentrations that are significantly higher than expected. This {{has led to the}} hypothesis that the photodissociation of <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) enhances the formation of c-C3H2.|$|E
25|$|Nitrosamines, {{present in}} {{processed}} and cooked foods, {{have been noted}} as being carcinogenic, being linked to colon cancer. Also, toxic compounds called PAHs, or <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons, present in processed, smoked and cooked foods, {{are known to be}} carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|A {{spectral}} database {{exists for}} tracking <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. Detection of PAHs in materials is often done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography with ultraviolet-visible or fluorescence spectroscopic methods or by using rapid test PAH indicator strips.|$|E
25|$|AhR ligands {{have been}} {{generally}} classified into two categories, synthetic or naturally occurring. The first ligands {{to be discovered}} were synthetic {{and members of the}} halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, dibenzofurans and biphenyls) and <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (3-methylcholanthrene, benzopyrene, benzanthracenes and benzoflavones).|$|E
25|$|Stir frying is {{not without}} health risks. Recent studies show that heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and <b>polycyclic</b> {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are formed by stir frying meat at very high temperatures. These chemicals cause DNA changes that may contribute to increased risk of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Complex organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, {{have been formed}} in a laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe.|$|E
