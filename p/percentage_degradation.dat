30|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{degradation of}} Reactive Yellow 17, Reactive Red 2, Reactive Blue 4 dyes using TiO 2 as photocatalyst and solar/UV irradiation as light source {{has been carried}} out by Neppolian et al. (2002 b). They found UV irradiation to be more effective than solar irradiation. The difference in the rate of degradation is attributed to difference in the input energy. The energy of UV irradiation is large compared to band gap energy of the catalysts. Hence, the problem of electron–hole recombination is largely avoided with UV source. But in sunlight only 5  % of the total radiation possesses the optimum energy for the band gap excitation of electrons (Fatin et al. 2012). Hence, the <b>percentage</b> <b>degradation</b> is found to be less in solar radiation of textile dyes. It was also found that the <b>percentage</b> <b>degradation</b> of all the three dyes increased with increasing solar light intensity. Under the higher intensity of light irradiation, the enhancement was considerably higher because the electron–hole formation is predominant, and hence, electron–hole recombination is negligible. However, at lower light intensity, electron–hole pair separation competes with recombination which in turn decreases the formation of free radicals, thereby causing less effect on the <b>percentage</b> <b>degradation</b> of the dyes (Bahnemann 1999).|$|E

Results The inter- and intra-laboratory consistency of FSH values with the same assay manufacturer was much higher after shorter-term storage (frozen for less than 11 months, mean <b>percentage</b> <b>degradation</b> less than 4 %) than after long-term storage (2 - 3 years, mean <b>percentage</b> <b>degradation</b> = 23 %).

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as the major components of oil sludge, are hydrophobic and recalcitrant.

This study used the bacteria Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter sp and Pseudomonas fluorescens.

This paper reports embedding immobilization of strain GY 2 B in calcium alginate gel beads and the rapid degradation of phenanthrene by the embedded strains. Results showed that embedded immobilized strains had high <b>degradation</b> <b>percentages</b> both in mineral salts medium (MSM) and 80 % artificial seawater (AS) media, and had higher phenanthrene degradation efficiency than the free strains. More than 90 % phenanthrene (100 mg·L- 1) was degraded within 36 h, and the phenanthrene <b>degradation</b> <b>percentages</b> were> 99. 8 % after 72 h for immobilized strains. 80 % AS had significant {{negative effect on the}} phenanthrene degradation rate (PDR) of strain GY 2 B during the linear-decreasing stage of incubation and preadsorption of cells onto rice straw could improve the PDR of embedded strain GY 2 B. The immobilization of strain GY 2 B possesses a good potential for application in the treatment of industrial wastewate...|$|R
