50|$|HOBBIES is {{a general}} purpose {{electromagnetic}} solver for various applications. The name is an acronym for Higher Order Basis Based Integral Equation Solver. The software {{is based on the}} Method of Moments (MoM), and it employs higher order polynomials as the basis functions for the frequency domain integral equation solver.

A kth order B-spline basis function is a <b>piece-wise</b> polynomial function of degree k−1 that is obtained by k-fold self-convolution of the rectangular function.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a rectifiable set is a {{set that}} is smooth in a certain measure-theoretic sense. It is an {{extension}} of the idea of a rectifiable curve to higher dimensions; loosely speaking, a rectifiable set is a rigorous formulation of a <b>piece-wise</b> smooth set. As such, it has many of the desirable properties of smooth manifolds, including tangent spaces that are defined almost everywhere. Rectifiable sets are the underlying object of study in geometric measure theory.|$|E
50|$|Tropical {{geometry}} is {{a relatively}} new area in mathematics, which might loosely be described as a <b>piece-wise</b> linear or skeletonized version of algebraic geometry. Its leading ideas had appeared in different forms in the earlier works of George M.

This has been motivated by the applications to enumerative algebraic geometry found by Grigory Mikhalkin.|$|E

50|$|They {{have also}} {{recently}} {{been used in}} a method (advanced by Valve Corporation) to render smooth fonts at large sizes (or alternatively at high DPI) using GPU acceleration. Valve's method computed signed distance fields in raster space {{in order to avoid}} the computational complexity of solving the problem in the (continuous) vector space. More recently <b>piece-wise</b> approximation solutions have been proposed (which for example approximate a Bézier with arc splines), but even this way the computation can be too slow for real-time rendering, and it has to be assisted by grid-based discretization techniques to approximate (and cull from the computation) the distance to points that are too far away.|$|E
5000|$|Girih are lines (strapwork) that {{decorate}} the tiles. The tiles {{are used to}} form girih patterns, from the Persian word , meaning [...] "knot". [...] In most cases, only the girih (and other minor decorations like flowers) are visible rather than {{the boundaries of the}} tiles themselves. The girih are <b>piece-wise</b> straight lines that cross the boundaries of the tiles at the center of an edge at 54° (3π/10) to the edge. Two intersecting girih cross each edge of a tile. Most tiles have a unique pattern of girih inside the tile that are continuous and follow the symmetry of the tile. However, the decagon has two possible girih patterns one of which has only fivefold rather than tenfold rotational symmetry.|$|E
