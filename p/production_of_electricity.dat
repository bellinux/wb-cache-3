5|$|<b>Production</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> in {{the station}} ceased in 1919, ushered in by the {{completion}} of an extension to generating equipment at Newburn Steelworks. The building was retained and continued {{to be used to}} supply power to the tram route by housing a sub-station, which used rotary converters. The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed. The station's chimney was demolished in 1949, along with remaining structures of the Tyne Iron Works, which had stood next to the power station throughout its operation.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} {{the closure of the}} A Station, rumours began to {{circulate}} that the B Station would soon follow. A campaign was then launched to try to save the building as part of the national heritage. As a result, the station was declared a heritage site in 1980, when the Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, awarded the building Grade II listed status. (This was upgraded to Grade II* listed in 2007.) On 31 October 1983 <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> at Station B also ended, after nearly 30 years of operation. By then the B Station's generating capacity had fallen to 146MW. The closure of the two stations was put down largely to the generating equipment becoming outdated, and the preferred choice of fuel for electricity generation shifting from coal toward oil, gas and nuclear power. Since the station ceased generating electricity, there have been numerous proposals and attempts to redevelop the site.|$|E

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) of emissions from coal-fired power stations is another alternative but the technology is still being developed and will increase the cost of fossil fuel-based <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> CCS may not be economically viable, unless the price of emitting CO2 to the atmosphere rises.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} sources point to the misuse of {{hydroelectric}} dams {{as a cause of}} the floods. Hydroelectric plants in the dams of Tabasco share the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> with newer, private, more expensive gas plants.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of technological improvements and increased operating experience on the techno-economic performance of integrated gasification facilities producing electricity and/or transportation fuels.

Results indicate that current <b>production</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> and/or transportation fuels are above market prices. Future improvements, however, could reduce production costs sufficiently to make gasification facilities economical. Furthermore, although CCS {{can be used to}} reduce CO 2 emissions at relative low CO 2 avoidance costs, only the use of biomass allows the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> carbon neutral <b>electricity</b> and/or transportation fuels and in combination with CCS can even result in negative CO 2 emissions...|$|R
