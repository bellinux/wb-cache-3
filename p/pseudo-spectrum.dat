40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we study the <b>pseudo-spectra</b> of the rotated {{harmonic}} oscillator. The <b>pseudo-spectra</b> of an operator are subsets {{in the complex}} plane which describe where the resolvent is large in norm. The study of such subsets allows us to understand {{the stability of the}} spectrum under perturbations and the possible calculation of 'false eigenvalues' far from the spectrum by algorithms for computing eigenvalues. The rotated harmonic oscillator is the simplest classic non-self-adjoint quadratic Hamiltonian, which has already been studied by Davies and Boulton. In one of his works, Boulton states a conjecture about the <b>pseudo-spectra</b> of this operator, which describes the instabilities for high energies. We can deduce this conjecture from a study of Dencker, Sjostrand and Zworski, which gives bounds on the resolvent for a semi-classical pseudo-differential operator in a very general setting. In the present paper, we give a more elementary proof of this result using only some non-trivial localization scheme in the frequency variable...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{application}} of the <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> method to galaxy-galaxy lensing. We derive explicit expressions for the <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> analysis of the galaxy-shear cross spectrum, which is the Fourier space counterpart of the stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profile. The <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> method corrects observational issues such as the survey geometry, masks of bright stars and their spikes, and inhomogeneous noise, which distort the spectrum and also mix the E-mode and the B-mode signals. Using ray-tracing simulations in N-body simulations including realistic masks, we confirm that the <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> method successfully recovers the input galaxy-shear cross spectrum. We also investigate the covariance of the galaxy-shear cross spectrum using the ray-tracing simulations to show that there is an excess covariance relative to the Gaussian covariance at small scales where the shot noise is dominated in the Gaussian approximation. We find that the excess of the covariance is consistent with the expectation from the halo sample variance (HSV), which originates from the matter fluctuations at scales larger than the survey area. We apply the <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> method to the observational data of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing survey (CFHTLenS) shear catalogue and three different spectroscopic samples of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy (SDSS LRG), and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS and LOWZ galaxies. The galaxy-shear cross spectra are significantly detected at the level of 7 - 10 σ using the analytic covariance with the HSV contribution included. We also confirm that the observed spectra are consistent with the halo model predictions with the halo occupation distribution parameters estimated from previous work. This work demonstrates the viability of galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis in the Fourier space. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

Synthetic Green’s functions at teleseismic distance, including the effect of a regional velocity model for Japan (Miura et al., 2005), were computed by interfacing a spectral element code (SPECFEM 3 D, Tromp et al., 2008) and a generalized ray theory code (Chu et al., 2009). We applied MUSIC back-projection to the synthetic waveforms from double-source scenarios with a range of seismic moment ratios between the shallow and deep sources, and measured the ratio of shallow vs. deep MUSIC <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> peaks. We obtained a power-law relationship between the MUSIC <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> ratio and the source amplitude ratio (Fig. 1 (d)). Combining these calibration curves with the MUSIC <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> ratio threshold derived previously, we estimate that the source amplitude ratio threshold is 0.5 for the European array and 0.1 for USArray. We conclude that during the Tohoku-Oki earthquake the deep sources were at least 10 times as strong as the shallow ones at 1 Hz.|$|E

40|$|The <b>pseudo-spectra</b> (or {{spectral}} instability) of non-selfadjoint operators is a {{topic of}} current interest in applied mathematics. For example, in computational fluid dynamics it affects {{the study of the}} stability of laminar flows. In fact, even for the most basic flows, the computations entirely fails to predict what is observed in the experiments. The explanation is that for non-normal operators the resolvent could be very large far away from the spectrum, which makes computation of the eigenvalues impossible. The occurence of ``false eigenvalues'' is due to the existence of quasi-modes, i. e., approximate local solutions to the eigenvalue problem. The quasi-modes appear since the Nirenberg-Treves condition (Psi) is not satisfied for topological reasons...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} {{known as}} multiple signal classification (MUSIC) is a semi-empirical way to obtain <b>pseudo-spectra</b> that highlight the spectral-energy distribution {{of a time}} series.

Accordingly, the paper concludes with a modification of MUSIC. The new method starts with filtering the time series and then estimating the covariance of the state of the filter. This step in essence improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by amplifying the contribution to the actual value of the state-covariance of a selected harmonic interval where spectral lines are expected to reside. Then, the method capitalizes on the canonical decomposition of the filter state-covariance to retrieve information on the location of possible spectral lines.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of coherent signals on passive coprime arrays, where we resort to the fourth-order cumulants of the received signal to explore more information. A fourth-order cumulant matrix (FCM) is introduced for the coprime arrays. The special structure of the FCM is combined with the array configuration to resolve the coherent signals. Since each sparse array of the coprime arrays is uniform, a series of overlapping identical subarrays can be extracted. Using this property, we propose a generalized spatial smoothing scheme applied to the FCM. From the smoothed FCM, the DOAs of both the coherent and independent signals can be successfully estimated on the <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> generated by the fourth-order MUSIC algorithm. To overcome the problem of occasional false peak appearing on the <b>pseudo-spectrum,</b> we use a supplementary sparse array whose inter-sensor spacing is coprime to that of either existing sparse array. From the combined spectrum aided by the supplementary sensors, the false peaks are removed while the true peaks remain. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by simulation examples. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the partial}} {{relaxation}} approach is introduced {{and applied to}} DOA estimation using spectral search.

At each considered direction, the manifold structure of the remaining interfering signals impinging on the sensor array is relaxed, which results in closed form estimates for the interference parameters. The conventional multidimensional optimization problem reduces, thanks to this relaxation, to a simple spectral search. Following this principle, we propose estimators based on the Deterministic Maximum Likelihood, Weighted Subspace Fitting and covariance fitting methods. To calculate the <b>pseudo-spectra</b> efficiently, an iterative rooting scheme based on the rational function approximation is applied to the partial relaxation methods.

We then use the array in a purely passive mode, measuring the response to the presence of a source. The measured response is projected onto the singular vectors, creating a time-reversal <b>pseudo-spectrum.</b> We can then apply standard detection techniques to the <b>pseudo-spectrum</b> to determine the presence of a source. If the source is close to a particular scatterer in the medium, then we would expect an enhancement of the inner product between the array response to the source with the singular vector associated with that scatterer.

50|$|The TRACE {{model is}} a connectionist network with an input layer and three {{processing}} layers: <b>pseudo-spectra</b> (feature), phoneme and word. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of TRACE. There are three types of connectivity: (1) feedforward excitatory connections from input to features, features to phonemes, and phonemes to words; (2) lateral (i.e., within layer) inhibitory connections at the feature, phoneme and word layers; and (3) top-down feedback excitatory connections from words to phonemes. The input to TRACE works as follows. The user provides a phoneme sequence that is converted into a multi-dimensional feature vector. This is an approximation of acoustic spectra extended in time. The input vector is revealed {{a little at a}} time to simulate the temporal nature of speech. As each new chunk of input is presented, this sends activity along the network connections, changing the activation values in the processing layers. Features activate phoneme units, and phonemes activate word units. Parameters govern the strength of the excitatory and inhibitory connections, as well as many other processing details. There is no specific mechanism that determines when a word or a phoneme has been recognized. If simulations are being compared to reaction time data from a perceptual experiment (e.g. lexical decision), then typically an activation threshold is used. This allows for the model behavior to be interpreted as recognition, and a recognition time to be recorded as the number of processing cycles that have elapsed. For deeper understanding of TRACE processing dynamics, readers are referred to the original publication and to a TRACE software tool that runs simulations with a graphical user interface.|$|R
