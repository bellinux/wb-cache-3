40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the functioning}} <b>of</b> the <b>passing-on</b> <b>of</b> price overcharges in damages actions for breaches of EU competition law and aims {{to give a}} critical appraisal of the present regulatory framework in Europe. In particular, this paper maintains that the European Directive 2014 / 104, {{in order to facilitate}} the claims of damages caused by the infringement of European competition rules and to provide full compensation for those damages, has adopted a complex set of rules placing the burden of proof on the party that has, assumedly, the best access to evidence on the relevant issue. Moreover, it is noted that these rules give a strict definition of the overcharge harm and of its diffusion through the market chain. In this connection, it is argued that the objectives of the Directive are partly compromised by the fact that this restrictive approach fails to take into consideration a number of other subjects who may potentially be damaged by the <b>passing-on</b> <b>of</b> the overcharge harm. Secondly, this paper maintains that the set of rules laid down by the Directive 2014 / 104 creates a system of presumptions, which, contrary to its intended purpose, is likely to discourage damages actions. Finally, this paper argues that actions by indirect purchasers based on the <b>passing-on</b> <b>of</b> the overcharge will still need to heavily rely on domestic civil law rules in particular on local principles of causation and evidence...|$|R

Agenda-setting {{is the political}} manifestation. This paper begins with a rehearsal {{of the history of}} the concept of the artworld and traces recent political events in the Australian context that show the notion has contemporary relevance. The institutional theory of art is revisited and its compatibility with ontological theories of virtual relations that address ideology and the cultural formation of actuality is explored. The interpretive function of gatekeepers has a place in the creation of both meaning and value. Value may be symbolic, economic and aesthetic. Could the artworker as researcher, in a role formalised through higher degree fine arts research programs, have the potential to subsume the traditionally separate roles of the artist practitioner, art critic and even curator within the institution of art? Can such researchers be said to be performing the function of translation, in a sense similar to that which arises from actor-network theory? This paper reviews relevant literature where the contribution of artists to culture is evaluated in terms of ontology. It is suggested that the, at one time, rising influence of the artworker/researcher concerned with establishing theoretical grounds for practice whilst also performing valuable interpretive function is currently being challenged by the often more pragmatic concerns of the cultureworker/researcher. The interdisciplinary appropriation of theory between the creative industries and political economy is giving rise to a new breed of authority trained in cultural sociology and possessing the skill to shepherd opinion accounting for innovative value in the newly interpreted data about creative roles in marketplaces. It is argued that the result to date is a conflation of common understanding of theterms 'the arts', 'creativity' and 'innovation'.

40|$|In an {{interview}} closely following on {{the release of}} The History of Love, Krauss made it clear that, contrary to what some critics had ventured, her second novel was not about Holocaust survivors. “I am the grandchild of people who survived that historical event,” Krauss pointed out. “I’m not writing their story – I couldn’t write their story […]. What interests me is the response to catastrophic loss. ” Great House, Krauss’s third novel, {{can be seen to}} further investigate this “response to catastrophic loss” – in a way which makes only tangential and mediated references to the Holocaust. The novel spans eighty years, starting from the near-end of World War 2, and traces the <b>passing-on</b> <b>of</b> a desk of massive proportions. Complete with nineteen drawers, one of which remains locked until it is symbolically revealed to be empty {{at the close of the}} book, the desk operates as some kind of trans-historical fetish for most of its successive keepers (and aspiring acquirers). Narrated through a set of five characters whose lives prove overshadowed less by the Holocaust itself than by its felt resonances in the psyches of loved ones, Great House is a polyphonic work that raises questions about the anatomy of ‘Holocaust postmemory’ (Marianne Hirsch), its temporality, but also its reification in conformity with defense mechanisms that take the form of death-denying fantasies. Here, while turning to the past, some clearly unreliable first-person narrators reveal their lifelong investment in fetishizing memories of themselves and others so as to better keep all sense of temporality and mortality at bay – in a way suggesting that fantasies of un-death have helped them fill in the gap left by the unspeakable horror of the Holocaust, and were later transmitted in lieu of ‘memory proper’. This paper will thus focus on Great House’s rich imagery, and its narrative strategies, in order to investigate Krauss’ representation of the paradoxes of Holocaust postmemory. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Doctoral Thesis in Law The defence <b>of</b> <b>passing-on</b> and Indirect Purchaser Standing as Components of Private Enforcement of EU Antitrust Rules Summaries The present work {{investigated}} one of {{the most}} complex and controversial issues in the field of private enforcement of antitrust rules, the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing. The research question that guided us throughout this work was: how should the passing-on defence be designed in order to (i) guarantee full compensation to both the direct and indirect purchasers; (ii) to prevent that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant is unjustly enriched; and (iii) to prevent the multiple liability and over-deterrence of the defendant? This work attempted to answer these questions. In doing so, it explored the US private antitrust enforcement policy, the Supreme Courts case law, State law and court practice, the legislative proposals regarding the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing, and academic literature. In antitrust cases the assistance of economists to help to overcome {{one of the}} complex issues in designing private enforcement, i. e. quantifying damages and calculating the degree <b>of</b> <b>passing-on,</b> is inevitable. This research provided therefore an overview of the degree of complexity of the methods which can be used to calculate the passing-on by relying on conclusions and statements of economists. Against this, the current situation of private enforcement of private enforcement in Europe is analyzed. It explored first the antitrust enforcement policy. Then an overview and analysis of the ECJs long standing case law on the development of EU law principles, rights and remedies is provided. These developments are the milestones in the course of horizontal liability and the right to claim damages from other individuals under EU law. After this analysis, it then sought to explore the ECJs case law on the extra-contractual liability of the EU and Member States and horizontal liability of individuals for damages. Consequently, the ECJs case law, selected Member States (Germany, England, Belgium and the Netherlands) on tort law has been investigated. Then, the Member States restitution law based on unjust enrichment and undue payment is considered. Subsequently, the Commissions Green, White and Draft Directive on the issues <b>of</b> <b>passing-on</b> defence and indirect purchaser standing are analyzed. Finally, general conclusions and additional proposed options are provided. PART I Passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing in the United States of America The stated purpose of this part was to explore the problem <b>of</b> <b>passing-on</b> by relying on the US Supreme Courts case law, state law and conclusions and statement of economists. Chapter 1 focused primarily on private antitrust enforcement policy in the US. It revealed that the US courts and antitrust agencies, as part of their interpretation and enforcement of federal antitrust laws adopted an optimal deterrence and efficiency-oriented approaches. In order to achieve these aims, not only the legislator but also the Supreme Court and the lower courts have imposed limitations on standing and to recover damages for antitrust infringements as embodied in Article 4 of the Clayton and Article 1 of the Sherman Acts. The most radical limitation is the rejection <b>of</b> <b>passing-on</b> defence in Hanover Shoe and the indirect purchaser standing in Illinois Brick. These two seminal decisions have received phenomenal attention and led to a split between Federal and State courts. Chapter 2 focused exclusively on passing-on defence. This chapter started with defining the passing-on defence and explaining its purpose, operation and effect. This chapter had further two aims. First, it aimed to explain why the defence gives rise to controversy, divided the academics and court and why the Supreme Court eventually rejected the defence. Second, it aimed to analyze the Supreme Courts Hanover Shoe decision and the academic response and criticism to the Courts decision. The Supreme Courts reasoning behind the rejecting the defence was that the task <b>of</b> establishing <b>passing-on</b> would require convincing proof of virtually unascertainable figure, prove insurmountable and render the already complex antitrust damages actions completely unmanageable. As stated by the Supreme Court: we are not impressed with the argument that sound laws of economics require recognizing this passing-on defence. The Supreme Courts analysis rests on three, well grounded, premises, (i) it is difficult to establish that the buyer has raised his price in response to the overcharge. Second, it is an insurmountable task to proof that the first buyer could not or would not have raised its prices or maintained supra-competitive prices had the alleged overcharges ceased. Finally, the same difficulty applies in proving that that the first purchaser did not lose sales or profit margin thereafter. Chapter 3 focused exclusively on the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick case where it rejected the indirect purchaser standing. This chapter aimed to explain the Courts reasoning in rejecting the indirect purchaser standing and its exceptions to the indirect purchaser rule. It revealed that the Court barred also indirect purchasers from bringing pass-on antitrust claims under the federal antitrust claims. The Supreme Court rejected standing in Illinois Brick on three grounds: (i) symmetry with Hanover Shoe; (ii) considerations of efficiency and (iii) effectiveness. The Court feared for multiple liability of the defendant. Presumably, the difficulties of proof apply also for the offensive use <b>of</b> <b>passing-on.</b> The Supreme Court also found that indirect purchasers are less likely than direct purchasers to institute actions to recover illegal overcharges. The Court feared further that, even in case if procedural devices are introduced to bring all potential claimants in one single action: the difficulties likely to be encountered in management of [such] a class action would make the procedure equally inadequate. The Court feared, further that apportioning the recoveries among all of the potential will add whole new dimensions of complexity to treble-damage suits and seriously undermine their effectiveness. Chapter 4 was concerned with deciphering the legislative response to the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick decision. This chapter revealed that the Courts decision received a lot of criticism. The force of the criticism has driven the legislator to intervene by proposing legislation to overturn these decisions. In 1978, 1983 and 1990 - 1991 the Congress attempted to overturn the decision but failed to do so. The First Task Force, which has been constituted by the American Bar Association, proposed combining all the claims arising from a violation in one single forum (under one jurisdiction). They argued that this is the only practical alternative to avoid the concerns of the Supreme Court in Illinois Brick. An opt-in regime, aggregating and allocating damages for the whole class in one single forum is proposed. The minority, however, did not agree with these proposals which resulted in a minority report. They argued for an opt-out regime. They argued that, otherwise the claims of all injured persons will be subjected to any favourable or adverse judgment on liability. Instead, the minority proposed a bifurcated procedure as a solution. Under this procedure, the defendants violation and aggregate total damages will be determined first, following which defendants would be dismissed from the case. The minority describes the second stage as follows: If an award was made, the various claimant groups would then litigate between themselves their respective rights to share in the aggregate total and any sums remaining undistributed {{at the conclusion of the}} proceedings would be given to the state governments in the geographic areas affected. However, this procedure is criticized for being too revolutionary. The minority proposed further a class-wide damages assessment. The calculation of damages consists of a two-step procedure of first determining the aggregate damages to the class and then distributing the damage award proportionally among class member. The Congress new attempt to overturn the decision also failed in 1983. The Task Force criticized the proposed legislation because it failed to deal with the fundamental conflict in policy which the Supreme Court has twice resolved, first in Hanover Shoe and then in Illinois Brick. However, the Supreme Court also recognized, as a practical matter, that compensation objectives must sometimes give way to manageability and fairness. In other words, the decisions in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick rest at bottom on the inescapable and very real practical problems which are likely to arise in indirect purchaser suits: (i) tracing overcharges; (ii) over-complexity; (iii) possible double recovery; (iv) inconsistent judgments and (v) dilution of interest in enforcing antitrust claims. The Task Force is convinced that the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick decision to bar indirect purchaser claims was founded on valid concerns. Chapter 5 presents itself as another important cornerstone of this thesis. This chapter provided an extensive analysis of the state responses to the Illinois Brick decision. The problems surrounding the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing not only divided the academics but also the courts. Some state courts (and the legislator) have clearly accepted vis-à-vis the Supreme Court, the indirect purchaser standing and the defence <b>of</b> <b>passing-on.</b> Others state courts (and legislator) rejected the passing-on defence but allowed the indirect purchaser standing through Illinois Brick repealers. These states have one common feature: the courts in these states have showed that the Supreme Courts overstated concerns are not a reason to reject the indirect purchaser standing and passing-on defence.|$|R
