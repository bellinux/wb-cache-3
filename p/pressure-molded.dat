50|$|Masonite {{is a type}} of {{hardboard}} made of steam-cooked and <b>pressure-molded</b> wood fibres in {{a process}} patented by William H. Mason. This product is also known as Quartrboard, Isorel, hernit, karlit, torex or treetex.|$|E
40|$|A {{solid state}} Hg(Au) /HgO {{reference}} electrode was prepared utilizing gold amalgam solid particles. Solid fine powder {{of the gold}} amalgam was prepared by chemical reduction of Au(III) with NaBH 4 followed by reduction of Hg(II) {{in the presence of}} gold fine particles. The solid content in the suspension of the gold amalgam particles and fine mercury oxide particles in DMF containing PVC was precipitated by the addition of a large amount of water to give solid Hg(Au) /HgO/PVC mixture. After drying, the mixture was <b>pressure-molded</b> to a physically stable Hg(Au) /HgO composite reference electrode material. The electrochemical characteristics of the electrode as a reference electrode were very similar to an ordinary Hg/HgO reference electrode. The electrode material can be molded and fabricated in any desired shape and size. The surface can be renewed by a simple polishing process whenever contaminated or deactivated. The applicability of the electrode in the electrochemical detection of carbohydrates after anion exchange separation was evaluated...|$|E
5000|$|In this method, the {{exterior}} {{surface of the}} fuselage is also the primary structure. A typical early form of this (see the Lockheed Vega) was built using molded plywood, where the layers of plywood are formed over a [...] "plug" [...] or within a mold. A later form of this structure uses fiberglass cloth impregnated with polyester or epoxy resin, instead of plywood, as the skin. A simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core, with a fiberglass covering, eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds, but requiring more effort in finishing (see the Rutan VariEze). An example of a larger molded plywood aircraft is the de Havilland Mosquito fighter/light bomber of World War II.No plywood-skin fuselage is truly monocoque, since stiffening elements are incorporated into the structure to carry concentrated loads that would otherwise buckle the thin skin.The use of molded fiberglass using negative ("female") molds (which give a nearly finished product) is prevalent in the series production of many modern sailplanes. The use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (using <b>pressure-molding</b> on female molds).|$|R
