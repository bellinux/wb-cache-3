50|$|Among {{the middle}} Miocene Sarmatian palynoflora from the Lavanttal Basin Austria {{researchers}} have recognized <b>Parrotia</b> fossil pollen. The sediment containing the <b>Parrotia</b> fossil pollen had accumulated in a lowland wetland environment with various vegetation units of mixed evergreen/deciduous broadleaved/conifer forests surrounding the wetland basin. Key {{relatives of the}} fossil taxa found with <b>Parrotia</b> are presently confined to humid warm temperate environments, suggesting a subtropical climate during the middle Miocene in Austria.|$|E

Some examples of exotic flora that are on grounds include the False Larch and Pseudolarix kaempferia from Japan; the White Enkianthus and the Enkianthis perulatas from China; and the Persian Ironwood.

50|$|It is a {{stratified}} forest, with a {{layer of}} very tall trees such as the endemic chestnut-leaved oak (boland-mazu; Quercus castaneaefolia), Siberian elm (derakht-e-azad; Zelkova crenata) and iron tree (anjili; <b>Parrotia</b> persica) and more common elms, maples, and hornbeams (ulas); a layer of smaller trees like the endemic Gleditchia caspica (lilaki), Diospyros lotus (kalhu), and Albizzia julibrissin (shabkhosb), boxwood (shemshad) in shady spots and all kinds of wild fruit trees; and an underwood with evergreen bushes such as Prunus laurocerasus (jal) and holly (khas), moss, wild vine, ivy, and other creeping plants. Medium altitude mountains are the realm of the lofty oriental beech (rash; Fagus orientalis), associated with oaks (balut), lime-trees (namdar), maples (afra), and elms (narvan; qq.v.). The upper mountain level, between 1800 and 2200 m, has remnants of a quite poorer forest of stunted oaks (uri; Quercus macranthera) and hornbeams (Carpinus orientalis). Alpine meadows, climacic at higher altitudes, have often replaced these upper mountain forests, some of them, on highest ridges or sheltered slopes, show distinctly xerophytic features.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Parrotia</b> persica or Iron wood is {{a unique}} broad leaves species in Hyrcanian forest of IR-Iran. The {{produced}} leaf litter by this species is an intrinsic component of the ecological integrity of a forested ecosystem. In present study the soil of leaf litter beneath and control plots were sampled at the depth of 0 - 10 cm. Samples were analyzed for macro and micro nutrients content. The fresh leaves of <b>Parrotia</b> persica were also collected and nutrients content were determined. Results indicated that the leaf litter decreased the soil electrical conductivity and pH (P 0. 05). Magnesium and iron were more in <b>Parrotia</b> persica summer leaves in proportion to other elements, while leaf litter increased the magnesium and decreased the iron of soil. In addition, the maximum changes in soil nutrients occurred for organic matter, organic carbon and nitrogen.
