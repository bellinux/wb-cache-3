25|$|Pure {{plastics}} {{have low}} toxicity {{due to their}} insolubility in water {{and because they are}} biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. <b>Plastic</b> <b>products</b> contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens.

The analysis need to repeat three time for each eight material. Finally, the average value of cooling time (s), filling time (s), and initial injection time (s) obtained from the analysis. From those parameters, the cycle time of product producing can be calculated for each eight material. The cycle time can relate to the production capacity, product cost and profit. From that comparison, the best material for <b>plastic</b> <b>product</b> (book tray) can be selected and also can know the effect of cycle time only on processing cost.

25|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>products</b> {{are printed}} with numbers 1–7 {{depending}} on the type of resin. Type 1 (polyethylene terephthalate) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, hula hoops, credit cards, wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is polypropylene and makes up syrup bottles, straws, Tupperware, and some automotive parts. Type 6 is polystyrene and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.|$|E

Injection Molding Machine (IMM) {{has been}} widely used for the mass {{production}} of a <b>plastic</b> <b>product.</b> With {{the development of the}} relative technique, various injection molding techniques have been developed and we could get more precise <b>plastic</b> <b>product.</b> In this paper, we present the system reliability of an IMM subject to a controller. The controller of an IMM {{is an important factor in}} the injection molding and this controller has direct influence on the quality of a <b>plastic</b> <b>product.</b> Presently, the mold close and open control method of a toggle type IMM is openloop control. Open-loop method is difficult to control when they affect highly nonlinear characteristic in an IMM. Therefore, we propose an alternate approach to implement the controller using closed-loop control method to enhance the reliability. Through the development, fuzzy control algorithm is selected and it is programmed by an IL(Instruction List) and a LD(Ladder Diagram) on a PC based PLC. For the development of an IMM controller, PC based PLC of PCI card type, distributed I/O modules with CANopen, Industrial PC and HMI(Human Machine Interface) software are used...|$|R
