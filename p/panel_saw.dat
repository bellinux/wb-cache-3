50|$|<b>Panel</b> <b>saws</b> {{are used}} by cabinet shops to easily cut panels, profiles, solid-wood, plywood, MDF, laminates, plastic sheets and {{melamine}} sheets into sizes or cabinet components. They are also used by sign shops to cut sheets of aluminum, plastic and wood for their sign blanks. Some higher end <b>panel</b> <b>saws</b> feature computer controls that move the blade and fence systems to preset values. Other lower end machines offer simplicity and ease of use, including full scale hobbyist level <b>panel</b> <b>saws</b> at a mere fraction of the cost. While the entry level machines are designed for light duty usage, they offer home DIYers a cheap alternative for infrequent cutting when accuracy and clean cuts are not required.|$|R

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} here {{originates in}} the industry of flat glass cutting and wood <b>panel</b> <b>sawing,</b> where smaller items are cut from larger items accordingly to predefined cutting patterns. In this type of industry the smaller pieces that are cut from the patterns are piled around the machine in stacks according {{to the size of}} the pieces, which are moved to the warehouse only when all items of the same size have been cut. If the cutting machine can process only one pattern at a time, and the workspace is limited, it is desirable to set the sequence in which the cutting patterns are processed in a way to minimize the maximum number of open stacks around the machine. This problem is known in literature as the minimization of open stacks (MOSP). To find the best sequence of the cutting patterns, we propose an integer programming model, based on interval graphs, that searches for an appropriate edge completion of the given graph of the problem, while defining a suitable coloring of its vertices...|$|R

For instance, 60.5 % of pulp and 47.1 % of plywood are exported. These demonstrate {{the importance of}} exportations for the forest Brazilian sector.

5000|$|A sliding <b>panel</b> <b>saw</b> {{was invented}} by Wilhelm Altendorf in 1906 in Germany. Its {{invention}} set a new standard in woodworking, with dramatic differences from traditional machines. Up to that time, a conventional table saw had no mechanism for edging. Meaning {{that for the first}} and second longitudinal cut on untreated massive wood, the lumber always had to be fed manually through the saw blade. The new system accomplished the task more elegantly by allowing the work piece to be fed through the saw blade while lying on a sliding table. Thus cutting becomes faster, accurate and effortless.|$|E
50|$|Spanboard Products Ltd at Coleraine in Northern Ireland began {{production}} in 1959 and {{was acquired by}} Sonae Industria, Portugal’s largest privately owned industrial group in 1989. The company was extensively refurbished in the early 1990s when a new {{state of the art}} panel line for edged panels was installed. Investment was also made in a computerized <b>panel</b> <b>saw</b> to provide a cut to size service for melamine faced panels and gives greater flexibility for customer service. The factory produces wood particle board to meet the criteria of both, BS EN 312, (physical requirements for Particleboard) and also the site Quality Management System, which operates to ISO 9001.|$|E

The other three judges were replaced by Musicmakers executive Kim Kuusi, singer-songwriter Nina Tapio and Jarkko Valtee.

The data used {{are available at the}} United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The concentration was determined by the concentration ratio [HR (k) ], the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), Theil Entropy Index (E) and the Gini index (G).

According to Bain, the concentration ratio of the four and eight largest exporters of forest products is moderately low; the HHI and Theil Entropy (E) show a reduction in the concentration of world exports of forest products and greater competition among the countries that sell such products; the Gini index indicates that despite the increase in export of forest products over the period of analysis, a smaller number of competitors concentrate increasingly larger shares of international exports of these products; summary indices (HHI, E and G) indicated that increased competition has not led to a more equitable distribution of forest products so as to bring down inequalities and concentration of profits in the sector; despite the downward trend in CR (4) and CR (8), there is an increase in G, probably because the economies of scale in the international trade have been held by few competitors; caution is recommended in the analysis of summary indices (HHI, E and G) which had better be checked jointly with the partial indices [CR (k) ] in order to avoid wrong conclusions; countries with a significant share in total exports, such as Brazil, should seek business strategies to retain competitive advantages, especially those arising from economies of scale...|$|R
