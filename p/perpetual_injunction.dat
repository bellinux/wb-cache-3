On {{presenting}} himself one day in the steaming corridor of a vapour bath, he was at once hustled back into his clothes by the proprietor, who was a North Italian, and who emphatically refused to allow the celebrated Fall of Icarus to be publicly on view without the permission of the municipality of Bergamo. Public interest and official vigilance increased as the matter became more widely known, and Deplis was unable to take a simple dip in the sea or river on the hottest afternoon unless clothed up to the collarbone in a substantial bathing garment. Later on the authorities of Bergamo, conceived the idea that salt water might be injurious to the masterpiece, and a <b>perpetual</b> <b>injunction</b> was obtained which debarred the muchly harassed commercial traveller from sea bathing under any circumstances. Altogether, he was fervently thankful when his firm of employers found him a new range of activities in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux. His thankfulness, however, ceased abruptly at the Franco-Italian frontier. An imposing array of official force barred his departure, and he was sternly reminded of the stringent law which forbids the exportation of Italian works of art.|$|E

50|$|Suits {{in equity}} having been begun in 1879 for the {{infringement}} {{of the two}} patents, and the circuit court having dismissed the bills, this Court in reversing the decrees after the first patent had expired but not the second, awarded accounts of profits and damages as to both patents, and a <b>perpetual</b> <b>injunction</b> as to the second patent.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to define and explore the meaning of 2 ̆ 2 the {{exclusive}} Right 2 ̆ 2 in the Intellectual Property Clause of the United States Constitution as related to the promotion of learning, the public domain, and authors. Without {{a clear understanding of}} this key term, one is likely to be unaware that lower federal courts are continually making rulings contrary to both the Copyright Clause and the Copyright Act. The classic example is the judicially created sweat-of-the-brow copyright, which in 1991 [...] after seventy-five years of precedent [...] the Supreme Court decreed to be unconstitutional. Other bad precedents, such as <b>perpetual</b> <b>injunctions</b> to prevent the infringement of future copyrights, remain uncorrected. Part II of this article deals with the source of 2 ̆ 2 the exclusive Right 2 ̆ 2 that the framers empowered Congress to secure, which requires consideration {{of the history of the}} English copyright jurisprudence as well as the American understanding of that jurisprudence. Part III shows that copyright policies and principles are derived from the meaning of 2 ̆ 2 the exclusive Right 2 ̆ 2 as the right to publish and vend; and Part IV demonstrates that the 1976 Act codifies the principles discussed in light of 2 ̆ 2 the exclusive Right. 2 ̆ 2 Part V is a brief commentary on understanding copyright, a goal that requires courts to cease reading the Copyright Act piecemeal and to read it whole in light of the Copyright Clause. Part VI is the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|In May 2007, {{a number}} of {{governors}} completed their eight-year term of office. Having lost the immunity conferred on them by Section 308 of the Constitution, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) invited them for investigation {{on the basis of}} several petitions alleging diversion of public funds running to billions of naira. Some reported for interrogation while others sought interlocutory and <b>perpetual</b> <b>injunctions</b> restraining the EFCC from arresting, investigating or prosecuting them in any manner whatsoever and howsoever. Among those who were charged to court only two have been convicted and given light sentences. The majority of the defendants have continued to manipulate the criminal justice system to frustrate their trial. To the eternal shame of the country one of the ex-governors who got {{a clean bill of health}} by a Nigerian court was later convicted and jailed by a British court. Out of the two, who jumped bail in the United Kingdom, one is now a Senator of the Republic. Not unexpectedly, the Nigerian people have justifiably blamed lawyers and judges for frustrating the anti-graft agencies from successfully prosecuting politically exposed persons and other members of the ruling class accused of corrupt practices and money laundering. In this presentation we shall examine how the neo-colonial legal system is regularly exploited by senior lawyers in favour of rich and powerful criminal suspects to the detriment of accountability and transparency in the society. And the questions remain: Is there a way out of the woods? Can this trend change as Nigeria approaches 2015 Elections? What are the implications of this trend? Even the judiciary has not helped matters together with the agencie...|$|R

50|$|The Equitable Telephone Association was an English company {{incorporated}} on the 15th December, 1886 for {{the purpose}} of manufacturing and selling telephone equipment based on the patents of Alan Archibald Campbell Swinton. In late 1887 the company started to sell its equipment. In March 1888 the United Telephone Company accused it of infringing the United Telephone Company's patents. The accusation was upheld in court and the UTC was granted a <b>perpetual</b> <b>injunction</b> forbidding the ETA from selling its infringing equipment. As a result, the ETA was left with little money, no means of raising more through sales, and no wish by its shareholders to provide more. The company wound up its affairs in 1889.|$|E
5000|$|Now that a [...] "roller coaster" [...] {{is ready}} to be {{launched}} upon the local public at Savin Rock, it is interesting to learn from the Boston Herald that Judge Buchwalter of Cincinnati, has been occupied an entire day with the hearing of testimony in a complaint case against one of them. Henry A. Morill {{and a number of other}} property owners and residents in the vicinity of the Bellevue house, in Cincinnati, are the plaintiffs, and David Billigheimer the defendant. The plaintiffs allege that the [...] "roller coaster" [...] or circular gravity railway, recently constructed on the Bellevue house grounds, is a nuisance to the neighborhood, on account of the noise it produces; that it prevents sleep, tortures invalids and nervous people, interrupts conversations, and will depreciate the value of property in that vicinity unless its further operation is enjoined, which the plaintiffs pray the court may be done by a <b>perpetual</b> <b>injunction.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In May 2014, the Supreme Court of the Australian {{state of}} Western Australia {{dismissed}} [...] "Marsh v. Baxter". [...] The plaintiff was Steve Marsh, an organic farmer, and {{the defendant was}} Michael Baxter, his lifelong neighbour, who grew GM canola. [...] In late 2010 Marsh found seeds from Baxter's crop in his fields. Later, Marsh found escaped GM canola growing amidst his crop. Marsh reported the seed and plants to his local organic certification board, and lost the organic certification of some 70 per cent of his 478 hectare farm. Marsh sued {{on the grounds that}} Baxter used a method of harvesting his crop that was substandard and negligent, and on the basis that his land had been widely contaminated. In its summary judgment, the court found that approximately 245 cut canola plants were blown by the wind into Marsh's property, Eagle's Rest. However, Baxter's method (swathing) was [...] "orthodox and well accepted harvest methodology". [...] "In 2011, eight GM canola plants were found to have grown up as self-sown volunteer plants on Eagle Rest," [...] which [...] "were identified and pulled out", and [...] "no more volunteer RR canola plants grew on Eagle Rest in subsequent years." [...] The summary judgment stated that the loss of organic certification [...] "was occasioned by the erroneous application of governing NASAA Standards applicable to NASAA organic operators as regards GMOs (genetically modified organisms) at the time." [...] and that [...] "the absence of a reliable underlying evidentiary platform to support a <b>perpetual</b> <b>injunction</b> against swathing was a significant deficiency".|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of Lacanian and psychoanalytic {{concepts}} that are reworked throughout the course of the book. The parallax concept, for example, has important implications for Lacan's concept of the Real. Whereas the Real for Lacan meant a hard kernel that resisted symbolization, for Žižek the term refers to the [...] "gap in perspectives." [...] Another concept that Žižek redefines is the superego. According to Jameson, Žižek's revision looks beyond the superego as the [...] "instance of repression and judgment, of taboo and guilt" [...] toward a new definition that states that the superego today has become [...] "something obscene, whose <b>perpetual</b> <b>injunction</b> is: 'Enjoy!'" [...] Whereas the superego was once thought by Freud to prohibit certain activities, today, Žižek argues, it commands people toward the pursuit of pleasure. Jameson claims that the [...] "death drive" [...] is another one of Žižek's persistent fundamental themes. In his revision of the Freudian Thanatos, Žižek suggest that the death drive's true horror is that it lives through us, embodied in life itself. The concept of jouissance also receives a revision; according to Žižek, the envy of the Other's jouissance accounts for [...] "collective violence, racism, nationalism and the like, as much as for the singularities of individual investments, choices and obsessions..." [...] One final and crucial concept in the book involves the Lacanian [...] "gap." [...] According to Jameson, this refers to the doctrine that [...] "the human subjectivity is permanently split and bears a gap within itself, a wound, an inner distance that can never be overcome." ...|$|E
