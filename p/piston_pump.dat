2500|$|In 1924–25, Goddard had {{problems}} developing a high-pressure <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> to send {{fuel to the}} combustion chamber. He wanted to scale up the experiments, but his funding would not allow such growth. He decided to forego the pumps and use a pressurized fuel feed system applying pressure to the fuel tank from a tank of inert gas, a technique used today. The liquid oxygen, some of which evaporated, [...] provided its own pressure.|$|E

50|$|A direct {{displacement}} control pump {{is a kind}} of axial <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> with a direct {{displacement control}}.A direct displacement control uses a mechanical lever attached to the swashplate of the axial <b>piston</b> <b>pump.</b> Higher system pressures require more force to move that lever, making direct displacement control only suitable for light or medium duty pumps. Heavy duty pumps require servo control.|$|E

50|$|A multi-bladed {{windmill}} is {{a mechanical}} device with a <b>piston</b> <b>pump.</b> Because a <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> has a fixed stroke, the energy demand {{of this type}} of pump is proportional to pump speed only. On the other hand, the energy supply of a wind rotor is proportional to the cube of wind speed. Because of that, a wind rotor runs at over speed (more speed than needed), yielding a loss of aerodynamic efficiency.|$|E

The asperity curvature at multiple scales and height distribution are obtained by analyzing actual contact surface profiles, then the separating pressure of asperities is estimated by the Hertz theory and the fluid separating pressure is calculated by Reynolds equation. Experimental results indicate that this model can predict film thickness accurately...|$|R
