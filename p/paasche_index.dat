40|$|Two {{issues are}} {{addressed}} in this paper. First, we explore the issue of price index invariance in the linearized Almost Ideal demand system. We establish that the Stone index, which lacks invariance, and the recently proposed invariant Laspeyres, <b>Paasche</b> and Tornqvist <b>indices</b> all generate biased and inconsistent estimators. Monte Carlo evidence shows that invariance does not necessarily lead to better estimates of price and income elasticities insofar as the Stone and <b>Paasche</b> <b>indices</b> are unambiguously inferior to the Laspeyres and Tornqvist indices, especially if prices are not strongly positively correlated. Second, we examine {{the merits of the}} widely used conditional ML estimator of the non-linear Almost Ideal system in which a prior value is chosen for the "subsistence" parameter. We find that the bias and trace mean square error increases induced by conditional estimation are modest. The choice between the linearized and the non-linear models favors the latter although in some cases linear methods are as good as non-linear.

5000|$|Utility is not {{directly}} measurable, so {{the true cost of}} living index only serves as a theoretical ideal, not a practical price index formula. However, more practical formulas can be evaluated based on their relationship to the true cost of living index. One of the most commonly used formulas for consumer price indices, the Laspeyres price index, compares the cost of what a consumer bought in one time period (q0) with how much it would have cost to buy the same set of goods and services in a later period. Since the utility from q0 in the first year should be equal to the utility from q0 in the next year, Laspeyres gives the upper bound for the true cost-of-living index. [...] Laspeyres only serves as an upper bound, because consumers could turn to substitute goods for those goods that have gotten more expensive and achieved the same level of utility from q0 for a lower cost. In contrast, a <b>Paasche</b> price <b>index</b> uses the cost of a set of goods purchased in one time period with the cost it would have taken to buy the same set of goods in an earlier time period. It can be shown that the Paasche is a lower bound for true cost of living index. Since upper and lower bounds of the true cost of living index can be found, respectively, through the Laspeyres and <b>Paasche</b> <b>indices,</b> the geometric average of the two, known as the Fisher price index, is a close approximation of the true cost of living index if the upper and lower bounds are not too far apart.|$|R

In {{addition to the}} classic Malmquist productivity index, the 'productivity' package contains also the multiplicatively complete Fisher, Laspeyres, Paasche, Färe-Primont and Lowe indices.

In the case of the Fisher, Laspeyres, Paasche and the transitive Färe-Primont and Lowe indices, it is furthermore possible to rule out technological change. The package also allows to prohibit negative technological change.

These indexes measure changes in the average foreign exchange value of a currency over time. The construction of a TWEX index requires numerous decisions.

In addition, countries adopting the single currency may find it useful to develop their own TWEXs, similar to those that exist for regions within the United States. All commonly-used TWEXs are based on either a Laspeyres or <b>Paasche</b> price <b>index.</b> In the present paper we argue that producers of TWEXs should consider using the chain approach for the construction of their indexes because of an issue that affects TWEXs based on either Laspeyres or <b>Paasche</b> price <b>indexes</b> - the choice of base period.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} two {{procedures for}} calculating Purchasing Power Parities (ppps) at the basic heading level: {{the first one}} suggested by UNSO and the second one used by EUROSTAT For the synthesis of the prices of items, UNSO resorts to the "characteristicity" or "asterisk" approach and proposes the unweighted geometric mean of the ratios {{with at least one}} asterisk, whereas EUROSTAT transforms the above approach into that of "equi-characteristicity" and introduces pseudo Laspeyres and <b>Paasche</b> <b>indexes</b> and finally Fisher forms which in some sense are weighted geometric means. For the purpose of producing a complete and transitive matrix of ppps, both resort to the EKS procedure, or GEKS, as this paper proposes to rename it. As far as the EUROSTAT procedure is concerned, the formulas for pseudo L and P are analyzed (leaving aside the simple geometric mean suggested by UNSO which gives biased results because of the Gerschenkron effect) and it is shown that the ratios of sums are proper L and P indexes which advantage is that of having a simple and reasonable economic meaning. &# 13; As for the GEKS iterative procedure, the paper proves that the minimization over the L and P matrices of parities instead of over the matrix of the Fs leads the process to converge in many more cases - therefore giving complete and transitive matrices - than one would obtain through minimization of the matrix of the Fs, which results in a minor loss of information...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{developed by the}} Central Bank of Chile to calculate unit value indexes for exports and imports of goods. The methodology was applied to data from 2003 onward, {{and the results were}} first released in May of 2005, when a quarterly series starting in 1996 was published. The series was constructed by linking the values obtained from the application of the new methodology, to the official values calculated for the 1996 – 2002 period according to the previous methodology. The new methodology introduces a Laspeyres index - the previous methodology was based on <b>Paasche</b> <b>indexes</b> - in which the weights of prices (unit values) are the volumes of a moving base year. The resulting yearly variations are linked, thus constructing a fixed base index. This procedure allows the weights to be adjusted yearly, and therefore, avoids a possible loss of relevance, which is particularly important in the case of imports, which undergo frequent changes. The new methodology also introduces important changes in the use of statistical techniques {{to improve the quality of}} the basic data in two areas: the minimization of distortions due to erroneous data, and the application of sampling techniques to improve intertemporal comparability of imports. The literature reviewed for this project shows that there is no single way to approach the calculation of these indexes. The choice of a certain methodology depends on the characteristics of the basic data, of the human and technical resources available, and of the specific uses of the index. Nonetheless, the methods chosen for calculating foreign trade indexes in Chile are similar to those applied by other statistical offices. ...|$|R
40|$|Textbooks of {{macroeconomics}} regularly remind {{their readers}} {{that they should}} not interpret the macroeconomic price variable as some sort of average price.
