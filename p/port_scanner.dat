25|$|UDP {{scanning}} is also possible, {{although there}} are technical challenges. UDP is a connectionless protocol {{so there is no}} equivalent to a TCP SYN packet.

40|$|Many network {{engineers}} might {{presume that}} the TCP three way handshake is the one, inviolate method of establishing TCP connections. A smaller percentage of engineers are also {{familiar with the}} little-used "simultaneous-open " connection method of establishing TCP connections. Researchers have discovered a third means to initiate TCP sessions, dubbed the "split-handshake " method, which blends features of both the three way handshake and the simultaneous-open connection. Popular TCP/IP networking stacks respect this novel handshaking method, including Microsoft, Apple, and Linux stacks, with no modification. Given the novelty of the split-handshake technique, session aware devices have had very little formal testing to determine their effectiveness in relation to sessions established in this way. The authors audit a number of intrusion detection devices, NAT gateways, <b>port</b> <b>scanners,</b> and firewalls, and unexpected behavior was observed within each class of device and application.

40|$|Abstract—The Internet host cardinality, {{defined as}} the number of {{distinct}} peers that an Internet host communicates with, is an important metric for profiling Internet hosts. Some example applications include behavior based network intrusion detection, p 2 p hosts identification, and server identification. However, due to the tremendous number of hosts in the Internet and high speed links, tracking the exact cardinality of each host is not feasible due to the limited memory and computation resource. Existing approaches on host cardinality counting have primarily focused on hosts of extremely high cardinalities. These methods do not work well with hosts of moderately large cardinalities that are needed for certain host behavior profiling such as detection of p 2 p hosts or <b>port</b> <b>scanners.</b> In this paper, we propose an online sampling approach for identifying hosts whose cardinality exceeds some moderate prescribed threshold, e. g. 50, or within specific ranges. The main advantage of our approach is that it can filter out the majority of low cardinality hosts while preserving the hosts of interest, and hence minimize the memory resources wasted by tracking irrelevant hosts. Our approach consists of three components: 1) two-phase filtering for eliminating low cardinality hosts, 2) thresholded bitmap for counting cardinalities, and 3) bias correction. Through both theoretical analysis and experiments using real Internet traces, we demonstrate that our approach requires much less memory than existing approaches do whereas yields more accurate estimates.

50|$|Mathy Vanhoef and Frank Piessens {{significantly}} improved upon the WPA-TKIP attacks of Erik Tews and Martin Beck. They demonstrated how to inject an arbitrary amount of packets, with each packet containing at most 112 bytes of payload. This was demonstrated by implementing a <b>port</b> <b>scanner,</b> {{which can be}} executed against any client using WPA-TKIP. Additionally they showed how to decrypt arbitrary packets sent to a client. They mentioned this {{can be used to}} hijack a TCP connection, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript when the victim visits a website.In contrast, the Beck-Tews attack could only decrypt short packets with mostly known content, such as ARP messages, and only allowed injection of 3 to 7 packets of at most 28 bytes. The Beck-Tews attack also requires Quality of Service (as defined in 802.11e) to be enabled, while the Vanhoef-Piessens attack does not. Neither attack leads to recovery of the shared session key between the client and Access Point. The authors say using a short rekeying interval can prevent some attacks but not all, and strongly recommend switching from TKIP to AES-based CCMP.|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 42). To test if a host contains any known security flaws over a network connection a Vulnerability Assessment (VA) could be used. This thesis describes different techniques used by VA tools over a network connection to detect known security flaws. To decrease the risk of flaws not being detected, several VA tools could be used. In this paper firstly types of vulnerabilities are discussed and also the impacts of different vulnerabilities are pointed out. This paper mainly focuses on two different categories of VA tool, <b>Port</b> <b>Scanner</b> and Vulnerability Scanner. As an example of <b>port</b> <b>scanner</b> this paper discusses about Nmap <b>port</b> <b>scanner</b> and as vulnerability scanner it discusses about Nessus. Both these tools are open source VA tools. This paper contains the scan reports using these tools over a range of IP addresses. The analysis part of this paper gives an idea about how these tools scan for security flaws and suggest solutions to make a host or network out of risk. Syeda Tasnuva AhsanSamina Rabiul AlamB.

40|$|Abstract Practically every {{corporation}} that {{is connected to}} the Internet has at least one firewall, and often many more. However, the protection that these firewalls provide {{is only as good as}} the policy they are configured to implement. Therefore, testing, auditing, or reverse-engineering existing firewall configurations are important components of every corporation’s network security practice. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Firewall configuration files are written in notoriously hard to read languages, using vendorspecific GUIs. A tool that is sorely missing in the arsenal of firewall administrators and auditors is one that allows them to analyze the policy on a firewall. To alleviate some of these difficulties, we designed and implemented two generations of novel firewall analysis tools, which allow the administrator to easily discover and test the global firewall policy. Our tools use a minimal description of the network topology, and directly parse the various vendor-specific low-level configuration files. A key feature of our tools is that they are passive: no packets are sent, and the analysis is performed offline, on a machine that is separate from the firewall itself. A typical question our tools can answer is “from which machines can our DMZ be reached, and with which services?. ” Thus, our tools complement existing vulnerability analyzers and <b>port</b> <b>scanners,</b> as they can be used before a policy is actually deployed, and they operate on a more understandable level of abstraction...|$|R

40|$|In today's {{distributed}} computing environment where computer networks and Internet are convenient medium {{of communication and}} information exchange, security {{is becoming more and}} more of an issue. Security in computer networks and Internet have serious implication in today's dynamic work environment. Security is now a basic requirement because {{distributed computing}} is inherently insecure. In an organization, irrespective of its size and volume, one of many roles played by the Network and System Administrators is to improve the security of computer infrastructure. However, with rapid surface of new vulnerabilities and exploits, sometime even a fully patched system or network have security flaws. There are different security measures which network/system administrator can deploy to secure the network or system, however, the best way truly to ensure that the network or system is secure, is to perform penetration testing. Penetration testing can provide Network and System Administrators with a realistic assessment of security posture by identifying the vulnerabilities and exploits which exist within the computer network infrastructure. Penetration testing uses the same principles as crackers or hackers to penetrate computer network infrastructure and thereby verify the presence of flaws and vulnerabilities and help to confirm the security measures. The thesis starts with defining the theoretical background of a penetration test. When the foundation is set, the thesis moves on and proposes a suitable penetration testing methodology using Free/Open Source Softwares (F/OSS) and techniques, to find out to what extend a penetration testing can succeed. This thesis also tries to identify the future trends and further research directions in penetration testing and network security. The aim of this thesis is to identify and explain a suitable methodology behind the penetration testing and illustrate free and open source tools and techniques to simulate a possible attacks that the Network and System Administrators can use against their network or system.
