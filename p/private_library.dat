5|$|Unlike {{other authors}} of the genre, Tolkien never favoured signing his works. Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his letters or of the first editions of his {{individual}} writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may occur on the market. In particular, the signed first hardback edition of The Hobbit from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000. Collectibles also include non-fiction books with hand-written annotations from Tolkien's <b>private</b> <b>library.</b>|$|E

5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a <b>private</b> <b>library</b> Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|Prescott began formal {{schooling}} {{at the age}} of seven, studying under Mr. Jacob Knapp. The {{family moved}} to Boston, Massachusetts in 1808, where his father's earnings substantially increased. His studies continued under Dr. John Gardiner, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church. As a young man, Prescott frequented the Boston Athenæum, which at the time held the 10,000-volume <b>private</b> <b>library</b> of John Quincy Adams, who was on a diplomatic mission to Russia. In 1832, Prescott became a trustee of the library, a position he held for 15years.|$|E
5|$|During Muñoz Rivera's childhood, Barranquitas was a {{small rural}} town. The family's house was {{moderately}} large for the time; it was built with wood and its roof was made with zinc. When he was four, his mother home-schooled him with books from a <b>private</b> <b>library</b> owned by his father. By the age of ten, Muñoz Rivera completed the education offered in the town's school, and finished first in his class. He was educated in Spanish and French, and took music classes with Jorge Colombani. His father hired private tutors to continue his instruction. Muñoz Rivera was a serious student with {{a strong interest in}} Miguel de Cervantes' works, in particular Don Quixote. Other authors that he studied include Fernando de Herrera, Tirso de Molina, Luis de Góngora, and Lope de Vega.|$|E

5|$|Francis Marrash {{was born}} in Aleppo, a city of Ottoman Syria (present-day Syria), to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their {{literary}} interests. Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century, the family was well established in Aleppo, although they had gone through troubles: a relative of Francis, Butrus Marrash, was martyred by Greek Orthodox fundamentalists in April 1818. Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from Aleppo during the persecutions, among them the priest Jibrail Marrash. Francis' father, Fathallah, tried to defuse the Sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849, in which he rejected the Filioque. He had built up a large <b>private</b> <b>library</b> to give his three children Francis, Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education, particularly {{in the field of}} Arabic language and literature.|$|E

25|$|Although a <b>private</b> <b>library</b> {{had existed}} since 1832, a public library {{did not exist}} in Guelph until 1882, when the Free Libraries Act allowed {{municipalities}} to operate libraries.

The current main library building on Norfolk St. was opened in 1965.|$|E

It was auctioned in 1859 and purchased by another autograph collector for the price of one pound fifteen pence. It passed to the Marquess of Crewe, who donated it in 1962 to the British Museum, where it is now on display.|$|E

Pabst is credited with the elaborate, two-story interior of medieval scholar Henry Charles Lea's <b>private</b> <b>library</b> (1881). This was removed from Lea's house at 2000 Walnut Street, Philadelphia in 1925, and installed at the University of Pennsylvania.
