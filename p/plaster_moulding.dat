In this study, {{the effect}} of {{alternative}} additives on the properties spred diameter, setting time, bending strength and water absorption of sanitaryware <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> was investigated. The plaster was partially replaced by the alternative additives such as perlite, diatomite and glass beads. Microstructural features of the resultant compositions were determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Finally, represantative moulds were produced and their performance was investigated under industrial conditions. It was observed that perlite and diatomite addition deteriorated the strength of <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> {{and there was no}} noticeable effect of these additives on casting performance of the <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds.</b> Morever, the presence of glass beads in plaster decreased weight of the moulds without deterioration of moulds service life. Slip casting is a common method for producing sanitaryware, and <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> have been used for shaping sanitaryware products [1, 2]. The most suitable material is to be gypsum, that is used extensively in the ceramic industry in moulding preforms from aqueous slips.

50|$|The {{building}} was originally {{built in the}} Beaux Arts style. There were no major alterations to the building until the 1950s, when modern conveniences were added.

Wood panelling was added to create more offices out of the large chambers present in the original design, and mahogany windows were replaced with aluminum ones. Windows on the ground floor were filled with concrete during the 1950s as well. City governments, believing they were making improvements to the building, actually harmed it or diminished its historical value. Terracotta tiles were painted over, which trapped moisture inside the tiles and caused parts of the building to rot.

50|$|In 1900 {{the house}} was {{acquired}} by Ealing Urban District Council {{in the year before}} it became a Municipal Borough for a total of £40,000 pounds, a quarter of which came from the Middlesex County Council. Its new function was to serve as a Free Public Library. However, work on converting the building did not start until after the death of its last resident, Frederika Perceval in May 1901. The important part of the work was to build a ground-floor extension with a pitched slate roof, on the west of the 'Eating Room'. However, this magnificent room was all that remained of George Dance's original design. Therefore, the Council had its chief surveyor Charles Jones design the extension next to the existing Breakfast Room. As Dance gave the room windows with a tall aspect, topped by semicircular bonded gauge brick arches, it made sense to remove the glazing and frames so as to open them up. This provided three large arched pedestrian openings into the newly created extension. To avoid a clash of architectural styles, Jones specified that the new extension be an almost mirror image of its neighbour, which is clearly visible through the connecting arches. With the high ceilings and matching <b>plaster</b> <b>moulding</b> and colour scheme, this helps create the illusion of one elegant, pleasantly proportioned and spacious reading area.|$|E
40|$|The <b>plaster</b> <b>moulding</b> {{process is}} {{commonly}} used for casting prototypes of aluminium components designed for subsequent production by die casting. Plaster moulded prototype castings possess dimensional tolerances and surface quality comparable to die castings, but vithout the high tooling costs and lead times. &fortunately, the mechanical properties of plaster castings are significantly inferior to their die cast counterparts. This is due pri-marily to the low thermal conductivity of plaster which extends casting solidijication time signijicantly compared to die or even sand casting processes. Long solidification times result in large grained castings demonstrating low strength and hardness. This work is an experimental investigation into the effects of various levels of silica sand and carbonfibre additions on the properties of foaming plaster moulds and associated aluminium castings. Data and statistical analyses are presented and conclusions drawn regarding the wet and dry strength of plaster moulds {{as a function of}} sand and carbon fibre content. Likewise, conclusions regarding the associated casting characteristics such as surface jinish, solid$cation time, hardness and tensile strength are presented. The eflec-tiveness of silica sand and carbon fibre additions with respect to improving the properties of plaster moulded prototype castings is also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|If {{museums in}} general have a haunted quality, {{monographic}} museums {{could be said}} to make it their trademark. In these museums dedicated to one artist and his or her art like the Warhol Museum in Pitsburgh or the series of Picasso Museums troughout Europe, the ‘museum-as-mauseleum’ is more than proverbial. This paper wants to map the different spectral aspects within monographic museums with regard to their collection, architecture, scenography and discourse. Some monographic museums like the mid-nineteenth century Thorvaldsen museum in Copenhague do contain the tomb of the artist burried amidst his works, while others limit the bodily presence of the glorified genius to a death mask or a <b>plaster</b> <b>moulding</b> of the artist’s hand. But the spectrality doesn’t limit itself to these macabre phenomena or their more common variants of the artist’s portrait or signature. Also the museum architecture can breath the artist’s presence, writ large: {{in the form of the}} preserved interior of the artist’s house or studio or in the ghostwriting an architect practices when conceiving a new museum gallery expressing the character of the presented oeuvre. Finally, a quintessential art historical and museological problem needs mention in this context. What is the appropriate weight to accord artistic intentionality in a monographic art museum after the “death of the author”? Many of these museum institutions are established in execution of the will of an artist and can be considered a posthumous performance. As such, is an artist’s foundation institutionally perpetuating the artist’s author-ity? Needs the respect for the artwork, as an entity the artist takes authorial responsibility for, to be extended to the curatorial matters of the museum? For instance, to installations that the artist made of his works in his personal museum? Or, to the particular reading of the oeuvre suggested by the selection of works bequeathed by the artist for exhibition in his personal museum...|$|E
40|$|<b>Plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> used in {{precision}} foundry {{are characterized}} by a very low permeability which, {{in the case of}} classic <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds,</b> equals to about 0, 01 ÷ 0, 02 m 2 /(MPa·s). One of the most effective methods for increasing the permeability is a foaming treatment. Another characteristic feature of plaster is its very good insulating power which has influence on the process of solidification and cooling of a cast and also on a knock-out property. This insulating power is a function of thermophysical properties of plaster which, in turn, depend mainly on the mineralogical composition of the mould material, its bulk density {{as well as on the}} temperature of the pouring alloy. In the case of a foamed <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> an increase of the degree of foaming increases its porosity which causes a change in its thermophysical properties, thereby increasing susceptibility of the mass to overheating. The susceptibility of the plaster layer surrounding the cast to overheating is favorable because it makes it easier to knock-out of the cast by immersing the hot mould in cold water. Thermal and phase tensions that are created during this process cause fast destruction of plaster. This paper describes our investigations aimed at the determination of the dependence of the mould temperature field on the time of the cast stay in the mould, as recorded in a process of an unsteady heat flow. The determined data were planned to be used for estimation of the technological properties of the <b>plaster</b> <b>mould.</b> The tests were carried out using the plaster α-Supraduro and Alkanol XC (foaming agent). The test mould had a diameter of Ø 120 mm with centrally situated mould cavity of Ø 30 mm. <b>Plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> with a degree of foaming 20; 32, 5 and 45 % and comparatively from non-foaming plaster were tested and their temperatures were measured at the distance x= 2; 9; 21; 25; 27; 30 mm from the mould cavity within 25 min. Analysis of the results leads to the conclusion, that the highest effectiveness of heating and overheating of a mould made of a foamed plaster occurs at the degree of the plaster foaming equal to SS= 45 %. The results obtained can provide the basis for the elaboration of the best <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> properties, and thus to increase the technology effectiveness...|$|R

50|$|The lost-wax casting {{technique}} Robinson developed is {{a modified}} version of the bronze casting technique. It involves creating a <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> which is filled with molten wax. The mould is then removed (and can be reused) and the wax is encased in a heat-resistant covering and placed in the kiln. When the wax is burnt out, this cavity is then filled with molten glass.|$|R
50|$|This {{production}} {{operation is}} well known for providing tools with dimensional stability, surface quality, density and uniformity. For instance, on the slip casting process the cast part is of high concentration of raw materials with little additive, this improves uniformity. But also, the <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting at the mould surface. This forms a dense cast.|$|R
2500|$|Christopher Hatton was {{rebuilding}} Kirby Hall in {{the same}} decade. For him Stone provided [...] "6 Emperors heads, with their pedestals cast in <b>Plaster,</b> <b>moulded</b> from the Antiques" [...] (£7 10s), a [...] "head of Apollo, fairly carved in Portland stone, almost twice as big as life" [...] and [...] "one head carved in stone of Marcus Aurelius" [...] still preserved set in the north front above the loggia (each £4).|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} process for latex models is simple, and {{similar to the}} early stages of pottery production. <b>Plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> are made from a 'master' model. When the plaster is completely dry, a mix of liquid latex and an inert 'filler' is poured into the mould and left to stand until a coating of latex has developed around the inside of the mould. The remaining liquid latex is poured away for reuse, and the casting allowed to dry out until it is firm enough to be removed from the mould. This part of the process is identical to the way ceramics are cast. With the casting removed, the <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> is left to dry out, and cannot be reused until 100% dry once more. Each casting progressively destroys the interior of the mould, so after a relatively limited number of casts, the mould has to be discarded and new ones made from the master. This explains why each individual Julip is different even from other examples of the same breed and from the same mould.|$|R
50|$|Carton-pierre was a {{material}} {{used for the}} making of raised ornaments for wall and ceiling decoration. It is composed of the pulp of paper mixed with whiting (ground calcium carbonate) and glue, this being forced into <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> backed with paper, and then removed to a drying room to harden. It is much stronger and lighter than common plaster-of-Paris ornaments, and is not so liable to chip or break if struck with anything.|$|R
50|$|Slipcasting or {{slip casting}} is a {{technique}} for the mass-production of pottery and ceramics, especially for shapes not easily made on a wheel. Slipcast ware {{should not be confused}} with slipware, which is pottery formed by any technique that is decorated using slip. In slipcasting, a liquid clay body slip (usually mixed in a blunger) is poured into <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> and allowed to form a layer, the cast, on the inside walls of the mould.|$|R
