40|$|I {{propose a}} new method to {{attenuate}} specularly-reflected multiples {{in the image}} space. The method {{is based on the}} difference in mapping between <b>primaries</b> and multiples in Subsurface Offset Domain Common Image Gathers (SODCIGs). I migrate the data with a velocity slower than that of the <b>primaries</b> but faster than that of the multiples. The <b>primaries</b> are therefore undermigrated whereas the multiples are overmigrated. For positive data offsets, the <b>primaries</b> are mapped to positive subsurface offsets and the multiples to negative subsurface offsets in SODCIGs. I then apply a tapered mute to eliminate the <b>primaries</b> and do adjoint migration on the multiples with the same velocity model to get an estimate of the multiples in data space. Similarly, a tapered mute is applied to eliminate the multiples and adjoint migration used to obtain an estimate of the <b>primaries</b> in data space. The estimate of the multiples is adaptively matched to the data with the estimate of the <b>primaries</b> used as a weight function to prevent matching the <b>primaries.</b> I illustrate the method with a 2 D synthetic dataset and show that the <b>primaries</b> can be well recovered although some residual from the water bottom multiple remains...|$|R

40|$|In a multi-candidate election, a voter {{may prefer}} {{to vote for}} his second choice in order to defeat his least {{favorite}} candidate.

In this unique equlibrium, supporters of a candidate vote more strategically when their hate for their worst choice becomes more domi-nant, but they vote less strategically when {{the same is true for}} the opposite camp. Using this property, I show that in sequential <b>primaries,</b> winning early <b>primaries</b> improves a candidates chance of winning later <b>primaries</b> by making his supporters in later <b>primaries</b> vote more sincerely. I show that sequential <b>primaries</b> help with coordination, but puts more weight on the preference of the median voters in the early <b>primaries.</b> When voters worry enough about defeating their worst choice, sequential <b>primaries</b> are better at aggregating preferences than simultaneous <b>primaries.</b> ...|$|R
