The three-dimensional (3 D) <b>pavement</b> crack detection technique based on laser is a recent trend due to its ability of discriminating dark areas, which are not caused by <b>pavement</b> distress such as tire marks, oil spills and shadows. In the field of 3 D <b>pavement</b> crack detection, the most important thing is the accurate extraction of cracks in individual <b>pavement</b> profile without destroying <b>pavement</b> profile. So after analyzing the <b>pavement</b> profile signal characteristics and the changeability of <b>pavement</b> crack characteristics, a new method based on the sparse representation is developed to decompose <b>pavement</b> profile signal into a summation of the mainly <b>pavement</b> profile and cracks. Based on the characteristics of the <b>pavement</b> profile signal and crack, the mixed dictionary is constructed with an over-complete exponential function and an over-complete trapezoidal membership function, and the signal is separated by learning in this mixed dictionary with a matching pursuit algorithm. Some experiments were conducted and promising results were obtained, showing that we can detect the <b>pavement</b> crack efficiently and achieve a good separation of crack from <b>pavement</b> profile without destroying <b>pavement</b> profile.|$|R

5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and <b>pavements</b> include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. <b>Pavements</b> in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E

5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, which it resembles, {{it is one of}} the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. The Georgian streets in the vicinity of the river tended to be built high above the original ground level to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the multi-storey cellars around Laura Place South of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the grated coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised <b>pavements</b> with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert <b>pavements</b> and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers.

This study explores the potential of <b>pavement</b> preservation concepts in managing the agency‘s <b>pavement</b> assets by attempting to integrate <b>pavement</b> preservation considerations within the network-level <b>pavement</b> management system. Several elements are studied in the report: (i) determining triggers for <b>pavement</b> preservation treatments {{for use in a}} PMS, (ii) development of performance models for preservation treatments, (iii) developing a remaining service life approach for strategy comparison at the project level, and (iv) developing a <b>pavement</b> preservation framework that integrates the districts and the central office of a state highway agency. It is found that distress-based decision matrices are found to be more desirable as triggers in the <b>pavement</b> management system, primarily because it can be easily adopted for new and innovative <b>pavement</b> preservation materials and treatments. <b>Pavement</b> performance models (both long term <b>pavement</b> performance and short term performance jumps) are developed and incorporated within a <b>pavement</b> management systems used by highway agencies. By adopting a remaining service life approach to evaluate competing <b>pavement</b> strategies at the project level, it is found that <b>pavement</b> preservation can be a cost-effective solution to preserve our <b>pavement</b> assets on a project level.
