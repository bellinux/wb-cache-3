The initial site of disease is the synovial membrane, where swelling and congestion leads to infiltration by immune cells. Three phases of progression of RA are an initiation <b>phase,</b> <b>due</b> to non-specific inflammation, an amplification <b>phase,</b> <b>due</b> to T cell activation and chronic inflammatory phase with tissue injury, due to cytokines IL–1, TNF-alpha and IL–6.|$|E

25|$|This term {{can also}} refer to heat {{exchangers}} that contain a material within their structure {{that has a}} change of phase. This is usually a solid to liquid <b>phase</b> <b>due</b> to the small volume difference between these states. This change of phase effectively acts as a buffer because it occurs at a constant temperature but still allows for the heat exchanger to accept additional heat. One example where this has been investigated is for use in high power aircraft electronics.|$|E
25|$|The cells {{which are}} {{actively}} undergoing cell cycle are targeted in cancer therapy as the DNA is relatively exposed during cell division and hence susceptible to damage by drugs or radiation. This fact is {{made use of}} in cancer treatment; by {{a process known as}} debulking, a significant mass of the tumor is removed which pushes a significant number of the remaining tumor cells from G0 to G1 <b>phase</b> (<b>due</b> to increased availability of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors etc.). Radiation or chemotherapy following the debulking procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{appear to}} {{contribute}} to brood decline {{and the end of}} the colony cycle in B. petiolata. These include: cessation of the supply of solid food to colonies and larvae during the reproductive phase, a decrease in the worker/larva ratio during the latter <b>phase</b> <b>due</b> to the slow loss of workers, increasing the number of gynes and males, and an adult priority over food reception from foragers. The brood gets aborted to feed hungry adults. Eventually, the brood declines and the adults leave the nest. Usually, some cell demolition is done by the queen in post emergence colonies.|$|E

25|$|The MRTS {{has been}} criticised for {{environmental}} issues during its construction <b>phase,</b> <b>due</b> {{to the fact}} that much of the alignment was built {{along the banks of the}} Buckingham Canal. Although the canal itself has been in decline due to fly tipping and sewage the Chennai River Restoration Trust has planned to revitalise and redevelop it. However, a 7.1-km section will remain impassable due to the presence of the MRTS. Another environmental impact caused by the erection of MRTS pillars in the canal is the blocking of the natural flow of storm water during rains. This has led to severe stagnation of rainwater in the neighbourhoods adjoining the canal.|$|E
25|$|In August 2004, HEEP {{strategic}} priorities were {{adjusted to}} become {{responsive to the}} requirements of quality and accreditation and to correspond to the government's approach to improving scientific research. The adjustment added two more dimensions: first, developing post graduate studies and scientific research and second, addressing students’ extra-curricular activities in addition to the continued implementation of the six prioritized programs during the first <b>phase.</b> <b>Due</b> to the dynamic nature of the reform strategy, which entails reconsidering priorities for each period, a Strategic Planning Unit (SPU) was established for the MOHE to ensure the sustainability of planning and project monitoring during the three phases and for future ones. A Students’ Activity Project (SAP) was also initiated as part of program accreditation similar to scientific research and post graduate studies.|$|E

The passenger terminal will be enlarged with additional security lanes, check-in counters and other facilities, and solar panels will be built on the roof.

The track designer, Udo Gurgel, said: [...] "The track had to be near Whistler, for use after the Olympics. You don't want to ruin an investment so the track is on terrain that's a little steep." [...] According to John Furlong, {{the chief executive of the}} 2010 Winter Olympics organizing committee, proposals to build the sliding centre on Grouse Mountain near Vancouver were rejected early in the bid <b>phase</b> <b>due</b> to reservations expressed by international bobsled, luge, and skeleton federations.|$|E
500|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. After the First Sudanese Civil War ended in 1972, there were plans to revive sugar production at Mongalla, and although Mongalla Sugar Processing Factory operated on a low-scale in the 1970s, it ceased production when civil war broke out again in 1983.A clothing mill also operated in the 1970s but was deactivated due to the unrest in the early 1980s. A paper mill was also planned at Mongalla, to be fed by eucalyptus species planted in a 70,000 feddan area.Equipment was supplied from Denmark between 1975 and 1976 for use in an agro-industrial complex at Mongalla. This would include a power station and pump station to support an abbatoir, poultry project, fish-receiving plant [...] and wood-working factory. The equipment arrived but was not installed, and eventually rusted away. A project funded by Khartoum also established six textile-manufacturing units in Sudan, one at Mongalla, and the other five factories located in the north at Ed Duiem, Kadugli, Kosti, Nyala, and Shendi. An agreement was made with a Belgian firm, SOBERI, to supply the weaving factory of 256 looms {{and at one point}} it was estimated to produce around 9 million meters of grey fabric per annum, but it failed to get past the trial <b>phase</b> <b>due</b> to lack of raw materials, capital, and transportation facilities.|$|E

2500|$|Edmonton was {{the first}} city in North America to build a modern (second generation) light rail system.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the Cretaceous, the tectonic regime {{changed to}} a {{compressive}} <b>phase,</b> <b>due</b> to the movement of the Caribbean Plate. The Early Paleocene deposits of the Hato Nuevo and Manantial Formations show a more calcareous character in the north, while the Cesar Sub-basin contained more siliclastic sedimentation, represented in the Barco Formation, consisting of more lithic fragments than the equivalent of the Llanos Basin. Compression continued during the Paleocene, with uplifted areas to the northwest and southeast and volcanism in the proto-Caribbean. The global climate was very hot in this period and in the restricted basin between the two forming mountain ranges, a unique ecosystem developed; the first Neotropic forest. In this hot and humid environment, the largest species of reptiles since the extinction of the dinosaurs evolved, of which Titanoboa was the main predator. It has been estimated {{on the basis of the}} fossil flora, pollen and large reptiles that the mean annual temperature was between [...] and yearly precipitation ranging from [...] per year.
