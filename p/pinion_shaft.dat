5000|$|Jaguar {{first used}} the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type {{as well as}} other models. It was used through 1996 (Jaguar IRS Article). There are some {{differences}} in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" [...] Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model {{through the use of a}} special installation kit which includes special shouldered bolts to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion bearing set to fit the standard <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> to the IRS housing. Gear distributors with knowledge of the Jag IRS should be able to get the installation kit. US Dana 44 gears a slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears higher priced, but once the installation kit price is added to the lower US gear prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500 hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.|$|E

50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and bleed valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the depositâs corrosion resistance. Differential <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts</b> and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R

40|$|Evidence of {{propellant}} leakage across ball-valve {{shaft seals}} {{has been noted}} during the disassembly of five flight engines and one test engine at the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, White Sands Test Facility. Based on data collected during the disassembly of these five engines, the consequences of propellant leakage across the ball-valve shaft seals {{can be divided into}} four primary areas of concern: Damage to the ball-valve <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts,</b> damage to sleeved bearings inside the ball-valve and actuator assemblies, degradation of the synthetic rubber o-rings used in the actuator assemblies, and corrosion and degradation to the interior of the actuator assemblies. The exact time at which leakage across the ball-valve shaft seals occurs has not been determined, however, the leakage most likely occurs during engine firings when, depending on the specification used, ball-valve cavity pressures range as high as 453 to 550 psia. This potential pressure range for the ball-valve cavities greatly exceeds the acceptance leakage test pressure of 332 psia. Since redesign and replacement of the ball-valve shaft seals is unlikely, the near term solution to prevent damage that occurs from shaft-seal leakage is to implement a routine overhaul and maintenance program for engines in the fleet. Recommended repair, verification, and possible preventative maintenance measures are discussed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the methods}} applied to detect pinion or gear wheel damage is an {{analysis}} of a signal synchronously averaged by the rotation period of a <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> or gear shaft, respectively.

The signal is then connected with a rotating element available outside the gear. As a result of torsional vibration {{in a system of}} shafts or gear casing vibration in a place where the shaftâs angular position sensor is fixed, or in consequence of a too slowly rising reference signal edge, a synchronizing impulse occurs at wheelâs angular positions varying by an insignificant value.

40|$|LecturePg. 49 - 56 Commissioning and {{operating}} turbomachinery often create surprises especially {{with respect to}} vibration. Often not all the conditions are known under which these highly-efficient turbomachines have to operate. This case study deals with a four-stage three-pinion integrally geared centrifugal compressor. It was designed for an air separation plant in Germany to produce nitrogen and oxygen for an adjacent steel works. The compressor was driven via a standard gear-tooth coupling with a 1500 mm (59 inch) spacer shaft by an induction motor with speed of 1490 rpm and power of 4000 Kw (5400 hp). During commissioning, high vibrations were observed at the <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts,</b> which sometimes exceeded the trip levels.

40|$|Integrally geared {{compressors}} (IGCs) {{comprise of}} single stage impellers {{installed on the}} ends of <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts,</b> all driven by a main bull gear (BG) and shaft system. When compared to single shaft multistage centrifugal compressors, the benefits of IGCs include better thermal efficiency, reduced footprint and simple foundation, dispensing with a high speed coupling, as well as better access for maintenance and overhauls. In IGCs the compression of the process gas induces axial loads on the <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts</b> that are transmitted via thrust collars (TCs) to the main drive shaft and balanced by a single thrust bearing. The TCs, located on either side of pinion gears, slightly overlap with the BG outer diameter to form lentil-shaped lubricant-wetted regions. A numerical model, based on classical thin film lubrication theory, predicts the force response of lubricated thrust collars for use in integrally geared compressors. The predictive model determines performance parameters such as lubricant flow rate, mechanical power loss, peak pressure, lubricant temperature rise, as well as rotordynamic stiffness and damping coefficients for a lubricated TC and bull gear pair. A Newton-Raphson based iterative procedure determines an equilibrium operating position for a given set of TC and BG operating conditions and geometry. Periodic, dynamic displacements from the equilibrium position renders complex dynamic stiffnesses (H = K+i?C), from which the fluid film force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients are determined. In a lubricated thrust collar and bull gear, a hydrodynamic pressure builds in {{the lower half of the}} lubricated zone and lubricant cavitation occurs in the upper half. The minimum film thickness and peak pressure in the lubricated zone shift location due to the difference in taper angles between the TC and BG surfaces. For a given applied load, a study on the differences in taper angle between the TC and BG surfaces reveals that current angular tolerances of ? 0. 1 produce TC/BG pairs with similar performance parameters (power loss, lubricant temperature rise, etc.) and dynamic force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients. Increasing the taper angles of both the TC and BG decreases mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise, but also decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. In addition, static angular misalignments of the TC and BG about the horizontal (x) axis joining the BG and TC centers alters the shape and extent of the lubricant cavitation region. This change alters the load carrying capacity and mechanical power losses of the lubricated element. For the specific TC/BG pair investigated herein, there exists a maximum difference between the two taper angles for which the mechanical element can support an imposed thrust load. Increasing the speed of the BG (and proportionally the TC speed) increases the mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise and decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. As with most fluid film bearings, increasing the applied load increases the power loss, lubricant temperature rise, and axial stiffness and damping coefficients. The thesis delivers a predictive tool, yet to be benchmarked against experimental data, that provides insight to both the static and dynamic force performance of a lubricated thrust collar, not currently in the archived literature...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{right angle}} gear drive design where helical and spiral bevel gears are being used. Because of the high speed ratio (1800 / 18, input/output), three {{reductions}} were applied.

40|$|LecturePg. 93 - 102 Test stand {{vibration}} {{measurements on}} a partially loaded 54, 000 hp, parallel shaft, double helical speed increaser revealed synchronous resonant vibrations near normal operating speed. Further testing confirmed the lateral critical {{speed of the}} pinion was lower than originally designed due to modifications applied while the gear unit was in the test stand, which were aimed at lowering bearing pad operating temperatures under full load field conditions. The lateral critical speed was seen to increase as expected by sequentially removing the coupling spacer, adapter plate, and the hub. However, resulting vibration measurements showed a resonance remained near running speed. Impact testing pointed to a structural, resonant axial motion of the gear case near rated operating speed. Finite element analyses of the gear unit confirmed the existence of two structural resonances with endwall breathing mode shapes near pinion speed. Excitation {{of one of these}} modes was provided by coupling unbalance on the rotating <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> that demonstrated cross-coupling of radial forces due to unbalance and axial structural motions. The near coincidence of the structural resonance and the lateral critical speed on the test stand provided vibration amplification above that normally expected due to either resonant condition alone. Amplification factors were moderate and significant overlap occurred between the flanks of the two resonances. A two-step solution was implemented to increase the resonant frequencies of both the shaft in its oil film bearings and the gear case end walls. First, a bearing clearance and preload modification were applied along with additional hot oil removal techniques. Second, a tie bar brace was added above and parallel to the pinion between the end walls of the upper section of the gear case to increase structural stiffness in an axial direction. Additional rotordynamic and finite element analyses predicted significantly improved response to unbalance. The bearing and structural modifications were installed and tested sequentially. These tests, under similar conditions as previously imposed on the unit for qualification and acceptance, were successful in proving the solution. This paper documents measured vibrations at various stages in the investigation, results of rotordynamic and finite element analyses, bearing and gear case modifications, and final successful tests...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{is one of}} many {{technologies for}} health monitoring and diagnosis of rotating machines such as gearboxes. Although significant research has been undertaken in understanding the potential of AE in monitoring gearboxes this has been solely applied to spur gears and slow speed roller bearings. This research presents an experimental investigation that assesses the effectiveness of both AE and vibration technologies in identifying various types of defects on in a helical gearbox; the first known attempt. Furthermore, the application of advanced signals processing techniques such as Spectral kurtosis (SK) and wavelet analysis were studied on AE and vibration signatures. It is shown that the application of advanced signal processing methods is particularly necessary for monitoring helical gears. The application of SK and wavelet analysis was found to be effective in denoising the acquired signals. The first chapter of this thesis is an introduction to this research and briefly explains motivation and theoretical background supporting this research. The second chapter summaries the relevant literature to establish the current level of the knowledge in this field. The third chapter describes methodologies and experimental arrangement utilized for this investigation. Chapter 4 discusses helical gear diagnosis for both natural and seeded surface defect. Chapter 5 reports on an experimental investigation in which several technologies such as AE, vibration and motor current signature analysis, were applied to identify the presence of a naturally fatigued <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> in an operating gearbox. Chapter 6 details an investigation which compared the applicability of AE and vibration technologies in monitoring a naturally degraded roller bearing. It has been concluded that AE is a strong diagnostic tool for early diagnosis of bearings faults. However, the application of condition monitoring for helical gear diagnosis was fraught with some degree of complexity as compared to spur gears. This implies that condition monitoring of the gears using AET can be challenging. On the contrary, the applicability of AET for bearing diagnosis was promising and it offered an absolute advantage over the conventional vibrationdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application advanced signals processing methods such as Spectral Kurtosis and wavelet was found to be promising in denoise the recorded AE signals. It was also concluded that the use of different signal processing methods is often necessary to achieve meaningful diagnostic information from the signals.
