40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} a <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> primary culture for replication of the isolated poxvirus-like virus. To date, the primary culture cells have been successfully subcultured for more than 25 passages in a T- 25 cell culture flask. Based on morphology studies, these cells were identified as mostly fibroblast cells. The results of this study showed that the L 15 medium was the optimal culture medium for these cells. Interestingly, the <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> primary cells grew faster at 37 degrees C than at temperatures below 30 degrees C. The lysis cellular pathogenic effects (CPE) presented on the monolayer cell culture which has been inoculated with 200 mu l of the tested isolated poxvirus-like viral suspension (1 x 10 (8) TCID 50 /ml) on the 2 nd postinoculation day. The virulence of poxvirus-like virus was significantly inhibited by 5 -iodo- 2 '-deoxyuridine, but 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine had no significant effect. According to the acridine orange staining results, the virus-infected primary cells were yellow-green in color, indicating that the poxvirus-like virus was a double-stranded DNA virus. The set primary culture cells were highly capable of being successfully infected with the <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> poxvirus-like virus. This study may be the first study to determine the optimal primary culture for studying viral infections in <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> embryos...|$|R

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of a poxvirus-like infection {{in a population}} of 20, 500 50 -day-old <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtles</b> (Pelodiscus sinensis) at a culture farm in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan, occurred from late November to early December 2008. A mortality rate of approximately 44 % was recorded and the clinical findings included anorexia, lethargy, swollen necks and several unusual vesicles and bullas were present on the legs and shell skin. When the surviving turtles {{reached the age of}} 11 months (October 2009), another {{outbreak of}} this disease occurred in the same pond, resulting in a mortality rate of approximately 20 %. In both outbreaks, histopathological examination revealed typical acute lesions, such as ballooning degeneration and acute cell swelling of keratinocyte 5 of the epidermis. Furthermore, tiny eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed in the vacuoles. Sloughed necrotic epidermis, inflammatory cells, and a predominance of heterophils were found to have infiltrated the area of the exposed underlying dermis. In addition, patches of skin ulceration and deep layer inflammation were present, and secondary bacterial infection was suspected. Six <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtles</b> were challenged with a 0. 45 mu m filtered virus suspension and showed clinical signs of anorexia and lethargy. The observed cutaneous lesions, 14 days post-challenge were similar to those reported on the farm and included medium to large size vesicles, white and circular thin-layered pustules and sloughed necrotic epidermis over the legs, head and shell skin. In addition, numerous white pock lesions on the CAM of embryonated <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> eggs which were also inoculated with the virus suspension were observed 3 days post-challenge. A transmission electron microscopy study; conducted from both farmed and experimentally infected turtles revealed enveloped, ovoid-shaped viral particles, measuring approximately 239 nm in diameter and 483 nm in length. According to its morphology and size, the virus was very similar to a poxvirus. Therefore, we provisionally named this agent, "soft <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> poxvirus-like virus"...|$|R

50|$|The lake also {{supports}} a fairly robust colony of turtles of various species. Most {{appear to be}} red-eared sliders, a non-native species originally from the southern United States that was extremely popular as a children's pet. At least a couple turtles living in the lake do not display the red markings typical of the red-eared slider and may be western painted turtles, a native species. There {{is at least one}} large (12 to possibly 14-inch) <b>soft</b> <b>shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> of unknown species also living in the lake. Most of the turtles were probably introduced to the lake as discarded pets though a thriving population of turtles was noted as far back as 1912.|$|R
5000|$|Large {{quantities}} of <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> {{are used as}} an ingredient in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). For instance, Taiwan confirmed that 940 tons of hard <b>shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> bone and 200 tons of <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> bones were imported between 1992 and 1998. The plastron - the belly shell - is used in TCM prescriptions. Some TCM scientists {{argue that there is}} no difference between plastron and carapace (back shell) bone. So, if both plastron and carapace bone are utilized, the demand of TCM for freshwater turtles, including four-eyed turtles, could decrease by 50%. [...] Current TCM research also suggests that there is no pharmaceutical difference in the effects of bone from animals produced on farms and animals captured in nature. As a result, farm production of turtle bone for TCM is likely to increase. In addition, TCM research could help find alternatives to turtle bone such as herbs.|$|R
40|$|The Chinese <b>soft</b> <b>shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> (Pelodiscus sinensis) {{has been}} used as food and {{medicine}} for thousands of years in China. In the last 25 years, some large-scale P. sinensis farms have been established. However, {{little is known about the}} genetic variations in farmed broodstocks although, they are important in selective breeding. Researchers genotyped 336 individuals from seven stocks using eight polymorphic microsatellites to study genetic diversity and population structure of P. sinensis. In the seven stocks, a total of 120 alleles were detected at the eight loci. All seven stocks showed high allelic (A = 9. 50 - 12. 25; Ar = 9. 25 - 12. 50) and gene diversity (H E = 0. 73 - 0. 79). But certain degree of inbreeding (inbreeding index franged from 0. 07 - 0. 23) was detected in all seven stocks. Both AMOVA and F ST analysis revealed significant population structuring (F ST = 0. 114, p P. sinensis through selective and cross breeding...|$|R
50|$|The {{carapace}} is the dorsal (back), convex part of {{the shell}} structure of a turtle, consisting of the animal's ossified ribs fused with the dermal bone. The spine and expanded ribs are fused through ossification to dermal plates beneath the skin to form a hard shell. Exterior to the skin the shell is covered by scutes, which are horny plates made of keratin that protect the shell from scrapes and bruises. A keel, a ridge that runs from front {{to the back of}} the animal is present in some species, these may be single, paired or even three rows of them. In most <b>turtles</b> the <b>shell</b> is relatively uniform in structure, species variation in general shape and color being the main differences. However the <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtles,</b> pig-nose turtles and the leatherback sea turtle have lost the scutes and reduced the ossification of the shell. This leaves the shell covered only by skin. These are all highly aquatic forms.|$|R
50|$|The Asiatic <b>soft</b> <b>shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> {{goes through}} a life cycle similar to many other turtles around the world. It begins its life by {{hatching}} from a clutch of eggs laid in sand along a body of water. This clutch can {{range in size from}} four to eight eggs depending on the size and age of the female that laid the clutch. On average, the incubation period for Amyda cartilaginea ranges between 130 and 140 days. However, the incubation period is greatly dependent on climate; not only for the rate of incubation, but also the sex of the majority of these turtles. Temperature has a great influence on what sex the turtle will become, females are typically born at around 30 degrees Celsius and males at 25 degrees Celsius. Once hatched, these young turtles must race to the water in order to prevent being eaten. Monitor lizards along with crows and serpent eagles are known to eat these young turtles.|$|R
40|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are among}} the most {{threatened}} groups of freshwater animals that are in need of urgent conservation attention. In Kerala (South India), two species of freshwater turtles, the Indian black turtle or Indian pond terrapin, Melanochelys trijuga coronata (Schweigger, 1812) and the Indian Flap-shelled turtle Lissemys punctata punctata (Lacépède, 1788) are exploited from Vembanad lake and associated wetlands in Punnamada to meet the demand from local restaurants and toddy shops. Eight hundred and forty three individuals belonging to the two species (499 pond terrapins and 344 flap-shelled turtle) were observed during a field survey conducted in 2007 at Punnamada. Despite being listed at the highest level in the Indian wildlife protection act, very little law enforcement takes place and turtles are exploited and traded regularly. Collection and trade have also become {{an important component of the}} local livelihoods in Punnamada, with the involvement of around five full-time and 25 part-time collectors. Details of the collection, marketing, economics and management of the freshwater turtles in Punnamada are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{continental}} turtle fauna of Mexico {{is composed}} of 7 families, 13 genera, and 45 species; when subspecies are included, a total of 61 distinct taxa are recognized. We searched for the imperiled level or protection status of each taxon according to the IUCN Red List, CITES appendices, the 25 most endangered freshwater turtles and tortoises, and the protection lists issued by the Mexican Government. We explored the overlap of conservation status between Mexican and international agencies by comparing listing status. Among the 61 taxa, 37 were in the IUCN Red List, 16 taxa were listed on CITES appendices, 39 taxa were in NOM- 059 (Mexican Government list), 4 taxa were in Conabio's list (Mexican Government list), and only 1 species {{was included in the}} world's 25 most endangered freshwater turtles and tortoises. The Central American river turtle (Dermatemys mawii), the desert tortoises (Gopherus spp.) and the black <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Apalone atra) were the only taxa included in all the lists surveyed. Our comparison of the lists indicates that at least 25 taxa of Mexican turtles are lacking basic information and require further study to inform their comprehensive conservation status. Further, we detected a noteworthy discrepancy between international and Mexican conservation priorities for turtle conservation...|$|R
40|$|Quaternary fauna and flora fossils {{were found}} in situ in a sand pit at the Khok Sung village of Khok Sung Subdistrict, Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima province. Six lithostratigraphic units from unit 1 to unit 6 in {{ascending}} order were recognized in the sand pit. The sediments in the Khok Sung sand pit were deposited as two meandering channel sets. Units 1, 2, and 3 form the lower channel sequence, and units 4, 5, and 6 form the upper channel sequence. The lower channel unconformably overlies bedrock and generally flowed northward, whereas the upper channel flowed eastward. The parent rocks of the Khok Sung sediments crop out in the western margins of the Khorat Plateau. The flora fossils include fruits (Ziziphus khoksungensis (Rhamnaceae), Dipterocarpus costatus (Dipterocarpaceae), Melia azedarach, and Dracontomelon dao (Anacardiaceae)), seeds, leaves, wood, tubers (Cyperus or Bolboschoenus (Cyperaceae)), amber, and pollen. This assemblage suggests the presence of tropical mixed deciduous and dry evergreen forests. The fauna fossils include fish, gavial (Gavialis cf. bengawanicus), tortoise (Batangur cf. trivittata, Heosemys annandalii, Heosemys cf. grandis, and Malayemys sp.), <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chitra sp., and cf.

40|$|Freshwater turtles {{are members}} of order Testudines in class Reptilia and being scavengers, {{carnivores}} as well as herbivores, they {{play a vital role}} in aquatic ecosystems. Freshwater turtles are facing illegal trade due to their demaned as food, pets and their use in medicines. Various studies in the last two decades have highlighted that their population is declining in different parts of the world including Pakistan. The present study identified and characterized the Pakistani freshwater turtles found in Rawalpindi – Islamabad area at morphological level and the parameters used for morphometric measurements were; length from muzzle to tail, body weight, body height, length and width of carapace and length and width of plastron. In the present study, 20 specimens belonging to three species of fresh water turtles i. e., Lissemys punctata, Nilssonia gangetica and Pangshura smithii were collected from 13 different sites or transects. Among these three species of freshwater turtles Nilssonia gangetica (Indian <b>Soft</b> <b>Shell</b> <b>Turtle)</b> was biggest and heaviest species with 30. 42 cm and 2276 g measurements.

40|$|The Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), {{a member}} of the genus Ranavirus, is a major viral {{pathogen}} that has caused heavy economic losses to the grouper aquaculture industry in China and Southeast Asia. No efficient method of controlling SGIV outbreaks is currently available. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is now widely used for the in vitro selection of artificial ssDNA or RNA ligands, known as aptamers, which bind to targets through their stable three-dimensional structures. In our current study, we generated ssDNA aptamers against the SGIV, and evaluated their ability to block SGIV infection in cultured fish cells and cultured fish in vivo. The anti-SGIV DNA aptamers, LMB- 761, LMB- 764, LMB- 748, LMB- 439, LMB- 755, and LMB- 767, were selected from a pool of oligonucleotides randomly generated using a SELEX iterative method. The analysis of the secondary structure of the aptamers revealed that they all formed similar stem-loop structures. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the aptamers bound SGIV specifically, as evidenced by a lack cross-reactivity with the <b>soft</b> <b>shell</b> <b>turtle</b> iridovirus. The aptamers produced no cytotoxic effects in cultured grouper spleen cells (GS). Assessment of cytopathic effects (CPE) and viral titer assays showed that LMB- 761, LMB- 764, LMB- 748, LMB- 755, and LMB- 767 significantly inhibited SGIV infection in GS cells. The in vivo experiments showed that LMB- 761 and LMB- 764 reduced SGIV-related mortality, and no negative effects were observed in orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides, indicating that these DNA aptamers may be suitable antiviral candidates for controlling SGIV infections in fish reared in marine aquaculture facilities.
