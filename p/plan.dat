5|$|A five-year interim {{management}} <b>plan</b> was put {{in place}} by the Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation in October 2005. Actions under that <b>plan</b> include regular monitoring of populations, management of the threats of fire and P.cinnamomi, and the cold storage of seed. As of December 2009 a recovery <b>plan</b> is being developed. There is also a translocation project underway.|$|E
5|$|A <b>plan</b> {{to widen}} the Narrows Bridge was {{announced}} on 13 April 1998 by the Court Liberal State Government. The $70 million <b>plan</b> would involve the addition of four extra traffic lanes, and {{was part of a}} $230 million package upgrading and extending {{the southern end of the}} Kwinana Freeway. Alannah McTiernan, then the Opposition Transport spokesperson, attacked the <b>plan,</b> saying that the government should instead build a railway to Rockingham.|$|E
5|$|A <b>plan</b> {{welcomed by}} then mayor of Cologne Fritz Schramma to build shorter minerets was dropped after the architects said the <b>plan</b> {{would leave the}} minarets out of {{proportion}} {{with the rest of}} the building and surrounding structures. Construction of the opposed higher minerets will continue.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action <b>Plan,</b> and an action <b>plan</b> for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. This <b>plan</b> revolves mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage. The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|E
5|$|Also {{included}} in the <b>plan</b> is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The <b>plan</b> specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the <b>plan.</b> According to the <b>plan,</b> the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The <b>plan</b> includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The <b>plan</b> enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E

5|$|Although no HV attack {{occurred}} in the area during the UNPROFOR mandate, elements of the <b>plan</b> were used by the 3rd Battalion of the PPCLI as the HV clashed with the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) in the January 1993 Operation Maslenica. The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI implemented the <b>plan</b> in March 1993 to demonstrate UNPROFOR resolve. The UNPROFOR Sector West deputy commander considered the <b>plan</b> impractical except for deterrence, due to security concerns.|$|E

50|$|Transportation <b>planning,</b> or {{transport}} <b>planning,</b> {{has historically}} followed the rational <b>planning</b> model of defining goals and objectives, identifying problems, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, and developing <b>plans.</b> Other models for <b>planning</b> include rational actor, transit oriented development, satisficing, incremental <b>planning,</b> organizational process, collaborative <b>planning,</b> and political bargaining.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the fires, a new fire management <b>plan</b> for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The <b>plan</b> observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management <b>plan</b> were added. According to the 2004 <b>plan,</b> natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management <b>plan</b> and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending <b>plan</b> designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The <b>plan</b> included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending <b>plan</b> called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation Cockade, a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; Operation Rankin, a <b>plan</b> for measures {{to be taken in}} the case of a sudden German collapse; and Operation Overlord, a <b>plan</b> for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord <b>plan</b> throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July. The <b>plan</b> set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E
40|$|The goal of an {{intelligent}} <b>planning</b> of manufacturing systems {{must be the}} drastic decrease of the <b>planning</b> {{time as well as}} the integration and interaction of different <b>planning</b> levels within companies.

5|$|Disagreements arose between Allied commanders {{over the}} {{operational}} <b>plan,</b> {{which called for}} a series of dispersed landings, based on the desire of the air, naval, and logistical planners concerning the early capture of ports and airfields. General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of the British Eighth Army, objected to this aspect of the <b>plan,</b> since it exposed the Allied forces to defeat in detail. Montgomery put forward an alternate <b>plan</b> that involved American and British forces landing side by side. He convinced Smith that his alternate <b>plan</b> was sound, and the two men then persuaded most of the other Allied commanders. Montgomery's <b>plan</b> provided for the early seizure of airfields, which satisfied Tedder and Cunningham. The fears of logisticians like Major General Thomas B. Larkin that supply would not be practical without a port were resolved by the use of amphibious trucks.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a school}} {{desegregation}} suit in 1972, the court required St. Louis to accept a busing <b>plan</b> in 1980. Judge William L. Hungate declared that a mandatory <b>plan</b> would go into effect unless other arrangements were made {{to adhere to the}} terms of the suit. In 1983, an unprecedented voluntary busing <b>plan</b> was put into place, integrating the schools without a mandated <b>plan</b> being required.|$|E

40|$|Deductive <b>planning</b> {{provides}} a rigorous approach for <b>planning,</b> {{such that the}} capabilities and limitations of the <b>planning</b> systems can be clearly defined. However, most of the deductive planners suffer from the frame problem and they are linear planners. This report presents a novel nonlinear deductive <b>planning</b> framework: constraint logic <b>planning.</b> Procedurally speaking, nonlinear <b>planning</b> is an activity of constraint solving. Constraint logic <b>planning</b> {{is a combination of}} the constraint solving for nonlinear <b>planning</b> with a temporal logic paradigm. In comparison with other state based deductive <b>planning</b> methods, constraint logic <b>planning</b> deals with the frame problem efficiently in a way similar to that in classical nonlinear <b>planning,</b> and constraint logic <b>planning</b> is a nonlinear deductive <b>planning</b> approach, it employs the least commitment strategy for both temporal relation decision and object selection.
