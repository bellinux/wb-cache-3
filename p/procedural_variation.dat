40|$|In paired {{comparisons}} {{based on}} which of two objects has the larger criterion value, decision makers {{could use the}} subjectively experienced difference in retrieval fluency of the objects as a cue. According to the fluency heuristic (FH) theory, decision makers use fluency—as indexed by recognition speed—as the only cue for pairs of recognized objects, and infer that the object retrieved more speedily has the larger criterion value (ignoring all other cues and information). Model-based analyses, however, have previously revealed {{that only a small}} portion of such inferences are indeed based on fluency alone. In the majority of cases, other information enters the decision process. However, due to the specific experimental procedures, the estimates of FH use are potentially biased: Some procedures may have led to an overestimated and others to an underestimated, or even to actually reduced, FH use.

40|$|A common <b>procedural</b> <b>variation</b> that {{facilitates}} {{the acquisition of}} conditional discriminations {{is to increase the}} time an organism spends {{in the presence of the}} sample stimulus by programming extended sample-observing response requirements. Despite their common use, there has been little empirical investigation of the effects of extended sample-observing response requirements. In the current study, four pigeons worked on a titrating delay matching-to-sample procedure in which the delay between sample offset and comparison onset was adjusted as a function of the pigeons' accuracy. The number of responses required to produce the comparison array was manipulated across conditions. Results show that all subjects were able to withstand longer delays between sample offset and comparison onset as sample-observing response requirements increased. These data show that the extent of the response requirement in the presence of the sample has systematic effects on conditional discrimination performances and should be considered in the design of experiments...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of four pretrial jail release mechanisms (i. e., bond types) commonly used during the pretrial phase of the criminal justice process in terms of their ability to discriminate between defendants failing to appear in court (i. e., bond forfeiture). These include attorney bonds, cash bonds, commercial bail bonds, and release via a pretrial services agency. A multi-treatment propensity score matching protocol was employed to assess between-release-mechanism differences in the conditional probability of failure to appear/bond forfeiture. Data were culled from archival state justice records comprising all defendants booked into the Dallas County, Texas jail during 2008 (n = 29, 416). The results suggest that defendants released via commercial bail bonds were less likely to experience failure to appear leading to the bond forfeiture process compared to equivalent defendants released via cash, attorney, and pretrial services bonds. This finding held across different offense categories.

40|$|While {{arbitration}} {{is practiced}} {{in nearly every}} region of the world, underlying assumptions {{of what it means}} to arbitrate a dispute or to be a “good arbitrator” are largely shaped by notions of role-perception and virtue. Such long standing conceptions tend to be deeply rooted and in turn have a significant influence on contemporary practice. Drawing on the concept of role morality, or the internalized expectations that guide an arbitrator’s actions and constitute a form of implicit law, 1 this paper presents a cross-cultural examination of how international arbitrators view their role in actively promoting settlement in the context of international arbitration proceedings. The result of both in-depth interviews as well as a 115 -person survey indicate that on the whole, international guidelines such as the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and the IBA Rules of Ethics * 2 for International Arbitrators have contributed to the harmonization of contemporary perspectives regarding the appropriateness of particular settlement interventions, such as suggesting settlement negotiations to disputing parties and engaging in settlement negotiations at the request of disputing parties. At the same time, historic and philosophical emphasis on the virtue of reconciliation is reflected in a slightly higher degree of involvement and effectiveness in assisting parties to reach settlement agreements in East Asia than in the West. Because of the flexible structure of international arbitration based on a Model Law system which allows countries to opt in or out of particular provisions, <b>procedural</b> <b>variation</b> pertaining to differing preferences for conciliatory or adjudicatory approaches to arbitration can coexist with a relatively high level of substantive legal uniformity across regions...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveFew {{studies have}} {{examined}} factors that influence an individual's decision to enter an academic medical career after residency training. We sought to evaluate whether sex, ethnicity, child care issues, and debt burden influenced residents' choice {{for a career in}} academic vascular surgery. MethodsA 39 -item Web survey, designed to elucidate which factors motivated residents to seek a career in academic vascular surgery, was sent to 295 vascular surgery residents currently enrolled in Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education-accredited training programs. ResultsA total of 128 responses (43 %) were received. Of these, 53 % of respondents were white and 47 % were nonwhite and 34 (27 %) were women and 94 (73 %) were men. Fifty-seven percent of minorities anticipate a career in academic vascular surgery. There were no statistical differences between sex and ethnicity for factors influencing career choice, including training paradigm, presence of a life partner or dependents, mentorship role, participation in research, service, and teaching, anticipated salary, and debt burden (P >. 05). Seventy-seven percent of respondents carry significant debt; of those with debt, 81 % owe >$ 100, 000 and 40 % owe >$ 200, 000. Seventy-three percent of 0 + 5 trainees anticipated choosing an academic practice compared with 42 % of 5 + 2 trainees (P <. 01). Respondents planning an academic career cited <b>procedural</b> <b>variation,</b> breadth and depth of practice/tertiary referral experience, and research opportunities as the most important drivers of career choice.

ConclusionsThis study shows that academic vascular surgery is a popular career option for current vascular surgery trainees, especially those in 0 + 5 programs. Choosing a career in academic vascular surgery appears not to be influenced by sex, ethnicity, child care concerns, salary expectations, or debt burden, even though most trainees carry enormous debt.

40|$|Fsculty of Science School of Animal,Plant And Enviromental Sciences Msc 9201098 j tsherwill@yahoo. comSouth Africa’s {{new water}} policy and law have {{introduced}} {{the requirement for}} public participation {{in all aspects of}} resource management and decision-making. This policy change is in recognition of the potential benefits of participation in generating more informed, acceptable, equitable and sustainable management of the nation’s water resources. However the new water law does not prescribe the form this participation should take, or offer criteria for evaluating the success of participatory processes. The term ‘public participation’, in its contemporary usage worldwide, is poorly or broadly defined and may thus encompass a range of processes, which differ in the roles and influence afforded to their stakeholder participants, and in their ability to deliver desired outcomes and benefits to government or the public. This study aimed to investigate the influence of this <b>procedural</b> <b>variation</b> on public and stakeholder participation in the implementation of the National Water Act (Act no. 36 of 1998) in South Africa, and thereby recommend a preferred approach to conducting and facilitating these processes in the future. Use was made of a qualitative and primarily inductive research approach. This was designed to gather perspectives of the various role-players (stakeholders, specialists and government) for a desired process and outcome of participation, and to link process and outcome by means of two case studies of the current implementation of participatory processes for water resource management decision-making. Both case studies illustrated the over-riding negative influence of a product-oriented and ‘specialist-centred’ approach to participation, focused on the development of specific statutory products or decisions required by the National Water Act. This approach in turn is being driven by the current fragmentation of participation around these different products and stages of the overall resource management process. A recommended alternative is a more process-oriented, ‘stakeholder-centred’ approach to participatory events, within an integrative, ongoing participatory process. This must be based on mutual learning by all role-players, and an emphasis on inter-sectoral interaction and relationships. A key constraint identified to the achievement of more integrative participatory processes that offer influence to, and generate ownership by, stakeholder participants, is the lack of clarity within government and the South African water sector as to the intent of participation within the new water policy, and thus the process by which this participation should take place. In particular, the role of stakeholders, and how much influence or power they should be afforded in decision-making processes, is subject to individual interpretation. The recommendation from this research is that, given the ideals of equity, sustainability and citizen empowerment aspired to by the Constitution and the new water policy, government should strive to fully engage stakeholders in processes that both offer influence and inspire action. Ideally, linkages should be created to extend this influence to the broader political process...|$|E
40|$|The need to {{conserve}} biodiversity of cocoa has become paramount {{due to the}} action {{of a range of}} diseases, pests and environmental hazards. In 1983 bushfire destroyed 60, 000 ha of cocoa plantation in Ghana and as of 1982 185. 5 million trees have been cut down in Eastern region of Ghana alone due to Cacao Swollen Shoot Virus (CSSV) infection. In order to safeguard germplasm of cocoa there is the need to use in vitro-based techniques to support in situ conservation. Successful cryopreservation of cocoa has already been demonstrated using an encapsulation-dehydration method but this is a labour intensive protocol requiring a relatively high level of technical skill and the objective of the current work is to explore the efficacy of a vitrification-based approach. Floral-derived secondary somatic embryos (SSE) of cocoa genotype AMAZ 15 were utilised. In order to optimise the vitrification procedure the effect of preculturing SSEs on sucrose and dehydration with plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS 2) was studied. SSEs were precultured on embryo development (ED) medium supplemented with either 0. 5 or 0. 75 M sucrose for 3 or 5 d and dehydrated with cold PVS 2 for 45 - 105 rin before storage in liquid nitrogen (LN). Preculturing the embryos on 0. 5 M sucrose for 5 d and dehydrating them in PVS 2 for 60 min led to significantly higher post-cryo survival than any other treatment (74. 5 ± 6. 4 %). So as to minimise cryo-injury due to cation- induced free radical formation, nutrient cation sources were removed from the ED solution and/or the recovery medium (ED), the former treatment resulting in a significant benefit. The influence of size of cotyledonary stage SSEs on postcryo' survival was studied for two size ranges. SSEs between 2 - 3 mm survived better than those between 4 - 5 mm. The protocol was effective across five other genotypes so far tested without further <b>procedural</b> <b>variation.</b> In order to accelerate bulking up of clones, embryos regenerated following cryopreservation were used as explant sources and the freezing process was not found to have any inhibitory effect on their embryogenic potential. In order to optimise the dehydration process Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to examine SSEs during cooling and warming. Partial vitrification, as evidenced by glass transition and ice melting, was achieved when embryos were exposed to PVS 2 for 45 and 60 min which correlated with higher post- cryo survival. Application of somatic embryogenesis and cryopreservation to eradicate Cacao Swollen Shoot Virus (CSSV) was also studied. While somatic embryogenesis was able to reduce CSSV transmission in genotypes studied the assessment of any 'cryotherapy' effect was limited by the availability of post-cryo regenerants.

40|$|Variations in {{practice}} and procedure permeate clinical work. While clinical research routinely investigates the consequences of these variations for clinical outcomes, we have little understanding of their implications for education. The current policy environment in medical education makes developing {{a new understanding of}} the role of variations in medical education especially important. Current policy reforms in the assessment of learners draw on the notion of competence to suggest that medical education should focus on the performance of learners in the workplace. The current turn toward workplace-based assessment positions the observations of faculty into key functions in these assessment frameworks; therefore, knowing what shapes observations in workplace-based assessment is crucial. This dissertation uses grounded theory to explore how interaction between surgeons and senior surgical residents around <b>procedural</b> <b>variations</b> shapes teaching, learning, and assessment in the operating room. The findings of the research suggest that the culture of the surgical workplace leads surgeons to engage in complex social processes in interpreting and negotiating <b>procedural</b> <b>variations.</b> A surgical culture based on autonomy and individuality leads residents to tacitly seek out thresholds of principle and preference for each surgeon they work with. Surgeons endorse residents’ tacit work as a means of learning to adapt to the ambiguity and complexity of surgical practice. The tacit thresholding work of residents may be so embedded in surgical culture that it {{plays an important role in}} determining how surgeons entrust residents intraoperatively. Workplace-based assessment could potentially utilize these intraoperative situated assessments made by surgeons. Emerging approaches to assessment suggest that attending to intuitive entrustment decisions made during everyday workflow may allow competency-based medical education to develop workplace-based assessments that make productive use of the subjectivity inherent to observations made by experts in the workplace...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} examining {{differences in the}} way the left (LH) and right (RH) hemispheres of the brain process language have used the visual half-field (VHF) paradigm to examine whether each hemisphere can independently process information from sentences. The current study expanded upon such work by using event related brain potential (ERP) measures to examine how the comprehension of thematic role knowledge, a process essential to successful sentence comprehension (MacDonald, Pearlmutter, 2 ̆ 6 Seidenbeerg, 1994), is undertaken in each hemisphere. During language comprehension, agents (entities that initiate action in an event) depicted by nouns (e. g., cop) {{have been shown to be}} associated with verbs presented in active voice (e. g., present participle—cop was arresting), whereas patients (entities that have action imposed upon them—e. g., crook for the event arrest) are associated with verbs presented in passive voice (e. g., crook was arrested—Ferretti, McRae, Elman, 2 ̆ 6 Ramshaw, 2005). Thus, the currently study examined how the cerebral hemispheres conjointly (Experiment 1) and independently (Experiment 2) process thematic fit (whether the noun and verb are thematically related) in conjunction with morphosyntactic information indicating whether a verb is in active (arresting), or passive (arrested) voice in order to further understand each hemisphere’s sentence processing abilities. In Experiment 1, ERP responses to verbs (presented centrally) preceded by a common agent noun and presented in related-active (e. g., The teacher was lecturing the man), unrelated active (e. g., The shepherd was lecturing the man), related-passive (e. g., The teacher was lectured by the man) and unrelated passive (e. g., The shepherd was lectured by the man), sentences were analyzed in order to examine the effects of relatedness and voice on the processing of the critical verb. Experiment 1 results showed that brainwave amplitudes demonstrated greater semantic facilitation for related active than for unrelated active verbs. However, this effect did not occur as strongly for passive verbs, indicating that the congruency between the agent and verb form significantly affected processing. In Experiment 2, the exact same experimental design was employed with the <b>procedural</b> <b>variation</b> that the critical verbs were presented 2 ⁰ to either the left or right of visual fixation, so only one hemisphere initially receives the information. Results from this experiment showed that with LH presentation, as with central presentation, related active verbs were processed more easily than unrelated active verbs and the magnitude of this effect was larger than that for analogous differences found with passive verbs (although sensitivity to relatedness for passive verbs was slightly larger than in Experiment 1). However, in the RH, differences in relatedness were found only for passive items indicating that sensitivity to relatedness differences in this hemisphere may be mediated more by frequency differences between verb forms than with LH processing (or central presentation). These results provide evidence against the theoretical contentions that the RH is only sensitive to simple word-level semantic relations (e. g., Faust, 1998), and are supportive of an ‘expectancy’ account of LH language processing (e. g., Coulson et al., 2005; Federmeier 2 ̆ 6 Kutas, 1999) ...|$|E

The prevalence of skin cancer has been continuously increasing in the American population over the last 3 decades. Melanoma, the most serious and dangerous form, causes the most skin cancer related deaths. If melanoma is found early enough, it can be treated and cured. Current therapy for melanoma is based on the stage of the disease. It is crucial to identify and treat the melanoma before metastasis occurs as the risk of death greatly increases once the disease becomes widespread. The processes of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis as well as changes in the extracellular environment all play significant roles in the expansion of a primary melanoma and ultimately metastasis. Neuropilins, specifically Neuropilin- 2 (NRP 2), {{have been found to be}} associated with both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and thus metastasis. Since it is critical to identify and treat melanoma before it advances to metastasis, the relationship between NRP 2 and tumor progression may prove to be extremely valuable as a prognostic marker for primary melanoma tumors. In addition, it may serve to identify subsets of early stage tumors that would benefit from adjuvant therapy. This study aimed to demonstrate if there is a relationship between the level of expression of NRP 2 in primary melanocytic lesions and the prognosis of melanoma, and determine the potential utility of NRP 2 as a biomarker for melanoma. To do so, the levels of expression of NRP 2 were analyzed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, tissue samples of nevi, primary melanomas, and metastatic melanomas. Sample RNA was extracted and converted to eDNA. Quantitative RT-PCR was then used to amplify eDNA and appropriate normalizations were performed. Luciferase RNA was added at the start of processing as an exogenous control and was used to correct for <b>procedural</b> <b>variation</b> between samples. Furthermore, Actin, beta (ACTB) and Melan-A were used as reference genes to correct for differences in tissue and lesion size respectively. To analyze the data, standard curves were developed for NRP 2, ACTB, and Melan-A to calculate the copy numbers for each gene in each sample. When normalized by both ACTB and Melan-A, the differences in the level of expression of NRP 2 between nevi and primary melanomas (p= 0. 94422), nevi and metastatic melanomas (p= 0. 29538), and primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas (p= 0. 32827) all failed to show statistical significance. In addition when normalized by only ACTB, there is no statistical significant difference in the level of expression of NRP 2 between nevi and primary melanomas (p= 0. 21001), or primary and metastatic melanomas (p= 0. 30874). However, there is a difference between nevi and metastatic melanomas (p= 0. 00472) that is statistically significant when just normalized by ACTB. Furthermore, when just normalized by Melan-A, there is no significant difference in the level of expression of NRP 2 between nevi and primary melanomas (p= 0. 3152) or primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas (p= 0. 14179). However, there is a statistically significant difference in the level of expression of NRP 2 between nevi and metastatic melanomas (p= 0. 01736). The fact that there is a statistically significant difference (p less than 0. 05) in the level of expression of NRP 2 between nevi and primary melanomas demonstrates its potential ability to be used as a biomarker. However, the inability to establish statistical significance between sample groups may be due to the small sample size. Further studies with an increased sample size may better show the relationship between the levels of NRP 2 and the stage of melanoma. Still, NRP 2 shows promise as both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for melanoma...|$|E

40|$|Jury {{instructions}} on damage awards are notoriously vague and ambiguous. As a result, awards are sometimes unexpected and seemingly illogical. In this article, {{the authors argue that}} jury instructions regarding damages are vague {{because the law}} of damages itself is purposefully ambiguous—allowing particularized justice across a variety of different circumstances. The authors review research on comprehension and application of substantive jury instructions related to damages and on <b>procedural</b> <b>variations</b> at trial (e. g., use of preinstruction, bifurcation, blindfolding jurors to various issues, special verdict forms, caps on damages, and instruction revision) that impact the substantive instructions that jurors receive from the judge. They comment on attempts at reforming jury instructions regarding damages and conclude that jurors’ decision making on this difficult and emotional issue could be made more predictable by careful reforms at the trial level...|$|R
30|$|The {{statutory}} environment directly impacts a firm’s {{reaction to}} decline aside from mere <b>procedural</b> <b>variations</b> in different legal settings (Mouly and Sankaran 2004). For instance, Davydenko and Franks (2008) {{argue that a}} lack of creditor protection leads banks to adjust their lending practices and require more collateral, thus increasing firms’ bankruptcy costs. Acharya and Subramanian (2009) similarly find a positive association between debtor-friendly bankruptcy codes and the use of innovation. When accounting for strong union laws combined with weak investor protection, Atanassov and Kim (2009) identify alliances between workers and managers who sell assets to prevent layoffs, even willingly risking further declines in performance. Further, Lel and Miller (2008) state that firms from weak investor protection regimes, which are cross-listed on US markets, have a greater likelihood to employ CEO replacement as a means of turnaround.|$|R

One {{of the purposes}} {{of this paper is to}} present information about the availability and features of these programmes. A second purpose is to make recommendations about how to best operate them based on cross-jurisdictional analysis and lessons from the addiction literature. The first section of the paper describes the typical casino self-exclusion programme, outlining the features common to most policies. The second section provides a detailed overview of the programmes operating in Canada in order to give the reader an appreciation of the <b>procedural</b> <b>variations</b> that exist. The third section discusses the effectiveness of self-exclusion programmes. Finally, the fourth section contains recommendations on ways to improve effectiveness. When properly implemented, self-exclusion can be a valuable tool in helping to curb problem gambling...|$|R
40|$|Stimulus equivalence, {{defined as}} C-A matching, was tested in 80 adults {{following}} training in a matching-to-sample task involving arbitrary A-B and B-C matching. In Experiment 1, 50 subjects, successively {{assigned to one}} of five groups, were exposed to specific stimulus material. The stimuli for subjects in the first group were Greek letters only. In the remaining groups, pictures were incorporated as A-, B-, and/or C-stimuli. The probability of equivalence was low when the stimulus material consisted only of Greek letters. For the remaining groups, the probability of equivalence varied considerably depending upon whether the A-, B-, and/or C-stimuli were pictures. The results indicate that seemingly minimal <b>procedural</b> <b>variations</b> can yield markedly differential outcomes not predicted by any existing model. The results also showed that responding gradually may become consistent with a pattern other than the predicted equivalence pattern. Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1 showing (a) differentia...|$|R
40|$|Wine micro-oxygenation is a {{globally}} used {{treatment and}} its effects were studied here by analysing by untargeted LC-MS the wine metabolomic fingerprint. Eight different <b>procedural</b> <b>variations,</b> marked {{by the addition of}} oxygen (four levels) and iron (two levels) were applied to Sangiovese wine, before and after malolactic fermentation. Data analysis using supervised and unsupervised multivariate methods highlighted some known candidate biomarkers, together with a number of metabolites which had never previously been considered as possible biomarkers for wine micro-oxygenation. Various pigments and tannins were identified among the known candidate biomarkers. Additional new information was obtained suggesting a correlation between oxygen doses and metal contents and changes in the concentration of primary metabolites such as arginine, proline, tryptophan and raffinose, and secondary metabolites such as succinic acid and xanthine. Based on these findings, new hypotheses regarding the formation and reactivity of wine pigment during micro-oxygenation have been proposed. This experiment highlights the feasibility of using unbiased, untargeted metabolomic fingerprinting to improve our understanding of wine chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Psychology (Applied Behavior Analysis) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. The {{purpose of}} the current studies was to {{evaluate}} the effects of teaching unidirectional intraverbal relations in a statement format on the emergence of symmetry and transitivity intraverbal relations and equivalence classes. In Experiment 1, eight undergraduates were exposed to tact training, listener testing, intraverbal training, and a review phase. Derived relations matching-to-sample (MTS) and intraverbal posttests were presented in alternating fashion. The two undergraduates in Experiment 2 also passed all the posttests despite the elimination of the review phase. For Experiment 3, all MTS posttests were administered before intraverbal posttests and vice versa for four undergraduates. Despite <b>procedural</b> <b>variations,</b> all fourteen participants met the emergence criteria for derived relations MTS and intraverbal posttests. Combined results suggest that intraverbal training may be sufficient for producing novel intraverbal and stimulus-stimulus classes. Moreover, all participants emitted vocalizations {{at some point during the}} last MTS vocal posttest, suggesting that intraverbal naming mediated responses.
