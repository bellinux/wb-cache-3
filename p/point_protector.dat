25|$|A punch {{that makes}} {{contact with the}} opponent's hogu (the body guard that {{functions}} as a scoring target) scores one one point, while a kick scores two <b>points.</b> (The trunk <b>protector</b> {{is referred to as}} a momtong pohodae 몸통 보호대 or trunk guard in the WT rules.) If a kick to the hogu involves a technique that includes fully turning the attacking competitor's body, so that the back is fully exposed to the targeted competitor during execution of the technique (spinning kick), three points are awarded. A kick to the head scores three points; as of October 2010 an additional point is awarded if a turning kick was used to execute this attack, making a spinning head kick worth 4 points. Punches to the head are not allowed. As of October 2017, no additional points are awarded for knocking down an opponent (beyond the normal points awarded for legal strikes).|$|R

50|$|The pogrom wave hit many towns {{even before}} the pestilence reached them. Very common were the accusations upraised for {{poisoning}} of springs. The pogroms spread like snowballs. It is unlikely that they were spontaneous and they originated from low population. Rather they show signs of a certain plan, that in its imprint shows {{the involvement of the}} leading social levels, or at least part of them. So the already mentioned events in Strassbourg, that the Cologne Council watched closely, suggest a clear plan. They previously formed an alliance with all that could have an advantage from the killing or expulsion of the Jews, {{to be able to make}} a <b>point</b> towards their <b>protectors.</b> Especially King Charles IV and the Habsburgher reeves and settled Jews in their domains. The council of Straßburg invoked the public peace and called on all the citizens to kill the Jews in their territory. So this pogrom was finally aimed against the Habsburgs and exploited the hysteria of the population simply to reach its goals of political power.|$|R
