Amine oxidase development in the apical part was inhibited by administration of neocuproine, and this effect was markedly reversed by the addition of copper disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate(EDTA-Na 2 -Cu). In this case, the amine oxidase activity was stimulated. Pea plant growth was inhibited by this chelator but not in the presence of EDTA-Na 2 -Cu. On the other hand, the development of enzyme activity and growth were much less sensitive to cuprizone. We have reported that the development of amine oxidase in germinating pea cotyledons is probably due to a de novo synthesis of <b>proteins</b> (<b>13,</b> <b>15).</b> The local-ization of amine oxidase activity in pea seedlings was examined carefully and high activity was found in the apical part and cotyledons (2, 5, 8, 17).

40|$|Biogenesis of {{eukaryotic}} box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (C/D snoRNPs) involves conservedtrans-acting factors, {{which are}} proposed {{to facilitate the}} assembly of the core <b>proteins</b> Snu <b>13</b> p/ <b>15.</b> 5 K, Nop 58 p/NOP 58, Nop 56 p/NOP 56 and Nop 1 p/Fibrillarin on box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (C/D snoRNAs). In yeast, protein Rsa 1 acts as a platform, interacting with both the RNA-binding core <b>protein</b> Snu <b>13</b> and <b>protein</b> Pih 1 of the Hsp 82 -R 2 TP chaperone complex. In this work, a proteomic approach coupled with functional and structural studies identifies protein Hit 1 as a novel Rsa 1 p-interacting partner involved in C/D snoRNP assembly. Hit 1 p contributes to in vivo C/D snoRNA stability and pre-RNA maturation kinetics. It associates with U 3 snoRNA precursors and influences its 3 '-end processing. Remarkably, Hit 1 p is required to maintain steady-state levels of Rsa 1 p. This stabilizing activity {{is likely to be}} general across eukaryotic species, as the human protein ZNHIT 3 (TRIP 3) showing sequence homology with Hit 1 p regulates the abundance of NUFIP 1, the Rsa 1 p functional homolog. The nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the Rsa 1 p(317 - 352) -Hit 1 p(70 - 164) complex reveals a novel mode of protein-protein association explaining the strong stability of the Rsa 1 p-Hit 1 p complex.

Jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) is also rich in protein but is under-utilized {{in many parts}} of Africa due to the presence of several anti-nutritional factors. Jack bean was therefore subjected to different pre-processing methods (cracked-soaked, cracked-boiled and germinated) to reduce the anti-nutritional content before conversion into flours. Composite blends of the pre-processed jack beans and cowpea flour in different proportions of 95 : 05, 90 : 10, 85 : 15, 80 : 20 and 50 : 50 for each of the pre-processing methods was used in the production of akara. The proximate, pasting, functional and anti-nutritional properties of the flours as well as the proximate and anti-nutritional properties of the akara were determined using AOAC methods. The protein content of the cracked-boiled jack bean with 50 % cowpea composite flour was the highest (23. 65 %), while germinated jack bean composite flour with 80 % cowpea flour had the lowest (20. 85 %). Similarly, the protein content of the akara balls produced from cracked-boiled jack bean with 50 % cowpea composite flour had the highest <b>protein</b> value (<b>13.</b> <b>15</b> %). Generally, the functional properties, except for water and oil absorption capacities were higher in cracked-boiled than in cracked-soaked and germinated jack bean composite flours. The pre-processing methods significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) affected the pasting properties of the composite flours, while the anti-nutritional factors such as protease inhibitor and saponins were not detected in the akara balls. Germination of jack bean decreased tannin content than cracked-boiled and cracked-soaked, while soaking decreased the phytates levels than germination and boiling methods. Sensory attributes of the akara were significantly different (p≤ 0. 05) from each other with the germinated jack bean composite flour with 50 % cowpea flour having the highest rating for all the attributes measured...|$|R
40|$|Viral genome-linked {{proteins}} (VPgs) {{have been}} identified in several single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus families. The pres-ence of such protein in the family Astroviridae has not been fully elucidated, although a putative VPg coding region in open read-ing frame 1 a (ORF 1 a) of astrovirus with high amino acid sequence similarity to the VPg coding region of Caliciviridae has been previously identified. In this work we present several experimental findings that show that human astrovirus (HAstV) RNA en-codes a VPg essential for viral infectivity: (i) RNase treatment of RNA purified from astrovirus-infected cells results in a single <b>protein</b> of <b>13</b> to <b>15</b> kDa, compatible with the predicted astrovirus VPg size; (ii) the antibody used to detect this <b>13</b> - to <b>15</b> -kDa pro-tein is specifically directed against a region that includes the putative VPg coding region; (iii) the <b>13</b> - to <b>15</b> -kDa protein detected has been partially sequenced and the sequence obtained is contained in the computationally predicted VPg; (iv) the protein re-sulting from this putative VPg coding region is a highly disordered protein, resembling the VPg of sobemo-, calici- and potyvi-ruses; (v) proteolytic treatment of the genomic RNA leads to loss of infectivity; and (vi) mutagenesis of Tyr- 693 included in the putative VPg protein is lethal for HAstV replication, which strongly supports its functional role in the covalent link with the vi-ral RNA.

40|$|Nutrition {{in infancy}} - Clinical studies on dietary intake, {{metabolism}} and growth Our aims were {{to try to}} determine an appropriate formula protein concentration to be used {{during the second half}} of infancy and to evaluate the effects on plasma lipids when breast milk was exchanged for formula and/or weaning foods. Both aspects were studied with special regard to the influence of traditional weaning foods. Nutrient intake, protein and fat metabolism, and growth were studied from 3 to 12 months in Swedish and Italian infants. Breast milk was gradually exchanged for formula with the same fat but different <b>protein</b> concentrations (<b>13,</b> <b>15</b> or 18 / 20 g/l) and given together with Swedish or Mediterranean weaning foods. Swedish infants given the lowest <b>protein</b> (<b>13</b> g/l) formula had lower total dietary intake of protein and indices of protein metabolism more similar to those of breast-fed infants in mid-infancy compared with infants assigned to higher protein (15 - 18 g/l) formulas. Sufficient amounts of protein was provided to Swedish and Italian infants, since serum proteins and growth were normal in both populations. However, plasma concentrations of some essential amino acids were lower in Italian infants fed low-protein formula, despite higher protein intake. This may indicate that dietary protein from Italian weaning foods was less available in mid-infancy compared with protein from Swedish weaning foods. Dietary intake of protein was found to be associated with plasma levels of insulin-releasing amino acids, with renal excretion of C-peptide from insulin synthesis and also with growth. High dietary supply of protein may probably increase growth by promoting insulin release during infancy. Swedish breast-fed infants had higher plasma cholesterol than those fed formula, possibly since breast milk provides much saturated fat, more cholesterol and less unsaturated fat than formula. These differences decreased {{during the second half of}} infancy, when more weaning foods were provided. Moreover, residual effects of breast milk on the plasma lipid profile were lost soon after the termination of breast-feeding. Plasma lipids were lower in Italian infants at 6 and 12 months of age, partly since Italian weaning foods – and possibly also breast milk – differed in lipid composition from Swedish ones. Higher protein and lower fat and energy contents of Italian compared with Swedish weaning foods, may explain why Italian infants were given excessive protein but less fat and energy in late infancy. In conclusion, protein needs during mid- and late infancy seem to be better met by lower (13 g/l) than by higher (18 g/l) protein-containing formula when combined with high-quality weaning foods. Plasma lipids respond to changes in dietary intake from breast milk to formula and weaning foods, and differ between the Swedish and Italian infant populations in mid- and late infancy, which may partly be due to differences in fat composition of their weaning foods...|$|R

Each diet was randomly fed to 4 replicates of 7 birds each and fed for 3 periods of 4 weeks (50 - 62 wks of age) each. Egg number and mortality was recorded daily, whereas feed consumption determined {{at the end of each}} period. The increased in dietary protein significantly increased egg production from 54 to 59. 4 %. Egg weight, egg mass and feed intake increased by 1. 7 g, 3. 4 g, and 2. 8 g, respectively during the whole experimental period.
