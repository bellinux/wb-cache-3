40|$|Abstract The {{efficiency}} of a solar cell {{is given by}} its average electrical parameters. On inhomogeneous materials and especially on large-area solar cells the inhomogeneity of the short circuit current, the open circuit voltage and the fill factor are important factors to reach high and stable efficiencies and may limit the overall performance of the device. A locally increased dark <b>forward</b> <b>current</b> (shunt) reduces the fill factor and the open circuit voltage of the whole cell. The inhomogeneity of the <b>forward</b> <b>current</b> in a solar cell can be measured using lock-in thermography. The quantitative and voltage-dependent evaluation of these thermographic investigations of various solar cell types on mono- or multicrystalline silicon enables the Paper presented at EMRS 2001 Strasbourg classification of the different shunting mechanisms found. By further microscopic investigations the physical reasons for the increased dark <b>forward</b> <b>currents</b> can be determined. It turns out that a high density of crystallographic defects like dislocation tangles or microdefects can be responsible for an increased dark <b>forward</b> <b>current.</b> Unexpectedly, grain boundaries in solar cells on multicrystalline silicon do not show any measurable influence on the local dark <b>forward</b> <b>current.</b> In most cases shunts caused by process-induced defects are dominating the current-voltage characteristic at the maximum power point of the solar cell.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine changes in gait characteristics and working memory performance of healthy young adults when lower extremity muscles are fatigued, during single and dual-task walking/obstacle-crossing. Twenty-four healthy adults (11 females, 20. 7 ± 1. 3 years) were recruited for the study and performed the following five tasks immediately before and after a muscle fatigue protocol in randomized order: 1) performing an N-back test, 2) walking, 3) walking while performing an N-back test, 4) obstacle-crossing, and 5) obstacle-crossing while performing an N-back test. Whole body motion data were collected from a set of twenty-nine retro-reflective markers with a 10 -camera motion system. Main effects: Fatigue increased walking step width, obstacle-crossing gait velocity, and caused closer placement of leading foot to obstacle. Dual-task walking decreased gait velocity, <b>peak</b> <b>forward</b> velocity, and stride length. Dual-task obstacle-crossing decreased gait velocity, caused closer placement of leading foot to obstacle, and increased leading and trailing foot obstacle clearance. Interaction effects: When fatigued, dual-task decreased obstacle-crossing <b>peak</b> <b>forward</b> velocity and walking and obstacle-crossing N-back accuracy. When pre-fatigue, dual-task increased walking N-back accuracy but decreased obstacle-crossing N-back accuracy. During single-task, post-fatigue increased obstacle-crossing <b>peak</b> <b>forward</b> velocity and walking and obstacle-crossing N-back accuracy. During dual-task, post-fatigue decreased walking N-back accuracy.
