5|$|For the 2007 presidential {{election}}, Le Pen and Mégret {{agreed to}} join forces. Le Pen came fourth in the election with 11% of the vote, and the party won no seats in the legislative election of the same year. The party's 4.3% support was the lowest score since the 1981 election and only one candidate, Marine Le <b>Pen</b> <b>in</b> Pas de Calais, reached the runoff (where she was defeated by the Socialist incumbent). These electoral defeats partly accounted for the party's financial problems. Le Pen announced {{the sale of the}} FN headquarters in Saint-Cloud, Le Paquebot, and of his personal armoured car. Twenty permanent employees of the FN were also dismissed in 2008. In the 2010 regional elections the FN appeared to have re-emerged on the political scene after surprisingly winning almost 12% of the overall vote and 118 seats.|$|E

5|$|The Bic Cristal (stylised as BIC Cristal; {{also known}} as the Bic pen) is an {{inexpensive}} disposable ballpoint pen mass-produced and sold by Société Bic of Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, France. It was first launched in December 1950 and is by far the best selling <b>pen</b> <b>in</b> the world – the 100 billionth was sold in September 2006. It has become the archetypal ballpoint pen and is considered ubiquitous, {{to the extent that the}} Museum of Modern Art has made it a permanent part of its collection. Its hexagonal form and design mimics a classic lead pencil; it is sold in a variety of colours.|$|E
5|$|These extreme {{difficulties}} in melting the metal limited {{the possibilities for}} handling iridium. John Isaac Hawkins was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold <b>pen.</b> <b>In</b> 1880, John Holland and William Lofland Dudley were able to melt iridium by adding phosphorus and patented the process in the United States; British company Johnson Matthey later stated they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium {{at a number of}} World Fairs. The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in thermocouples was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000°C.|$|E
5|$|Sivanandam interrogates Usha, {{who tells}} him {{how she and}} Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky {{fountain}} <b>pen</b> <b>in</b> order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all of the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. All the suspects shoot him except Usha, who bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.|$|E

His main job description was to compose the English Republic's foreign correspondence in Latin, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.|$|E
25|$|The city {{opened its}} Public Electronic Network (<b>PEN)</b> <b>in</b> 1989, {{providing}} citizens with {{a bulletin board}} system (BBS) to discuss local issues and access city services. PEN was the first municipally operated BBS in the world. While plagued by the ills common to BBSes, the site empowered residents. Due {{in part to the}} placement of publicly available terminals in libraries, homeless persons and their issues received considerable attention on PEN. The SWASHLOCK (Showers, WASHers, and LOCKers) plan was developed on PEN and implemented in 1993. PEN also served as a center to organize opposition to the 1990 proposal to redevelop 415 PCH.|$|E
