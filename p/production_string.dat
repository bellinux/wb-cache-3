40|$|Model {{discovery}} and selection {{is an important}} step in component-based simulation model development. This paper proposes an efficient model discovery approach and quantifies the degrees of semantic similarity for selection of partially matched models. Models are represented as <b>production</b> <b>strings</b> as specified by an EBNF composition grammar. Together with a novel DHT overlay network, we achieve fast discovery of syntactically similar models with discovery cost independent of the model size. Next, we rank partially matched models for selection using semantic-based model attributes and behavior. Experiments conducted on a repository with 4, 000 models show that on average DHT-based model lookup using <b>production</b> <b>strings</b> takes less than one millisecond compared with two minutes using naive string comparisons. Lastly, efficient model selection is a tradeoff between query representation and the computation cost of model ranking. ...|$|R
