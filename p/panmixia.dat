6000|$|In Chapter XIII. the {{question}} is discussed and answered affirmatively, {{of the right of}} the nine fundamentally differing patterns to be considered as different genera; also of their more characteristic varieties to rank as different genera, or species, as the case may be. The chief test applied, respected the frequency with which the various Loops that occurred on the thumbs, were found to differ, in successive degrees of difference, from the central form of all of them; it was found to accord with the requirements of the well-known law of Frequency of Error, proving the existence of a central type, from which the departures were, in common phraseology, accidental. Now all the evidence in the last chapter concurs in showing that no sensible amount of correlation exists between any of the patterns on the one hand, and any of the bodily faculties or characteristics on the other. It would be absurd therefore to assert that in the struggle for existence, a person with, say, a loop on his right middle finger has a better chance of survival, or a better chance of early marriage, than one with an arch. Consequently genera and species are here seen to be formed without the slightest aid from either Natural or Sexual Selection, and these finger patterns are apparently the only peculiarity in which <b>Panmixia,</b> or the effect of promiscuous marriages, admits of being studied on a large scale. The result of <b>Panmixia</b> in finger markings, corroborates the arguments I have used in Natural Inheritance and elsewhere, to show that [...] "organic stability" [...] is the primary factor by which the distinctions between genera are maintained; consequently, the progress of evolution is not a smooth and uniform progression, but one that proceeds by jerks, through successive [...] "sports" [...] (as they are called), some of them implying considerable organic changes, and each in its turn being favoured by Natural Selection.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{patterns}} are hereditary, and we have seen that they are uncorrelated with race or temperament or any other noticeable peculiarity, inasmuch as groups of very different classes are alike in their finger marks. They cannot exercise the slightest influence on marriage selection, the very existence both of the ridges and of the patterns having been almost overlooked; they are too small to attract attention, or to be thought worthy of notice. We therefore possess a perfect instance of promiscuity in marriage, or, as it is now called, <b>panmixia,</b> in respect to these patterns. We might consequently have expected them to be hybridised. But that is not the case; they refuse to blend. Their classes are as clearly separated as those of any of the genera of plants and animals. They keep pure and distinct, as if they had severally descended from a thorough-bred ancestry, each in respect to its own peculiar character.|$|E

5000|$|... #Subtitle level 4: Extensive {{binomial}} sampling - is <b>panmixia</b> restored? ...|$|E
5000|$|If {{the number}} of {{binomial}} samples is large (s &rarr; &infin; [...] ), then p• &rarr; pg and q• &rarr; qg. It might be queried whether <b>panmixia</b> would effectively re-appear under these circumstances. However, the sampling of allele frequencies has still occurred, {{with the result that}} σ2p, q &ne; 0. In fact, as s &rarr; ∞, the [...] , which is the variance of the whole binomial distribution. Furthermore, the [...] "Wahlund equations" [...] show that the progeny-bulk homozygote frequencies can be obtained as the sums of their respective average values (p2• or q2•) plus σ2p, q. Likewise, the bulk heterozygote frequency is (2 p• q•) minus twice the σ2p, q. The variance arising from the binomial sampling is conspicuously present. Thus, even when s &rarr; &infin;, the progeny-bulk genotype frequencies still reveal increased homozygosis, and decreased heterozygosis, there is still dispersion of progeny means, and still inbreeding and inbreeding depression. That is, <b>panmixia</b> is not re-attained once lost because of genetic drift (binomial sampling). However, a new potential <b>panmixia</b> can be initiated via an allogamous F2 following hybridization.|$|E
50|$|In simple terms, <b>panmixia</b> (or panmicticism) is {{the ability}} of {{individuals}} in a population to interbreed without restrictions; individuals are able to move about freely within their habitat, possibly over a range of hundreds to thousands of miles, and thus breed {{with other members of the}} population.|$|E
50|$|In {{small or}} {{isolated}} populations, genetic drift can fix unusual traits such as aberrant coloration. A non-harmful mutation can soon become widespread in small, isolated populations. Moreover, if the mutant gene confers benefits, such as better camouflage, then affected individuals may out-compete those without the mutation; {{this would happen}} faster in a small inbred population close to <b>panmixia.</b>|$|E
50|$|For example, micro-allopatry, {{also known}} as macro-sympatry, is a {{condition}} where there are two populations whose ranges overlap completely, but contact between the species is prevented because they occupy completely different ecological niches (such as diurnal vs. nocturnal). This can often be caused by host-specific parasitism, which causes dispersal {{to look like a}} mosaic across the landscape. Micro-allopatry is included as sympatry according to spatial definitions, but, as it does not satisfy <b>panmixia,</b> it is not considered sympatry according to population genetics definitions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{attempting}} {{to describe the}} mathematical properties of structured populations, Sewall Wright proposed a [...] "factor of Panmixia" [...] (P) {{to include in the}} equations describing the gene frequencies in a population, and accounting for a population's tendency towards <b>panmixia,</b> while a [...] "factor of Fixation" [...] (F) would account for a population's departure from the Hardy-Weinberg expectation, due to less than panmictic mating. In this formulation, the two quantities are complementary, i.e. P = 1 - F. From this factor of fixation, he later developed the F statistics.|$|E
50|$|While <b>panmixia</b> may not {{be widely}} extant, the {{potential}} for it does occur, {{although it may be}} only ephemeral because of those local perturbations. It has been shown, for example, that the F2 derived from random fertilization of F1 individuals (an allogamous F2), following hybridization, is an origin of a new potentially panmictic population. It has also been shown that if panmictic random fertilization occurred continually, it would maintain the same allele and genotype frequencies across each successive panmictic sexual generation—this being the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. However, as soon as genetic drift was initiated by local random sampling of gametes, the equilibrium would cease.|$|E
5000|$|Genetic drift was {{introduced}} when discussing {{the likelihood of}} <b>panmixia</b> being widely extant as a natural fertilization pattern. section on Allele and Genotype frequencies. Here the sampling of gametes from the potential gamodeme is discussed in more detail. The sampling involves random fertilization between pairs of random gametes, each of which may contain either an A or an a allele. The sampling is therefore binomial sampling. Each sampling [...] "packet" [...] involves 2N alleles, and produces N zygotes (a [...] "progeny" [...] or a [...] "line") as a result. During {{the course of the}} reproductive period, this sampling is repeated over and over, so that the final result is a mixture of sample progenies. The result is dispersed random fertilization [...] These events, and the overall end-result, are examined here with an illustrative example.|$|E
50|$|This, and {{the other}} few {{concrete}} examples that have been found, are just that; they're few, so they tell us little about how often sympatry actually results in speciation in a more typical context. The burden now lies on providing evidence for sympatric divergence occurring in non-isolated habitats. It is not known {{how much of the}} earth's diversity it could be responsible for. Some still say that <b>panmixia</b> should slow divergence, and thus sympatric speciation should be possible but rare (1). Meanwhile, others claim that much of the earth's diversity could be due to speciation without geographic isolation. The difficulty in supporting a sympatric speciation hypothesis has always been that an allopatric scenario could always be invented, and those can be hard to rule out - but with modern molecular genetic techniques can be used to support the theory.|$|E
5000|$|Definitions {{based on}} {{population}} genetics {{are not necessarily}} spatial or geographical in nature, and can sometimes be more restrictive. These definitions deal with the demographics of a population, including allele frequencies, selection, population size, the probability of gene flow based on sex ratio, life cycles, etc. The main discrepancy between {{the two types of}} definitions tends to be the necessity for [...] "panmixia". Population genetics definitions of sympatry require that mating be dispersed randomly - or that it be equally likely for an individual to mate with either subspecies, in one area as another, or on a new host as a nascent one: this is also known as <b>panmixia.</b> Population genetics definitions, also known as non-spatial definitions, thus require the real possibility for random mating, and do not always agree with spatial definitions on what is and what is not sympatry.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Panmixia</b> rarely {{actually}} {{occurs in}} nature, as gamete distribution may be limited, for example by dispersal restrictions or by behaviour, or by chance sampling (those local perturbations mentioned above). It is well-known {{that there is}} a huge wastage of gametes in Nature, which is why the diagram depicts a potential gamete-pool separately to the actual gamete-pool. Only the latter sets the definitive frequencies for the zygotes: this is the true [...] "gamodeme" [...] ("gamo" [...] refers to the gametes, and [...] "deme" [...] derives from Greek for [...] "population"). But, under Fisher's assumptions, the gamodeme can be effectively extended back to the potential gamete-pool, and even back to the parental base-population (the [...] "source" [...] population). The random sampling arising when small [...] "actual" [...] gamete-pools are sampled from a large [...] "potential" [...] gamete-pool is known as genetic drift, and is considered subsequently.|$|E
5000|$|Mendelian {{randomization}} is {{a method}} that allows one to test for, or in certain cases to estimate, a causal effect from observational data {{in the presence of}} confounding factors. It uses common genetic polymorphisms with well-understood effects on exposure patterns (e.g., propensity to drink alcohol) or effects that mimic those produced by modifiable exposures (e.g., raised blood cholesterol (Katan 1986)). Importantly, the genotype must only affect the disease status indirectly via its effect on the exposure of interest. [...] Because genotypes are assigned randomly when passed from parents to offspring during meiosis, if we assume that choice of mate is not associated with genotype (<b>panmixia),</b> then the population genotype distribution should be unrelated to the confounders that typically plague observational epidemiology studies. In this regard, Mendelian randomization {{can be thought of as}} a “natural” randomized controlled trial. Because the polymorphism is the instrument, Mendelian randomization is dependent on genetic association studies having provided good candidate genes for response to risk exposure.|$|E
50|$|This seldom {{occurs in}} nature: {{localization}} of gamete exchange - through dispersal limitations, preferential mating, cataclysm, or other cause - {{may lead to}} small actual Gamo demes which exchange gametes reasonably uniformly within themselves but are virtually separated from their neighboring Gamo demes. However, there may be low frequencies of exchange with these neighbors. This {{may be viewed as}} the breaking up of a large sexual population (panmictic) into smaller overlapping sexual populations. This failure of <b>panmixia</b> leads to two important changes in overall population structure: (1) the component Gamo demos vary (through gamete sampling) in their allele frequencies when compared {{with each other and with}} the theoretical panmictic original (this is known as dispersion, and its details can be estimated using expansion of an appropriate binomial equation); and (2) the level of homozygosity rises in the entire collection of Gamo demes. The overall rise in homozygosity is quantified by the inbreeding coefficient (f or φ). Note that all homozygotes are increased in frequency - both the deleterious and the desirable. The mean phenotype of the Gamo demes collection is lower than that of the panmictic original - which is known as inbreeding depression. It is most important to note, however, that some dispersion lines will be superior to the panmictic original, while some will be about the same, and some will be inferior. The probabilities of each can be estimated from those binomial equations. In plant and animal breeding, procedures have been developed which deliberately utilize the effects of dispersion (such as line breeding, pure-line breeding, backcrossing). It can be shown that dispersion-assisted selection leads to the greatest genetic advance (ΔG=change in the phenotypic mean), and is much more powerful than selection acting without attendant dispersion. This is so for both allogamous (random fertilization) and autogamous (self-fertilization) Gamo demes.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new model of {{permanent}} monogamous pair formation in zoological populations with multiple types of females and males. According to this model, animals randomly encounter members of the opposite sex at their so-called firing times to form temporary pairs which then become permanent if mating happens. Given the distributions of the firing times and the mating preferences upon encounter, we analyze the contingency table of permanent pair types in three cases: (i) definite mating upon encounter; (ii) Poisson firing times; and (iii) Bernoulli firing times. In the first case, the contingency table has a multiple hypergeometric distribution which implies <b>panmixia.</b> The other two cases generalize the encounter-mating models of Gimelfarb (1988) who gives conditions that he conjectures to be sufficient for <b>panmixia.</b> We formulate adaptations of his conditions and prove that they not only characterize <b>panmixia</b> but also allow us to reduce the model to the first case by changing its underlying parameters. Finally, when there are only two types of females and males, we provide a full characterization of <b>panmixia,</b> homogamy and heterogamy. Comment: 27 pages.

Using 13 microsatellite markers, we compared 393 blue hake (Antimora rostrata) from 11 sample sites across a geographic range of over 3000 [*]km, and found no evidence of population structure.

40|$|International audienceTrypanosoma cruzi, the causative {{agent of}} Chagas disease, is {{subdivided}} into six discrete typing units (DTUs; TcI-TcVI) of which TcI is ubiquitous and genetically highly variable. While clonality {{is the dominant}} mode of propagation, recombinant events play a significant evolutive role. Recently, foci of wild Triatoma infestans have been described in Bolivia, mainly infected by TcI. Hence, for the first time, we evaluated the level of genetic exchange within TcI natural potentially panmictic populations (single DTU, host, area and sampling time). Seventy-nine TcI stocks from wild T. infestans, belonging to six populations were characterized at eight microsatellite loci. For each population, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), linkage disequilibrium (LD), and presence of repeated multilocus genotypes (MLG) were analyzed by using a total of seven statistics, to test the null hypothesis of <b>panmixia</b> (H- 0). For three populations, none of the seven statistics allowed to rejecting H- 0; for another one the low size did {{not allow us to}} conclude, and for the two others the tests have given contradictory results.

Nevertheless it is worth stressing that for the statistic tests of "HWE", in order to minimize the type I error (i. e. incorrect rejection of a true H- 0), we used the Bonferroni correction (BC) known to considerably increase the type II error (i. e. failure to reject a false H- 0). For the other tests (LD and MLG), we did not use BC and the risk of type II error in these cases was acceptable.

40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} and {{the collection}} of genome-wide data allow identifying adaptive variation and footprints of directional selection. Using a large SNP data set from 259 RAD-sequenced European eel individuals (glass eels) from eight locations between 34 and 64 °N, we examined the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity across locations. We tested for local selection by searching for increased population differentiation using FST-based outlier tests and by testing for significant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables. The overall low genetic differentiation found (FST = 0. 0007) indicates {{that most of the}} genome is homogenized by gene flow, providing further evidence for genomic <b>panmixia</b> in the European eel. The lack of genetic substructuring was consistent at both nuclear and mitochondrial SNPs. Using an extensive number of diagnostic SNPs, results showed a low occurrence of hybrids between European and American eel, mainly limited to Iceland (5. 9 %), although individuals with signatures of introgression several generations back in time were found in mainland Europe. Despite <b>panmixia,</b> a small set of SNPs showed high genetic differentiation consistent with single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection acting on glass eels. After screening 50 354 SNPs, a total of 754 potentially locally selected SNPs were identified. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including calcium signalling, neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction and circadian rhythm. Remarkably, one of the candidate genes identified is PERIOD, possibly related to differences in local photoperiod associated with the > 30 ° difference in latitude between locations. Genes under selection were spread across the genome, and there were no large regions of increased differentiation as expected when selection occurs within just a single generation due to <b>panmixia.</b> This supports the conclusion that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow that removes any effects of diversifying selection from each new generation...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of departures from multiple-locus Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is presented {{for a set}} of four tribal Indian groups (the Yanomama, Makiritare, Wapishana and Ticuna) from the lowlands of South America. These tribes span a range of agglomeration and acculturation from the most traditional, swidden horticulturalists to frontier townspeople. The small-group social organization typical of traditional horticulturalists leads to substantial departures from tribal <b>panmixia,</b> as manifested by the distribution of multiple-locus genotypes both within and between villages. Within villages, the departures from single-locus Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are small and nonsignificant, but the departures from gametic equilibrium (independence of loci) are substantial, even for the unlinked loci we have used to characterize these populations. The departures from single-locus homogeneity across villages are also substantial. One of the normal concomitants of increasing acculturation in this setting is an increase in agglomeration. As agglomeration increases, the departures from multiple-locus <b>panmixia</b> decrease, a process that can be very rapid.

Third, we tested for statistical associations between temporal variation in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the effective number of breeders and two indices of recruit abundance. A total of 2142 eels from 32 sampling locations were genotyped with 18 microsatellite loci.

40|$|In haplodiploids, females {{pass their}} genes on to all their {{offspring}}, whereas a male’s genes are only {{passed on to}} his daughters [1]. Hence, males always benefit from female- biased sex ratios, whereas for females the optimal offspring sex ratio depends {{on the level of}} local mate competition (LMC), ranging from highly female-biased under strict LMC to unbiased in <b>Panmixia</b> [2]. This generates a sexual conflict over sex ratio, the intensity of which depends on the LMC level, with most intense conflict in <b>Panmixia</b> [3 – 6]. Such conflict might lead to an evolutionary arms race, with persistence traits evolving in males and resistance traits in females. Although this prediction is theoretically straightforward, it remains untested empirically. We addressed this by crossing spider mites that evolved under varying intensities of LMC (hence of sexual conflict), to mates from inbred lines. Under high levels of sexual conflict, both sexes evolved manipulative traits to shift the sex ratio to their own advantage. In females, this was partly achieved through changes in egg size. We thus show that (1) LMC levels modulate sexual conflict over sex ratio in haplodiploids, driving the evolution of manipulative traits, and (2) fathers can affect sex ratio, challenging conventional assumptions. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The European eel (Anguilla {{anguilla}} L.) {{has been}} {{a prime example of}} the <b>panmixia</b> paradigm because of its extraordinary adaptation to the North Atlantic gyral system, semelparous spawning in the Sargasso Sea and long trans-oceanic migration. Recently, this view was challenged by the suggestion of a genetic structure characterised by an isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern. This is only likely if spawning subpopulations are spatially and/or temporally separated, followed by non-random larval dispersal. A limitation of previous genetic work oneels is the lack of replication over time to test for temporal stability of genetic structure. Here we hypothesize that temporal genetic variation plays a significant role in explaining the spatial structure reported earlier for this species. We tested this by increasing the texture of geographical sampling and by including temporal replicates. Overall genetic differentiation among samples was low, highly significant and comparable to earlier studies (F ST = 0. 0014; p < 0. 01). On the other hand and in sharp contrast with current understandings, hierarchical analyses revealed no significant inter-location genetic heterogeneity and hence no IBD. Instead, genetic variation among temporal samples within sites clearly exceeded the geographical component. Our results provide support for the <b>panmixia</b> hypothesis and emphasize the importance of temporal replication when assessing population structure of marine fish species...|$|E

Hence, males always benefit from female-biased sex ratios, whereas for females the optimal offspring sex ratio depends {{on the level of}} local mate competition (LMC), ranging from highly female-biased under strict LMC to unbiased in <b>Panmixia</b> [2]. This generates a sexual conflict over sex ratio, the intensity of which depends on the LMC level, with most intense conflict in <b>Panmixia</b> [3 – 6]. Such conflict might lead to an evolutionary arms race, with persistence traits evolving in males and resistance traits in females. Although this prediction is theoretically straightforward, it remains untested empirically. We addressed this by crossing spider mites that evolved under varying intensities of LMC (hence of sexual conflict), to mates from inbred lines. Under high levels of sexual conflict, both sexes evolved manipulative traits to shift the sex ratio to their own advantage. In females, this was partly achieved through changes in egg size. We thus show that (1) LMC levels modulate sexual conflict over sex ratio in haplodiploids, driving the evolution of manipulative traits, and (2) fathers can affect sex ratio, challenging conventional assumptions...|$|E
