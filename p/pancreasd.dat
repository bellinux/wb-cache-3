In short-term (two weeks) alloxan-induced diabetic rats, N. sativa oil (NSO) reduced significant amount of glucose in blood, TC, TG and LDL-C and increased significant amount of HDL-C compared to diabetic rats. However, pathological changes of <b>pancreas’s</b> Islets of Langerhans were observed after long-term (four weeks) induction of alloxan in rats. Administration of NSO recovered Langerhans cells from shrinkage whereas pioglitazone displayed slight recovery. But the combination therapy showed complete recovery of Langerhans cells as compared with diabetic rats. Combination of drugs significantly reduced the TC, TG and LDL-C level as well as increased significant amount of HDL-C level to the normal level. Combination also increased DPPH free radical scavenging activity compared with diabetic rats. The results suggest that treatment with combination therapy was more effective than mono-therapy for preventing diabetes as N. sativa oil potentiates the effects of pioglitazone on long term alloxan-induced diabetic rats...|$|R

THE PURIFIED PANCREATIC LIPASE EXHIBITS MOLECULAR MASS OF 46 KD AND ISOELECTRICPOINT AROUND 6, 4. LIPOLYSIS IS REGULATED BY THE PRESENCE OF AMPHIPHILIC COMPOUNDS SUCH AS BILE SALTS AND LECITHIN, WHICH ARE ADSORBED AT THE TRIGLYCERIDE/WATER INTERFACE. THE PARTITION OF BILE SALTS BETWEEN THE LIPIDIC AND THE AQUEOUS PHASE IS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN THE EXPRESSION OF LIPASE ACTIVITY. LIPASE ACTIVITY WAS DETERMINED AS A FUNCTION OF DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF CONCENTRATIONS OF DEOXYCHOLATE AND DIPALMITOYLPHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE.

25|$|If beta {{cells are}} {{destroyed}} by an autoimmune reaction, insulin {{can no longer}} be synthesized or be secreted into the blood. This results in type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations, and generalized body wasting. In type 2 diabetes mellitus the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead there is an accumulation of amyloid in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology. The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but patients exhibit a reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive and peripheral tissue insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high rates of glucagon secretion into the blood which are unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of glucose in the blood glucose. Insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose. As a result, the insulin levels, even when the blood sugar level is normal, are much higher than they are in healthy persons. There are a variety of treatment regimens, none of which is entirely satisfactory. When the <b>pancreas’s</b> capacity to secrete insulin can no longer keep the blood sugar level within normal bounds, insulin injections are given.|$|R

THEREFORE WE STUDIED NINETEEN WOMEN WITH PCOS (ELEVEN WITH FULL EXPRESSION AND EIGHT WITH ONLY PARTIAL EXPRESSION OF THE SYNDROME) AND ELEVEN NORMAL WOMEN WITH NO EVIDENCE OF PCOS (CONTROL GROUP). IN THE FIRST PART OF THE STUDY, WE ESTIMATED THE GHRESPONSE TO A) THE IV INFUSION (4 ΜG/KG. MIN FOR 3 H) OF DOPAMINE AND B) THE BOLLUS IV ADMINISTRATION OF GHRH (1 - 29) 1 ΜG/KG.

THERESULTS OF THE STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT: 1) THE GH RESPONSES TO DOPAMINE AND GHRH ADMINISTRATION WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN PCOS THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN CONTRAST THE IGF - 1 LEVELS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE GROUPS. THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESENCE OF AN ABNORMALLY REGULATED GH/IGF - 1 SYSTEM IN WOMEN WITH PCOS, IN PARTICULAR IN THOSE WITH THE FULL EXPRESSION OF THE SYNDROME. 2) DOPAMINE INFUSION INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION INTHE INSULIN AND C - PEPTIDE RESPONSE TO THE ORAL GLUCOSE CHALLENGE, WHILE THEPLASMA GLUCOSE LEVELS REMAINED UNCHANGED, IN THE PCOS GROUP. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THE PRESENCE EITHER OF A FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITY OF THE DOPAMINERGIC RECEPTOR OF THE <b>PANCREAS</b> OR AN UP - REGULATION OF THE Α - ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR, IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. ...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes is a {{disorder}} of glucose regulation, {{characterized by an}} accumulation of glucose in the blood. The breakdown of glucose regulation {{can be attributed to}} the <b>pancreas’s</b> inability to secrete insulin or to the body’s inability to properly use it. The usual treatment for type 1 diabetes consists in multiple subcutaneous insulin injections, daily administered using needles, insulin pen or insulin pump. However, this method doesn’t maintain normoglycemia and can lead to complications such as limb amputation, blindness, and kidney failure. To avoid such abnormal episodes, scientists imagined smart systems which are able to regulate the glucose level by themselves. During the past decades, a large variety of micro- and nanocarriers have been developed in order to improve efficiency, availability and toxicity profiles of drugs. In this field, stimuli-responsive polymer multilayers have attracted great scientific interest because of their potential applications as controlled delivery or release systems, for chemicals and drugs. A category of stimuli-responsive materials is able to sense glucose and respond to it by a modification of their porosity, leading to a release of insulin. The objective of this work was to investigate the formation of glucose responsive hollow microcapsules (5 microns) made of polyelectrolyte copolymers. These copolymers are composed of carbohydrate-sensitive functions, such as boronic acid and diols (PVOH), known for forming reversible covalent ether bond. In presence of carbohydrates such as glucose, the ether bonds will be reversibly broken and, consequently, the porosity of the glucose particles will change. Therefore, polyelectrolyte copolymers were synthesized by control radical polymerization, i. e. reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT, polyboronic acid) and cobalt-mediated radical polymerization (CMRP, PVOH). Using these polyelectrolytes as polyanions and poly(allylamine) (PAH) as a polycation, we undertook the formation of layer-by-layer capsules starting with a template of CaCO 3 microparticles which can be dissolved with EDTA leading to the formation of hollow microcapsules. Bovin serum albumin isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC) was used to fill the CaCO 3 microparticles and to determine the porosity of the resulting capsules in function of the glucose concentration. The sugar-dependent porosity is investigated by following the release of encapsulated BSA-FITC by spectro-fluoroscopy...|$|R
