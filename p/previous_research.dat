5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able to}} help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with bright lights, which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E

30|$|Statistics-based intercarrier {{interference}} (ICI) mitigation {{algorithm is}} proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems in presence of both nonstationary and stationary phase noises. By utilizing the statistics of phase noise, which {{can be obtained from}} measurements or data sheets, a Wiener filter preprocessing algorithm for ICI mitigation is proposed. The proposed algorithm can be regarded as a performance-improving technique for the <b>previous</b> <b>researches</b> on phase noise cancelation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively mitigate ICI and lower the error floor, and therefore significantly improve the performances of <b>previous</b> <b>researches</b> on phase noise cancelation, especially in the presence of severe phase noise.|$|R

Eberth, Brinkman, and Barkas proposed a different explanation for the Hilda mega-bonebed, hypothesizing that a herd of Centrosaurus apertus, as well as other local wildlife, were killed by a flood. The researchers concluded that all of the component bonebeds of the Hilda complex formed during the same individual flood.|$|E
25|$|The {{corpus callosum}} {{transfers}} information between {{the left and}} right cerebral hemispheres. The corpus callosum, rostrum, and the anterior mid-body sections are larger in adults who stutter as compared to normally fluent adults. This difference may be due to unusual functions of brain organization in stuttering adults and may be a result of how the stuttering adults performed language-relevant tasks. Furthermore, <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> has found that adults who stutter show cerebral hemispheres that contain uncommon brain proportions and allocations of gray and white matter tissue.|$|E
25|$|The neocortex {{makes up}} {{half of the}} echidna's brain, {{compared}} to 80% of a human brain. Due to their low metabolism and accompanying stress resistance, echidnas are long-lived for their size; the longest recorded lifespan for a captive echidna is 50 years, with anecdotal accounts of wild individuals reaching 45 years. Contrary to <b>previous</b> <b>research,</b> the echidna does enter REM sleep, but only when the ambient temperature is around 25°C (77°F). At temperatures of 15°C (59°F) and 28°C (82°F), REM sleep is suppressed.|$|E
30|$|In this article, {{we focused}} on ICI {{mitigation}} for OFDM systems {{in the presence of}} phase noise. By utilizing the correlation inherently exists in phase noise, a Wiener filter preprocessing algorithm based on the statistics of phase noise has been proposed, which performs directly on the received signal without changing the structure of conventional OFDM systems. Subsequently, the algorithms of <b>previous</b> <b>researches</b> on phase noise cancelation can be performed on the preprocessed received signal. Simulation results showed that for both nonstationary and stationary phase noise cases, the proposed algorithm can effectively mitigate ICI and lower the error floor, and therefore significantly improve the performances of <b>previous</b> <b>researches</b> on phase noise cancelation, especially in the presence of severe phase noise.|$|R
