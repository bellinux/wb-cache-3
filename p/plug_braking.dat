40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a method of}} controlling a slip-ring induction motor so as to provide characteristics suitable for hoist drive applications. The primary of the machine was supplied from a three-phase voltage regulator which in addition to producing a motoring torque can also provide <b>plug</b> <b>braking</b> by phase reversal and dynamic braking by d. c. injection. The hoist drive characteristics are of a constant torque nature and these were obtained by the control of a variable duty cycle forced commutated thyristor chopper in the secondary circuit of the motor. The operation of the voltage regulator has been examined for a load consisting of a delta wound induction motor. A simple model of the regulator has been developed from which speed-torque characteristics have been determined. Analysis of {{the operation of the}} motor and thyristor chopper was used to determine the appropriate relationship between duty cycle and speed necessary to produce a constant torque characteristic. This relationship was realized by a function generator which was used to control the thyristor chopper. Closed loop control of motor speed by the voltage regulator combined with open loop operation of the thyristor chopper as a function of speed gave the required constant torque characteristic. Logic circuits were incorporated in the design to allow automatic selection of the motoring and braking modes. The four-quadrant controller has been designed and successfully operated throughout the required speed range. The operation of the controller has been considered from both steady state and dynamic aspects...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} in demand for green energy, new technologies are evolved to improve energy efficiency. One of the methods to improve energy efficiency in electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles is regenerative braking. As regeneration is not effective during low speeds, hydraulic braking is being used along with regenerative braking. Different control algorithms are proposed in literature for proper selection between {{the two types of}} braking. The hydraulic braking system consists of multiple pistons that provide equal distribution of braking force on the wheels. However, this can be directly achieved by providing necessary braking torque on the shaft by applying dissipative braking at low speeds using an auxiliary motor parallel to the traction motor. In this thesis, a method is proposed where two induction motors are used, one as the traction motor and other as an auxiliary motor to demonstrate braking phenomenon. <b>Plug</b> <b>braking</b> of auxiliary motor is integrated with regenerative braking of main motor by coupling both the shafts of the two motors. The advantage of this method is that force is directly acting on the shaft and hence equal braking force is distributed on all the wheels, even at low speeds. The auxiliary motor can also be used for propulsion according to the torque demand and peak regeneration current can be counteracted by the plugging current thus limiting the battery current to its range. The disadvantage is that some amount energy is dissipated during plugging for small duration at low speeds. A transient analysis implementing vector control of induction machine is performed in Matlab and the results show good braking performance...|$|E
40|$|Braking {{of three}} phase {{induction}} motors {{is required in}} many industrial applications. This paper introduces braking of three phase induction motors using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The objective {{is to determine the}} optimum values of the applied voltage and frequency during braking to stop the motor in a certain time with minimum braking energy losses to limit any excessive thermal heating. The proposed technique is important and more useful in applications of repeated braking cycles. The results are compared with that obtained using <b>plugging</b> <b>braking</b> method and it's found that the proposed technique gives lower braking energy and shorter braking time. The braking energy losses with the proposed method are about 20 % of the <b>plugging</b> <b>braking</b> energy losses with the same braking time. The proposed method determines the variation of optimal values of applied voltage and frequency to have a certain braking time of three phase induction motor at a certain load torque with minimum braking energy losses. The characteristics of the motor are simulated using SIMULINK/MATLAB. </span...|$|R
50|$|While a {{magnetic}} levitation train {{is capable of}} performing at extremely high velocities, the configurations so far consume more energy than the trains that are being used currently. This setback {{is one of the}} barriers that is preventing magnetic levitation trains from being commercialized past the experimental and entry phase. A group of scientists in the Daejeon Metropolitan Express Transit Corporation of South Korea (the corporation that operates the Daejeon Metro) focused on the braking system.Train systems such as the Incheon Airport Maglev use air brakes and electric brakes. However, magnetic levitation trains use regenerative <b>braking</b> and <b>plugging</b> <b>braking</b> as opposed to normal trains using regenerative braking and air braking. Regenerative braking is used when the speed of the motor exceeds the synchronous speed. When this happens, the motor changes current flow so that the motor brakes. After this happens, the excess power is converted to power for the motor. <b>Plugging</b> <b>braking</b> is used when the supply terminals are switched, but it is criticized as a wasteful practice, because in order to switch the terminals, an external resistor needs to be implemented as a stopper for the current flow. As a result, a lot of power is squandered.|$|R

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} that a wagon driven by a {{squirrel-cage}} induction motor is controlled {{to stop at the}} given position on a rail. The wagon is driven on the rail and arrives at the brake-start point. From this point, the motor should be braked corresponding to the load of the wagon. Therefore, the distance from brake-start point to the stop position must be constant. The brake of the 3 phase squirrel-cage induction motor is various method; dynamic <b>braking,</b> regenerative <b>braking,</b> <b>plugging</b> and single-phase <b>braking</b> etc. DC exciting method, so called dynamic braking, was used for this experiment. The peculiarity of this experiment is that the load was detected during the braking and braking current was decided. The method of this detection is as follows. At the first step, dynamic braking of which braking current is small was given on the motor from the brake-start point. In response to the ratio of speed down, the pulses were gained by phototransister which respond to light through the hole of disk installed on motor. The distance of pulse was converted into position stepping in the second dynamic braking of which braking current is large. This way was termed the second-step dynamic braking. By such a way, as the value of load increased, the braking quantity increased. Hence the difference of the given position and the stop position was small value in spite of the load variation...|$|R
5000|$|These are bolt-action [...] "sniper" [...] rifles. Before each shot is fired, {{the shooter}} has {{to pull the}} bolt, cock the piston and load a BB into the chamber. All three {{versions}} of the VSR-10 share the same stock, same internals and same air chamber. The Pro-sniper version has a black stock, 430 mm long inner barrel and is the most accurate of the three versions. The Real Shock version has a metal weight in the piston to simulate recoil. Real Shock has a simulated wooden stock and the same 430 mm long inner barrel. However, due to the vibration caused by the heavier piston's impact, Real Shock is the least accurate of the three, albeit only by less than an inch difference at 20 m distance. G-spec is shortened version with a silencer attached. Inner barrel is 303 mm long, but has a slightly tighter bore. Due to short inner barrel its accuracy is close to Real Shock, but a couple mm more accurate. A needle-like contraption called air brake protrudes from the piston. The air <b>brake</b> <b>plugs</b> the cylinder before piston impacts, trapping {{a small amount of}} air between the piston and cylinder. This reduces impact vibration and adds to VSR series' unique accuracy.|$|R
