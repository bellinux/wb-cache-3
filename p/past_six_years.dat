25|$|With {{the end of}} the Peninsular War in 1814, {{the courts}} of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony.

However, such a ploy didn't last long, since the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to require the return of court to Lisbon (as postulated by the Liberal Revolution of 1820), and also groups of Brazilians, impatient for practical and real changes, still demanded independence and a republic, as demonstrated by the 1817 Pernambucan Revolt.|$|E

When the legislature met in early 1903, Borah led on early caucus ballots, but then the other candidates withdrew and backed Heyburn, who was chosen by the caucus, and then by the legislature. There were many rumors of corruption in the choice of Heyburn, and Borah determined that the defeat would not end his political career, deciding to seek the seat of Senator Dubois (by then a Democrat) when it was filled by the legislature in early 1907.|$|E

In addition to changing the colors of the cover, we have implemented editorial policies that should result in greater diversity of content through a wider range of publication venues. The scientific field of neuropsychology has broadened, ranging from experiments in basic cognitive and experimental neuroscience conducted in healthy participants to research in patient populations designed to improve the effectiveness, range, and depth of clinical practice. The editorial team encourages submissions that match this diversity.
