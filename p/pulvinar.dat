5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the <b>pulvinar</b> in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E
25|$|The right {{superior}} temporal gyrus was {{the most}} significantly activated area during the processing happiness. The right superior temporal gyrus increasingly responds to an increasingly happy stimuli, while the left <b>pulvinar</b> increasingly responds to increasingly fearful stimuli. The right <b>pulvinar</b> is activated during aversive conditioning.|$|E
25|$|These {{models can}} be {{vulnerable}} to the combinatorial and connectivity problems, which come as a natural consequence of depending solely on one-to-one communication of conventional information via spike rate coding. These models also require the seamless directing and combining of signals, which either assumes a controller (proposed to be the <b>pulvinar</b> nuclei) or a mechanism for the spontaneous self-assembly of neural ensembles.|$|E
25|$|The games' sponsor (Latin editor) usually {{sat beside}} {{the images of}} {{attending}} gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (<b>pulvinar)</b> but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the Republican era) the dictator Manius Valerius Maximus and his descendants were granted rights to a curule chair at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing. In the 190sBC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.|$|E
25|$|The risk {{of further}} fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have {{prompted}} Trajan's decision {{to rebuild the}} Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new <b>pulvinar</b> in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured {{as part of the}} Roman community, alongside her gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under Caracalla, and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in Diocletian's reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have checked}} the BOLD signal against both signals from {{implanted}} electrodes (mostly in monkeys) and signals of field potentials (that is the electric or magnetic field from the brain's activity, measured outside the skull) from EEG and MEG. The local field potential, which includes both post-neuron-synaptic activity and internal neuron processing, better predicts the BOLD signal. So the BOLD contrast reflects mainly the inputs to a neuron and the neuron's integrative processing within its body, and less the output firing of neurons. In humans, electrodes can be implanted only {{in patients who}} need surgery as treatment, but evidence suggests a similar relationship {{at least for the}} auditory cortex and the primary visual cortex. Activation locations detected by BOLD fMRI in cortical areas (brain surface regions) are known to tally with CBF-based functional maps from PET scans. Some regions just a few millimeters in size, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, which relays visual inputs from the retina to the visual cortex, have been shown to generate the BOLD signal correctly when presented with visual input. Nearby regions such as the <b>pulvinar</b> nucleus were not stimulated for this task, indicating millimeter resolution for the spatial extent of the BOLD response, at least in thalamic nuclei. In the rat brain, single-whisker touch has been shown to elicit BOLD signals from the somatosensory cortex.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pulvinar</b> means pillow in Latin. It {{constitutes}} the posterior pole of the thalamus and its posterior border is indeed smooth. Anteriorly {{there is only}} an incomplete boundary with the medial nucleus. The two have in fact common connections both thalamocortical and corticothalamic. This {{is the case for}} instance for the frontal cortex. The usual subdivisions do not fit with the distribution of cortical afferent. It is common to find the description of a [...] "nucleus lateralis posterior ( [...] LP). This is simply a part of the <b>pulvinar</b> passing over the lateral region and giving in transverse sections the image of a ventral and a dorsal (or lateral) subdivision. Sagittal sections show that the pulvinar(LP) ensemble is a single curved entity. The whole receives in the same almost identical afferences. A main medial part receives flat islands of axonal terminations from the frontal, parietal, temporal and preoccipital cortex. Only one part of the <b>pulvinar</b> is particular, the intergeniculate or inferior <b>pulvinar,</b> which receives tectal afferents and which has a visuotopic map.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is made up}} of the two [...] "geniculate bodies" [...] (knee-form bodies) {{that are}} located ventrally at the surface of the thalamus, below the <b>pulvinar.</b> They are [...] "relays" [...] of highly {{specific}} functions: audition for the first and vision for the second. They differentiate early in ontogenesis and totally, for the lateral or partially for the medial separate from the thalamic mass. They are however specialized but authentical isothalamic elements.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fire damage}} of 31 was {{probably}} repaired by Augustus (Caesar's successor and Rome's first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and <b>pulvinar</b> {{at the site}} but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods. Augustus had it brought from Heliopolis at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The <b>pulvinar</b> was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (aedes) raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus as [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} and admirable structures in Rome", with [...] "entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the postero {{inferior}} {{part of the}} thalamus is a {{place which}} raises unsolved problems. This {{is a place of}} endings of spinothalamic terminal axonal arborisations. The spinothalamic tracts ends in three [...] "lateral elements", the VCP, VCO, and VIm. Secondly, it ends, close to these, in intralaminar-limitans elements. The third place of ending, the basal formation (not a classical nucleus, in a place that was attributed to lower <b>pulvinar),</b> is particular only in one place named the nucleus basalis nodalis that was claimed by some to be the only relay of pain messages from layer I of the spinal cord. This place has been shown to send axons to the insula. In fact VCP also conveys painful stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|The region {{separated}} by the superior lamella is the Anterior region (A). The region separated medially by the medial lamina is the Lateral region (L). Almost {{separated from the}} thalamic mass are the Geniculate bodies (G). The remaining isothalamus {{is made up of}} the medial region (M, medial to the medial lamina) and posteriorly, with no complete separation in man, of the posterior regio or <b>pulvinar</b> (Pu). The last two represent a huge medioposterior ensemble. The classical separation into relay nuclei, receiving [...] "specific" [...] subcortical afferences or association nuclei, which would not, cannot be retained as absolute. The lateral region and the geniculate bodies indeed receive strong lower [...] "specific" [...] afferences and {{can be seen as the}} [...] "sensorimotor" [...] part of the thalamus. The medioposterior ensemble, in most of its volume does not receive subcortical afferents and abundant afferences from the [...] "associative" [...] cortex but in some, essentially ventral parts, in fact receives subcortical afferences, such as tectal, spinothalamic or amygdalar. The anterior region receives a particular afference that is not entirely subcortical (directly or indirectly from the subiculum).|$|E
2500|$|The nuclei {{corresponding}} to the lemniscal territory are called VP. The tactile part nucleus ventralis posterior caudalis VPC is the posterior part of the lateral region, {{in front of the}} <b>pulvinar.</b> It is the addition of a lateral nucleus VPL and of the superior part of the classic arcuate nucleus VPM. VPC receives axons from the dorsal column nuclei located in the lower medulla oblongata: the nucleus gracilis (Goll) medial and the nucleus cuneatus (Burdach) lateral. Starting from these nuclei, axons go ventralwards and decussate (to the other side) still in the medulla oblongata forming the [...] "lemniscal decussation". Axons from the two sides form the thick medial lemniscus close to the midline. Higher, it separates in order to reach the lower border of the two VPC. In this nucleus, the axons terminate forming lamellae and a somatotopic map. The axons conveying information from the leg are the most lateral and the most dorsal. Those conveying information from the mouth and tongue are the most medial and ventral (in VPM). The axonal arborisations are rather small and very dense. The mediator of the lemniscus system is glutamate. The thalamocortical axons of the VPC send their axons to the primary somatosensory area (areas 3b and 1) where there is also a clear somatotopic map.|$|E
2500|$|The nucleus {{medialis}} {{corresponds to}} the part which is located medial to the lamina medialis. In the anterior part of the lamina, the oral intralaminar cellular part makes a clear border. This is no more true posteriorly with the <b>pulvinar.</b> Due to their constitution and connection, the two constitute a common set corresponding to the largest mass of the human thalamus. In non human primates, the medial nucleus (often named dorsomedian) is subdivided into several subnuclei. It is admitted that {{this is no longer}} the case in humans, which makes comparison even with old world monkeys difficult. Some subcortical afferences are documented in macaques (amygdalar, tectal). There are no arguments in favour of their existence in humans. The majority of the afferences comes from the cortex, reciprocated by corticothalamic efferences. In macaques, the spatial distribution of the connection was said to be [...] "circunferential" [...] (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985), medial cortical areas being linked to medial parts of the nucleus and lateral dorsal to lateral dorsal. This is also true in humans. The strong interrelation between the medial nucleus and the frontal cortex is known for long. Lobotomies were intended to cut this connection. There are however other mediocortical connections; with the cingulate cortex, the insular cortex and also with the premotor cortex.|$|E
2500|$|This {{corresponds}} to the part of isothalamus located laterally to the medial lamina {{and in front of}} the <b>pulvinar</b> (the noyau externe of Dejerine after Burdach). It receives abundant and diverse infrathalamic afferences. Some main afferent systems occupy a particular portion in the lateral region. Several [...] "main territories" [...] are spatially separate. This allows functionally significant subdivisions. Other afferent systems may end in one or the other main territories to which they are coterritories. Still other can end in several main territories. The topographic description of the territories was made using experiments in monkeys. This showed that they are no dorsal nuclei. What was believed to be dorsal was simply the posterior extension of the more anterior territory. This makes it difficult to follow the Terminologia anatomica (1998). To follow common usage, lateral nuclei are called [...] "ventral". It is today possible to transfer the data experimentally obtained in monkeys to the human brain using immunostaining. The sequence described by C. Vogt (1909) hold true. Starting from caudally one may describe the lemniscal territory, made up of two components cutaneous or tactile and deep (musculoarticular), the cerebellar territory also made up of two nuclei, the pallidal territory and the nigral territory [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Winter {{festival is}} known {{primarily}} through Cicero's account, supplemented by later Roman authors. First, {{the house was}} ritually cleansed of all male persons and presences, even male animals and male portraiture. Then the magistrate's wife and her assistants made bowers of vine-leaves, and decorated the house's banqueting hall with [...] "all manner of growing and blooming plants" [...] except for myrtle, whose presence and naming were expressly forbidden. A banquet table was prepared, with a couch (<b>pulvinar)</b> for the goddess {{and the image of}} a snake. The Vestals brought Bona Dea's cult image from her temple and laid it upon her couch, as an honoured guest. The goddess' meal was prepared: the entrails (exta) of a sow, sacrificed to her on behalf of the Roman people (pro populo Romano), and a libation of sacrificial wine. The festival continued through the night, a women-only banquet with female musicians, fun and games (ludere), and wine; the last was euphemistically referred to as [...] "milk", and its container as a [...] "honey jar". The rites sanctified the temporary removal of customary constraints imposed on Roman women of all classes by Roman tradition, and underlined the pure and lawful sexual potency of virgins and matrons in a context that excluded any reference to male persons or creatures, male lust or seduction,. According to Cicero, any man who caught even a glimpse of the rites could be punished by blinding. [...] Later Roman writers assume that apart from their different dates and locations, Bona Dea's December and May 1 festivals were essentially the same.|$|E
60|$|Finally, of {{individual}}s, {{the living}} power {{will be most}} intense in that individual which, as a whole, has {{the greatest number of}} integral parts presupposed in it; when, moreover, these integral parts, together with a proportional increase of their interdependence, as parts, have themselves most the character of wholes in the sphere occupied by them. A mathematical point, line, or surface, is an ens rationis, for it expresses an intellectual act; but a physical atom is ens fictitium, which may be made subservient, as ciphers are in arithmetic, to the purposes of hypothetical construction, per regulam falsi; but transferred to Nature, it is in the strictest sense an absurd quantity; for extension, and consequently divisibility, or multeity,(11) (for space cannot be divided,) is the indispensable condition, under which alone anything can appear to us, or even be thought of, as a thing. But if it should be replied, that the elementary particles are atoms not positively, but by such a hardness communicated to them as is relatively invincible, I should remind the assertor that temeraria citatio supernaturalium est <b>pulvinar</b> intellectús pigri, and that he who requires me to believe a miracle of his own dreaming, must first work a miracle to convince me that he had dreamt by inspiration. Add, too, the gross inconsistency of resorting to an immaterial influence in order to complete a system of materialism, by the exclusion of all modes of existence which the theorist cannot in imagination, at least, finger and peep at! Each of the preceding gradations, as above defined, might be represented as they exist, and are realised in Nature. But each would require a work for itself, co-extensive with the science of metals, and that of fossils (both as geologically applied); of crystallization; and of vegetable and animal physiology, in all its distinct branches. The nature of the present essay scarcely permits the space sufficient to illustrate our meaning. The proof of its probability (for to that only can we arrive by so partial an application of the hypothesis), {{is to be found in}} its powers of solving the particular class of phenomena, that form the subjects of the present inquisition, more satisfactorily and profitably than has been done, or even attempted before.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pulvinar</b> nuclei or nuclei of the <b>pulvinar</b> (nuclei pulvinares) are the nuclei (cell {{bodies of}} neurons) {{located in the}} {{thalamus}} (a part of the vertebrate brain).

5000|$|The word <b>pulvinar</b> (...) {{comes to}} {{scientific}} English vocabulary via New Latin from classical Latin pulvinus, [...] "cushion".
