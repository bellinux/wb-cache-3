5|$|Block I (RS-25B) – First flown on STS-70, the Block I engines offered {{improved}} turbopumps featuring ceramic bearings, {{half as many}} {{rotating parts}} and a new casting process {{reducing the number of}} welds. Block I improvements also included a new, two-duct <b>powerhead</b> (rather than the original design, which featured three ducts connected to the HPFTP and two to the HPOTP), which helped improve hot gas flow, and an improved engine heat exchanger.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November 2001, <b>powerhead</b> 401 020 caught fire. The {{train was}} {{stopped at the}} station in Offenbach am Main near Frankfurt a.M. No {{passengers}} were harmed, but the fire caused the <b>powerhead</b> to be written off.|$|E

5000|$|The three {{components}} of the demonstration train were adapted separately at Siemens's DUEWAG plant in Uerdingen, Germany and GEC-Alsthom's plant in La Rochelle, France, in March 1998. [...] Adaptations included the connection on the ICE 2 <b>powerheads</b> to the roof-mounted high-voltage cable along the TGV trainset, the installation of electronic and optical cables for the ICE drive control electronics {{on the roof of}} the TGV trainset, the installation of a rectifier on a TGV car for the on-board electricity, and the replacement of the automatic coupler on the ICE 2 <b>powerheads</b> with side buffers and standard UIC coupler. [...] Braking systems weren't adapted, only pneumatic braking was used. [...] The ICE 2 <b>powerheads</b> also received a special livery to harmonise with that of the TGV Duplex set.|$|R

50|$|Except for the {{automatic}} coupling, ICE 2 <b>powerheads</b> {{are very similar}} to those of the ICE 1 and can actually be used in ICE 1 trains if the necessity arises.|$|R
25|$|A <b>powerhead</b> or bang stick is {{a device}} which fires a {{firearms}} cartridge or blank cartridge {{in contact with}} the target, and relies primarily on the muzzle blast to kill the target. Powerheads are often attached to spears used for spear fishing, or attached to a handle to make a bang stick, which is thrust (while still held) at the target. Bang sticks are often carried for defense against shark attack, but are legally required for alligator hunting in some areas.|$|E
25|$|These {{trainsets}} {{were used}} on the ICE line 10 Berlin-Cologne/Bonn. However, since the driving van trailers of the trains were still awaiting approval, the DB joined two portions (with one <b>powerhead</b> each) to form a long train, similar to the ICE1. Only from 24 May 1998 were the ICE 2 units fully equipped with driving van trailers and could be portioned on their run from Hamm via either Dortmund Hbf – Essen Hbf – Duisburg Hbf – Düsseldorf Hbf or Hagen Hbf – Wuppertal Hbf – Solingen-Ohligs.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was a wheel rim which broke and damaged the train six kilometres south of the accident site. The wheel rim penetrated the carriage floor and lifted the check rail {{of a set of}} points close to Eschede station. The broken-off check rail then forced the point blades of the following set of points to change direction, and the rear cars of the trainset were diverted to a different track. They hit the pillars of a street overpass, which then collapsed onto the tracks. Only three cars and the front <b>powerhead</b> passed under the bridge, the rest of the 14-car train jackknifed into the collapsed bridge.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>powerheads</b> use the {{cartridge}} to propel a barbed spear point into the target. These are generally {{used on a}} bangstick for alligator hunting, to secure a line to the alligator to prevent escape.|$|R
5000|$|Although most {{commercial}} <b>powerheads</b> use standard handgun ammunition, such as [...]357 Magnum or [...]44 Magnum, {{many users}} {{choose to use}} larger caliber ammunition to do maximum damage to the intended target. [...] A common misconception of how <b>powerheads</b> function is that the muzzle blast does the damage, as much high-pressure gas is forced into {{the flesh of the}} target. While the gas does do minimal damage, it is ultimately the penetration of the slug that causes the damage to the target. Most <b>powerheads</b> function just as traditional firearms do, instead it is the spear which acts as the firing hammer. One commercially produced version used a modified [...]30-30 Winchester cartridge case, loaded backwards, with a primed [...]38 Special case loaded in its mouth holding the primer. The cartridge was loaded with the [...]30-30 case facing outwards, so that the [...]30-30 case full of burning powder was propelled into the target upon firing.This system is fast to reload {{and one of the most}} effective despite the fact that it does not use a bullet.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the train}} {{does not have}} <b>powerheads,</b> the whole length of the train is {{available}} for passenger seats, including the first car. The lounge-seats are located directly behind the driver, separated only by a glass wall.|$|R
25|$|On 28 April 2006, {{trainset}} 73 collided head-on {{with two}} BLS Re 465 locomotives at Thun in Switzerland. The {{driver of the}} Swiss locomotives was unfamiliar with the new layout of the station, which had been recently changed. He did not see a shunting signal ordering him to stop. The locomotives automatically engaged the emergency brakes when he passed the signal, but {{came to a stop}} on the same track as the approaching ICE. The ICE was travelling at a speed of 74km/h. The emergency brake slowed the train to 56km/h at the point of collision. 30 passengers and the driver of the ICE suffered minor injuries, the driver of the Swiss locomotives having jumped to safety. Both trains suffered major damage. The <b>powerhead</b> 401 573 had to be rebuilt using components from three damaged powerheads (401 573, 401 020 and 401 551).|$|E
25|$|Highwall mining {{is another}} form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In Highwall mining, the coal seam is {{penetrated}} by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam). As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutterhead is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the <b>Powerhead</b> and the cutterhead. The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One patented Highwall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce {{thousands of tons of}} coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas (inert) venting system.|$|E
2500|$|Water {{changes are}} {{a staple of}} good {{saltwater}} maintenance. Larger (approximately [...] ) aquariums are much more stable and water changes may not need to take place if the nitrogen cycle has fully established itself in the tank, although this is a controversial statement among aquarists. [...] Water changes are used to maintain balance of calcium, carbonate alkalinity, and magnesium which are rapidly depleted in a reef aquarium, while also maintaining levels of other trace elements as well as removing toxic solutes which may accumulate from many different sources and cannot be removed by even advanced filtration methods. Supplements are needed (such as calcium) when regular water changes alone {{are not able to}} maintain adequate levels, particularly those of calcium, carbonate, and magnesium. Water changes involve removing a fraction of the total volume of the aquarium, replacing that water with new pre-mixed saltwater. Pre-mixed saltwater has been dechlorinated and/or dechloraminated—typically with an additive such as bisulfite or through filtering. Water should be brought to the same temperature if more than a 5% change is occurring. Salinity should match that of the aquarium, or be dosed very slowly if altering the salinity. Aging and aerating saltwater (such as in a bucket with a <b>powerhead</b> or airstone) is recommended as good practice to allow the pH to stabilize.|$|E
50|$|In early 1998, the two {{companies}} created a demonstration train by combining cars of three existing French and German high-speed trains: ICE 2 <b>powerheads</b> DB 402 042-6 and 402 046-7 and the intermediate cars of TGV Duplex trainset #224.|$|R
25|$|From 1997, the successor, the ICE2 trains {{pulled by}} Class 402 <b>powerheads,</b> {{was put into}} service. One {{of the goals of}} the ICE2 was to improve load {{balancing}} by building smaller train units which could be coupled or detached as needed.|$|R
50|$|Historically, a {{majority}} of outboards have been two-stroke <b>powerheads</b> fitted with a carburetor due to the design's inherent simplicity, reliability, low cost and light weight. Drawbacks include increased pollution, due to the high volume of unburned gasoline and oil in their exhaust, and louder noise.|$|R

2500|$|ICE1 trains {{consist of}} two <b>powerheads</b> and 9 to 14 {{intermediate}} cars. [...] Because trainsets are not separated in regular service, {{they can be}} seen as multiple units from an operational point of view. [...] During the refurbishment, which was completed in late 2008, trainsets were standardized to 12 intermediate cars.|$|R
25|$|Water {{movement}} {{can also}} be important in simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift , depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Water movement can be controlled via aeration from air pumps, <b>powerheads,</b> and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).|$|R
5000|$|Wounds {{caused by}} contact shots are very devastating, {{as the body}} absorbs the entire {{discharge}} of the cartridge, not just the projectile. Even a [...] blank cartridge can cause lethal wounds if fired {{in contact with the}} body, so <b>powerheads</b> (bang sticks), which are intended to fire at contact range, are often loaded with blanks.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>powerhead</b> may be {{considered}} a firearm under some circumstances. In the US, the BATFE considers a <b>powerhead</b> a firearm {{if it is not}} permanently affixed to a shaft; generally powerheads are sold spot welded to a temporary steel shaft giving an overall length of greater than 18 inches (45 cm). After installing permanently on a spear shaft, the spot weld is cut, and the temporary shaft discarded. Revenue Ruling 55-569, C.B. 1955-2, 483 says: ...|$|E
