5|$|At SuperBrawl VII on February 23, 1997, the Faces of Fear {{competed in}} a Three Way match. They faced The <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> and Harlem Heat but lost when Rocco Rock from The <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> pinned The Barbarian. At Fall Brawl 1997, The Barbarian and Meng faced Wrath and Mortis. Because Wrath and Mortis {{were part of}} a heel group, WCW had the Faces of Fear compete as faces during the match. Wrath and Mortis won the match, as Wrath pinned Meng for the victory. The Faces of Fear were {{successful}} at World War 3 1997, however, when they defeated the team of Glacier and Ernest Miller.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} a {{critical}} and commercial success, particularly in Europe, unusually so for a hip hop album at that time. Bumrush the Show had been recorded {{on the heels of}} Run-D.M.C.'s Raising Hell, but was held back by Def Jam {{in order for them to}} concentrate on releasing and promoting the Beastie Boys' License to Ill. Chuck D of <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> felt that by the time their first record was released, BDP and Rakim had already changed the landscape for how an MC could rap. <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> were already recording their second album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (Def Jam, 1988) when Bumrush hit stores.|$|E
50|$|<b>Public</b> <b>Enemies</b> {{was voted}} {{the most popular}} band in Norway in 1966, with a good margin down to The Pussycats. They {{featured}} in the Norwegian film Hurra for Andersens, performing their hit single Shotgun. Later that year Public Enemies' Shotgun reached #7 on Radio Luxembourg Top 20, making <b>Public</b> <b>Enemies</b> the first Norwegian band with success on international hit lists. Their 1967 album From <b>Public</b> <b>Enemies</b> Without Love, simply titled <b>Public</b> <b>Enemies,</b> was released also in Italy with a different cover on the Thunder label.|$|R

5|$|Warner Bros. {{was quick}} to team its two rising gangster stars—Edward G. Robinson and Cagney—for the 1931 film Smart Money. So keen was the studio to follow up the success of Robinson's Little Caesar that Cagney {{actually}} shot Smart Money (for which he received second billing in a supporting role) {{at the same time}} as The <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy.</b> As in The <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy,</b> Cagney was required to be physically violent to a woman on screen, a signal that Warner Bros. was keen to keep Cagney in the public eye. This time, he slapped co-star Evalyn Knapp.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, {{there was a}} {{resurgence}} of interest in his life among young people. Hip-hop groups such as <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> adopted MalcolmX as an icon, and his image was displayed in {{hundreds of thousands of}} homes, offices, and schools, as well as on T-shirts and jackets. This wave peaked in 1992 with the release of the film MalcolmX, an adaptation of The Autobiography of MalcolmX.|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} that Prophets of Rage {{is a new}} supergroup formed by Morello, Wilk and Commerford, with Chuck D of <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> and B-Real of Cypress Hill. The band toured through the remainder of 2016 and played the songs of the three bands in which {{the members of this}} group participated in before.|$|E

(A previously released Wooden Gun was re-released.) Mastering the limited time job would give you Dillinger's sunglasses. Two items went on sale for 25 RP: Dillinger's Overcoat and a stolen police car.|$|R

5|$|Mark Antony, Caesar's lieutenant, {{condemned}} Caesar's assassination, and {{war broke}} out between the two factions. Antony was denounced as a <b>public</b> <b>enemy,</b> and Caesar's adopted son and chosen heir, Gaius Octavianus, was entrusted with the command of the war against him. At the Battle of Mutina Mark Antony was defeated by the consuls Hirtius and Pansa, who were both killed.|$|E
5|$|Octavian also {{demanded that}} the decree should be {{rescinded}} which declared Antony a <b>public</b> <b>enemy.</b> When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions. He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on 19 August 43BC was elected consul with his relative Quintus Pedius as co-consul. Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another leading Caesarian.|$|E

5|$|While Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had {{effectively}} {{become his}} agent, angled {{for a substantial}} pay raise and more personal freedom for his brother. The success of The <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> and Blonde Crazy forced Warner Bros.' hand. They eventually offered Cagney a contract for $1000 a week. Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was 1932's Taxi!. The film is notable for not only being {{the first time that}} Cagney danced on screen, but it was also the last time he allowed himself to be shot at with live ammunition (a relatively common occurrence at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were considered too expensive and hard to find to use in most motion picture filming). He had been shot at in The <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy,</b> but during filming for Taxi!, he was almost hit.|$|E
5|$|Chase {{had been}} fascinated by {{organized}} crime and the mafia from an early age, witnessing such people growing up. He also was raised on classic gangster films, such as The <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy,</b> and the crime series The Untouchables. The series is partly inspired by the Boiardo family, a prominent New Jersey organized crime family when Chase was growing up, and partly on New Jersey's DeCavalcante family. He has mentioned American playwrights Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams as influences on the show's writing, and Italian director Federico Fellini as an important influence on the show's cinematic style.|$|E
5|$|However, this {{resurgence}} {{soon became}} commodified as a trend, while actual awareness within the African-American community was limited and ineffectual to {{issues such as}} drug dealing and the prevalence of liquor stores in such neighborhoods. <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> responded to this and other deep-rooted problems of Black America on their following album, Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black (1991), which featured more critical assessments of African-Americans, denouncing Black drug dealers who donned Afrocentric merchandise, hip hop artists who promoted malt liquor, black radio stations for lacking significant airplay to hip hop, and even the Africans {{at the onset of}} the Atlantic slave trade for lacking unity.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> {{released}} {{their second}} album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back to critical and commercial success. Their music's dense textures, {{provided by the}} group's production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop at the time. The controversial, politically charged lyrics by the group's lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader Louis Farrakhan, intensified the group's affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan. It Takes a Nations success helped raise hip hop's profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in the popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction {{at the turn of}} the 1980s. In promoting the record, <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album's content and the group's rage-filled showmanship in concert, they became the vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 American film {{directors}} Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, {{a critically}} acclaimed documentary film which explores {{the world of}} conspiracy theorists - such as American radio host Alex Jones - who consistently expose and vigorously oppose {{what they perceive as}} an emerging New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E
5|$|In April 1931, {{the same}} month as the release of The <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy,</b> Hays {{recruited}} former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and actually too favorable in their depiction of the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed and from 1930 to 1932 removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E

5|$|On {{the basis}} of Ice's good looks and dance moves, <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy</b> tried to {{convince}} their producer, Hank Shocklee, to sign Ice to Def Jam, but Ice later {{signed a contract with}} SBK Records in 1990. SBK remixed and re-recorded Hooked under the title To the Extreme. The reissue contained new artwork and music. According to Ice, SBK paid him to adopt a more commercial, conventional appearance. This led Ice to later regret his business agreements with SBK.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote their}} album, {{in the summer}} of 1992 the band went on two two-week tours of the Western area of the United States. In the fall, they {{embarked}} on a two-and-a-half month national tour. Due to the commercial failure of their album, Interscope refused to support the tour, leaving the band to finance it themselves. They played alongside bands such as Rage Against the Machine, Ugly Kid Joe, Sublime, Dance Hall Crashers, 311, <b>Public</b> <b>Enemy,</b> Pato Banton and The Special Beat.|$|E
5|$|Warner Brothers′ {{succession}} of gangster movie hits, in particular Little Caesar with Edward G.

However, after the initial rushes, each was reassigned the other's part. The film cost only $151,000 to make, but it {{became one of the}} first low-budget films to gross $1million.|$|E
