Even a small splash that lodges in a shoe or between the shoe and ankle could cause a severe burn. Many welders also wear fire-resistant <b>spats</b> <b>for</b> protection from sparks. Casual chainsaw operators often wear <b>protective</b> <b>spats</b> over steel-toe boots, but professionals are now encouraged to wear true chainsaw boots to prevent injury from accidental chainsaw contact with the foot or ankle.|$|R
