50|$|Fomitopsis cajanderi is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} bracket fungus. Commonly known as the rosy conk due to its rose-colored pore surface, it causes a disease called a brown <b>pocket</b> <b>rot</b> in various tree species.|$|E
50|$|Hericium abietis {{causes a}} white <b>pocket</b> <b>rot</b> of conifers; {{this is a}} form of wood decay {{featuring}} a selective attack on lignin and hemicellulose in wood. The fruit bodies grow singly or occasionally in small groups on the dead wood of conifers, especially fir and Douglas fir. It can also be cultivated on conifer sawdust. The species is found throughout North America.|$|E
50|$|Identification in {{affected}} wood, {{known as}} white <b>pocket</b> <b>rot,</b> includes symptoms {{in the form}} of dark discolouration around the heartwood near the base. Heavily diseased wood will be soft, stringy, and fibrous that may contain black specks parallel to the grain. Quick identification of affected wood can be done by wrapping suspect wood in damp paper towels and left for 5-6 days for the tell-tale formation of the conidial anamorph, Spiniger meineckellus. The basidiospores are spherical to ellipsoid, distinctive of the family Bondarzewiaceae.|$|E
5000|$|Red {{ring rot}} {{is common in}} North America. The {{pathogen}} Phellinus pini is widely spread in the temperate zone in the Northern Hemisphere. [...] It infects {{a wide range of}} coniferous trees, including jack pine, lodgepole pine, Sitka and white spruce, Douglas-fir, balsam and true fir, western hemlock, and tamarack. It attacks both heartwood and sapwood and causes white <b>pocket</b> trunk <b>rot.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lentinellus montanus is a {{white rot}} fungus. Its fruit bodies grow singly, or, more commonly, in {{clusters}} on decaying conifer wood at elevations between 5000 - 10000 ft. Recorded tree substrates include Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and Pinus contorta. The fungus mycelium has also been found growing on fire wounds on living trees of Engelmann spruce and Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), where it attacks the springwood and causes small <b>pockets</b> of <b>rot.</b>|$|R
50|$|Endemic to Madagascar, {{species of}} Tanipone are {{predominantly}} terrestrial to subarboreal, being found as ground foragers in leaf litter, under stones, in rotten stumps and in rotten logs. Just as commonly {{workers have been}} captured on low vegetation, in living and dead stems above the ground and in <b>rot</b> <b>pockets</b> in tree trunks.|$|R
50|$|Neolentinus kauffmanii decays {{sitka spruce}} {{on the west}} coast of North America, {{producing}} a variation of brown rot called brown <b>pocket</b> <b>rot.</b> Neolentinus ponderosus is another western North American species found on the ground, growing from the roots of or growing from the stumps of pine, predominantly Pinus ponderosa in montane areas. In California, it is often solitary, common in the Sierra, and is rare at low elevations. The fruiting commences from late spring to late summer. Sought out when young and tender, it has an excellent taste.|$|E
5000|$|Many agents damage T. distichum trees. The main {{damaging}} (in {{some cases}} lethal) agent is the fungus Stereum taxodii, which causes a brown <b>pocket</b> <b>rot</b> known as [...] "pecky cypress". It attacks the heartwood of living trees, usually from the crown {{down to the}} roots. A few other fungi attack the sapwood and the heartwood of the tree, {{but they do not}} usually cause serious damage. Insects such as the cypress flea beetle (Systena marginalis) and the bald cypress leafroller (Archips goyerana) (closely related to the fruit tree leafroller) can seriously damage trees by destroying leaves, cones or the bark. Nutrias also clip and unroot young bald cypress seedlings, sometimes killing a whole plantation in a short amount of time.|$|E
50|$|Most commercially {{important}} conifers in Canada, including white spruce, are {{attacked by}} Inonotus tomentosus (Fr.) Teng {{also known as}} Onnia tomentosa (Whitney 1978). This fungus produces a white <b>pocket</b> <b>rot</b> commonly called Tomentosus root rot in both roots and butts of naturally seeded or planted conifers. White spruce and black spruce {{were found to be}} the 2 most susceptible species in an inoculation test in Saskatchewan (Whitney 1964), and high losses to root rot, in large part due to I. tomentosus, affected white spruce plantations at Grand-Mère QC (Lachance 1978). In white spruce plantations, mortality in groups of 2 or 3 trees usually occurs at about age 30-35 years (Whitney 1977), but younger trees can also be killed (Whitney 1993). Occasional trees as young as 10 years of age are infected (Whitney and Timmer 1983). Seventeen white spruce plantations 43-58 years old in Ontario incurred an average of 0.7% mortality annually over a 6-year study period (Whitney 1993). Average accumulated mortality of dominant and codominant trees was 10.3% for all plantations in that study. Tomentosus root rot was found in more than half the stumps after clearcutting in a plantation at Searchmont, Ontario, but decay and stain had not yet reached stump height (Whitney 1962).|$|E
25|$|A major {{rehabilitation}} project {{took place}} between 1978 and 1981. Work included the removal of all interior and exterior caps of the arches for visual inspection and probing, in order to detect <b>pockets</b> of wood <b>rot.</b> The portions of arches showing surface wood rot were treated with ‘Git-Rot’, a wood preservative. The caps that remained in good condition were salvaged and reinstalled.|$|R
30|$|Modal-based damage-detection {{algorithms}} {{were used}} to identify the location of defects commonly found in timber and to estimate their severities. In this study, the authors propose modifications to an existing damage-detection algorithm for locating and evaluating damage by comparing the modal strain energy before and after damage using the first two flexural modes of vibration. Experimental verification was performed on pin-pin supported timber beams by employing the algorithms with extracted modal parameters using experimental modal analysis. Single and multiple cases of damage used to simulate <b>pocket(s)</b> of <b>rot</b> with various severities were inflicted by removing sections of timber beam specimens. The proposed damage indicator, computed from the first two flexural modes, was capable of detecting all damage locations. It was also able to estimate, with reasonable accuracy, the severity of damage in term of loss of sectional moment of inertia. The modified damage index method is generally reliable in detecting the location and estimating the severity of simulated defects in timber beams.|$|R
50|$|Platypus apicalis {{has both}} {{biodiversity}} and economic impacts. From a biodiversity perspective, the beetles {{are a threat}} to beech trees. While some trees {{have been known to}} survive, in most cases the combination of the tunnels through the xylem and phloem and the subsequent fungal infection prove lethal. This {{and the fact that it}} has no known predators and few parasites makes it a potential threat to beech tree population numbers. There is also the threat of the species escaping New Zealand via exports of lumber. Beech species exist throughout much of the world and it is conceivable that the insect could survive quite well elsewhere. From an economic standpoint, the tree reduces the amount of native timber available. Even if a tree is not killed outright, the invasion often causes defects such as concealed <b>rot</b> <b>pockets</b> and irregular wood cores. Damaged trees are also easy targets for other species of fungi. This not only affects logging companies, but also associated industries.|$|R
40|$|International audienceEvidence of fungal decay is {{frequently}} encountered in silicified wood. However, studies focusing on fossil fungal wood degradation remain rare. A characteristic pattern of degradation and decay symptoms congruent with present-day white <b>pocket</b> <b>rot</b> occur in Late Permian silicified glossopteridalean stem and root wood (Australoxylon sp.) from Skaar Ridge, Antarctica. Co-occurring with the decay symptoms are fungal hyphae with clamp connections. Hyphae usually {{progress through the}} pit apertures, but some may also penetrate tracheid walls. The individual wall layers {{in some of the}} infected tracheids are separated from each other, apparently forming appositions. Small, opaque bodies (?arthropod coprolites) occur in some of the decay pockets. The abundance of infected specimens among the silicified woods from Skaar Ridge suggests that white <b>pocket</b> <b>rot</b> fungi were important decomposers in late Paleozoic high-latitude forest ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} evaluated effects of organic inputs on crop yield and quality and incidence of <b>pocket</b> <b>rot,</b> which commonly diminishes non-flooded taro yields by {{a quarter to}} a third. Considering the costs of organic inputs, enumerated in the publication, yield increases due to the amendments were not economically justified, {{at least in the}} short term; the experiment did not continue in order to assess long-term benefits and economics...|$|E
40|$|General Production Information NY {{produces}} 2700 {{acres of}} beets annually, virtually all for processing. Root rot, <b>pocket</b> <b>rot,</b> damping-off and seed rots, caused by Rhizoctonia, Pythium, Phoma and other fungi, are serious diseases of beets. Control of annual and perennial weeds is another significant pest management challenge. Insect damage to beets {{is not usually}} an economic problem. Without the registration of new, effective materials to replace them, the loss of thiram, captan, and mefenoxam (all as seed treatments); cycloate and pyrazon preplant herbicides; and the postemergence carbamate herbicides phenmedipham and desmedipham would have significant impacts on production and profitability...|$|E
30|$|The {{fuzzy logic}} method for {{segmentation}} in hardwood is feasible {{and has a}} scarce advantage over the artificial neural network (ANN), however, an important improvement is that after the training process of the ANN the knowledge represented in the neural weights is basically a black box, {{in contrast with the}} fuzzy logic method where there is a traceability of the segmentation process. The fuzzy logic method shows a better performance for all the regions, except the bark (which has marginal value as compared to the sapwood or heartwood), when compared with the neural network. The primary disadvantages of the fuzzy method are that for each new situation a new set of rules have to be created, for example for the labeling of <b>rot</b> <b>pockets</b> or living knots. However, as indicated, the most important advantage of the fuzzy logic method is the ability to emulate the expert’s knowledge, unlike the neural network. In this case, an expert {{has to be able to}} express this knowledge in a structured form.|$|R
40|$|The "many {{fragments}} curse," {{a special}} case of the segment length curse, occurs in den- drochronology when time series are broken into fragments, either because of missing part of a sample (e. g., a <b>rot</b> <b>pocket)</b> or when a section of ring growth cannot be crossdated (e. g., a section with extremely suppressed growth and/or many rings absent). We exorcise this curse by inserting values to connect fragments of measurements. This technique permits fitting a single detrending curve to the connected series and thus preserves the low-frequency variance contained in the entire series. Inserted values are discarded after detrending and do not otherwise affect calculations of final corn- posite chronologies. As an example from junipers sampled at a site in Qinghai Province, China, 66 of 117 increment cores have nondatable sections of wood and one core has a gap of rotten wood between dated fragments. After connecting fragments by inserting values and then detrending, the chronology constructed from connected fragments has stronger century to multicentury scale variation than the chronology constructed from separate fragments. This approach is adapted to the library of computer programs developed for dendrochronological research {{under the auspices of}} the International Tree-Ring Data Bank...|$|R
40|$|Late Tertiary fossil woods {{from the}} state of Nevada provide an {{opportunity}} for observing the mineralization sequences that cause buried wood to become permineralized. Oligocene and Miocene caldera basins contain abundant petrified wood that ranges in composition from incipient silicification to complete permineralization. Examination of specimens from 21 localities reveals that the petrifaction sequence can follow multiple pathways. Fossil wood specimens from a single stratum may have different mineralization; silicification may vary even within a single specimen. Despite these variations, several trends are evident. Features in Nevada specimens suggest that two fundamental processes are involved: early mineralization of cell walls, and later silica deposition in lumina, vessels, and <b>rot</b> <b>pockets</b> from groundwater that permeated these open spaces. The process of open-space filling may be analogous to the genesis of geodes and veins, where multiple episodes of hydrothermal precipitation may produce opal, chalcedony, and quartz as deposits within a single cavity. Silica polymorphs may coexist as primary precipitates, or they may originate from solid-state transformation of a single parent material. Relic lepisphere textures observed in some chalcedony wood specimens are evidence of opal→chalcedony transition. In Nevada, specimens that contain crystalline quartz, this mineral appears to have been formed by direct precipitation in open spaces, not from recrystallization of chalcedony. Opal-A has seldom been reported in fossil wood, but this amorphous material is fairly common in Nevada specimens...|$|R
40|$|Xylobolus frustulatus {{caused a}} {{distinct}} <b>pocket</b> <b>rot</b> in decorticated oak. Polymerization products appeared to accumulate {{in advance of}} delignified wood to form barriers to decay. Medullary ray parenchyma and earlywood vessels were not readily degraded and remained between pockets of decay. Chemical analyses indicated that 97 % lignin, 96 % xylose, and 69 % mannose were removed from pockets of wood during incipient decay. Although 53 % of the cellulose was removed from these areas, the remaining white tissues were composed of relatively pure cellulose. Hyphae became abundant as the released cellulose was subsequently removed. In the most advanced stages of decay, hyphae were absent from pockets, and only a sparse lining of crystals, found to contain {{a high concentration of}} calcium, remained...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of an industrial computed tomography scanner for the sawmilling industry {{raises the question of}} how to find a production strategy that uses a computed tomography scanner in the sawmill production line to its full potential. This study was focused on a Scandinavian sawmill processing Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The potential value increase when allowing an alternative log rotation other than the horns down position was investigated using a log breakdown simulation. The resulting data was analysed with respect to the size of the log rotational step, an introduced rotational error of the sawing machine and different price differences between the quality grades. It was also of interest to define the outer log properties that characterise the logs sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to logs sawn for a greater profit return in a different log rotation. Such characteristics can be used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in an optimisation and consider instead other parameters, such as positioning and sawing pattern. Other defects such as pitch <b>pockets,</b> splits and <b>rot</b> are also of interest. The results shows that there is a potential value increase when applying the log rotation that maximises the value for each log instead of processing all logs in the horns down position. However, the potential value increase depends on the rotational error of the used sawing machine and the price differences between the quality grades. The log properties that differ between logs sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to a different log rotation are the bow height and the log taper. Unfortunately, predictability of log rotation for greatest profit return based on the outer properties of logs is poor. It is not possible to differentiate logs which would be sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position from those where a different log rotation results in the greatest profit return, based only on their outer properties...|$|R
