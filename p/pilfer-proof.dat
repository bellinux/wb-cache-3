5000|$|The {{tamper-evident}} band (also {{known as}} the <b>pilfer-proof</b> ring -however considered a misnomer given that pilfering is still technically possible) is a plastic or metal ring that is often found attached below a screw cap in bottles, connected by thin bridges. They can be molded along with the cap or slit afterwards. [...] When unscrewing the cap, the ring breaks: the ring can separate from the cap, and two separate pieces remain, the sealing piece and the leftover ring; or the broken ring can form a [...] "pigtail" [...] still attached to the cap. [...] The ring therefore is a tamper warning: if the seal between the ring and the cap is broken, it {{is an indication that}} the cap has been opened.|$|E
