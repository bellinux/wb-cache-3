The free nature of the carboxylic acids analyzed was ensured by employing a single-step water extraction.

Within the Murchison aromatic acids, there are previously unreported <b>phthalic</b> <b>acids,</b> methyl <b>phthalic</b> <b>acids,</b> and hydroxybenzoic acids. In Orgueil, benzoic acid and very small amounts of methylbenzoic acids and methylhydroxybenzoic acids were detected. For the aromatic acids in both Murchison and Orgueil, most structural isomers were identified, suggesting an origin by abiotic processes. Quantitative differences are evident between acids in the two meteorites; carboxylic. acids are much more abundant in Murchison than in Orgueil. The data suggest that differing levels of aqueous alteration on the meteorite parent body(ies) has produced dissimilar distributions of carboxylic acids. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{structural}} requirements for organic acids that increase the yield of ATP formed by spinach chloroplasts in the dark due to an acid-base transition. Dicarboxylic acids of 4 and 5 carbon atoms with 1 pKa in the range of 4. 2 to 4. 4 and the second at 5. 3 to 5. 5 are most effective. A fairly good correlation was found between the fraction of the acid completely undissociated at the test pH and the final yield. Other considerations are also important, however, since introducing hydroxyl groups or excessive chain length decreased yields in spite of pKa considerations. Aromatic acids, except for the dicarboxylic <b>phthalic</b> <b>acids,</b> were inhibitory. The diversity of organic acids having some effect makes it unlikely that they serve as substrate for a chloroplast enzyme system...|$|R

Over 60 % of [14 C]pyrene was mineralized to CO 2 after 96 h of incubation at 24 degrees C. High-pressure liquid chromatography analyses showed the presence of one major and at least six other metabolites that accounted for 95 % of the total organic-extractable 14 C-labeled residues. Analyses by UV, infrared, mass, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and gas chromatography identified both pyrene cis- and trans- 4, 5 -dihydrodiols and pyrenol as initial microbial ring-oxidation products of pyrene.

40|$|The main {{target of}} this {{research}} was to investigate strategies for linking triphenylene discogens via staggered, ferrocene links. The thesis begins with a general introduction to liquid crystals and triphenylenes. The results {{of this research}} are then described. In the first part, a new and improved synthesis of dibromotriphenylene intermediates is described. The new procedure allows convenient access to the material without extensive chromatography. Attempts to couple dibromotriphenylenes with ferrocene derivatives is then discussed using ferrocene boronic acid and via acetylene links (Sonagashira couplings). Unfortunately, the required twinned structures were not observed, but a number of new monomeric derivatives (Ferrocenyl triphenylenes) were isolated. The reactions of ethynyl triphenylenes were complicated by efficient and competing homocoupling.

Aerosol samples were analyzed for low-molecular-weight homologous dicarboxylic acids, oxocarboxylic acids and alpha-dicarbonyls, as well as organic carbon and elemental carbon. Concentration ranges of diacids, oxoacids, and alpha-dicarbonyls were 1, 400 - 5, 250, 272 - 1, 380, and 88 - 220 ng m(- 3), respectively. Molecular distributions of diacids (mean 3, 388 +/- 943 ng m(- 3)) were characterized by a predominance of oxalic acid (C- 2; 1, 373 +/- 427 ng m(- 3)), followed by succinic (C- 4), terephthalic (tPh), and <b>phthalic</b> (Ph) <b>acids.</b> Such high levels of tPh and Ph were different from those in other Asian cities where malonic acid (C- 3) is {{the second or third}} highest species, mostly owing to significant emissions from coal combustion and uncontrolled waste incineration. High contents of diacids, oxoacids, and alpha-dicarbonyls were detected on hazy days, suggesting an enhanced emission and/or formation of these organics during such a weather condition. Concentrations of unsaturated aliphatic diacids (e. g., maleic <b>acid)</b> and <b>phthalic</b> <b>acids</b> were higher in nighttime than in daytime. Good positive correlations of C- 2 with C- 3, C- 4, ketomalonic (kC(3)), pyruvic (Pyr), and glyoxylic (E center dot C- 2) acids in daytime suggest secondary production of C- 2 via the photooxidation of longer chain diacids and E center dot C- 2.

Alkylated PAHs, which are more abundant in crude oils than the nonsubstituted compounds, were selectively attacked at extents that varied from more than 90 % for dimethylnaphthalenes, methylphenanthrenes, methylfluorenes, and methyldibenzothiophenes to about 30 % for monomethylated fluoranthenes/pyrenes and trimethylated phenanthrenes and dibenzothiophenes.

The polyester was based on <b>phthalic</b> <b>acids</b> and aliphatic diols. The polyisocyanate cross-linking agent was 1 -isocyanato- 3 -isocyanatomethyl- 3, 5, 5 -trimethyl cyclohexane homopolymer (IPDI) blocked with methylethylketone oxime (MEKO) to make a one-part formulation. The overall migrate, obtained using solvent extraction of cured films, comprised almost completely of twelve cyclic and one linear polyester oligomers up to molecular weight 800 and containing up to six monomer units. These 13 oligomers were {{in a total of}} 28 isomeric forms. Other minor components detected were plasticisers and surfactants as well as impurities present in the starting materials.

The level of extractable IPDI was used as an indicator of the completeness of cure in experimental coatings. These studies revealed the influence of time, temperature and catalyst content.

In addition to diacids, Ï‰-oxo acids (C_ 2 -C_ 5,C_ 9), pyruvic acid and Î±-dicarbonyls (methylglyoxal and glyoxal) were detected. Oxalic (C_ 2) acid was generally found as a dominant diacid species (1. 8 - 70 ng/m^ 3,av. 14 Â± 12 ng/m^ 3) followed by malonic (C 3; 0. 05 - 19 ng/m^ 3,av. 2. 5 Â± 3. 3 ng/m^ 3) and succinic (C_ 4; 0. 51 - 18 ng/m^ 3,av. 3. 8 Â± 3. 5 ng/m^ 3) acids throughout all seasons.

On the other hand, the spring peak was observed during the period of "Arctic Sunrise".
