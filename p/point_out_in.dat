She eats their food and hides under a bed.|$|E

2500|$|Retention and {{recruitment}} are important methods {{to achieve a}} long-term solution to the nursing shortage. Recruitment is promoted through making nursing attractive as a profession, especially to younger workers, to counteract the high average age of RNs and future waves of retirement. Refining the work environment can improve the overall perception of nursing as an occupation. This {{can be achieved by}} ensuring job satisfaction. Writers Lori Candela, Antonio Gutierrez, and Sarah Keating <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the journal, Nurse Education Today, ways the academic nursing administrators can make a change. [...] "Individual support to attend workshops or conferences, participation in on-campus teaching/learning faculty sessions, the use of consultants with expertise in particular areas around teaching and evaluation, and mentoring networks that include senior faculty with teaching expertise" [...] can all create a strong relationship between staff members therefore developing a better environment. Additionally, financial opportunities such as signing bonuses can attract nurses.|$|E

2500|$|Su Shi's trial {{lasted for}} 4 months, {{starting}} {{in the summer of}} 1079: he was accused of writing or allowing writings to circulate that the government might consider to be treasonously derogatory to the person of the emperor or to the state, which were considered to be basically equivalent. The charges were of [...] "denouncing the imperial chariot" [...] (Murck, 49) and of [...] "great irreverence toward the emperor" [...] (Murck, 49): conviction carried a mandatory death penalty by beheading, according to the statutory Song penal code, although this had never yet been applied (Murck, 49). Among the evidence were poems by Su Shi (also known as [...] "Master Dongpo"). Su Shi defended himself, denying accusations, or explaining how the lines of his poems really referred to the results of the actions of corrupt ministers, which according to ancient tradition it was incumbent as a duty of a loyal official to <b>point</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> his trial, Su Shi confessed to such things as comparing the attachment of unscrupulous officials to their salaries with an owl's attachment to eating a rotten rat (Murck, 76). According to Alfreda Murck (92), in a further confession, this time regarding the interpretation of a poem that he had written {{on the occasion of the}} banishment of Zeng Gong to serve in a remote government posting, Su Shi admitted: [...] "This criticizes indirectly that many unfeeling men have recently been employed at Court, that their opinions are narrow-minded and make a raucous din like the sound of cicadas, and that they do not deserve to be heard." [...] However, he omitted to enlighten the court upon his use in this poem of matched rhymes from Du Fu's [...] "Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture", or the added meanings which could then be derived from his poem (Murck, 92). In the end, Su Shi was convicted. The failure of the court to notice the extended meanings derivable by comparison of his rhymes with Du Fu's was apparent (to those in the know), and Su Shi and others, such as Wang Shen, having learned a way to avoid censorial persecution while still being able to express themselves to each other would continue to employ and expand upon this rhyme-matching, in conjunction with similarly coded painting.|$|E
