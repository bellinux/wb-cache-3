5000|$|In 1933, Chrysler {{decided to}} catch up with Ford and Chevrolet with respect to engine {{cylinder}} count. The 190 cu in version of Chrysler's flathead-six engine was equipped with a downdraft carburetor and installed in the new 1933 Plymouth PC, introduced on November 17, 1932. However, Chrysler had reduced the PC's wheelbase from 112 to 107 in, and the car sold poorly. By April 1933, the Dodge division's Model DP chassis, with a 112 in wheelbase, was put under the <b>PC</b> <b>body</b> with DP front fenders, hood, and radiator shell. The model designation was advanced to PD' and the car was marketed as the [...] "DeLuxe" [...] 1933 Plymouth. This car sold very well and is the 1933 model most commonly found in collections. The PC became the 'Standard Six'. It had been the 'Plymouth Six' at introduction, and was sold through to the end of 1933, but in much lower numbers. It is consequently in the minority in collectors' hands today. In 1937, Plymouth (along with the other Chrysler makes) added safety features such as flat dash boards with recessed controls and the back of the front seat padded for the rear seat occupants.The PC was shipped overseas to Sweden, Denmark, and the UK, as well as Australia. In the UK, it was sold as a 'Chrysler Kew', Kew Gardens being the location of the Chrysler factory outside London. The flathead six which started with the 1933 Model PC stayed in the Plymouth until the 1959 models.|$|E
40|$|Polycomb group (PcG) {{proteins}} are conserved chromatin {{factors that}} maintain silencing of key developmental genes {{outside of their}} expression domains. Recent genome-wide analyses showed a Polycomb (PC) distribution with binding to discrete PcG response elements (PREs). Within the cell nucleus, PcG proteins localize in structures called PC bodies that contain PcG-silenced genes, {{and it has been}} recently shown that PREs form local and long-range spatial networks. Here, we studied the nuclear distribution of two PcG proteins, PC and Polyhomeotic (PH). Thanks to a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we could analyze the formation and the mobility of PC bodies during fly embryogenesis as well as compare their behavior to that of the condensed fraction of euchromatin. Immuno-FISH experiments show that PC bodies mainly correspond to 3 D structural counterparts of the linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During early embryogenesis, PC and PH progressively accumulate within PC bodies, which form nuclear structures localized on distinct euchromatin domains containing histone H 3 tri-methylated on K 27. Time-lapse analysis indicates that two types of motion influence the displacement of PC bodies and chromatin domains containing H 2 Av-GFP. First, chromatin domains and PC bodies coordinately undergo long-range motions that may correspond to the movement of whole chromosome territories. Second, each <b>PC</b> <b>body</b> and chromatin domain has its own fast and highly constrained motion. In this motion regime, PC bodies move within volumes slightly larger than those o...|$|E

This study investigates {{the effect of a}} weak base, methylamine, on the pH in lamellar bodies and on the trafficking and packaging of newly synthesized <b>PC</b> in lamellar <b>bodies.</b> Methylamine increased the pH of isolated lung lamellar bodies and of lamellar bodies in intact cells. Metabolic labelling of isolated type II cells with [methyl- 3 H]choline showed that although methylamine (2. 5 - 10 mM) did not alter the labelling of cellular or microsomal PC and disaturated PC, it decreased the labelling of the PC and disaturated <b>PC</b> in lamellar <b>bodies.</b> The packaging of <b>PC</b> in lamellar <b>bodies</b> (the specific activities ratio between the <b>PC</b> in lamellar <b>bodies</b> and the microsomal PC) also decreased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The cellular synthesis of PC or its packaging into lamellar bodies was unaltered by brefeldin A, suggesting that the Golgi was not involved in PC packaging. Although methylamine also increased surfactant secretion, the inhibition of PC packaging in lamellar bodies seems unrelated to the secretagogue effect, (1) on the basis of metabolic consequences of increased secretion and (2) because ATP, another secretagogue, did not inhibit PC packaging. Methylamine seems to inhibit PC packaging by inhibiting trafficking of PC to lipid-rich light subcellular fractions. Together our results suggest that the trafficking of surfactant <b>PC</b> into lamellar <b>bodies</b> might be sensitive to changes in the pH of lamellar bodies...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, {{automated}} customization {{is considered}} as a promising way of improving garment fit. This research addressed the commercial systems that use 3 D body measurements to generate custom fit patterns by applying automated alterations to a graded pattern. The goal {{of this study was}} to test whether improved customization could occur if the process is started from base patterns that are balanced and corrected for each customer's figure type and posture. Data collection and analysis intertwined in this multi-step project which consists of (stage 1) statistical analysis for lower body shape categorization based on 2, 981 women aged 18 to 35 from SizeUSA data, identifying three distinct shape groups, (stage 2) development of basic block pants patterns in each body shape by fitting three representative women in each of the three shape groups, and (stage 3) validation of the use of the basic block patterns for different shape groups in a custom fit process by comparing the fit of two pairs of pants on 27 study participants (9 women in each group); one pair was generated from the automated custom patternmaking system using a standard base pattern, and the other pair was generated using the appropriate block pattern driven by body shape. In stage 1, five components were identified to represent distinctive shapes from the silhouette and profile views of the lower body using principal component analysis: <b>PC</b> 1 : <b>body</b> measurements that define waist to top hip silhouette, <b>PC</b> 2 : <b>body</b> measurements that define top hip to hip silhouette, <b>PC</b> 3 : <b>body</b> measurements that define buttocks prominence, z-score 1 : the drop of front abdomen depth to waist front depth, and z-score 2 : the drop of front abdomen depth to front hip depth. From cluster analysis, three body shape groups were found: group 1 (curvy shape) has the curviest silhouette between waist level and top hip level, and the most prominent abdomen among the three groups; group 2 (hip tilt shape) has the most prominent buttocks, and their lower body is tilted toward the back; group 3 (straight shape) has a non-curvy silhouette and less prominent buttocks. From 83 participants, 3 primary fit models for development of base block patterns and 9 fit testers for validation of the use of the basic block patterns in a custom fit process were selected for each group. From 83 participants, 3 fit models (one primary) were chosen for each shape group for stage 2, and 9 participants from each shape group were selected for stage 3. In stage 3 an automated custom-made system for which alterations started from the three block patterns driven by body shape was developed, and the fit of pants (type A) developed from this system was compared with the fit of pants (type B) created from an automated custom-made system using a single block pattern. Evaluation of fit was conducted by 3 experts and by the 27 wearers. The results of experts' evaluations showed that type A provided significantly better fit at waist ease, waist placement, crotch length, and side seam placement. At abdomen ease, buttocks ease, front crotch ease, front thigh ease, and side seam location, type A was also judged to have a tendency to exhibit better fit even though the differences of the two types were not significantly different. At back crotch ease, thigh ease, and inseam length, type B had a tendency to exhibit equal or better fit, but the fit variables were not significantly different and the values of the differences were not large.

Likewise, the effect of fish size on the growth of luminous bacteria is worth studying. Shrimp (Penaeus monodon Fabricius) were stocked in concrete tanks filled with 34 ppt cartridge filtered seawater. Tanks were stocked with two sizes (16 <b>pcs,</b> average <b>body</b> weight (ABW) = 55 g and 6 pcs ABW= 250 g) of the red tilapia hybrid Oreochromis mossambicus Peters x O. niloticus Linnaeus, except for the tanks that served as the control.

Significantly lower luminous bacterial count was observed in tanks with either of the two sizes of red tilapia hybrid compared with the control, after 5 - 7 d. Bacteria isolated from the fish feces, mucus and rearing water; and the fish feces and mucus themselves demonstrated anti-V. harveyi activity. Results showed that the red tilapia hybrid could be used to control luminous bacteria at salinities as high as 34 ppt and that the size of the fish did not affect its efficiency. The ability of the red tilapia hybrid to control the growth of the luminous bacteria V. harveyi is attributed to different factors such as the mucus, the feces and the bacteria associated with tilapia culture. Bacteria associated with the fish mucus and feces also contributed to the anti-V. harveyi activity of these biological substances...|$|R

Using a reciprocal transplant experiment we tested the hypothesis of local adaptation in the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. Aphid genotypes derived from two sympatric host plants, Brassica oleracea and B. campestris, were assessed in order to measure the extent of phenotypic plasticity in morphological and life history traits in relation to the host plants. We obtained an index of phenotypic plasticity for each genotype. Morphological variation of aphids was summarized by principal components analysis. Significant effects of recipient host on morphological variation and life history traits (establishment, age at first reproduction, number of nymphs, and intrinsic growth rate) were detected. We did not detected genotype × host plant interaction; in general the genotypes developed better on B. campestris, independent of the host plant species from which they were collected. Therefore, there was no evidence to suggest local adaptation. Regarding plasticity, significant differences among genotypes in the index of plasticity were detected. Furthermore, significant selection on PC 1 (general aphid body size) on B. campestris, and on PC 1 and <b>PC</b> 2 (<b>body</b> length relative to body size) on B. oleracea was detected. The elevation of the reaction norm of PC 1 and the slope of the reaction norm for PC 2 (i. e., plasticity) were under directional selection. Thus, host plant species constitute distinct selective environments for B. brassicae. Aphid genotypes expressed different phenotypes in response to the host plant with low or nil fitness costs.

The organization of microtubules and microfilaments within neurites of PC 12 cells differentiated by exposure to nerve growth factor was examined after H 2 O 2 injury using fluorescence microscopy. Concentrations of H 2 O 2 as low as 100 [mu]M produced an initial periodic pattern of microtubule depolymerization over 3 - 4 which later progressed to complete depolymerization.

We included 43 SBRT-treated patients, and a control cohort of 20 noneSBRT-treated patients, in this retrospective study. Patients in the SBRT cohort could start ADT significantly later, and the time till castration resistance was significantly longer. Introduction: For patients with oligometastatic recurrence of prostate cancer (<b>PC),</b> stereotactic <b>body</b> {{radiation therapy}} (SBRT) represents an attractive treatment option, as it is safe without major side effects. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the impact of SBRT in delaying the start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients and Methods: Forty-three patients treated with SBRT for oligometastatic recurrence (< 5 metastases) of hormone-sensitive PC, defined with [F- 18] fluoromethylcholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography were included. As a control group, 20 patients with oligometastatic disease not treated with SBRT were identified from another hospital. Data were collected retrospectively. Results: A post-SBRT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was seen in 29 (67. 4 %) of 43 patients. Median ADT-free survival (ADT-FS) was 15. 6 months (95 % confidence interval [CI], 11. 7 - 19. 5) for the whole group, and 25. 7 months (95 % CI, 9. 0 - 42. 4) for patients with a PSA response. Seven patients were treated with a second course of SBRT because of oligometastatic disease recurrence; the ADT-FS in this group was 32. 1 months (95 % CI, 7. 8 - 56. 5). Compared with the control group, the ADT-FS from first diagnosis of metastasis was significantly longer, with 17. 3 (95 % CI, 13. 7 - 20. 9) months versus 4. 19 months (95 % CI, 0. 0 - 9. 0), P <. 001. Also, time between diagnosis of the metastasis until progression of disease during ADT use (castration resistance) was longer for the SBRT-treated patients (mean 66. 6, 95 % CI, 53. 5 - 79. 8, vs. 36. 41, 95 % CI, 26. 0 - 46. 8 months, P =. 020). There were no grade III or IV adverse events reported. Conclusion: SBRT can safely and effectively be used to postpone ADT in appropriately selected patients with oligometastatic recurrence of PC.

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and Phosphatidylserine (PS) are Phosphatidyl-phospholipids {{that are required}} for normal cellular structure and function. The participation in physical activity often challenges a variety of physiological systems; consequently, the ability to maintain normal cellular function during activity can determine sporting performance. The participation in prolonged intense exercise {{has been shown to}} reduce circulatory choline concentrations in some individuals. As choline is a pre-cursor to the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine, this finding has encouraged researchers to investigate the hypothesis that supplementation with PC (or choline salts) could enhance sporting performance. Although the available data that evaluates the effects of PC supplementation on performance are equivocal, acute oral supplementation with PC (~ 0. 2 g <b>PC</b> per kg <b>body</b> mass) has been demonstrated to improve performance in a variety of sporting activities where exercise has depleted circulatory choline concentrations. Short term oral supplementation with soy-derived PS (S-PS) has been reported to attenuate circulating cortisol concentrations, improve perceived well-being, and reduce perceived muscle soreness after exercise.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The C-terminal tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat {{domain of}} Pex 5 p {{recognises}} proteins carrying a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS 1) tripeptide in their C-terminus. Previously, structural data {{have been obtained}} from the TPR domain of Pex 5 p in both the liganded and unliganded states, indicating a conformational change taking place upon cargo protein binding. Such a conformational change {{would be expected to}} play a major role both during PTS 1 protein recognition as well as in cargo release into the peroxisomal lumen. However, little information is available on the factors that may regulate such structural changes. RESULTS: We have used a range of biophysical and computational methods to further analyse the conformational flexibility and ligand binding of Pex 5 p. A new crystal form for the human Pex 5 p C-terminal domain (Pex 5 p(C)) was obtained in the presence of Sr 2 + ions, and the structure presents a novel conformation, distinct from all previous liganded and apo crystal structures for Pex 5 p(C). The difference relates to a near-rigid body movement of two halves of the molecule, and this movement is different from that required to reach a ring-like conformation upon PTS 1 ligand binding. The bound Sr 2 + ion changes the dynamic properties of Pex 5 p(C) affecting its conformation, possibly by making the Sr 2 +-binding loop - located near the hinge region for the observed domain motions - more rigid. CONCLUSION: The current data indicate that Pex 5 p(C) is able to sample a range of conformational states in the absence of bound PTS 1 ligand. The domain movements between various apo conformations are distinct from those involved in ligand binding, although the differences between all observed conformations so far can be characterised by the movement of the two halves of Pex 5 <b>p(C)</b> as near-rigid <b>bodies</b> with respect to each other...|$|R
40|$|The two {{principal}} antibody classes present in saliva are secretory IgA (SIgA) and IgG; {{the former is}} produced as dimeric IgA by local plasma cells (PCs) in the stroma of salivary glands and is transported through secretory epithelia by the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), also named membrane secretory component (SC). Most IgG in saliva {{is derived from the}} blood circulation by passive leakage mainly via gingival crevicular epithelium, although some may be locally produced in the gingiva or salivary glands. Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) do not contribute equally to the pool of memory/effector B cells differentiating to mucosal <b>PCs</b> throughout the <b>body.</b> Thus, enteric immunostimulation {{may not be the best}} way to activate the production of salivary IgA antibodies although the level of specific SIgA in saliva may still reflect an intestinal immune response after enteric immunization. It remains unknown whether the IgA response in submandibular/sublingual glands is better related to B-cell induction in GALT than the parotid response. Such disparity is suggested by the levels of IgA in submandibular secretions of AIDS patients, paralleling their highly upregulated intestinal IgA system, while the parotid IgA level is decreased. Parotid SIgA could more consistently be linked to immune induction in palatine tonsils/adenoids (human NALT) and cervical lymph nodes, as supported by the homing molecule profile observed after immune induction at these sites. Several other variables influence the levels of antibodies in salivary secretions. These include difficulties with reproducibility and standardization of immunoassays, the impact of flow rate, acute or chronic stress, protein loss during sample handling, and uncontrolled admixture of serum-derived IgG and monomeric IgA. Despite these problems, saliva is an easily accessible biological fluid with interesting scientific and clinical potentials...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{heritability}} of 11 traits in a mixed-longitudinal sample of Indian siblings, and to determine whether heritability estimates vary during the growth period and whether they are influenced by sex. The sample consisted of 245 brothers and 213 sisters from 138 nuclear families living in a semi-urban area in Kolkata, India. The age ranged between 5 and 19 years. The traits were standardised for age and sex using standard deviation scores (SDS) produced by the LMS method (Cole, T. J. 1988. Fitting smoothed centile curves to reference data. J. R. Stat. Soc. A 151, 385 - 418). The standard deviation scores were analysed by PCA. The two factors with eigenvalues above 1 explained 77. 3 % of the variance; they showed a high level of pleiotropism present among the studied traits and represented <b>body</b> lengths (<b>PC</b> 1) and <b>body</b> weight and breadths (PC 2). The heritability between all types of siblings (irrespective of sex) for the PC 1 and PC 2 was estimated. The heritability between various pairs of siblings showed variations along the whole ontogenetic period studied. During the childhood and pre-pubertal period, heritability between brothers, brother-sister pairs and any sibling pairs was mostly constant, with small and non-significant variations. All the pairs showed the lowest degree of heritability during puberty for PC 1 but not for PC 2, with significant changes of heritability estimates between adolescence and adulthood, in most of the analysed sibling pairs and in both PC factors. The highest heritability was generally observed at the end of the examined growth period in all pairs. A significant effect of sex on heritability was only detected for PC 2 at 11 years of age. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to lower body core {{temperature}} prior to a simulated portion of a triathlon (swim- 15 min; bike- 45 min) and examine whether precooling could attenuate thermal strain and increase subjective exercise tolerance in the heat. Six endurance trained triathletes (mean ± SE, 28 ± 2 yr, 8. 2 ± 1. 7 % body fat) completed two randomly-assigned trials, one week apart. The precooling trial (<b>PC)</b> involved lowering <b>body</b> core temperature (- 0. 5 °C) in water prior to swimming and cycling. The control trial (CON) was identical except no precooling was performed. Water temperature and environmental conditions were maintained at - 25. 6 °C and - 26. 6 °C/ 60 % RH respectively, throughout all testing. Mean time to precool was 31 : 37 ± 8 : 03 and average time to reach baseline temperature during cycling was 9 : 35 ± 7 : 60. Oxygen consumption (VO 2), heart rate (HR), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), thermal sensation (TS), and skin (Tsk) and core (Ta) temperatures were recorded following the swim segment and throughout cycling. No significant differences in mean body (TO or Tsk were noted between PC and CON, but a significant difference (P< 0. 05) in T, between treatments was noted through the early phases of cycling. No significant differences were reported in HR, V 02, RPE, TS or sweat rate (SR) between treatments. Body heat storage (S) was negative following swimming in both PC (92 ± 6 W/m 2) and CON (66 ± 9 W/m 2). A greater increase in S occurred in PC (109 ± 6 W/m 2) vs. CON (79 ± 4 W/m 2) during cycling (P< 0. 05). Precooling attenuated the rise in T,, but this effect was transient. Based on the results from this study, precooling is not recommended prior to endurance exercise in the heat. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Adolescents {{with low}} motor {{competence}} have diminished {{perceptions of their}} physical self. Consequently they tend to avoid activities that develop physical fitness and strength. This study of adolescents with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) examined the outcomes of an exercise intervention that focused on improving aerobic fitness, strength, and self-perceptions in the physical domain. We predicted positive changes in fitness as well as perceptions of physical self worth in sub domains targeted by the intervention. Methods: The sample of 35 adolescents with DCD, comprising boys (n = 25) and girls (n = 10) {{ranging in age from}} 13 to 17 years, participated in the twice weekly 13 week exercise intervention study (AMP it up). To be included in the intervention, participants needed a score below 1 SD of the mean Neuromuscular Developmental Index (MAND; McCarron, 1997) and /or a history of movement difficulties. Physical self-perceptions were measured before and after the intervention using the Physical Self Perception Profile (PSSP) (Fox 2 ̆ 6 Corbin, 1990) comprising five 6 item subscales. Four of these (sports competence (SC), physical conditioning (<b>PC),</b> attractiveness of <b>body</b> (AB), and physical strength (PS)) assess perceptions within specific sub domains. A fifth subscale measures global physical self –worth (PSW), that reflects feelings of satisfaction with the physical self. Participants also completed the Perceived Importance Profile which consists of four 2 item subscales that measure level of importance attached to each domain of PSW. Results AB and PS sub domain scores were the best predictors of PSW at pre-test (F= 22. 915, p Conclusion The observed improvements in specific subdomains of physical self-worth were directly related to the focus of the intervention. That is participants showed increases in perceptions of physical condition (PC), and physical strength (PS) as well as actual improvements in fitness and strength. This is consistent with the view that changes in specific aspects of PSW can be facilitated by interventions that focus on related areas of fitness, and that these can occur after {{a relatively short period of}} time. These results highlight the importance of appropriate programs for adolescents with DCD when positive attitudes towards exercise are encouraged...|$|R
40|$|Protein C (PC) is an {{important}} anticoagulant, antithrombotic, and antiinflammatory in blood plasma. PC deficiency can lead to severe venous thrombotic events, including lung embolism, stroke, and heart attack. In the <b>body,</b> <b>PC</b> is activated only when it is needed, and, therefore, PC does not cause bleeding problems that currently available anticoagulants may do. Purification of PC from plasma is currently done by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), which is very expensive. Single chain variable regions (mini-Mab) with a PC binding capability, which can be produced in recombinant E. coli, were developed for PC purification. Compared to Mabs, mini-Mabs are easier to control the contamination during the production, with lower production cost, and easier to scale-up the process. In this Ph. D. research, the effect of media conditions on the PC mini-Mab production, the mini-Mab purification yield from the production media, and the PC purification performance of the mini-Mab from Cohn Fraction IV- 1 (an inexpensive PC source) were studied. The optimum conditions for mini-Mab production medium were determined to be 0. 1 % glucose, 0. 1 mM IPTG, initial pH 5. 5 ~ 6. 0, 23 ~ 30 °C of media temperature during the production, and 18 hours of mini-Mab production time. The final mini-Mab production level became 450 mg/L. Mini-Mab in the production medium broth was purified using protein A affinity chromatography. A purification yield of 34 % was obtained using the elution pH of 3. 0. For PC purification using the PC mini-Mab, among four commercially available affinity chromatography matrices, NHS Sepharose showed the best performance. The PC mini-Mab immobilized NHS Sepharose, when Cohn Fraction IV- 1 is used as the source material, showed a PC purification yield of 16 %. High human serum albumin (HAS) content in the source material was found to reduce PC purification yield significantly. Therefore, anion exchange chromatography (DEAE) {{was used for the}} pretreatment of the Cohn Fraction IV- 1 before the affinity chromatography. DEAE chromatography removed over 99 % of the human serum albumin from Cohn Fraction IV-l. The PC purification yield from the eluate of DEAE chromatography of Cohn Fraction IV- 1 was approximately 25 %, increasing by approximately 10 %. PC production cost using the mini-Mab immobilized NHS-Sepharose matrix was estimated to be approximately 100 times cheaper than that using regular Mab...|$|R

A total of 480 birds were randomly assigned to four treatments with 6 replicate pens. The positive control (PC) diet was a typical industry diet with traditional 21 -day diet phase changes, and was formulated on a crude protein and total amino acid basis. The experimental diets were formulated using ideal protein ratios on a digestible amino acid basis. Amino acid, metabolizable energy and phosphorus requirements were modeled for the experimental rations, and a set of 147 diets were formulated to represent daily nutritional requirements. The ideal protein negative control (IPNC) treatment was based on traditional 21 -day diet phase changes. Two additional treatments (Ideal Protein Diet Change 1 (IPDC 1) and Ideal Protein Diet Change 2 (IPDC 2)) changed diets at varying intervals based on the price of the diets. At the conclusion of the trial, it was determined that changing diet intervals did not work well as the IPDC 1 and IPDC 2 treatments resulted in significantly reduced body weight gain (P < 0. 05), and would not result in cost savings. The IPNC treatment was most cost effective, and resulted in the lowest cost per unit of gain with a savings of 4. 5 cents/pound of body weight gain over the traditional <b>PC</b> diet.

40|$|Introduction Rhenium- 186 (t 1 / 2 = 3. 72 d) is very {{attractive}} {{for use as}} a theranostic agent in targeted radionuclide therapy (Eβ max = 1. 072 MeV (> 76. 6 %); Eγ = 137. 2 keV) 1. Previously published investigations of high specific activity 186 Re production have utilized the 186 W(p,n) 186 Re or 186 W(d, 2 n) 186 Re reactions 2 - 5. Our group is interested in the refinement and scale-up of the production of high specific activity 186 Re by cyclotron irradiations of 186 W with deuterons; including investigations of the most suitable target material. WO 3 has been successfully used as a target material in proton irradiations by two other groups 4, 5. Further, the physical properties of WO 3, such as the reported monoclinic with <b>Pc</b> space group, <b>body</b> centered cubic crystal structure 6 and melting point of 1473 °C, made for an attractive target material as sintered and other more structurally robust pressed pellet target preparations could be explored. Thus, this study reports on the characterization and suitability of WO 3 as a full-thickness target material for the deuteron production of 186 Re. Materials and Methods Assessments of WO 3 for target material suitability and structural integrity were made on thick targets (~ 1 g) prepared using both commercially available and converted WO 3 by either uniaxially pressing (13. 8 MPa) of powdered WO 3 into an aluminum target support or by placing sintered WO 3 pellets (1105 °C for 12 hours) into an aluminum target support. In some experiments, WO 3 pellets were prepared by dissolution of Wmetal with H 2 O 2, then treatment with 1. 5 M HCl. The recovered hydrated WO 3 was calcinated at 800 °C for 4 hours, allowed to cool to ambient temperature, pulverized with a mortar and pestle, uniaxially pressed at 13. 8 MPa into pellets with a 13 mm die, and subsequently sintered in a tube furnace under flowing Ar at 1105 °C for 3, 6, and 12 hours. Material characterization and product composition analyses were conducted with SEM, EDS, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and visible photoluminescence spectroscopy. Thick WO 3 targets were irradiated for 10 min at 10 µA with nominal extracted deuteron energies of 17 MeV. Gamma-ray spectroscopy was per-formed to assess production yields and radionuclidic byproducts at least 24 hours post EOB. Results While the color of the commercially available WO 3 is slightly different (dull, pale green) than the brighter more yellow color of the chemically processed WO 3, X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD) indicated the two samples were virtually identical. Attempts to determine how the duration of the sintering process (at 1105 °C) affects the chemical/physical nature of the pellet yielded surprising results. In contrast to the characteristic annealed appearance of sintered material, grains of the WO 3 sample appeared more densely packed, but not sintered to one another as had been seen during higher temperature (1550 °C) reductions of WO 3 irrespective of the time interval used. Full-thickness pressed or sintered pellets of WO 3 were found to disintegrate upon irradiation with the deuteron beam, allowing for the direct irradiation of the aluminum target body producing 24 Na as a contaminant. Upon retrieval of the target support it was observed that the WO 3 had vaporized, discoloring the surface of the well in the target support and coating the walls of ~ 61 cm (24 inches) of the terminal portion of the beamline, which then required decontamination. We believe that these observations are the result of outgassing oxygen species that subsequently reacted with the aluminum target support. While these findings are in sharp contrast with the successful production yields and isolations previously reported by both Shigeta et al. and Fassbender et al., we believe that these differences are attributable to differences in target design (previous studies utilized an en-closed target with cooling in front of and behind the target) necessitated by the configuration of our target station. Conclusions. The physical properties of powdered WO 3, including its lower melting point and more suitable compressibility than powdered Wmetal, seemed to enhance the structural integrity of a WO 3 pellet (whether pressed or sintered). However, when compared to our recent successes with the use of Wmetal based targets, the disappointing degradation of our WO 3 targets when irradiated with the incident deuteron beam has led us to believe that Wmetal is the more viable target material for 186 Re production in our facility...|$|R
