40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} choice {{as it applies to}} long-term unemployed and vulnerable individuals. It argues that the combination of poor employment opportunities, requirements, compulsions and sanctions has not merely reduced available choice for individuals with multiple barriers to re-/join the labour market but has also resulted in curtailed decision-making abilities {{when it comes to their}} pathways into employment. The outcomes can include <b>protective</b> <b>resistance</b> as a response to the extent of regulation, which may undermine engagement in job search and related activities. Despite attempts by benevolent staff in a charity to provide support and enhance capabilities that result in the overcoming of <b>protective</b> <b>resistance,</b> they operate within a broader institutional framework of choice as set by government policy.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the protective role of Ocimum sanctum (O. sanctum) leaves against Salmonella typhimurium(S. typhimurium) infection in rats by inducing TNF-α, IFN-γ& IL- 2 cytokines. MethodsWistar albino rats were fed with aqueous extract of O. sanctum leaves using 250 mg/kg body weight dose {{once a day}} for 20 consecutive days. Control rats were fed with placebo. Rats were infected with LD 50 dose of S. typhimurium infection and monitored for their survival. Bacterial blood burden in both the groups was compared and numbers of activated peritoneal macrophages were counted. Concentration of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL- 2 cytokines in serum during different time intervals was assayed by sandwich ELISA. ResultsRats of control group showed a high mortality rate and had higher bacterial blood burden when compared with O. sanctum extract fed rats. There was {{a significant increase in}} the number of S. typhimurium engulfed peritoneal macrophages in the peritoneal fluid of O. sanctum fed animals. The protective control against bacterial infection in O. sanctum fed rats was associated with elevated level of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL- 2 cytokines in serum. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that orally administered O. sanctum leaves extract effectively enhanced activation in macrophage and lymphocytes, depicted by the elevated serum concentration of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL- 2 cytokines, leading to induce a <b>protective</b> <b>resistance</b> against Salmonella typhimurium infection...|$|E

The relative significance of susceptibility and exposure generating the observed pattern was tested using experimental infections. We examined, whether rainbow trout developed <b>protective</b> <b>resistance</b> mechanisms against the louse following a challenge infection {{and if there was}} variation between individual trout in their susceptibility to A. coregoni metanauplii. Fish were exposed to 20 A. coregoni for 5, 25, 50, 85 or 120 min and the numbers attaching recorded. Three weeks later, developing argulids were removed and the experiment repeated with a standardized exposure of 20 metanauplii. Prior exposure of fish with A. coregoni did not reduce the total infection intensity compared to naïve fish, but fish gained infection more rapidly. We suggest that there is no protective acquired resistance of pre-exposed rainbow trout to subsequent Argulus exposure. The possibility that an immunosuppressive mechanism by argulids was acting enabling the higher attachment rate could be refuted since control individuals, not previously exposed to lice, gained the infection at a similar rate as the fish challenged twice. Our results do not indicate clear differences in susceptibility among individual fish but the transmission of metanauplii on fish seemed to be opportunistic and non-selective. Our results support the view that variation in exposure time, rather than differences in susceptibility of individual hosts, might be the key factor in generating the aggregated distribution of Argulus on their hosts...|$|E

Experimentally, we have used the intraperitoneal injection as the standard method of administering ILK to neonatal poultry. However, this method is neither easy, practical, nor economical for the poultry industry. In the present study, we evaluated the effectiveness of oral (p. o.), intranasal (i. n.), and subcutaneous (s. c.) administration of ILK for ease of delivery, induction of <b>protective</b> <b>resistance</b> against Salmonella enteritidis (Se) organ invasion, {{and the ability to}} activate peripheral blood heterophils in day-old chickens. In the first experiments, delivery of ILK p. o., i. n., and s. c. significantly (P < 0. 01) increased the resistance of day-old chickens to Se organ invasion. The level of protection was equivalent to that induced by the i. p. route. Administration of a comparable protein control (bovine serum albumin, BSA) by the 3 routes induced no protective effect against Se organ invasion. Likewise, a significant increase was found in the number of circulating heterophils within 4 h of administration of the ILK by all routes. In the 2 nd experiment, the function of the heterophils from ILK-treated birds was compared with that of the control cells in adherence, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis assays. The heterophils from birds given ILK i. p., s. c., p. o., or i. n. had significantly (P < 0. 01) increased functional activities when compared to the activities of the heterophils from the control birds. These studies indicate that the delivery of ILK either orally or parenterally, routes which can be used by the poultry industry, can confer protection to chickens against a localized enteric Se organ invasion by potentiating the systemic heterophilic innate response...|$|E

Two types of priapism have been described, the more common is the ischemic, low blood flow, veno-occlusive type in which inadequate venous out flow creates an acidotic hypoxic environment leading to a painful prolonged erection. Ischemic priapism is caused by corporeal smooth muscle relaxation precipitated by pharmacological or neurogenic factors. In addition, it could be caused by rare hematological conditions such as sickle cell anemia. The other type is less common and is a non-ischemic, a high flow priapism.

40|$|Pramanicin (PMC) is an {{antifungal}} agent that was previously demonstrated to exhibit antiangiogenic and anticancer properties {{in a few}} in vitro studies. We initially screened a number of PMC analogs for their cytotoxic effects on HCT 116 human colon cancer cells. PMC-A, the analog with the most potent antiproliferative effect was chosen to further interrogate the underlying mechanism of action. PMC-A led to apoptosis through activation of caspase- 9 and - 3. The apoptotic nature of cell death was confirmed by abrogation of cell death with pretreatment with specific caspase inhibitors. Stress-related MAPKs JNK and p 38 were both activated concomittantly with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of p 38 proved to attenuate the cell death induction while pretreatment with JNK inhibitor did not exhibit a <b>protective</b> effect. <b>Resistance</b> of Bax -/- cells and the protective nature of caspase- 9 inhibition indicate that mitochondria {{play a central role}} in PMC-A induced apoptosis. Early post-exposure elevation of cellular Bim and Bax was followed by a marginal Bcl- 2 depletion and Bid cleavage. Further analysis revealed that Bcl- 2 downregulation occurs at the mRNA level and is critical to mediate PMC-A induced apoptosis, as ectopic Bcl- 2 expression substantially spared the cells from death. Conversely, forced expression of Bim proved to significantly increase cell death. In addition, analyses of p 53 -/- cells demonstrated that Bcl- 2 /Bim/Bax modulation and MAPK activations take place independently of p 53 expression. Taken together, p 53 -independent transcriptional Bcl- 2 downregulation and p 38 signaling appear to be the key modulatory events in PMC-A induced apoptosis...|$|R
50|$|Incidence of Insulin {{resistance}} is lowered with diets higher in monounsaturated fats (especially oleic acid), while {{the opposite is}} true for diets high in polyunsaturated fats (especially large amounts of arachidonic acid) as well as saturated fats (such as arachidic acid). These ratios can be indexed in the phospholipids of human skeletal muscle and in other tissues as well. This relationship between dietary fats and insulin {{resistance is}} presumed secondary to the relationship between insulin resistance and inflammation, which is partially modulated by dietary fat ratios (Omega-3/6/9) with both omega 3 and 9 thought to be anti-inflammatory, and omega 6 pro-inflammatory (as well as by numerous other dietary components, particularly polyphenols and exercise, with both of these anti-inflammatory). Although both pro- and anti-inflammatory types of fat are biologically necessary, fat dietary ratios in most US diets are skewed towards Omega 6, with subsequent disinhibition of inflammation and potentiation of insulin resistance. But this is contrary to the suggestion of more recent studies, in which polyunsaturated fats are shown as <b>protective</b> against insulin <b>resistance.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fatty liver, {{oxidative}} stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction are key pathophysiological {{features of}} insulin resistance and obesity. Butyrate, produced by fermentation {{in the large}} intestine by gut microbiota, and its synthetic derivative, the N-(1 -carbamoyl- 2 -phenyl-ethyl) butyramide, FBA, have been demonstrated to be <b>protective</b> against insulin <b>resistance</b> and fatty liver. Here, hepatic mitochondria were identified as the main target of the beneficial effect of both butyrate-based compounds in reverting insulin resistance and fat accumulation in diet-induced obese mice. In particular, butyrate and FBA improved respiratory capacity and fatty acid oxidation, activated the AMPK-acetyl-CoA carboxylase pathway, and promoted inefficient metabolism, {{as shown by the}} increase in proton leak. Both treatments consistently increased utilization of substrates, especially fatty acids, leading to the reduction of intracellular lipid accumulation and oxidative stress. Finally, the shift of the mitochondrial dynamic toward fusion by butyrate and FBA resulted in the improvement not only of mitochondrial cell energy metabolism but also of glucose homeostasis. In conclusion, butyrate and its more palatable synthetic derivative, FBA, modulating mitochondrial function, efficiency, and dynamics, can be considered a new therapeutic strategy to counteract obesity and insulin resistance...|$|R

In addition, parasitizing macrophages with L. major markedly increased {{the ability of}} the cells to produce TNF. Finally, when mice were vaccinated with an avirulent form of L. major, the animals produced large amounts of TNF but no gamma interferon in response to infection with virulent L. major. Treating these mice with a neutralizing anti-TNF antibody led to partial but not complete inhibition of the resistant state, which suggests that factors other than TNF and gamma interferon contribute to resistance to L. major.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome may have {{its origins in}} thriftiness, insulin resistance {{and one of the}} most ancient of all signalling systems, redox. Thriftiness results from an evolutionarily-driven propensity to minimise energy expenditure. This has to be balanced with the need to resist the oxidative stress from cellular signalling and pathogen resistance, giving rise to something we call 'redox-thriftiness'. This is based on the notion that mitochondria may be able to both amplify membrane-derived redox growth signals as well as negatively regulate them, resulting in an increased ATP/ROS ratio. We suggest that 'redox-thriftiness' leads to insulin resistance, which has the effect of both protecting the individual cell from excessive growth/inflammatory stress, while ensuring energy is channelled to the brain, the immune system, and for storage. We also suggest that fine tuning of redox-thriftiness is achieved by hormetic (mild stress) signals that stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and resistance to oxidative stress, which improves metabolic flexibility. However, in a non-hormetic environment with excessive calories, the protective nature of this system may lead to escalating insulin resistance and rising oxidative stress due to metabolic inflexibility and mitochondrial overload. Thus, the mitochondrially-associated resistance to oxidative stress (and metabolic flexibility) may determine insulin resistance. Genetically and environmentally determined mitochondrial function may define a 'tipping point' where <b>protective</b> insulin <b>resistance</b> tips over to inflammatory insulin resistance. Many hormetic factors may induce mild mitochondrial stress and biogenesis, including exercise, fasting, temperature extremes, unsaturated fats, polyphenols, alcohol, and even metformin and statins. Without hormesis, a proposed redox-thriftiness tipping point might lead to a feed forward insulin resistance cycle in the presence of excess calories. We therefore suggest that as oxidative stress determines functional longevity, a rather more descriptive term for the {{metabolic syndrome}} is the 'lifestyle-induced metabolic inflexibility and accelerated ageing syndrome'. Ultimately, thriftiness is good for us as long as we have hormetic stimuli; unfortunately, mankind is attempting to remove all hormetic (stressful) stimuli from his environment...|$|R

We hypothesized that disruption of the {{interaction of}} MM cells with their BM milieu would lead to their sensitization to therapeutic agents such as bortezomib, melphalan, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone. We report that the CXCR 4 inhibitor AMD 3100 induces disruption of the interaction of MM cells with the BM reflected by mobilization of MM cells into the circulation in vivo, with kinetics that differed from that of hematopoietic stem cells. AMD 3100 enhanced sensitivity of MM cell to multiple therapeutic agents in vitro by disrupting adhesion of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Moreover, AMD 3100 increased mobilization of MM cells to the circulation in vivo, increased the ratio of apoptotic circulating MM cells, and enhanced the tumor reduction induced by bortezomib. Mechanistically, AMD 3100 significantly inhibited Akt phosphorylation and enhanced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage {{as a result of}} bortezomib, in the presence of BMSCs in coculture.

Over the course of evolution, many resistance mechanisms against herbivory have been developed by the plants. Induced direct and indirect resistance mechanisms can manifest in plants after herbivore attack. The two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is not a pest of maize crops (Zea mays), despite being reported infesting plants that may have resistances against this herbivore. We tested the hypothesis that maize plants would be able to induce direct resistance against T. urticae after, evaluating the effect of T. urticae infestation in maize plants on the development and reproduction of conspecifics. We tested induced direct resistance performing infestation and measuring biological parameters upon a second infestation. Maize plants, 40 days after sowing, were divided into two groups: 30 not infested by T. urticae (clean plants clean) and, 30 infested by the spider mite. Infestation of maize plants by T. urticae reduced the conspecific female adult survival. However, no change in the survival of immature or reproduction was observed. These results suggest the induction of induced direct resistances in maize by T. urticae.

Although alkylresorcinols are widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, no enzyme systems for their biosynthesis are known. We report here an ars operon in A. vinelandii {{that is responsible for}} the biosynthesis of the alkylresorcinols in the cysts. The ars operon consisted of four genes, two of which encoded a type III polyketide synthase, ArsB and ArsC. In vitro experiments revealed that ArsB and ArsC, sharing 71 % amino acid sequence identity, were an alkylresorcinol synthase and an alkylpyrone synthase, respectively, indicating that ArsB and ArsC are not isozymes but enzymatically distinct polyketide synthases. In addition, ArsB and ArsC accepted several acyl-CoAs with various lengths of the side chain as a starter substrate and gave corresponding alkylresorcinols and alkylpyrones, respectively, which suggests that the mode of the ring folding is uninfluenced by the structure of the starter substrates. The importance of the alkylresorcinols for encystment was confirmed by gene inactivation experiments; the lack of alkylresorcinols synthesis caused by ars mutations resulted in the formation of severely impaired cysts, as observed by electron microscopy...|$|R

The human astrocytoma (glioblastoma) cell line U 87 MG was treated with 0. 6, 2 and 6 - 7 ŽM arsenic (equivalent to 0. 3, 1 and 3 - 3. 5 ŽM As(2) O(3)) for 12, 24 or 48 h and gene expression for different MT isoforms, namely MT 2 A, MT 1 A, MT 1 F, MT 1 X, MT 1 E and MT 3, was measured by real time qPCR using SYBR Green I and TaqmanŽ gene expression assays. TfR, 18 S rRNA, GAPDH and AB were tested as reference genes, and the last two evaluated to be appropriate in conditions of low (GAPDH) and high (AB) arsenic exposure. The gene expression of MT 3 gene was additionally tested and confirmedby restriction enzyme analysis with PvuII. In the given conditions the mRNAs of six MT isoforms were identified in human glioblastoma cell line U 87 MG. Depending on arsenic exposure conditions, an increase or decrease of MT gene expression was observed for each isoform, with the highest increase for isoforms MT 1 X, MT 1 F and MT 2 A mRNA (up to 13 -fold) and more persistent decreases for MT 1 A, MT 1 E and MT 3 mRNA. Despite the common assumption of the noninducibility of MT 3, the evident MT 3 mRNA increase was observed during highAs exposure (up to 4 -fold). In conclusion, our results clearly demonstratethe influence of As on MT isoform gene expression. The MT 1 X, MT 1 F and MT 2 A increase could represent brain tumour acquired resistance to As cytotoxicity while the MT 3 increase is more enigmatic, with its possible involvement in arsenic-related induction of type II cell death...|$|R
40|$|Background: Physical {{activity}} (PA) has {{a protective}} role in cardiovascular diseases. Aim: To quantify PA in young adults and to correlate it with cardiovascular risk factors. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed employing the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ), {{to measure the}} PA of 983 randomly selected young adults from Valparaiso region born between 1974 and 1978. Its results were associated with levels of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP- ATP III) Results: Mean physical activity among men and women was 3731 ± 3923 and 1360 ± 2303 METs-minutes/week, respectively (p < 0. 001). Fifty percent of women and 21. 5 % of men had an insuffcient level of physical activity (p < 0. 001). Sixty percent of men and 23. 4 % of women had an intense level of physical activity (p < 0. 001). There was an inverse association of physical activity and insulin resistance. A high physical activity was protective, specially among men, against a low HDL cholesterol level and high triglyceride levels with Odds Ratios of 0. 59 (confdence interval (CI) : 0, 35 - 0. 98) and 0. 49 (CI: 0, 27 - 0, 87) respectively, after adjusting for body mass index and age. Conclusions: In this sample, men had higher levels of physical activity, that was <b>protective</b> against insulin <b>resistance</b> {{and the presence of}} cardiovascular risk factors...|$|R

High speeds combined with high temperatures make tur- bomachinery sealing applications even more challenging. In order to confirm sufficient service life material pairs should be tested under conditions similar to engine oper- ating conditions. This study presents high temperature friction and wear characteristics of cobalt/nickel superal- loys, Haynes 25 (51 Co– 10 Ni– 20 Cr– 15 W), Haynes 188 (39 Co– 22 Ni– 22 Cr– 14 W), and Haynes 214 (75 Ni– 16 Cr– 3 Fe– 0. 5 Mn) sheets when rubbed against Hastelloy X (47 Ni– 22 Cr– 18 Fe– 9 Mo) pins. Tests are conducted at 25, 200, 400, and 540 °C with a validated custom design linear reciprocating tribometer. Sliding speed and sliding distance are 1 Hz and 1. 2 km, respectively. Friction coefficients are calculated with friction force data acquired from a load cell. Wear coefficients are calculated through weight loss measurements. Results indicate that Haynes 25 (H 25) has the lowest friction coefficients at all test temperatures. Above 400 °C, H 25 and Haynes 188 (H 188) exhibit the best wear <b>resistance.</b> <b>Protective</b> cobalt oxide layers are formed on the H 25 and H 188 at 540 °C in addition to nickel, chrome, and tungsten oxides. Although, it has better oxidation resistance, Haynes 214 has relatively higher wear rates than other tested materials especially at low temper- atures. However, its wear performance improves beyond 200 °C...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to the {{widespread}} belief that stress is necessarily immunosuppressive, {{recent studies have}} shown that, under certain conditions, stress can induce a significant enhancement of a skin cell-mediated immune response [delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) or contact hypersensitivity]. Adrenal stress hormones and a stress-induced trafficking of leukocytes from the blood to the skin have been identified as systemic mediators of this immunoenhancement. Because γ interferon (IFNγ) is an important cytokine mediator of DTH, the studies described here were designed to examine its role as a local mediator of the stress-induced enhancement of skin DTH. The effect of acute stress on skin DTH was examined in wild-type and IFNγ receptor-deficient (IFNγR−/−) mice that had previously been sensitized with 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene. Acutely stressed wild-type mice showed a significantly larger DTH response than nonstressed mice. In contrast, IFNγR−/− mice failed to show a stress-induced enhancement of skin DTH. Immunoneutralization of IFNγ in wild-type mice significantly reduced the stress-induced enhancement of skin DTH. In addition, an inflammatory response induced by direct IFNγ administration to the skin was significantly enhanced by acute stress. Our results suggest that IFNγ is an important local mediator of a stress-induced enhancement of skin DTH. These studies are clinically relevant because, depending {{on the nature of the}} antigen, DTH reactions mediate numerous <b>protective</b> (e. g., <b>resistance</b> to viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections) or pathological (e. g., autoimmune reactions and contact sensitivity reactions such as that to poison ivy) immune responses...|$|R
40|$|The tribo-potential of {{sugarcane}} fibre reinforcement in the thermoset polymers {{for enhancing}} the adhesive wear resistance {{has not been}} explored so far. Hence, the present work aims to explore {{the possibility of using}} this natural fibre to reinforce polyester and thus opens a new way to implement locally available inexpensive fibres and produce a new candidate tribo-material for bearing applications. Sugarcane fibre/polyester (SCRP) and glass fibre/polyester (GRP) composites (with chopped fibres of 1, 5, 10 mm length randomly distributed and unidirectional mat fibres) were prepared using compression mould and hand-lay-up techniques. Friction coefficients and wear rates of SCRP and GRP composites were determined under dry sliding contact conditions in parallel and anti-parallel orientations and subjected to different operating parameters such as load, speed and test duration. Results of friction and wear proved that SCRP composite is a promising composite which can be a competitive to GRP composite. In the case of chopped sugarcane/polyester (C-SCRP) composite, very smooth patches of polymer film (protective layer) due to plastic deformation shielded the surface of C-SCRP composite pin from damage by the metallic asperities and thereby contributed to the higher wear resistance. Furthermore, this layer provided enhancement to the bonding of SCFs fibre with matrix. In contrast C-GRP composite produced broken hard particles of GF at the interface which acted as a third body and restrained the formation of such <b>protective</b> layer. Wear <b>resistance</b> of C-SCRP composite increased significantly with increasing load but decreased drastically for C-GRP composite. In addition, wear rate of C-SCRP composite decreased by (20 - 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{is devoted to}} the {{manufacturing}} of cellular structures from perforated steel tapes, which are obtained as a waste during stamping of fine-sized details. Obtained cellular structures can be used for electromagnetic shielding solutions. The relevance of the current study can be characterized as in modern working and living environments there is an increasing need for electromagnetic shielding solutions. This need can be based on several points of view: 1) a need to protect workers from electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by working machinery, 2) a need to protect sensitive electronic devices from the surrounding EMFs, 3) minimizing health risk from EMFs in the living areas (high tension power lines, power transformers etc), 4) counter-espionage applications (preventing electronic surveillance). Besides, the recycling of metal wastes is one of the significant modern tasks of the industry. The different methods of manufacturing of protective shield from perforated materials by profiling and welding are studied. The methodology for manufacturing of lightweight and reliable (including strength and corrosion <b>resistance)</b> <b>protective</b> shield is elaborated and offered. The main directions for using of such protective shield are the following: protection from electromagnetic fields, solar radiation and noise. This study undertook shielding efficiency measurements in a controlled environment. Test materials were irradiated with various electromagnetic fields: 1) low frequency magnetic field, 2) low frequency electric field and 3) high frequency electromagnetic field. The results showed great differences in between different test samples. The best shielding factor was obtained with the samples where the electromagnetic absorbing material was thickest...|$|R
40|$|The CC {{chemokine}} receptor 5 (CCR 5) delta 32 allele {{results in}} a nonfunctional form of the chemokine receptor and has been implicated {{in a variety of}} immune-mediated diseases. CCR 5 Δ 32 may also predispose one to chronic liver disease or be linked with resistance to HBV infection. This study was undertaken to investigate any association between CCR 5 polymorphism with resistance to hepatitis B or susceptibility to HBV infection. A total of 812 Iranian individuals were enrolled into two groups: HBV infected cases (n= 357), who were HBsAg-positive, and healthy controls (n= 455). We assessed polymorphisms in the CCR 5 gene using specific CCR 5 oligonucleotide primers surrounding the breakpoint deletion. Genotype distributions of the HBV infected cases and healthy controls were determined and compared. The CCR 5 /CCR 5 (WW) and CCR 5 / CCR 5 Δ 32 (W/D) genotypes were found in (98 %) and (2 %) of HBV infected cases, respectively. The CCR 5 Δ 32 / Δ 32 genotype was not found in HBV infected cases. Genotype distributions of CCR 5 in healthy controls were W/W genotype in (87. 3 %), W/D genotype in (11. 2 %) and D/D genotype in (1. 5 %). Heterozygosity for CCR 5 / CCR 5 Δ 32 (W/D) in healthy controls was greater than in HBV infected cases (11. 2 % vs 2 %, p < 0. 001). W/D and D/D genotypes were more prominent in healthy controls than in HBV infected cases. This study provides evidence that the CCR 5 Δ 32 polymorphism may have a <b>protective</b> effect in <b>resistance</b> to HBV infection at least in the Iranian population...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} and cancer {{are the leading}} causes of death in most countries. These diseases share many common risk factors as well as pathogenetic determinants, and their incidence is related to age in an exponential manner. Furthermore, it has become apparent that several treatments used in therapy or even in prevention of cancer can impair the structural and functional integrity of the cardiovascular system, giving rise to an interdisciplinary field: cardio-oncology. However, tumors and cardiovascular diseases also share common protective factors: they can be prevented either by avoiding exposure to recognized risk factors, and/or by favoring the intake of protective compounds and by modulating the host defense machinery These latter approaches are generally known as chemoprevention. A great variety of dietary and pharmacological agents {{have been shown to}} be potentially capable of preventing cancer in preclinical models, most of which are of plant origin. Phytochemicals, in particular diet-derived compounds, have therefore been proposed and applied in clinical trials as cancer chemopreventive agents. There is now increasing evidence that some phytochemicals can be also protective for the heart, having the potential to reduce cancer, cardiovascular disease and even anticancer drug-induced cardiotoxicity. We introduce the concept that these compounds induce pre-conditioning, a low level cellular stress that induces strong <b>protective</b> mechanisms conferring <b>resistance</b> to toxins such as cancer chemotherapeutics. Cancer cells and cardiomyocytes have fundamental differences in their metabolism and sensitivity to preconditioning, autophagy and apoptosis, so that dosage of the prevention compounds is important. Here we discuss the mechanisms responsible for the cardiotoxicity of anticancer drugs, the possibility to prevent them and provide examples of diet-derived phytochemicals and other biological substances that could be exploited for protecting the cardiovascular system according to a joint cardio-oncological preventative approach...|$|R
