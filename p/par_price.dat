40|$|The {{management}} of fat {{content of the}} carcass, both subcutaneous fat and marbling, will be {{the challenge of the}} future for the cattle feeders of the U. S. The cattle feeder will have to juggle carcass weights, quality grade and yield grade {{in order to determine the}} appropriate end point for fed cattle. The input data for decisions will be the Choice-Select spread, yield grade discounts, feed costs, interest costs, cost of feeder cattle and genetic potential of the cattle in question. There is a perception among cattle feeders that, in the future, the packers will simply dictate the type of cattle they wish to kill, and it will be up to cattle feeders to hit that low-fat target. Nothing could be further from the truth. The market will get more complicated, not less complicated. The packing industry will undoubtedly set up a scale of discounts for both quality and yield grades with minimum and maximum carcass weights. It will not always be in the best interests of feeders to exactly hit those targets. Cattle feeders will feed all cattle available. Since not all cattle will readily find a home on the specification list of a packer, it will be up to feeders to manage the end point of those cattle as close to target as is economically feasible. Discounts may be a more acceptable way to go rather than using the extra feed needed to gain a <b>par</b> <b>price.</b> Those decisions will be part of the juggling act that cattle feeders will do as an extra part of their routine management. Increasing demand by foreign consumers for a higher quality product will complicate many of the management decisions. If we were moving to a product with a minimum acceptable level of quality and lowered levels of fat, the management job would not be difficult, as we would select for muscling and away from excess fat to hit our targets. The demand for higher quality will cause feeders to increase the subcutaneous fat on certain genetic types of cattle in hopes of developing a higher percentage of cattle reaching the high quality target. These cattle may receive a quality grade premium and a yield grade discount. Thus, the relative size of the premiums and discounts will have to be weighed against the increased cost of feed to create the fat...|$|E

40|$|EN] This article {{examines}} a relatively unknown 18 th century European source on Moroccan Arabic. It is the article entitled “Dialogues on the vulgar Arabick of Morocco”, published in London in 1797 by William Price (1771 – 1830), a self-taught linguist and orientalist from Worcester, England. Price’s work {{is one of}} the few European texts predating 1800 focused on Moroccan Arabic, and providing some information about this linguistic variety. As we explain, Price obtained these “Dialogues” from “some natives of Barbary”, who happened to be in London. In the first four sections of the article, we examine the life and works of William Price, we place his activities as an expert in Arabic and other of the so-called “Oriental languages” in the context of 18 th century British Orientalism, and we analyse the contents of the “Dialogues” provided in his article. These “Dialogues” consist of a conversation between two interlocutors who are taking a stroll in a walled coastal town of the Moroccan Atlantic strip. The fifth section of our contribution is a linguistic dialectological analysis of both the Arabic and Latin character transcriptions of Moroccan Arabic provided by Price. We analyse different issues concerning the transcriptions given, and we focus our linguistic study on phonological, morphological and syntactical issues.

Le travail de Price, étant un des rares textes européens en arabe marocain publié avant le XIXème siècle, nous permet d’accéder à quelques informations sur la variété linguistique dans laquelle est publiée le texte. Price obtient les «Dialogues» par le biais de “natifs de Berbérie” résidant à Londres. Dans les premières sections de notre article, on examine la vie de William Price qui était, dans le contexte de l’Orientalisme Britanique du XVIIIème siècle, un expert en arabe ainsi que dans d’autres ‘langues orientales’. Ensuite, on décrit ses travaux, puis le contenu des «Dialogues».

2500|$|These {{factors are}} likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued. The market price is {{expressed}} {{as a percentage of}} nominal value. Bonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but bond prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as [...] "Pull to Par". At other times, prices can be above <b>par</b> (bond is <b>priced</b> at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below <b>par</b> (bond is <b>priced</b> at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. Most government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the United States, or in units of £100 in the United Kingdom. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold.

Customer willingness to change behaviour in response to this information was explored through mail-back survey. The diversified demand modelling method was used along with energy audit data to estimate the potential peak load reduction resulting from the voluntary demand response. A case study was conducted in a suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand, where electricity is the main source for water and space heating. On this network, all water heating cylinders have ripple-control technology and about 50 % of the households subscribe to differential day/night pricing plan.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{real time}} information based energy management algorithms to reduce electricity cost and {{peak to average ratio}} (PAR) while preserving user comfort in a smart home. We categorize household appliances into thermostatically controlled (tc), user aware (ua), elastic (el), inelastic (iel) and regular (r) appliances/loads. An optimization problem is formulated to reduce electricity cost by determining the optimal use of household appliances. The operational schedules of these appliances are optimized {{in response to}} the electricity price signals and customer preferences to maximize electricity cost saving and user comfort while minimizing curtailed energy. Mathematical optimization models of tc appliances, i. e., air-conditioner and refrigerator, are proposed which are solved by using intelligent programmable communication thermostat (iPCT). We add extra intelligence to conventional programmable communication thermostat (CPCT) by using genetic algorithm (GA) to control tc appliances under comfort constraints. The optimization models for ua, el, and iel appliances are solved subject to electricity cost minimization and PAR reduction. Considering user comfort, el appliances are considered where users can adjust appliance waiting time to increase or decrease their comfort level. Furthermore, energy demand of r appliances is fulfilled via local supply where the major objective is to reduce the fuel cost of various generators by proper scheduling. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms efficiently schedule the energy demand of all types of appliances by considering identified constraints (i. e., <b>PAR,</b> variable <b>prices,</b> temperature, capacity limit and waiting time) ...|$|R

Would hedonic price indexing also have large effects on measured price and productivity during earlier technological breakthroughs? This paper investigates the impact of hedonic and matched model methods on historical data for electric motors in Sweden 1900 – 35. The results show that during the productivity boom of the 1920 s, current prices for electric motors decreased by 13. 2 and 12. 2 percent per year depending on whether hedonic or matched model price indexes were used. This indicates high productivity growth in the industry producing electric motors in 1920 – 29. In contrast to Sweden, the US annual total factor productivity growth was only, according to current best estimates, 3. 5 percent in Electric machinery compared to 5. 3 percent in manufacturing in 1920 – 29. However, hedonic price indexes were not used to calculate US productivity.

30|$|A {{second study}} by Druant et al. (2012) {{examines}} {{the frequency and}} character of wage and price increases and their interrelation. (Recall {{that the degree of}} wage and price rigidity determines the speed of adjustment of the economy to macroeconomic shocks and with it the scale of the adjustment costs.) The authors’ examination of the speed with which firms change prices and wages indicates that the frequency of the latter is roughly one half that of the former—although both “series” display considerable time dependence. The overall stickiness of wages thus exceeds that of prices. The frequency of wage adjustment evinces lower dispersion across sectors, and higher dispersion across countries, than does the frequency of price adjustment. Coupled with widespread wage indexation, the implication of price and wage rigidity is real wage rigidity, which makes the adjustment of the economy to aggregate shocks more costly. The authors’ cet. <b>par.</b> analysis of <b>price</b> and wage rigidity at the firm level indicates that prices are more flexible where competitive pressures in product markets are strong and where labor costs account for a smaller fraction of total costs. Wages are more flexible where bargaining is decentralized (being conducted at the firm level as opposed to the national/sectoral/regional level) and where the coverage of collective bargaining and the stringency of employment protection legislation are low. Finally, descriptive evidence is provided (e.g., on the comparable frequency of wage and price changes and the synchronization between the timing of wage and price changes) showing that wages and prices feed into each other at the firm level and that wage and price rigidity are interrelated especially in labor-intensive sectors.|$|R

40|$|Peak {{demand is}} an issue in power supply system when demand exceeds the {{available}} capacity. Continuous growth in peak demand {{increases the risk of}} power failures, and increases the marginal cost of supply. The contribution of the residential sector to the system peak is quite substantial and has been a subject of discussion internationally. For example, a study done in New Zealand in 2007 attributed about half of system peak load to the residential sector. International research has attributed a significant influence of human behaviour on households energy use. “Demand Response” is a demand side management tool aimed at achieving peak energy demand reduction by eliciting behaviour change. It encompasses energy needs analysis, information provision to customers, behaviour induction, smart metering, and new signalling and feedback concepts. Demand response is far advanced in the industrial and commercial demand sectors. In the residential sector, information barriers and a lack of proper understanding of consumers’ behaviour have impeded the development of effective response strategies and new enabling technologies in the sector. To date, efforts to understanding residential sector behaviour for the purpose of peak demand analysis has been based on pricing mechanism. However, not much is known about the significance of other factors in influencing household customers’ peak electricity demand behaviour. There is a tremendous amount of data that can be analyzed and fed back to the user to influence behaviour. These may include information about energy shortages, supply security and environmental concerns during the peak hours. This research is intended {{to begin the process of}} understanding the importance of some of these factors in the arena of peak energy consumption behaviour. Using stated preference survey and focus group discussions, information about household customers’ energy use activities during winter morning and evening peak hours was collected. Data about how customers would modify their usage behaviour when they receive enhanced supply constraint information was also collected. The thesis further explores households’ customer demand response motivation with respect to three factors: cost (price), environment (CO 2 -intensity) and security (risk of black-outs). Householders were first informed about the relationship between these factors and peak demand. Their responses were analyzed as multi-mode motivation to energy use behaviour change. Overall, the findings suggest that, household customers would be willing to reduce their peak electricity demand when they are given clear and enhanced information. In terms of motivation to reduce demand the results show customers response to the security factor to be on <b>par</b> with the <b>price</b> factor. The Environmental factor also produced a strong response; nearly two-thirds of that of price or security. A generic modelling methodology was developed to estimate the impact of households’ activity demand response on the load curve of the utility using a combination of published literature reviews and resources, and own research work. This modelling methodology was applied in a case study in Halswell, a small neighbourhood in Christchurch, New Zealand, with approximately 400 households. The results show that a program to develop the necessary technology and provide credible information and understandable signals about risks and consequences of peak demand could provide up to about 13 % voluntary demand reduction during the morning peak hours and 8 % during the evening peak hours...|$|R
