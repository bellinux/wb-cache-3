5|$|Christian Lee Novetzke of the University of Washington {{suggests}} that Vithoba's worship migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur {{some time before}} 1000CE; but under the possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping Mahanubhava sect, the town {{was transformed into a}} Vaishnava center of pilgrimage. This <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> consistent with contemporary remnants of Shaiva worship in the town.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Conroy delayed {{implementing}} the plan pending a 12-month review into how refused classification content was rated. The <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> {{not expected to}} go forward due to the opposition from The Coalition and the Greens. Internet service providers Telstra and Optus have both agreed to voluntarily block some content.|$|E
5|$|Microfossils {{dating from}} – just 3million {{years after the}} end of the Cryogenian glaciations– may {{represent}} embryonic 'resting stages' in the life cycle of the earliest known animals. An alternative <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> that these structures represent adult stages of the multicellular organisms of this period.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> made. The first project <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> not {{approved}} (2005) and the second, modified <b>proposal,</b> <b>was</b> approved (2006).|$|R
50|$|A similar <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{made in the}} Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013, {{but that}} <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> not {{submitted}} to a referendum.|$|R
50|$|Under the Commonwealth, <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> {{advanced}} for {{the establishment}} of an expanded, Polish-Lithuanian-Muscovite or Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian, Commonwealth. These <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> never implemented.|$|R
5|$|The {{definition}} of the kelvin will undergo a fundamental change if the <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> accepted. Rather than using the triple point of water to fix the temperature scale the proposal recommends that the energy equivalent as given by Boltzmann's equation be used.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, the Czech {{air force}} {{commander}} General Libor Štefánik proposed leasing a further six Gripens due to Russia's deteriorating {{relationship with the}} West. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, this <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> just a personal vision {{of the air force}} commander. The fleet expansion is not on the agenda for years to come. More recently, the air force decided to upgrade its fleet to the MS20 configuration.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E
5000|$|Twenty <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> submitted. On 27 May 2008, {{the anniversary}} of the Operation Anthropoid, a <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> chosen. The authors of the winning <b>proposal</b> <b>were</b> artists David Moješčík and Michal Šmeral, and architects Miroslava Tůmová and Jiří Gulbis. Moješčík and Šmeral had {{previously}} collaborated on various projects in connection with [...] "public art".|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the archaea evolved from gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic selection pressure. This {{is suggested by the}} observation that archaea are resistant {{to a wide variety of}} antibiotics that are primarily produced by gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics primarily act on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria. The <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics' target genes, and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present-day Archaea. The evolution of Archaea in response to antibiotic selection, or any other competitive selective pressure, could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperature or acidity) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic-producing organisms; Cavalier-Smith has made a similar suggestion. This <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that gram-positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Proposal</b> <b>is</b> a 2009 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Anne Fletcher and written by Peter Chiarelli. The film stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds with Betty White, Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson. The plot {{centers on a}} Canadian executive who learns that she may face deportation from the U.S. because of her expired visa. Determined to retain her position as {{editor in chief of}} a publishing house, she convinces her assistant to temporarily act as her fiancé.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for modifying the alphabet or the chart is to propose {{the change in}} the Journal of the IPA. (See, for example, August 2008 on a open central vowel and August 2011 on central approximants.) Reactions to the proposal may be published in the same or subsequent issues of the Journal (as in August 2009 on the open central vowel). A formal <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> then put to the Council of the IPA – which is elected by the membership – for further discussion and a formal vote.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1887, no {{alternative}} site had become available and the original <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> renewed. There were slight amendments made to the proposals, but again the <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> rejected.|$|R
5000|$|These <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> greatly {{controversial}} (especially in Rutland, {{which put}} forth a counter-suggestions to add surrounding areas to Rutland instead from surrounding counties) and the final <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> watered down somewhat ...|$|R
50|$|Republic P-44 Rocket (1941) {{single-engine}} single-seat propeller fighter aircraft. The <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> for a P-43-based fighter {{with larger}} engine. The <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> rejected (no prototype built) {{in favor of}} the P-47 Thunderbolt.|$|R
5|$|In the Lillehammer {{bid for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics, the {{agreement}} between Lillehammer Municipality and the state specified that the municipality was responsible for financing all necessary sports venues. However, after the games were awarded the responsibility {{was taken over by}} Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) and the town's five venues were ultimately funded through state grants. To allow for post-Olympic use, a fund was created by the state, of which Lillehammer Olympiapark received 146 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Unlike the Hamar venues, which survive on their fund's yield, the Lillehammer venues have used up their capital. From 2014 the post-Olympic use fund will be depleted and alternative organization and funding is being looked into. A leading <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> that the bobsleigh and luge track be taken over by the state, while the remaining venues be retained by the company and jointly funded by the municipality and Oppland County Municipality.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2001, the Federal Transit Administration {{approved}} {{the start of}} preliminary engineering on a full-length Second Avenue Subway. The MTA's final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was approved in April 2004; this latest <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> for a two-track line from 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in Harlem, down Second Avenue to Hanover Square in the Financial District. The final plan called for the full-length Second Avenue line to carry two services: the T, with a route emblem colored , {{as well as a}} rerouted Q train. Phase 1 rerouted the Q, the Broadway Express via the BMT 63rd Street Line and north along Second Avenue, to the Upper East Side at 96th Street. Phase 2 will extend the rerouted Q train to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. In Phase Three, the new T train will run from 125th Street to Houston Street. The final phase will extend T train service from Houston Street to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of the residential towers that {{had served as}} the Barksdale organization's prime territory pushes their dealers back out onto the streets of Baltimore. Stringer Bell continues his reform of the organization by cooperating with other drug lords, sharing with one another territory, product and profits. Stringer's <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> met with a curt refusal from Marlo Stanfield, leader of a new, growing crew. Against Stringer's advice, Avon decides to take Marlo's territory by force and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths. Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible. Working with his new boyfriend Dante and two women, he is once more a serious problem. The violence related to the drug trade makes it an obvious choice of investigation for Cedric Daniels' permanently established Major Crimes Unit.|$|E
5000|$|Awards {{were given}} in two rounds. In {{the first round}} which dealt only with the Conceptualization track, for which full <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> due on July 26, 2012, three DIBBs <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> awarded: ...|$|R
50|$|Another <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{known as}} the Birch Spur Incline. This would have {{involved}} the line continuing from Summit to Birch Spur from where a rope-worked incline would convey traffic to the valley floor where the railway would continue through a narrow valley to the Wairarapa plains. The Public Works Department engineers investigating this <b>proposal</b> <b>were</b> unable to locate a suitable incline, so this <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> also abandoned.|$|R
50|$|While this <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{approved}} by Pershing, it met some resistance when {{it reached the}} Secretary of War. With an initial price tag of almost $800,000 just to open the field, the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> rejected by the Secretary of War on 19 May 1917. That same day the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> resubmitted with the additional argument that a facility such as the 3d AIC was critical {{to the development of}} the air forces that would accompany the A.E.F. to Europe. This time the <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> accepted and by July 1917 the first Aero Construction Squadrons began to arrive in France.|$|R
5|$|The {{existing}} draft law {{was scheduled}} to conclude {{at the end of}} June 1971, and the Senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the Vietnam War continued. The Nixon administration announced in February 1971 that it wanted a two-year extension to June 1973, after which the draft would end; Army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a two-year extension, after which an all-volunteer force would be in place. Skeptics such as Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John Stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a four-year extension, but the two-year <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> what went forward in Congress. By early May 1971, Gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation, halting conscription and thereby bringing U.S. involvement in the war to a rapid end.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The {{first and most}} common is nomination and approval through {{the chain of command}} of the service member. The second method is nomination {{by a member of the}} U.S. Congress, generally at the request of a constituent. In both cases, if the <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> outside the time limits for the recommendation, approval to waive the time limit requires a special Act of Congress. The Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of, and in the name of, the Congress. Since 1980, nearly all Medal of Honor recipients--or in the case of posthumous awards, the next of kin--have been personally decorated by the Commander-in-Chief. Since 1941, more than half of the Medals of Honor have been awarded posthumously.|$|E
5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proposals</b> <b>were</b> later {{made for}} {{additional}} {{members of the}} class WU to be built. However, the class lacked the ability to cope with post-World War II traffic, and therefore the <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> never realised.|$|R
