5000|$|If the {{oscillation}} is left unchecked, failures can result. One case {{occurred in}} the middle J-2 engine of the second stage, S-II, of the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970. In this case, the engine shut down before the oscillations could cause damage to the vehicle. [...] Later events in this mission overshadowed the pogo problem. Pogo also had been experienced in the S-IC first stage of the unmanned Apollo 6 test flight in 1968. [...] One of the Soviet Union's N1-L3 rocket test flights suffered pogo oscillations {{in the first stage}} on February 21, 1969. The launch vehicle reached initial engine cutoff, but exploded 107 seconds after liftoff and disintegrated. There are other cases during unmanned launches in the 1950s and 1960s where the <b>pogo</b> <b>effect</b> caused catastrophic launch failures.|$|E
40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} {{of the technology}} involved in integrating the Space Shuttle system. A powered flight analysis of the Shuttle is presented, touching upon the following areas: ascent profile and abort mode integration, sizing and design, control of load factor by a stage thrust shaping, structural load constraints, flight performance reserve and trajectory design for the orbital flight test. A discussion is presented of aerothermodynamics including aerodynamic and plume heating. Flight control and separation is considered with attention paid to liftoff, ascent to booster staging, elevon load relief, booster tailoff thrust mismatch and gimbal limitations and booster separation. Structural analysis and dynamics is examined, considering: vehicle loads and modes and the <b>pogo</b> <b>effect.</b> Propulsion aspects (hydraulics, the LH 2 recirculation system, the antigeyser system, the pressurization system, etc.), ground vibration tests, separation system verification and flight readiness firing are all described...|$|E
