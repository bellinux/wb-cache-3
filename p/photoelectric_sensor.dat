40|$|A part {{tracking}} system comprised of {{an array of}} <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> positioned at various angles {{with respect to a}} conveyor transporting parts such as pieces of poultry to create a field of detection. The angle arrangements of the array of <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> circumscribes the parts with lines of varying angles to approximate the part outline or closed line integral with a polygon. As a part is conveyed through the array of <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> each transition of the sensors provide a side of the polygon that circumscribes the part. From this the vertices of the polygon can be determined which allows the centroid and angle of the major axis of the part to be calculated thereby providing the coordinates for the part's location on the conveyor. The coordinates are then conveyed to a robotic controller which manipulates an end effector to grasp the part. Georgia Tech Research Corporation Office Of Technology Licensin...|$|R
40|$|A non;contact angle {{measurement}} method based on gyrorotor with periodical pattern surface is proposed. By using <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> {{to detect the}} information from periodical pattern surface of gyrorotor, we can measure the deflection angle of gyrorotor in real time. The {{angle measurement}} principle and its device are introduced. By constructing three;dimensional geometrical models, the angle decoding algorithm of the angle measurement method is derived in detail, and the curves or the surfaces {{of the relationships between}} the gyrorotor&# 39;s pattern surface information detected by <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> and the angle deflections (calculated under the conditions that the gyrorotor is without deflection, with one;dimensional deflection and with two;dimensional deflection respectively) are obtained. The results show that the deflection angle and the deflection direction of gyrorotor can be measured by two <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> in orthogonal directions, and the measurement values are unique and the measurement range of deflection angle is larger than 30 °. This method can be used to measure angle deflection both in static and high;speed dynamic measurements. © 2016, Chinese Lasers Press. All right reserved. </p...|$|R

50|$|A {{self-contained}} <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensor</b> {{contains the}} optics, {{along with the}} electronics. It requires only a power source. The sensor performs its own modulation, demodulation, amplification, and output switching. Some self-contained sensors provide such options as built-in control timers or counters. Because of technological progress, self-contained photoelectric sensors have become increasingly smaller.|$|E
50|$|AS-Interface was {{developed}} during the late 1980s and early 1990s by a group (consortium) of 11 companies mostly known for their offering of industrial non-contact sensing devices like inductive <b>sensors,</b> <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors,</b> capacitive sensors and ultrasonic sensors. Once development was completed the consortium was resolved and a member organization, AS-International, was founded.

50|$|A <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensor,</b> or photo eye, is an {{equipment}} used {{to discover the}} distance, absence, or presence of an object by using a light transmitter, often infrared, and a photoelectric receiver. They are largely used in industrial manufacturing. There are three different useful types: opposed (through beam), retro-reflective, and proximity-sensing (diffused).|$|E
5000|$|The {{detecting}} {{range of}} a <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensor</b> is its [...] "field of view", or the maximum distance from which the sensor can retrieve information, minus the minimum distance. A minimum detectable object is the smallest object the sensor can detect. More accurate sensors can often have minimum detectable objects of minuscule size.|$|E
50|$|Electric garden {{lanterns}} {{are usually}} controlled from inside a building {{by a wall}} switch, or by a <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensor</b> attached to the lamp or nearby.

5000|$|Applicators {{advance the}} label stock over the peeler plate until {{a portion of}} the label, called the [...] "flag," [...] is {{extended}} into the path of the oncoming package. When the package engages the label flag, the label web is advanced to match the speed of the package and label is either tamped or wiped on to assure adhesion.Proper alignment of the label on the package depends on sensors that sense the location/orientation of the package and label sensors that detect the location of the label edge. Package sensors can be a variety of Position sensors, often optical sensors or Ultrasonic sensors. Label <b>sensors</b> are usually <b>Photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> because they are inexpensive. But clear labels cannot be detected by <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors.</b> Capacitive and ultrasonic technologies are used for clear label detection.|$|R
50|$|Cards may be read using {{mechanical}} brushes {{that make}} an electrical contact for a hole, and no contact if no punch, or <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> that function similarly. Timing relates the {{signals to the}} position on the card. Cards may be read serially, column by column, or in parallel, row by row.|$|R
50|$|Remote <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> {{used for}} remote sensing contain only the optical {{components}} of a sensor. The circuitry for power input, amplification, and output switching are located elsewhere, typically in a control panel. This allows the sensor, itself, to be very small. Also, the controls for the sensor are more accessible, since they may be bigger.|$|R

50|$|Because {{ultrasonic}} sensors use sound {{rather than}} light for detection, {{they work in}} applications where <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> may not. Ultrasonics are a great solution for clear object detection, clear label detection and for liquid level measurement, applications that photoelectrics struggle with because of target translucence. As well, target color and/or reflectivity do not affect ultrasonic sensors, which can operate reliably in high-glare environments.|$|R

50|$|A {{proximity}} sensor often emits an electromagnetic field or {{a beam of}} electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), and looks {{for changes in the}} field or return signal. The object being sensed {{is often referred to as}} the {{proximity sensor}}'s target. Different proximity sensor targets demand different sensors. For example, a capacitive or <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensor</b> might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive proximity sensor always requires a metal target.|$|E

It is possible to use OMG for the same applications where Electromyography (EMG) and Mechanomyography (MMG) are used. However, OMG offers superior signal-to-noise ratio and improved robustness against the disturbing factors and limitations of EMG and MMG.The basic principle of OMG is to use active near-infra-red optical sensors to measure the variations in the measured signals that are reflected from the surface of the skin while activating the muscles below and around the skin spot where the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensor</b> is focusing to measure the signals reflected from this spot.|$|E
5000|$|Pioneer 4 was an American spin-stabilized {{unmanned}} spacecraft launched {{as part of}} the Pioneer program on a lunar flyby trajectory and into a heliocentric orbit making it the first probe of the United States to escape from the Earth's gravity. It carried a payload similar to Pioneer 3: a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Müller tube detector and a lunar photography experiment. It passed within 58,983 km of the Moon's surface. However, Pioneer 4 did not come close enough to trigger its <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensor.</b> The spacecraft was still in solar orbit as of 1969.

5000|$|On June 17, 2015, Nest {{launched}} {{a new version of}} the Nest Protect. It is the first smoke alarm to bring a commercial-grade <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensor</b> to the home; called the Split-Spectrum Sensor - it uses two wavelengths of light to spot different kinds of smoke, which helps it catch both fast and slow-burning fires quickly. Additionally, due to the long-lasting carbon monoxide sensor, the Nest Protect lasts ten years. The new Nest Protect also has a feature called App Silence which lets you silence it using your smart device if you are not in the US or Canada. [...] Also, when you are not home, the smoke detector will test itself using a built in microphone. Safety Rewards allows Nest Protect users that have their insurance through American Family and Liberty Mutual to get savings off their bill.|$|E

50|$|At 12:10 AM EST on {{the night}} of March 2-3, Pioneer 4 lifted from LC-5. This time, the booster {{performed}} almost perfectly so that Pioneer 4 achieved its primary objective (an Earth-Moon trajectory), returned radiation data and provided a valuable tracking exercise. A slightly longer than nominal second stage burn however was enough to induce small trajectory and velocity errors, so that the probe passed within 60,000 km of the Moon's surface (7.2° E, 5.7° S) on 4 March 1959 at 22:25 UT (5:25 p.m. EST) at a speed of 7,230 km/h and was not able to impact as planned. The distance was also not close enough to trigger the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensor.</b> The probe continued transmitting radiation data for 82.5 hours, to a distance of 409,000 miles (658,000 km), and reached perihelion on 18 March 1959 at 01:00 UT. The cylindrical fourth stage casing (173 cm long, 15 cm diameter, 4.65 kg) went into orbit with the probe. The communication system had worked well, and it was estimated that signals could have been received out to 680,000 miles (1 million kilometers) had there been enough battery power.|$|E
40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{bio-nanocomposite}} photoelectrode was fabricated through directimmobilization of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (RC) proteins on ananocrystalline TiO 2 matrix prepared by anodic electrodeposition.

High efficient light-harvesting ofthe NIR light energy by RC contributed to the distinct enhancement of the photoelectricconversion on such nanoporous matrix, which would provide a new strategy to developversatile biomimic energy convertors or <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{computerized}} {{block system}} {{is used to}} prevent trains from contacting each other. GASM has 5 blocks: Station, Transfer Table, Lift, Main Brake, and Ready Brake. Normal operation uses two trains; however, it can be operated with only one. During two-train operation, if the train in the station has not fully exited the loading platform, the inbound train will stop abruptly in the Main Brakes. A combination of proximity switches, mechanical switches, <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors,</b> and timers are all used by the controller to track train movements.|$|R
50|$|Discrete signals {{behave as}} binary switches, {{yielding}} simply an On or Off signal (1 or 0, True or False, respectively). Push buttons, limit switches, and <b>photoelectric</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are examples of}} devices providing a discrete signal. Discrete signals are sent using either voltage or current, where a specific range is designated as On and another as Off. For example, a PLC might use 24 V DC I/O, with values above 22 V DC representing On, values below 2VDC representing Off, and intermediate values undefined. Initially, PLCs had only discrete I/O.|$|R
