40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimization of centrifugal compressors. The {{purpose is to}} obtain optimal flow conditions in centrifugal compressors. The analysis is {{with respect to the}} effect of the degree of <b>pre-whirl</b> on the optimal inlet relative flow angle and hence the optimal mass flow rate achievable at various inlet relative Mach numbers for different values of the compressor inducer geometric parameter. A mass flow function incorporating all these parameters was developed and analyzed in a MATLAB environment to obtain the optimal inlet relative flow angle and the corresponding optimal mass flow rate at a given rotational speed of the compressor. The optimal inlet relative flow angle increases with the inlet relative Mach number at the given degree of <b>pre-whirl,</b> but decreases with an increase in the degree of <b>pre-whirl</b> at the given inlet relative Mach number. Also the optimal mass flow rates for computed values of the geometric parameter fall between those for two extreme allowable values of this parameter. The optimal rotational speed at a defined mass flow rate could be obtained from the analysis, and the results of this work will serve as guide for both design and operation of centrifugal compressors...|$|E
40|$|The {{onset of}} {{aerodynamic}} instabilities in {{proximity of the}} left margin of the operating curve {{represents one of the}} main limitations for centrifugal compressors in turbocharging applications. An anticipated stall/surge onset is indeed particularly detrimental at those high boost pressures that are typical of engine downsizing applications using a turbocharger. Several stabilization techniques have been investigated so far to increase the rangeability of the compressor without excessively reducing the efficiency. One of the most exploited solutions is represented by the use of upstream axial variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) to impart a <b>pre-whirl</b> angle to the inlet flow. In the pre-design phase of a new stage or when selecting, for example, an existing unit from an industrial catalogue, it is however not easy to get a prompt estimation of the attended modifications induced by the VIGV on the performance map of the compressor. A simplified model to this end is presented in the study. Figuring out a typical industrial pre-design phase, the model assumes the availability of the original performance data of the compressor without <b>pre-whirl</b> and only very few geometrical parameters. Based on fluid dynamic considerations and some additional models and correlations, a procedure is defined to correct the attended stage pressure ratio and efficiency {{as a function of the}} <b>pre-whirl</b> angle imposed by the VIGV. The model has been successfully validated using an experimental literature case study and is thought to represent a new useful preliminary tool for turbocharger designers...|$|E
40|$|A {{single stage}} {{centrifugal}} compressor {{has been designed}} for industrial use. Adjustable Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) and vaned diffusers were equipped to meet the requirement of large flow range, high efficiency and constant shaft speed. Both numerical calculations and experiments were implemented to get the performance of this new designed centrifugal compressor. The influence of adjustable IGVs and vaned diffusers on the stage performance characteristic was examined by numerical method. It is shown that numerical simulation results {{are close to the}} measured results and predict the stall limit well. The new centrifugal compressor has a comparatively high efficiency and wide operating range. Moreover, unilateral adjustment of either IGV <b>pre-whirl</b> angle or vaned diffuser stagger angle enables an increase in stable operating range opposed to the stag...|$|E
40|$|In {{engineering}} practice, most {{centrifugal compressors}} use variable {{inlet guide vanes}} which can provide <b>pre-whirl</b> and control volume flow rates. As the impeller of a centrifugal compressor passes through the wakes created from the guide vanes, the aerodynamic parameters change significantly. The concept of adding dual slots at the trailing-edge of the guide vanes is proposed for reducing the aerodynamic load on the compressor impeller blades. In this article, the steady and unsteady performances of the new guide vanes are analysed under two compressor operating conditions (winter and design conditions). The results show that the average amplitude of the impeller passing frequency at the leading edge has a 13 % decrease under the winter condition, especially at the middle and root parts. Moreover, the dual slots structure has no effect on the overall compressor performance...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-pressure}} {{ratio and}} a wide operating range are highly required for a turbocharger in diesel engines. Ring groove arrangement is effective for flow range enhancement of centrifugal compressors. Two ring grooves on the suction pipe and the shroud casing wall are connected {{by means of the}} annular passage, and the stable recirculation flow is formed at small flow rates from the downstream groove toward the upstream groove through the annular bypass. It is well known that the ring groove arrangement shows the following two merits; (1) the formation of recirculation flow removes the low energy fluid around the downstream groove located near the splitter blade leading edge, (2) the flow incidence can be reduced because the recirculation flow merges again with the incoming main flow upstream of the impeller inlet. In the present study, the ring groove arrangement was applied to the high speed centrifugal compressor, in addition, in order to suppress too large <b>pre-whirl</b> due to the recirculation flow, the effects of guide vane installed in th...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2002. This project {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of {{solar chimney power plant}} turbines. A solar chimney power plant consists of a tall chimney surrounded by a transparent deck or solar collector. The sun heats the air in the collector through the greenhouse effect. A turbine extracts energy from the hot air rising up the chimney. An investigation of the requirements and operation of such turbines is needed. Correct matching of the turbine to the plant requires the determination of the turbine operational range and other requirements. An air-standard cycle analysis is extended to include component and system losses. Simple steady-state and transient collector models are added {{to take into account the}} coupling effect of the collector air temperature rise and mass flow rate on the turbine operation. The predicted turbine operational range for a representative day shows that the expected pressure drop in a full-scale solar chimney turbine is significantly higher than has previously been predicted. A turbine design method is developed and used to design a turbine for the representative day. The methods can easily be extended to include more operating points for a full year of operation. A turbine layout is suggested that uses the chimney support pillars as inlet guide vanes (IGVs). These introduce <b>pre-whirl</b> to the turbine and reduce the amount of exit whirl thus decreasing the kinetic energy at the turbine exit. Non-radial inlet guide vanes add to the torsional stiffness of the chimney base. A matrix throughflow method is used to design the radial to axial duct between the IGVs and rotor. The turbine blade profiles are simulated using a surface-vortex method. This is coupled to an optimisation scheme that minimises both the chord length and maximum flow velocity of the profile to reduce blade drag. An experimental program investigates {{the performance of}} the turbine. Volume flow, pressure drop, torque and speed are measured on a scale model turbine to map the turbine performance over a wide range. The velocity and pressure profiles are measured at two design points to investigate the flow through the turbine in more detail. These are compared to the design predictions and used to improve the design method. The experiments show that the design of a solar chimney turbine with a total-to-total efficiency of 85 % - 90 % and total-to-static efficiency of 75 % - 80 % is possible. Analysis of the experimental results shows that the turbine efficiency can be improved...|$|E
