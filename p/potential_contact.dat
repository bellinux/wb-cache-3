500|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{a largely}} positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation" [...] before concluding that the episode was [...] "fairly standard." [...] The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, [...] "I {{used to be a}} huge [...] "Scooby Doo" [...] fan. [...] Of course, none of [...] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: we all want to believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we think we know isn't everything there is to know. That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales." [...] Handlen ultimately called the episode [...] "Essential." [...] Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that [...] "The X-Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening." [...] Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode [...] "an engrossing chiller about <b>potential</b> <b>contact</b> from outer space." [...] He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was [...] "both scary and wondrous" [...] and [...] "offer no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not [...] "what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great.

40|$|Understanding and {{modeling}} the wildlife-livestock interface {{is essential for}} controlling emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The contact rate between hosts is a key parameter for mathematical modeling of EIDs dynamics. Because modifications of the contact rate can modify greatly the epidemiologic dynamic, {{it is important to}} take into account its seasonal variability. We developed a distribution model based on satellite telemetry and remote sensing data to directly evaluate the dynamic of contacts between wild birds and domestic poultry in African villages. In the Inner Niger Delta of Mali, five Comb ducks (Sarkidiornis melanotos), were tracked with satellite transmitters providing GPS data for seven months. We used 250 -meter spatial resolution and 8 -day temporal resolution remotely sensed environmental indicators to model the distribution of these wild birds with the MAXENT method. For each 8 -day period, we estimated the <b>potential</b> <b>contacts</b> between wild and domestic birds by calculating the number of villages harbouring predicted suitable habitats for Comb ducks. A period of increased <b>potential</b> <b>contacts</b> occurred {{at the end of the}} dry season when wild birds were looking for the last suitable habitats. Comb ducks subsequently performed regional movements to reach their breeding grounds during the rainy season. We could directly estimate the seasonal variation of <b>potential</b> <b>contacts</b> between Comb ducks and domestic poultry. It allowed us to identify period of potential transmission and spread of pathogens by wild birds.
