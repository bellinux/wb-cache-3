5|$|Bonaparte Crossing the Alps (also called Napoleon Crossing the Alps, {{despite the}} {{existence}} of another, more well-known <b>painting</b> <b>with</b> that name) is an 1848–1850 oil-on-canvas portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte, by French artist Paul Delaroche. The painting depicts Bonaparte leading his army through the Alps on a mule, a journey Napoleon and his army of soldiers made {{in the spring of}} 1800, in an attempt to surprise the Austrian army in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Kent {{selected}} Albert Chevallier Tayler as the artist; he {{had earlier}} painted Lord Harris batting for Kent in 1905. Tayler was paid 200 guineas by Kent for the <b>painting,</b> <b>with</b> an additional royalty for reproductions {{that could bring}} the total as high as 350 guineas.|$|E
50|$|Fat over lean {{refers to}} the {{principle}} in oil painting of applying <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> a higher oil to pigment ratio ('fat') over <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> a lower oil to pigment ratio ('lean') to ensure a stable paint film, since {{it is believed that}} the <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> the higher oil content remains more flexible.|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{the blue}} areas were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> indigo, while the green areas were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> indigo, a copper green (likely to be a basic copper {{chloride}} and possibly malachite) and a trace amount of orpiment. The yellow regions {{were most likely}} <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> an organic yellow such as gamboge. The red areas were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> vermilion and the dull red areas were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> vermilion and {{a small amount of}} indigo. The suite of non-invasive techniques applied on the green fragments need to be applied directly on the map to areas of other colours to confirm the identification of the yellow pigments and give a fuller picture of the colorants used and the way they were used.|$|R

The crucifixion scene with rosettes and vine leaf decoration was uncovered in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} <b>painting</b> <b>with</b> {{watercolor}} and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn what he has forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of <b>painting,</b> <b>with</b> rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E

Coulson knocks Bakshi unconscious and takes the painting while May defeats Agent 33. Afterwards, May reveals her own contingency plan – to take Coulson into the Australian Outback to hide away from civilization. He orders her {{to follow through with}} his plan instead.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1897, Simonovich {{taught at}} a {{boarding}} school in Tbilisi and gave art classes in a private school run by O.M. Shmerling. She left Tbilisi in 1899 and went to Paris where she studied drawing under Louis Charles Delescluze for a year, before returning to Moscow to take private painting courses with Elizaveta Nikolaevna Zvantseva, her cousin Serov, and attend classes at the Stroganov School. Simonvich returned to Paris in 1901 and studied <b>painting</b> <b>with</b> Eugène Carrière {{through the end of}} the following year, learning the Impressionist style of masters such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Van Gogh.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Lao She {{introduced}} Xin Fengxia to {{the famous}} playwright Wu Zuguang. Like many intellectuals at the time, Wu held high hopes for the new People's Republic and returned to China from British Hong Kong. Xin, who had acted in one of Wu's plays, admired his talent. They married that year, {{despite the fact that}} they were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy. She also studied <b>painting</b> <b>with</b> Qi Baishi, one of the most celebrated masters of Chinese painting, who took her as his goddaughter.|$|E

5|$|The {{conservation}} {{was carried}} out between 1974 and 1986, wherever possible using non-invasive procedures such as washing with water and a solution of lime, filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing because of the corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished by <b>painting</b> <b>with</b> a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} cathedral are so specifically detailed and the elements of Gothic and contemporary architecture so well delineated, that art and architecture historians have concluded that van Eyck must have had enough architectural knowledge to make nuanced distinctions. More so, given the finesse of the descriptions, many scholars have tried to link the <b>painting</b> <b>with</b> a particular building. Yet, and as with all buildings in van Eyck's work, the structure is imagined and probably an idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect architectural space. This is evident {{from a number of}} features that would be unlikely in a contemporary church, such as the placing of a round arched triforium above a pointed colonnade.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual <b>painting,</b> <b>with</b> a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{passed from}} Haro into {{the collection of}} his daughter Catalina de Haro y Guzmán, the eighth Marchioness of Carpio, and her husband, Francisco Álvarez de Toledo, the tenth Duke of Alba. In 1802, Charles IV of Spain ordered the family to sell the <b>painting</b> (<b>with</b> other works) to Manuel de Godoy, his favourite and chief minister. He hung it alongside two masterpieces by Francisco Goya {{that he may have}} commissioned himself, The Nude Maja and The Clothed Maja. These bear obvious compositional similarities with Velázquez's Venus, although unlike Velázquez, Goya clearly painted his nude in a calculated attempt to provoke shame and disgust in the relatively unenlightened climate of 18th-century Spain.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a year of}} {{arriving}} in Harbin, China, Kalep's son died and her husband disappeared. Kalep was able to support herself by working as an interpreter—she spoke Russian, German, English and Chinese—for a British general in Shenyang. She was also employed by Zhang Zuolin and later his son, Zhang Xueliang, but {{decided to return to}} Estonia in 1925. She traveled through Indonesia, Italy and France before eventually arriving in Tallinn in 1926. Soon afterwards she settled in Paris, where she studied the art of oil <b>painting</b> <b>with</b> Russian painter Alexandre Jacovleff. She married Rolf Baron von Hoeningen-Bergendorff, who was of German or Austrian descent.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{pieces were}} stolen {{at an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. One of the paintings, The Concert, was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen <b>painting,</b> <b>with</b> a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze finial was taken from the top of a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves. The museum is offering a $100,000 reward for this piece alone.|$|E

In 1929 Knight was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in June 1931 she received an honorary degree from St. Andrews University. Knight {{was elected president of}} the Society of Women Artists in 1932 and held the post until 1967. In 1936 she became the first woman since 1769 elected to full membership of the Royal Academy. The same year Knight published her first autobiography, Oil Paint and Grease Paint, which became a best-seller, with four hardback editions followed in 1941 by a Penguin paperback printing.|$|E
5|$|Lander's Peak was an {{immediate}} success; twelve hundred people were invited for the exhibition, and almost a thousand showed up. Bierstadt was a shrewd self-promoter {{as well as a}} gifted artist, and this was the first of his paintings to be widely promoted with a single-picture exhibition, accompanied by a pamphlet, engravings and a tour. The <b>painting,</b> <b>with</b> its ten-foot width, was intended both for exhibition halls and the homes of America's emergent millionaire class. In 1865 it was purchased by British railway entrepreneur James McHenry for the (at the time) high price of $25,000. Bierstadt later bought it back, and gave or sold it to his brother Edward, before it was eventually acquired for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Late {{one night}} in 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth {{to see what was}} purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Youngworth was a career criminal and associate to New England art thief Myles Connor Jr. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the <b>painting</b> <b>with</b> a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting. It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit speaking to Youngworth after not making any progress. The painting has since disappeared.|$|E
