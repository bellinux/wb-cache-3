5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the {{nuclear envelope}}. These <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> located in an area of high traffic, they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.|$|E
5|$|Cairanoolithus dughii is {{the type}} oospecies. At , its eggshell is {{slightly}} thicker than that of C. roussetensis. It has slender, partially fused columnar eggshell units. Their outer surface is almost without ornamentation, and the inner surface is covered with hollows once filled by organic cores. C. dughiis eggshell exhibits an angusticanaliculate pore system, i.e. its <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> long, narrow, and straight.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum holopus {{produces}} a brown spore print. Spores are somewhat fusoid (spindle-shaped) and measure 14–20 by 5–6.5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 28.5–36.5 by 11.5–12.5µm. Cystidia on the <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> flask-shaped (lageniform) to fusiform, and 39.0–45.5 by 7.5–9.0µm, while {{those of the}} stipe (caulocystidia) are fusiform, club-shaped, or cylindrical, measuring 39.0–54.5 x 9.1–13.5µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of L.holopus. The cap cuticle is arranged {{in the form of}} a cutis—with hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface.|$|E
30|$|Individual {{plant was}} {{recorded}} as male fertile or male sterile {{based on the}} pollens stainability and germination. Fully developed and red stained pollen grains (with germinal <b>pore)</b> <b>were</b> classified as fertile while shriveled and unstained pollen grains (without germinal <b>pore)</b> <b>were</b> grouped as sterile.|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic‐assisted {{tungsten}} {{inert gas}} welding was carried out on a thin plate of 2195 Al‐Li alloy, and the characteristics of the weld <b>pores</b> <b>were</b> analyzed in terms of their size and porosity. The effects of welding speed and ultrasonic power on the porosity and size of the <b>pores</b> <b>were</b> investigated. The <b>pores</b> <b>were</b> found to occur primarily adjacent {{to the surface of the}} weld. The porosity decreased and the size increased with a decrease in welding speed. The effect of ultrasonic power on the characteristics of the <b>pores</b> <b>was</b> different from that of the welding speed. The porosity and size of the pores decreased and then increased with an increase in ultrasonic power. A relationship was found between the transient cavitation intensity and the characteristics of pores. An increasing transient cavitation intensity results in a decrease in the porosity and size of pores when the transient cavitation intensity is lower. However, it can result in an increase in the porosity and pore size when the transient cavitation intensity further increases. Finally, the influencing mechanism of cavitation on welding <b>pores</b> <b>was</b> discussed...|$|R

5|$|Nuclear pores, {{which provide}} aqueous {{channels}} through the envelope, {{are composed of}} multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> 100nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9nm wide, due {{to the presence of}} regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Sclerodermatineae have {{fruit body}} shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes on the {{underside}} of the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies sometimes have hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with flaky particles), and lack the reticulation (a net-like pattern of interlacing lines) characteristic of some members of the Boletaceae. The <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The flesh is usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> highly {{efficient}} at selectively allowing {{the passage of}} materials {{to and from the}} nucleus, because the nuclear envelope has a considerable amount of traffic. RNA and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Histones, gene regulatory proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope of a typical mammalian cell contains 3000–4000 pore complexes. If the cell is synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the cell is growing rapidly, each complex also needs to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the nuclear}} {{membrane}} is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> required to regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing {{free movement of}} small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression {{and the maintenance of}} chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of sub-nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are white. Spores are cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, and measure 9–12 by 3–3.5µm. Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning {{it is made}} of {{generative}} hyphae, which are thin-walled, branched, and narrow. Hyphae in the flesh layer are thin- to thick-walled, frequently branched, and measure 2–10µm in diameter, while those of the <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> roughly similar in morphology, but measure 3–5µm. Both forms have a thin incrustation on their walls that gives them a rough appearance when viewed with a light microscope. The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) is 40–60µm thick, and has abundant cystidia, which are hyaline, and measure 7–9µm in diameter. They are cylindrical, thin-walled to moderately thick-walled, hyaline, have a septum at the base, and measure 60–120 by 5–10µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 25–35 by 6–7µm.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E

5000|$|Size of stomatal aperture. The somatal pore {{controls}} {{the diffusion of}} [...] into the leaves to be utilized for photosynthesis. The <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> formed by two guard cells, which control {{the size of the}} pore by swelling in response to the activity of the -ATPase. Opening and closure of the <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> partly controlled by regulation of the -ATPase.|$|R
30|$|Contribution from medium <b>pores</b> <b>was</b> {{the highest}} {{among all the}} three groups of pores, {{accounting}} for about 40  %– 49  %, during SP flooding. Although the SP system mainly displaced the residual oil in medium pores, {{its effect on the}} residual oil in small and large <b>pores</b> cannot <b>be</b> neglected. After the SP flood, the residual oil was mainly trapped in small and medium pores, so the oil in small and medium <b>pores</b> <b>was</b> the main target for enhanced oil recovery after the SP flood.|$|R
5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. <b>Pores</b> <b>are</b> left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
25|$|Stomata (or leaf <b>pores)</b> <b>are</b> {{involved}} in both uptake {{of carbon dioxide}} gas from the atmosphere and water vapor losses from the leaf due to water transpiration. Basic physiological investigation of these gas exchange processes has yielded valuable carbon isotope based methods that are used for breeding wheat varieties with improved water-use efficiency. These varieties can improve crop productivity in rain-fed dry-land wheat farms.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium alloys often {{undergo a}} surface treatment. Electrochemical {{conditions}} in the bath are carefully adjusted so that uniform pores, several nanometers wide, appear in the metal's oxide film. These pores allow the oxide to grow much thicker than passivating conditions would allow. At {{the end of the}} treatment, the <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> allowed to seal, forming a harder-than-usual surface layer. If this coating is scratched, normal passivation processes take over to protect the damaged area.|$|E

50|$|Apical germ <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> {{mushroom}} spore {{which has}} a pore at one end. Some spores have {{a hole in the}} cell wall where the first strand of germinating mycelium emerges. If the cell wall is divided {{from one end to the}} other, this is called a germ slit. Commonly the germ <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> at one end of the mushroom spore and is called an apical pore.|$|R
25|$|Filtered {{molecules}} {{are either}} excreted {{in the urine}} or may be specifically re-absorbed. Protein molecules that pass through the glomerular <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> either absorbed unchanged (such as albumin), degraded in the proximal tubular cells and absorbed (such as free light chains), or excreted as fragments. This re-absorption is mediated by a receptor complex (megalin/cubulin) and prevents the loss of large amounts of protein into the urine. It is very efficient and can process10–30g of low-molecular-weight proteins per day, so under normal conditions no light chains pass beyond the proximal tubules.|$|E
25|$|Porosity (n) is a {{directly}} measurable aquifer property; it is {{a fraction}} between 0 and 1 indicating {{the amount of}} pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity). Permeability {{is an expression of}} the connectedness of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high porosity (it has lots of holes between its constituent grains), but a low permeability (none of the <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.|$|E
25|$|Most horses do {{not object}} to mane pulling, and willingly stand for the process. To make it more {{comfortable}} for the horse, a groom should pull the mane out of the crest in an upwards direction, rather than sideways or down. An application of Orajel or clove oil on {{the roots of the}} mane can help desensitize the area during the pulling process. It is also recommended that pulling is performed right after exercise, when it is thought that the mane comes out more easily because the <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> open. Using a mane pulling device such as the ManePuller may also be considered because it tends to be quicker and therefore less stressful for the horse (and groom).|$|E
30|$|Plugging of <b>pores</b> <b>is</b> {{related to}} small-sized pores (with diameters smaller than 12  µm) {{comparable}} in size with asphaltene particles formed in oil. Asphaltene deposition affected only the pores with diameter below 12  µm. Pores with sizes comparable with asphaltene particles were plugged by them. In those pores, which sizes slightly exceeded particle sizes, adsorption of asphaltenes occurred. The {{rest of the}} <b>pore</b> sizes <b>were</b> {{not included in the}} considered range. It can be assumed that mechanical trapping of asphaltenes in <b>pore</b> throats <b>is</b> the predominant one. The experiment results showed that large-sized <b>pores</b> <b>were</b> not involved in asphaltene deposition which was confirmed by a number of researchers (Shedid and Zekri 2006; Papadimitriou et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the pore {{opening and}} closure on the giant unilamellar vesicle GUV {{membrane}} are studied under different theoretical schemes. The opening process is {{considered as a}} dynamics process; while the closure process is considered as a quasi-static process. The opening criterion is set based on an energy release rate theory, similar to the Griffith theory for crack initiation. On the other hand, the closure process is described by a non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory. When the size of initial <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> smaller than a critical value, the <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> stable, and followed by the closure process.

25|$|The {{complement}} system includes blood proteins {{that can cause}} cell death after an antibody binds to the cell surface (the classical complement pathway, among the ways of complement activation). Generally the system deals with foreign pathogens, but can be activated with therapeutic antibodies in cancer. The system can be triggered if the antibody is chimeric, humanized or human; {{as long as it}} contains the IgG1 Fc region. Complement can lead to cell death by activation of the membrane attack complex, known as complement-dependent cytotoxicity; enhancement of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; and CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity occurs when antibodies bind to the cancer cell surface, the C1 complex binds to these antibodies and subsequently protein <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> formed in the cancer cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|To {{overcome}} {{the need to}} use organic solvents and solid porogens, a technique using gas as a porogen has been developed. First, disc-shaped structures made of the desired polymer are prepared by means of compression molding using a heated mold. The discs are then placed in a chamber where {{they are exposed to}} high pressure CO2 for several days. The pressure inside the chamber is gradually restored to atmospheric levels. During this procedure the <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> formed by the carbon dioxide molecules that abandon the polymer, resulting in a sponge-like structure. The main problems resulting from such a technique are caused by the excessive heat used during compression molding (which prohibits the incorporation of any temperature labile material into the polymer matrix) and {{by the fact that the}} pores do not form an interconnected structure.|$|E
25|$|In diffuse-porous woods, as {{has been}} stated, the vessels or <b>pores</b> <b>are</b> even-sized, so that the water {{conducting}} capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, {{not the same as}} in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPorous {{titanium}} {{with the}} porosity {{in the range}} of 44 - 77 % was successfully prepared by space holder sintering process. The size of large <b>pores</b> had <b>been</b> controlled by fractionized the holder. The pore size of the as-prepared samples exhibited bimodal distribution, i. e., the size of large <b>pores</b> <b>was</b> about 200 - 500 μm and the size of small <b>pores</b> <b>was</b> approximate several micrometers. The mechanism for the formation of the <b>pores</b> <b>was</b> explored and the optimal process was determined in this paper. The compressive behavior of the porous titanium was investigated at different processing variables. It was found that the yielding strength and Young's modulus were strongly depended on the sintering temperature, porosity and pore size. Therefore, the pore structure and properties of the porous titanium could be tailored to satisfy the requirements of biomedical implants...|$|R
40|$|The fusion <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> an aqueous {{channel that}} is formed upon {{the fusion of}} the vesicle {{membrane}} with the plasma membrane. Once the <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> open, it may close again (transient fusion) or widen completely (full fusion) to permit vesicle cargo discharge. While repetitive transient fusion pore openings of the vesicle with the plasma membrane have been observed {{in the absence of}} stimulation, their frequency can be further increased using a cAMP-increasing agent that drives the opening of nonspecific cation channels. Our model hypothesis is that the openings and closings of the fusion <b>pore</b> <b>are</b> driven by changes in the local concentration of cations in the connected vesicle. The proposed mechanism of fusion <b>pore</b> dynamics <b>is</b> considered as follows: when the fusion <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> closed or is extremely narrow, the accumulation of cations in the vesicle (increased cation concentration) likely leads to lipid demixing at the fusion pore. This process may affect local membrane anisotropy, which reduces the spontaneous curvature and thus leads to the opening of the fusion pore. Based on the theory of membrane elasticity, we used a continuum model to explain the rhythmic opening and closing of the fusion pore...|$|R
40|$|Determination of {{the rates}} of {{diffusion}} of beta-lactam antibiotics through purified Pseudomonas aeruginosa porins C, D 2, and E in liposomes yielded the following results. (i) The rates of carbapenem (imipenem and meropenem) diffusion through the protein D 2 <b>pore</b> <b>were</b> roughly 2 to 70 times higher than those through other porin <b>pores.</b> It <b>is</b> not clear why the protein D 2 pore allowed rapid diffusion of carbapenems. The rates of diffusion of glucosamine and triglycine through the protein D 2 <b>pore</b> <b>were</b> about 14 and 4 times higher, respectively, than that of an uncharged test solute with a similar Mr, glucose. (ii) The rates of diffusion of antipseudomonal anionic beta-lactams such as piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefsulodin, and aztreonam through the protein C <b>pore</b> <b>were</b> higher than those through other porin <b>pores.</b> This <b>was</b> {{probably due to the}} slightly larger pore size and the slight anion selectivity of protein C, since the apparent exclusion limit of the protein C pore for uncharged saccharides is higher than that of other porins and the rate of diffusion of gluconic acid through the protein C <b>pore</b> <b>is</b> about double that for glucose. (iii) The rates of diffusion of cefoperazone through all three species of porin were relatively high.
