40|$|For {{some time}} {{the theory of}} the firm has been subject to an unfortunate division: in the {{classroom}} we talk about <b>production</b> <b>functions</b> involving physical inputs and a physical output; in our empirical work we are content to estimate cost or <b>production</b> <b>functions</b> from value and accounting data. 1 The former have come to be called 2 ̆ 2 engineering <b>production</b> <b>functions,</b> 2 ̆ 22 while the latter have been termed 2 ̆ 2 index numbers of production 2 ̆ 2 [3], 2 ̆ 2 distribution functions 2 ̆ 2 [4], and 2 ̆ 2 surrogate <b>production</b> <b>functions</b> 2 ̆ 2 [13].
