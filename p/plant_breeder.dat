There, she participated in student {{government}} and {{was invited to}} join a sorority, though she soon realized that she preferred not to join formal organizations. Instead, McClintock took up music, specifically jazz. She studied botany, receiving a BSc in 1923. Her interest in genetics began when she took her first course in that field in 1921. The course {{was based on a}} similar one offered at Harvard University, and was taught by C. B. Hutchison, a <b>plant</b> <b>breeder</b> and geneticist. Hutchison was impressed by McClintock's interest, and telephoned to invite her to participate in the graduate genetics course at Cornell in 1922. McClintock pointed to Hutchison's invitation as the reason she continued in genetics: [...] "Obviously, this telephone call cast the die for my future. I remained with genetics thereafter." [...] Although {{it has been reported that}} women could not major in genetics at Cornell, and therefore her MA and PhD—earned in 1925 and 1927, respectively—were officially awarded in botany, recent research has revealed that women did earn graduate degrees in Cornell's Plant Breeding Department during the time that McClintock was a student at Cornell.|$|E

This review shows that the Australian <b>plant</b> <b>breeder’s</b> rights scheme is well used, has been progressively amended and extended, and is just one element in a suite of measures geared to stimulate plant-related innovation.

In the early 19th century, Augustin Sageret established the concept of dominance, recognizing that when some plant varieties are crossed, certain characters (present in one parent) usually appear in the offspring; he also found that some ancestral characters found in neither parent may appear in offspring. However, <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> made little attempt to establish a theoretical foundation for their work or to share their knowledge with current work of physiology, although Gartons Agricultural <b>Plant</b> <b>Breeders</b> in England explained their system.|$|R

2500|$|His ever-expanding {{interests}} led {{him into}} plant population genetics, a field that he essentially founded. [...] His particular interest was in the population genetics of Inbreeding species, and included wild plants such as Collinsia, Avena barbata and Avena fatua. [...] His interest in inbreeding species probably stemmed from his interactions with Ledyard Stebbins, who was also at U.C. Davis, and had predicted that wild inbreeding plant populations should be devoid of genetic variation. As a <b>plant</b> <b>breeder</b> who had done selection on inbreeding species in cultivated plants, Allard {{knew that there was}} ample genetic variation within [...] "pure lines." [...] It is easy to see how he would have become intriqued with inbreeding wild species. And indeed starting in the early 1960s he worked with experimental populations of wheat, barley, and lima beans as well as the wild plants Collinsia, Avena barbata, and Avena fatua investigating a wide variety of issues important to the population genetics of inbreeding species. [...] He published numerous foundational papers on the effects of mating systems, selection, gene-environment interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and genetic drift on the genetic variation of inbreeding plant populations.|$|E

By improving the profitability of farming, <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> improved the economic condition of farmers {{and contributed to the}} growth and structure of rural communities. In the years since World War II, agriculture and the quality of rural life have been driven by policies that encouraged and subsidized an agroindustrial production model. <b>Plant</b> <b>breeders</b> responded by developing methods and deploying products attuned to agroindustrial clients. Major achievements by <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> of the era include the development of higher-yielding crops suitable to new environments and mechanized harvesting and shipping. As social, technological, and economic changes reinforced the expansion and dominance of the agroindustrial model, rural communities sustained high levels of out-migration. At the same time, a variety of societal and economic forces have encouraged new food system models, including the locavores and community-supported agriculture. Sustainability indices reflect the desire of megaretailers to make the relationship between consumers and the production of their food more transparent.
