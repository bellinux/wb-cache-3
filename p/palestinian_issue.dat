25|$|The 1969 {{congress}} also saw an ultra-leftist faction under Nayef Hawatmeh and Yasser Abd Rabbo split {{off as the}} Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP), later to become the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). During Habash's time as Secretary-General, the PFLP became {{known as one of}} the most radical and militant Palestinian factions, and gained world notoriety after a string of aircraft hijackings and attacks against Israel affiliated companies as well as Israeli ambassadors in Europe mostly planned by Haddad. The PFLP's pioneering of modern international terror operations brought the group, and the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>issue,</b> onto newspaper front pages worldwide, but it also provoked intense criticism from other parts of the Palestine Liberation Organization.|$|E
2500|$|Hussein {{considered}} the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>issue</b> {{to be the}} overriding national security issue, even after Jordan lost the West Bank in 1967 and after it renounced claims to it in 1988. Initially, Hussein attempted to unite both banks of the Jordan River as one people, but {{with the formation of}} the PLO in the 1960s, it became difficult to maintain such a policy. He was relentless in pursuit of peace, viewing {{that the only way to}} solve the conflict was by peaceful means, excluding his decision to join the war in 1967. The decision cost him half his kingdom and his grandfather's legacy. After the war he emerged as an advocate for Palestinian statehood. After renouncing ties to the West Bank in 1988, he remained committed to solving the conflict. His 58 secret meetings held with Israeli representatives since 1963 culminated in the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, which he considered to be his [...] "crowning achievement".|$|E

2500|$|The First Intifada, 1987–1993, {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinians, particularly the young, against the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip after {{the failure of the}} PLO to achieve any kind of meaningful diplomatic solution to the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>issue.</b> The exiled PLO leadership in Tunisia quickly assumed a role in the intifada, but the uprising also brought a rise in the importance of Palestinian national and Islamic movements, and helped lead to the Palestinian Declaration of Independence in 1988. The intifada was started by a group of young Palestinians who began throwing rocks at the Israeli occupying forces in Jabalia (Gaza Strip) in December 1987. In May 1989, the government of Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister of Israel at the time, [...] "suggested that violence cease, and that elections should be held in the West Bank and Gaza for a political delegation with whom Israel would come to terms regarding the implementation of Palestinian interim self-governing authority in these areas." [...] These elections however never materialized.|$|E
2500|$|Mass demonstrations had {{occurred}} {{a year earlier}} when, after two Gaza students at Birzeit University had been shot by Israeli soldiers on campus on 4 December 1986, the Israelis responded with harsh punitive measures, involving summary arrest, detention and systematic beatings of handcuffed Palestinian youths, ex-prisoners and activists, some 250 of whom were detained in four cells inside a converted army camp, known popularly as Ansar 11, outside Gaza city. A policy of deportation was introduced to intimidate activists in January 1987. Violence simmered as a schoolboy from Khan Yunis was shot dead by Israelis soldiers pursuing him in a Jeep. Over the summer the IDF's Lieutenant Ron Tal, {{who was responsible for}} guarding detainees at Ansar 11, was shot dead at point-blank range while stuck in a Gaza traffic jam. A curfew forbidding Gaza residents from leaving their homes was imposed for three days, during the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha. In two incidents on 1 and 6 October 1987, respectively, the IDF ambushed and killed seven Gaza men, reportedly affiliated with Islamic Jihad, who had escaped from prison in May. Some days later, a 17-year-old schoolgirl, Intisar al-'Attar, was shot in the back while in her schoolyard in Deir al-Balah by a settler in the Gaza Strip. [...] The Arab summit in Amman in November 1987 focused on the Iran–Iraq War, and the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>issue</b> was shunted to the sidelines {{for the first time in}} years.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 February 2009, {{after being}} asked to be the prime {{minister}} of Israel, Netanyahu described Iran as the greatest threat that Israel has ever faced: [...] "Iran is seeking to obtain a nuclear weapon and constitutes the gravest threat to our existence since the war of independence." [...] Speaking before the UN General Assembly in New York on 24 September 2009, Netanyahu expressed a different opinion than Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech at the forum, saying those who believe Tehran is a threat only to Israel are wrong. [...] "The Iranian regime", he said, [...] "is motivated by fanaticism... They want to see us go back to medieval times. The struggle against Iran pits civilization against barbarism. This Iranian regime is fueled by extreme fundamentalism." [...] "By focusing solely on Iran," [...] columnist Yossi Melman speculated that Netanyahu's foreign policy, [...] "...took the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>issue</b> off the world agenda." [...] After four days of shelling from the Iranian-funded Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Melman asked, [...] "Is it worth initiating a crisis with Iran? Will the Israeli public be able to cope with Iran's response?" [...] According to Uzi Eilam, a retired brigadier general and the ex-director of Israel's Atomic Energy Commission, Benjamin Netanyahu is using the threat of atomic Iran as a means of reaching his own goals. Directly blaming Netanyahu, he said: [...] "Netanyahu is using the Iranian threat to achieve a variety of political objectives." [...] He also said: [...] "These declarations are unnecessarily scaring Israel's citizens, given Israel is not party to the negotiations to determine whether Iran will or will not dismantle its nuclear program." ...|$|E
