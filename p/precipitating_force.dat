40|$|The Financial {{crisis of}} 2008 to 2009 and the Great Recession it <b>precipitated</b> <b>forced</b> a {{rethinking}} among macroeconomists about the origin, prevention, and potential mitigation of such events. One of the conclusions {{emerging from a}} considered examination of the run-up to and {{the fallout from the}} events is the limitation of framing the policy issues solely in terms of whether Chairman Bernanke and the Federal Reserve System, as well as President Obama and the Congress, did the right thing when the crisis hit. Most observers believe that the response to the immediate crisis was correct {{in the sense that they}} believe that the appropriate remedy, once the seizing up of credit markets began, was indeed large scale fiscal and monetary stimulus. As the Fed reduced short- term rates close to the zero lower bound, it almost tripled the size of its balance sheet, and this ongoing monetary accommodation was augmented by the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP, October 2008) and, beginning in February of 2009, the fiscal stimulus associated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). 1 The Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in the November 2010 midterm elections ended prospects for additional fiscal stimulus, at least from the expenditure side, but the Fed’s expansionary monetary stance continued as it sustained its expanded balance sheet, purchasing, through its programs of quantitative easing, longer term securities as some of the troubled assets acquired at the height of the crisis matured. Analysis of the appropriate response to the crisis drew inspiration from the experience of the country during the Great Depression. Two of the key policymakers, Christina Romer and Ben Bernanke, were both serious students of the Great Depression. Bernanke is famous for saying, at a 2002 conference honoring Milton Friedman on his 90 th birthday, “Regarding the Great Depression, you’re right, we did it. We’re very sorry... we won’t do it again” (Bernanke 2002). Or to put it slightly more accurately, we won’t not do it again, since Friedman and Schwartz’s (1963) brief against the Fed was not their action, but their inaction in the face of bank failures and the consequent shrinkage in the country’s money supply...|$|R

5000|$|In The General Line (referred in {{the text}} as The Old and the New) the pathos of the milk {{separator}} is localized {{in order to examine}} the (in)voluntary contamination of pathos by themes and supposedly neutral elements. Like Potemkin, The General Line invoked the theme of [...] "collective unity" [...] within a community. [...] "And all this because the scheme 'of a chain reaction'- buildup of intensity- explosion- leaps from explosion to explosion- gives a clearer structural picture of the leaps from one state to another, characteristic for the ecstasy of particulars accumulating into the pathos of the whole." [...] However, a number of factors separate the scenes' pathos. The use of a new 28-inch lens allowed for a simultaneous splitting and unifying effect in The General Line. Also, milk's transformation to cream was a metaphorical device used to stand-in for the peasants' own transformation. These, and other examples, illustrate that pathos, as determined by exterior features, is incomplete. Rather, pathos and emotion were self-determined and intrinsic to form. The example of several painterly renderings of Christ’s expulsion of the moneylenders and his eventual resurrection demonstrate a consistent pathos, despite different artists and moments. This suggests a parallel “inner discovery” process embedded in thematic works. Finally, Eisenstein identifies the dialectical process as the <b>precipitating</b> <b>force</b> for unearthing pathos. [...] "The law of construction of processes- the basis of their form- in these cases will be identical. The effectiveness of the results in the norms of each area is equally 'transported beyond the limits' of these norms and the areas themselves as well. The actual processes- according to the same formula of ex stasis- is 'being beside oneself'. And this formula is nothing but the moment (instant) of the culmination of the dialecti law of transition of quantity into quality...The areas of application are different. But the stages are identical. The nature of the effects achieved is different. But the 'formulas' at the basis of these highest stages of manifestation, independent of the areas themselves, are identical." ...|$|E

Despite bringing the band additional licenses, the net impact of the Heiltsuk’s suits for expanded participation in the spawn industry remains ambiguous. The courts retained a selective definition of common law that nullified Heiltsuk territorial claims. The unifying theme in this discussion is common law. The same common law assumptions that the state historically used to appropriate and mismanage Heiltsuk fisheries continue to undermine aboriginal fishing rights.

40|$|The salar de Uyuni is {{a massive}} dry salt lake {{that lies at the}} lowest point of an {{internal}} drainage basin in the Bolivian Altiplano. A kinematic GPS survey of the salar in September 2002 found a topographic range of only 80 cm over a 54 × 45 km area and subtle surface features that appeared to correlate with mapped gravity. In order to confirm the correlation between topography and gravity/geopotential, we use local gravity measurements and the EGM 96 global geopotential model to construct a centimeter-level equipotential surface corresponding to the elevation of the salar. Our comparison of GPS survey elevations with the equipotential surface estimate shows that 63 % of the variance of the GPS elevations can be explained by equipotential surface undulations (and long-wavelength error) in the EGM 96 model alone, with an additional 30 % explained by the shorter-wavelength equipotential surface derived from local gravity. In order to establish a physical connection between topography and the geopotential, we also develop and test a simple surface process model that redistributes salt via the dissolution, transport, and redeposition of salt by <b>precipitated</b> water. <b>Forcing</b> within the model pushes the system to evolve toward constant water depth, with the salt surface approximating the shape of the local equipotential surface. Since the model removes almost all topographic relief with respect to the equipotential surface within a matter of decades, it appears that observed (~ 5 cm amplitude, ~ 5 km wavelength) residual topography is actively maintained by a process independent of gravity-driven fluid flow...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{feasibility}} of accurately measuring {{the size and}} the volume fraction of nano-scale plate-shaped <b>precipitates</b> by atomic <b>force</b> microscopy (AFM) has been explored. For quantitative evaluations their unhandy geometry is conveniently described as superellipsoids. The experimental alloy Ni 69 Co 9 Al 18 Ti 4 served as a model system: plate-shaped disordered γ-precipitates form in the L 12 -long-range ordered γ'-matrix. The results obtained by AFM are compared with those derived from transmission (TEM) and from high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The agreement between the AFM and the TEM results is good. In spite of the low number of SEM images taken, the same holds for the SEM results. In addition, magnetic force microscopy was applied; its results are acceptable. The main advantages of AFM are (i) the numerical output for all three dimensions, (ii) the simplicity of its operation, and (iii) the lower cost of the microscope itself. The first point allows to directly subject the numerical AFM output data to automated computer based evaluations. All present experimental and evaluation procedures are also applicable to cube-shaped particles with rounded edges and corners as found e. g. in γ'-strengthened nickel based superalloys...|$|R

Earlier studies have focused on the impact of these laws, primarily on wives as secondary earners within families, and not on their development.

Thus, while examining state legislative processes, this paper shows the goal of federal tax reduction led to changes in an entirely separate area of state law. This analysis also provides a new perspective on the American federal system, illustrating the complex and reciprocal relationship between state and federal laws and incentives. While initially states altered their domestic laws to give their residents a benefit under the federal tax code, using the federal system to win benefits for their residents vis-a-vis those of other states, these state-law changes ultimately induced the federal government to adopt a uniform national policy on income-splitting...|$|R
40|$|Microstructure and {{microchemistry}} evolution during {{hot deformation}} and subsequent annealing {{of a commercial}} Al-Mg-Si alloy were experimentally investigated using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and SEM. Meanwhile, a through-process model framework consisting of the deformation model GIA- 3 IVM+ and the recrystallization (RX) model CORe was utilized to simulate the microstructure evolution during the processing. Based on the experimental observations a new model for the RX driving force in particular after hot deformation and its evolution during subsequent annealing is proposed. Unlike a driving force model for cold deformed materials proposed recently, the geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) {{are taken into account}} in the new model for hot deformed materials, in which the deformation stored energy is normally very low. Furthermore, the static recovery of statistical stored dislocations, which decreases the RX driving force, is terminated in the new model at a certain level. This is {{based on the fact that}} after evolving into subgrain boundaries, dislocation cell walls will no longer change (apart from very slow subgrain growth). Fine <b>precipitates</b> exhibit back-driving <b>forces</b> on the moving grain boundary, namely the Zener drag force. This diminishes the effective driving force for RX in the deformed grains. Implementing these aspects into the RX model CORe, the partial RX in materials deformed at two variant conditions could be modeled.

40|$|Lithofacies {{distribution}} {{indicates that}} the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation of England and South Wales was desposited on a shelf which was flat and gently subsiding in the north, but topographically variable in the south. Limestone deposition in the north began with 12 m of alga-rich limestone, which formed an upward shoaling sequence. Deepening then led to deposition of calcareous silty mudstones on the northern shelf. The remainder of the formation in this area formed during a shelf-wide regression, culminating {{in the production of}} an E to W younging sandbody. Lithofacies distribution on the southern shelf was primarily controlled by local subsidence. Six bedded lithofacies are recognised which contain 14 brachiopod/bryozoan dominated assemblages, of which 11 are in situ and three consist of reworked fossils. Microfacies analysis is necessary to distinguish assemblages which reflect original communities from those which reflect sedimentary processes. Turbulence, substrate-type, ease of feeding and other organisms in the environment controlled faunal distribution. Reefs were built dominantly by corals, stromatoporoids, algae and crinoids. Coral/stromatoporoid (Type A) reefs are common, particularly on the northern shelf, where they formed in response to shallowing, ultimately growing in front of the advancing carbonate sandbody. Algae dominate Type B and Type C reefs, reflecting growth in areas of poor water circulation. Lithification of the formation began in the marine-phreatic environment with precipitation of aragonite and high Mg calcite, which was subsequently altered to turbid low Mg calcite. Younger clear spars post-date secondary void formation. The pre-compactional clear spars have features which resemble the products of meteoric water diagenesis, but freshwater did not enter the formation at this time.

Preparation of the Solution: This {{may involve}} several steps {{including}} adjustment of the pH {{of the solution}} {{in order for the}} precipitate to occur quantitatively and get a precipitate of desired properties, removing interferences, adjusting the volume of the sample to suit the amount of precipitating agent to be added. 2. Precipitation: This requires addition of a precipitating agent solution to the sample solution. Upon addition of the first drops of the precipitating agent, supersaturation occurs, then nucleation starts to occur where every few molecules of precipitate aggregate together forming a nucleous. At this point, addition of extra precipitating agent will either form new nuclei or will build up on existing nuclei to give a precipitate. This can be predicted by Von Weimarn ratio where, according to this relation the particle size is inversely proportional to a quantity called the relative supersaturation where Relative supersaturation = (Q - S)/S The Q is the concentration of reactants before precipitation, S is the solubility of precipitate in the medium from which it is being precipitated. Therefore, in order to get particle growth instead of further nucleation we need to make the relative supersaturation ratio as small as possible. The optimum conditions for precipitation which make the supersaturation low are: a. Precipitation using dilute solutions to decrease Qb. Slow addition of precipitating agent to keep Q as low as possiblec. Stirring the solution during addition of precipitating agent to avoid concentration sites and keep Q lowd. Increase solubility by precipitation from hot solutione. Adjust the pH in order to increase S but not a too much increase np as {{we do not want to}} loose precipitate by dissolutionf. Usually add a little excess of the precipitating agent for quantitative precipitation and check for completeness of the precipitation 3. Digestion of the precipitate: The precipitate is left hot (below boiling) for 30 min to 1 hour in order for the particles to be digested. Digestion involves dissolution of small particles and reprecipitation on larger ones resulting in particle growth and better precipitate characteristics. This process is called Ostwald ripening. An important advantage of digestion is observed for colloidal precipitates where large amounts of adsorbed ions cover the huge area of the <b>precipitate.</b> Digestion <b>forces</b> the small colloidal particles to agglomerate which decreases their surface area and thus adsorption. You should know that adsorption is a major problem in gravimetry in case of colloidal precipitate since a precipitate tends to adsorb its own ions present in excess, Therefore, forming what is called a primary ion layer which attracts ions from solution forming a secondary or counter ion layer. Individual particles repel each other keeping the colloidal properties of the precipitate. Particle coagulation can be forced by either digestion or addition of a high concentration of a diverse ions strong electrolytic solution in order to shield the charges on colloidal particles and force agglomeration. Usually, coagulated particles return to the colloidal state if washed with water, a process called peptization.|$|R
40|$|What {{combination}} of <b>forces</b> <b>precipitated</b> urban {{development in the}} ancient Mediterranean world? Are the remnants of such forces identifiable in the archaeological record? Since the Mediterranean basin presented itself as an ethnically diverse region where goods and services were transported largely by water, to what degree was urban development {{at the local level}} stimulated by the expansion of overseas empires? More specifically, does a ›world system‹ theoretical construct adequately address the phenomenon of urban development in the ancient Mediterranean world? This construct has gained significant popularity with those attempting to explain the pace and scale of development in the pre-classical world and is commonly applied to prehistoric, Near Eastern, and Bronze Age cultures of the region. However, it is rarely applied in Roman contexts where the quantity of archaeological and historical evidence to test the construct arguably is most plentiful. Moreover, existing discussion tends to focus on the formulation of a world system construct {{from the perspective of the}} core, defining the entity of the core itself, the possibility that core locations shifted over time, or that multiple competing core entities existed simultaneously. Recent observers have pointed increasingly to the lack of attention paid to diverging tendencies at the peripheral level in these developments. The desire to interpret developments macroregionally tends in particular to diminish the importance of economic behavior on the periphery, not to mention the complexity entailed in the merger of native and offshore systems. Some argue that participation by the periphery was often negotiated by local elites, and that such negotiations create internal conflicts and resolutions that often brought about social, political, and economic transformations. Understanding the nature of core/periphery relations, therefore, requires an awareness of the social and political structures of the individual societies in question. When viewed in microcosm, the likelihood for nuance, complexity, and variation in cultural development at the local level offers potentially significant insight to a world system construct. Regional survey in Rough Cilicia strives to address these issues...|$|R
50|$|Although {{hesitant}} {{at first}} to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah {{played an important role}} in the Lebanese Civil War. Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Arafat aligned the PLO with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement (LNM). The LNM was led by Kamal Jumblatt, who had a friendly relationship with Arafat and other PLO leaders. Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside right-wing Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM. The primary components of the Christian front were the Phalangists loyal to Bachir Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun, a son of former President Camille Chamoun.In February 1975, a pro-Palestinian Lebanese MP, Maarouf Saad, was shot and killed, reportedly by the Lebanese Army. His death, from his wounds, the following month, and the massacre in April of that year of 27 Palestinians and Lebanese travelling on a bus from Sabra and Shatila to the Tel al-Zaatar refugee camp by Phalangist <b>forces,</b> <b>precipitated</b> the Lebanese Civil War. Arafat was reluctant to respond with force, but many other Fatah and PLO members felt otherwise. For example, the DFLP carried out several attacks against the Lebanese Army. In 1976, an alliance of Christian militias with the backing of the Lebanese and Syrian armies besieged Tel al-Zaatar camp in east Beirut. The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of Damour, a Phalangist stronghold where they massacred 684 people and wounded many more. The Tel al-Zaatar camp fell to the Christians after a six-month siege in which thousands of Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed. Arafat and Abu Jihad blamed themselves for not successfully organizing a rescue effort.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on some {{physical}} investigations of the properties and organization of some components of intercellular space. The work was divided into two parts: (l) {{an investigation of the}} contribution of hyaluronic acid and collagen to the structure of Wharton's jelly found in human umbilical cord, and (2) an investigation of neutral salt soluble collagen. (1) Investigation of the contribution of hyaluronic acid and collagen to the structure of Wharton's jelly found in human umbilical cord. After a study of the swelling of the interstitial tissue of the cord in various media, and the effect of swelling on the extractability of hyaluronic acid, a method was adopted for extracting the material. Care was taken to obtain fresh cords and to avoid degradation during extraction. The Wharton's jelly was dissected out, removing blood vessels and as far as possible the fibrous tissue associated with them. The Wharton's jelly was finely minced and the mince was treated with small volumes of solvent (water and buffer solutions) and, after being left to stand, was cleared by centrifugation. The conditions of extraction were studied and the stability of the extract on storage. A number of successive extractions were required to remove the bull of the polysaccharide, and more severe treatment could yield still further extracts. Sedimentation and viscosity studies on polysaccharide extracted by mild methods showed that its physicochemical properties resemble those of the hyaluronic acid of the synovial fluid of human knew joints fairly closely. An investigation of these synovial fluids was made in collaboration with Drs. J.  E. Stanier and A.  G. Ogston. The structure of Wharton's jelly was investigated by visible and electron microscopy. This suggested that there is a network of unbranched collagen fibres, many of them very fine (down to 100 A diameter), which lie freely in the jelly. Similar fibres were found in cords which had not reached full term. Material was examined after digestion with hyaluronidase and with collagenase. Electron micrographs of hyaluronic acid suggested the possibility of a fibrous structure; but doubts were cast upon this interpretation by studies of the appearance of "pearl-strings" in random distributions of small glass spheres. These findings led to a hypothesis, of the structure of intercellular spaces, and specifically of the parts played by water, hyaluronic acid, and collagen fibres. Theoretical considerations show that a combination of a fibrous network and an incompressible fluid can provide an important contribution to the mechanical strength of the tissue, provided that the incompressible fluid, water, is not permitted to move freely through the network. Experimentally it was shown that hyaluronic acids a considerable resistance to water moving through them, and calculation showed that a collagen network could in turn offer sufficient resistance to a solution of hyaluronic acid, to hinder the movement of water. Sedimentation and viscosity studies on native and degraded hyaluronic acids showed the importance of a high degree of polymerisation in producing this effect, and suggested a mode of action of hyaluronidase as it is employed in clinical practice. Further investigations, by means of model systems, were obstructed both by the lack of a suitable fibre-forming system and by the difficulty in determining the proportions of collagen and hyaluronic acid in tissues. (2) Investigation of neutral salt soluble collagen. This was first undertaken as a simple investigation of the physico-cheimical properties of neutral salt soluble collagen in solution. The study was hampered by the ease with which solutions <b>forced</b> <b>precipitates</b> under the conditions of investigation. An investigation of this precipitate formation was therefore undertaken, which showed that the precipitates are fibrous and have the typical cross striations of collagen as examined in the electron microscope. Above a certain temperature, determined by the other conditions such pH, fibres were rapidly precipitated from the solution, and with care the process could be partly reversed by cooling. By these means it was shown that the original material consists of three components: A, which reversibly precipitates as fibres on warming and re-dissolves on cooling; B, which does not precipitate; and C which precipitates but does not readily re-dissolve on cooling. Polarimetric studies showed a method of distinguishing between native material and gelatin formed from it. A method was devised for separating the three components of neutral salt soluble collagen. Sedimentation, viscosity, flow birefringence and ultraviolet absorbtion studies were made on solutions of the unfractionated material, of the separate fractions, and of a control solution which had undergone the fractionation procedure but whose fractions had not been separated. These studies indicated that all the materials are similar and consist of elongated particles having a "molecular weight" of 5 × 10 5. All the fractions except A were found to be heterogeneous. Electron microscope studies were also made on these solutions, and these suggested that fraction C consists of only partly disintegrated fibres. </p...|$|R
40|$|Postcolonial Polysystems: The Production and Reception of Translated Children’s Literature in South Africa is an {{original}} and provocative {{contribution to the}} field of children’s literature research and translation studies. It draws on a variety of methodologies to provide a perspective, both product- and process-oriented, on the ways in which translation contributes to the production of children’s literature in South Africa, with a special interest in language and power, as well as post- and neocolonial hybridity. The book explores the forces that affect the use of translation in producing children’s literature in various languages in South Africa, and shows how some of these <b>forces</b> <b>precipitate</b> in the selection, production and reception of translated children’s books in Afrikaans and English. It breaks new ground in its interrogation of aspects of translation theory within the multilingual and postcolonial context of South Africa, as well as in its innovative experimental investigation of the reception of domesticating and foreignising strategies in translated picture books.
