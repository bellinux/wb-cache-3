While Anglin alleged the president could be under control of a purportedly Jewish deep state, weev said in a video on the website that he retained faith in Trump from his <b>past</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{made little}} or no {{distinction}} between Pussy Riot and Voina, incorrectly attributing <b>past</b> <b>actions</b> of Voina to Pussy Riot. In particular, a notorious performance by Voina in St. Petersburg, {{in which a woman}} stole a chicken from a supermarket by stuffing it in her vagina, is sometimes cited by detractors of Pussy Riot. However, {{there is no evidence that}} members of Moscow-based Pussy Riot participated in this action.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) greets {{his friend}} Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello) and his {{assistant}} Lt. Commander Dexter Remmick (Robert Schenkkan) aboard the Enterprise. For classified reasons, Quinn has ordered Remmick to perform {{an investigation of the}} Enterprise and its crew and expects Picard to fully co-operate. Remmick's query causes tension in the crew, particularly when he questions the trustworthiness of the senior staff based on their personal logs and <b>past</b> <b>actions.</b> A young cadet, having failed the Starfleet Academy entrance examination, attempts to run away in a shuttlecraft but ends up drifting. Picard is able to direct the cadet to pilot the shuttle away from a planet by bouncing off the atmosphere.|$|E

5000|$|Past future perfect {{or future}} perfect {{in the past}} (in Bulgarian бъдеще предварително време в миналото, future {{preliminary}} tense in the past) expresses a <b>past</b> <b>action</b> which is future {{with respect to a}} <b>past</b> <b>action</b> which itself is prior to another <b>past</b> <b>action.</b> It is made up of the past imperfect of ща [...] "will, want", the particle да [...] "to", the present tense of the verb съм [...] "be" [...] (in other words, the past future tense of съм, but not the form with бъда) and the past active aorist participle of the main verb, which agrees in number and gender with the subject.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his <b>past</b> <b>actions</b> and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} threat of the Darkness – {{revealed}} {{over the course of the}} series to be God's 'sister', sacrificed to create the world – Castiel agrees to act as Lucifer's vessel when Lucifer claims to be the only one with the power to defeat the Darkness, since God is absent and all other archangels are dead or insane. After killing Rowena, apparently the only person capable of re-opening the Cage, Lucifer spends some time re-establishing his power base in Hell while acting as Castiel to interact with the Winchesters and follow their research into Amara, but his true identity is revealed after the Winchesters attempt to travel back in time to recover a Hand of God from a submarine before it sank in 1943. Castiel is able to regain control long enough to explain the situation to Sam and stop himself killing his friend, Dean subsequently banishing Lucifer and vowing to find a way to free Castiel from his control. Crowley, forced to act as Lucifer's slave, is forced on the run after he fails to kill Lucifer with another salvaged Hand of God. The Winchesters manage to get through to Castiel when preparing for a new confrontation with Amara, but Castiel resolves to remain as Lucifer's Vessel until her defeat, only for the Hand of God to fail against Amara's power. With Castiel/Lucifer now Amara's prisoner, she decides to torture an archangel to try and lure God out, leaving the Winchesters to speculate that Lucifer couldn't use the Hand of God due to the fact that he is a fallen archangel. Lucifer is eventually rescued when God returns – revealed to be Chuck, the author who wrote the Winchester Gospels – with God/Chuck healing Lucifer and apologising for his <b>past</b> <b>actions.</b> Although Lucifer is apparently killed in the later confrontation with Amara, Castiel is healed and returned to control of his body, although he is then banished when a member of the London branch of the Men of Letters attacks the bunker to punish Sam's <b>past</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{was then}} {{traded to the}} SmackDown brand on June 29, and {{underwent}} surgery for the torn abdominal muscle on July 2. He made his return on the August 7 episode of SmackDown as the special guest referee in the World Heavyweight Championship match between his brother, Jeff, and CM Punk, and helped Jeff retain the championship by counting the pinfall. The following week Hardy saved his brother when CM Punk and The Hart Dynasty attacked both Jeff and John Morrison, turning into a fan favorite again. On the August 21 episode of SmackDown, after apologizing for his <b>past</b> <b>actions</b> towards Jeff and admitting {{that he was not}} behind any of Jeff's accidents, he had his first match back after his injury when he teamed with Jeff and John Morrison to defeat The Hart Dynasty and CM Punk, when Matt pinned Punk.|$|E
50|$|Past future perfect is a {{compound}} form {{used to express}} a <b>past</b> <b>action</b> which is future {{with respect to a}} <b>past</b> <b>action</b> which itself is prior to another past action; it is made up of the past imperfect of ща, the particle да the present tense of the verb съм and the past participle of the verb (e.g. щях да съм учил, , 'I would have studied').|$|R

5|$|In Luxerion, Lightning investigates {{a series}} of murders where all the victims match the {{physical}} description of the savior. During her journey, she is followed by Noel, who has become obsessed with a prophecy that he must kill Lightning to realize a better world and reunite with Yeul. The two briefly ally to rout the Children of Etro, responsible for the murders, then later do battle. Lightning uses Noel's rage to make him realize and accept his mistakes, lifting his burden. After this, she meets up with Vanille in the Order's cathedral. Vanille shows Lightning a place within the cathedral where {{the souls of the}} dead have gathered. Vanille is being prepared for a ritual to take place on the final day that will apparently purify the souls. She hopes to atone for <b>past</b> <b>actions</b> by doing so.|$|E
5|$|After this event, Vanille remains with Fang {{in crystal}} stasis within the pillar: from there, the two end up seeing {{everything}} that is going on, remaining unaffected by {{the changes in the}} timeline. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, though still held in the pillar, Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in. At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it to atone for her <b>past</b> <b>actions.</b> On the final day, Lightning and Fang persuade Vanille to use her power to free the dead and enable them to be reborn.|$|E
5|$|Lace was {{released}} from Dartmoor in July 1987 and settled in nearby Brixham, Devon, returning to visit family in Portsmouth in 1988. He intimated that he was depressed about his <b>past</b> <b>actions</b> and in December 1988 gave away his possessions and resigned from his job. He was last seen by friends between 7–8 December and was found dead by his landlord on 9December. Postmortem examination revealed superficial wounds to his wrist, ingestion of analgesics and a plastic bag over his head. The {{cause of death was}} determined to be asphyxiation and his death was determined as suicide by the coroner. Lace was buried in Kingston Cemetery, Portsmouth on 20December 1988. After a cross check on the DNA database found that the DNA from the murder scene showed a partial match with that of a relative of Lace, detectives requested a sample from Andrina Foster, Lace's biological sister, which gave a familial match with the murderer's DNA. As a result of this development, Lace's body was exhumed on 12 August 2009 for DNA testing as part of Operation Iceberg.|$|E

50|$|When self-directed {{negative}} feelings {{are a result}} of negative <b>past</b> <b>action,</b> self-forgiveness does not mean ignoring or excusing offenses, but rather practicing self-compassion while taking full responsibility for <b>past</b> <b>action.</b> In this way, self-forgiveness may increase people's willingness to repent for wrongdoing. Despite this research, there is not yet a clear link between self-forgiveness and pro-social behavior. It would seem that accepting responsibility for negative actions leads to pro-social behavior, and coupling acceptance with self-forgiveness increases this effect.|$|R

50|$|Like the perfect, the {{subordinate}} forms {{can take the}} suffix -m to express a series of non-past actions. This can be combined with näbbär to express a habitual <b>past</b> <b>action.</b>|$|R

25|$|Of these, the {{imperfect}} {{and perfect}} {{can be considered}} to represent a past tense combined with imperfective and perfective aspect respectively (the first is used for habitual or ongoing <b>past</b> <b>actions</b> or states, and the second for completed actions). The pluperfect and future perfect are relative tenses, referring to the past relative to a past time or relative to a future time.|$|E
25|$|In January 2002, Peggy {{receives}} news Frank {{has died}} in a car crash in Spain and travels there for his funeral, where she's stunned to see him in attendance.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the compound forms for completed <b>past</b> <b>actions,</b> Portuguese also retains a synthetic pluperfect: so, ele tinha falado and ele havia falado ("he had spoken") can also be expressed as ele falara. However, the simple (one-word) pluperfect is losing ground to the compound forms. While pluperfect forms like falara are generally understood, their use is limited mostly to some regions of Portugal and to written language. In Brazilian Portuguese they are used nearly exclusively in the printed language, though even in that environment the -ra synthetic pluperfect has been losing ground to the compound form using tinha in the last decades.|$|E
5000|$|The Present Perfect is {{used for}} every <b>past</b> <b>action</b> without strong {{connotation}} on the aspect of the verb, otherwise speakers prefer Imperfect or Past Progressive tenses. Notably, Lombard {{does not have a}} Preterite.|$|R
5000|$|Imperfect, Past: {{reflecting}} {{not just}} a <b>past</b> <b>action</b> but also suggesting the process with which it was being done, e.g: [...] "I brought the horse to a halt", [...] "I began to hear" ...|$|R
2500|$|Another aspectual {{distinction}} in Chichewa is that between perfect and past. A perfect tense is one which carries an implication {{that the result}} of a <b>past</b> <b>action</b> still holds at the present time; for example, wabwera [...] "he has come" [...] implies that the person is still here. The past tenses in Chichewa carry exactly the opposite implication, namely that the result of the <b>past</b> <b>action</b> no longer holds; for example the Recent Past tense anabwéra [...] "he came" [...] implies that the person has now gone. This kind of tense is known in modern linguistics as discontinuous past. It differs from the English Past Simple, which is generally neutral in implication.|$|R
