5000|$|The grip {{in charge}} of {{operating}} the camera dollies and camera cranes is called the dolly grip. They place, level, and move the dolly track, then push and <b>pull</b> the <b>dolly,</b> and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders.|$|R
50|$|On 26 July 2012 Devine {{screened}} {{a documentary}} chronicling {{her life as}} a drag queen. The documentary, Davina Defined, included interviews with other Dublin nightlife figures, including the drag queen <b>Dolly</b> Grip and <b>clips</b> of her performances.|$|R

Several men are seated on a bench at left, examining a piece of paper. Several buildings can be seen {{along the sides of}} the narrow paved street, and four horse- and donkey-drawn vehicles are visible. A Japanese barber is at left...|$|R
5000|$|In cinematography, the dolly grip is a {{dedicated}} technician trained {{to operate the}} camera dolly. This technician places, levels, and moves the dolly track, then pushes and <b>pulls</b> the <b>dolly</b> and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders. If the dolly has a moveable vertical axis, such as a hydraulic arm, then the dolly grip also operates the [...] "boom". If both axes are used simultaneously, this type of dolly shot {{is known as a}} compound move.|$|R
5000|$|In cinematography, the dolly grip {{places and}} moves the dolly track where required, and then pushes and <b>pulls</b> the <b>dolly</b> along that track during filming. A dolly grip {{works closely with}} the camera crew to perfect these complex {{movements}} through rehearsals. For moving shots, dolly grips may also push the wheeled platform that holds the microphone and Boom Operator. The dolly is a cart that the tripod and camera (and occasionally the camera crew) rest on. It transports the camera without bumps and visual interruptions throughout a shot. It is commonly used to follow beside an actor to give the audience the sense of walking with the actor, or as the actor.|$|R
500|$|Doug Jones and {{the other}} actors who played The Gentlemen had {{previous}} experience performing as monsters and were professional mimes as well. This gave them an elegant grace, especially in their hand movements. Their floating effect was accomplished by suspending them from cranes with wires (digitally removed in post-production), or by <b>pulling</b> them on <b>dollies.</b> The cast found the actors in make-up and costume to be terrifying in broad daylight, and Whedon {{was so impressed with}} the physical movements of The Gentlemen that he admitted on the DVD commentary that his mocking of mimes in general [...] "went down about 40%" [...] after the episode was filmed.|$|R
50|$|Angelessa gets {{dressed as}} “Olympia” {{for her next}} match with Tiger. Mother steps in saying that she can’t {{go out there and}} play the face (good girl) since she’s black and the crowd is full of rednecks. Mother {{complains}} to Big Man. During the argument, <b>Dolly</b> <b>pulls</b> out a 9mm pistol to break it up. Mother convinces Dani to do a lingerie match for one hundred dollars. Nola volunteers to wrestle her. They return triumphant. The match not only went well, but they got tips from the crowd after the fight. The big tag-team match is finally ready to go. Dani and Nola (as Ninjas) will job a match (take a dive) for The Knockout Sisters.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2011, a TV documentary, Dancing King: Man in the Mirror, {{was shown}} on the DMAX channel. The six part series from Mighty Fine Productions {{followed}} King {{for six months and}} showed him working on his latest production and auditioning cast members in London, New York and Monte Carlo. [...] King was joined on the audition panel by TV actress Claire Sweeney and King's own daughter Sophie from popular girl band The <b>Dolly</b> Rockers. A <b>clip</b> from the show which included his family was shown on Harry Hill's TV Burp, a British television comedy programme on ITV hosted by comedian Harry Hill. King has readily admitted that when he creates a new production, it is not necessarily his love of the particular music that drives him but whether the show idea can be financially viable. In April 2011, King offered Jackson fan Mohamed Al-Fayed a role in the musical. The offer followed Fayed's unveiling of a statue of the singer at the Fulham Football Club ground which he owns in south London.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A chap can't pay if he hasn't got it, Carbury. A chap {{ought to}} pay of course. I've had {{a letter from}} our lawyer within the last half hour-- here it is.' And <b>Dolly</b> <b>pulled</b> a letter {{out of his pocket}} which he had opened and read indeed the last hour, but which had been duly {{delivered}} at his lodgings early in the morning. 'My governor wants to sell Pickering, and Melmotte wants to buy the place. My governor can't sell without me, and I've asked for half the plunder. I know what's what. My interest in the property is greater than his. It isn't much of a place, and they are talking of £50,000, over and above the debt upon it. £25,000 would pay off what I owe on my own property, and make me very square. From what this fellow says I suppose they're going to give in to my terms.' ...|$|R
50|$|When using a dolly, which {{generally}} {{has to be}} equipped with lights and a license plate, rigid trucks {{can be used to}} <b>pull</b> semi-trailers. The <b>dolly</b> is equipped with a fifth wheel to which the trailer is coupled. Because the dolly attaches to a pintle hitch on the truck, maneuvering a trailer hooked to a dolly is different from maneuvering a fifth wheel trailer. Backing the vehicle requires same technique as backing an ordinary truck/full trailer combination, though the dolly/semi setup is probably longer, thus requiring more space for maneuvering. The tractor/semi-trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks, since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels, and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load, allowing a short (lightweight) crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling. Also construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor/semi-trailer setup.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{overall length}} in the EU and EEA member states was 18.75 m with a maximum weight of 40 tonnes, or 44 tonnes if {{carrying}} an ISO container. However, rules limiting the semi-trailers to 16.5 m and 18.75 m are met with trucks carrying a standardized 7.82 m body with one additional 7.82 m body on tow as a trailer. 25.25 metre truck combinations were developed under the branding of EcoCombi which influenced the name of EuroCombi for an ongoing standardization effort where such truck combinations shall be legal to operate in all jurisdictions of the European Economic Area. With the 50% increase in cargo weight, the fuel efficiency increases {{with an average of}} 20% with a corresponding relative decrease in carbon emissions and with the added benefit of one third fewer trucks on the road. The 1996 EU regulation defines a Europe Module System (EMS) as it was implemented in Sweden. The wording of EMS combinations and EuroCombi are now used interchangeably to point to truck combinations as specified in the EU document; however apart from Sweden and Finland the EuroCombi is only allowed to operate on specific tracks in other EU member states. Since 1996, when Sweden and Finland formally won a final exemption from the European Economic Area rules with 60 tonne and 25.25 m combinations, all other From 2006, 25.25 m truck trailer combinations are to be allowed on restricted routes within Germany, following a similar (on-going) trial in The Netherlands. Similarly, Denmark has allowed 25.25 m combinations on select routes. These vehicles will run a 60 tonne weight limit. Two types are to be used: 1) a 26 tonne truck <b>pulling</b> a <b>dolly</b> and semi-trailer, or 2) an articulated tractor unit pulling a B-double, member states gained the ability to adopt the same rules. In Italy the maximum permitted weight (unless exceptional transport is authorized) is 44 tonnes for any kind of combination with five axles or more.|$|R
