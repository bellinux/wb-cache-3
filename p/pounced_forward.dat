6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to risk it," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "I see a stick down there, and I'll grab {{that as soon as}} I land," [...] and down he dropped, and caught up the stick with alacrity. The dog <b>pounced</b> <b>forward,</b> struck the sharp barbs of the fence, and retreated, howling dismally with pain. Then he made another advance, with like results.|$|E
5000|$|Swarbrick licked up {{the pass}} like a {{sprinter}} head {{down for the}} finish. Sheer pace carried him on. Tonkin could not get to him. He swerved out, his flying feet not brushing the chalk from the touch line. Pipers dash to the corner was too late. Swarbrick <b>pounced</b> <b>forward</b> - he was clear ! The 70,000 crowd were on their toes. Wild arms waved to high heaven. The Twickenham Valley, pinched between the canyon grandstands, reverberated with thundering clanging to a crescendo. He was not only clear - he was through ! He was indeed over the line, safely, marvellously home. He had but to fall {{on his face and}} England would be a try up. A dead man must have scored us three points. And then, as Swarbrick hurled himself down, a pin-pointed rocket caught him, swept him through mid-air, ball and all, into the no-mans land of touch in goal. It was Trevor Allan, the forlorn hope, saving his side after all was lost.|$|E
60|$|BOHUN (<b>pouncing</b> <b>forward</b> again). Stop. You're {{going to}} tell me about your feelings, Mr. Crampton. Don't: I sympathize with them; but they're not my business. Tell us exactly what you want: that's what we have to get at.|$|R
5000|$|Vapula {{appears in}} Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin as a purple lion with red {{markings}} and mane and griffon wings. It attacks by <b>pouncing</b> <b>forward</b> and by spewing a hex from its mouth to curse the character. The player may learn the Hex spell by defeating it.|$|R
60|$|No one in {{the stands}} saw where it went. But they heard the crack, saw the New York shortstop stagger and then <b>pounce</b> <b>forward</b> {{to pick up the}} ball and speed it toward the plate. The catcher was quick to tag the {{incoming}} runner, and then snap the ball to first base, completing a double play.|$|R
6000|$|Frank Muller made {{no answer}} in words. He simply took one step <b>forward,</b> <b>pounced</b> upon his insubordinate follower, {{and with a}} single swing of his {{athletic}} frame sent him flying headlong through the door, so that this free and independent burgher lit upon {{his head in the}} passage, smashing his pipe and considerably damaging his best feature--his nose. [...] "There," [...] said Muller, shutting the door after him, [...] "that {{is the only way to}} deal with such a fellow. And now let me bid you good-day, Miss Jess," [...] and he extended his hand, which Jess took, rather coldly it must be owned.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the 1995-96 season, Smith became a scout for the Colorado Avalanche. There, he enjoyed perhaps his finest moment, {{deconstructing}} Scotty Bowman's left-wing lock during the 1996 playoffs and neutralizing it as Colorado beat the favoured Red Wings and {{went on to win the}} Stanley Cup. [...] "Smith noticed the Red Wings' left wingers, who stayed back to help the defense, were small," [...] The Sporting News reported, [...] "so the Avalanche made sure to softly dump the puck into the right corner, where the Avs' <b>forwards</b> <b>pounced.</b> This wore down Detroit's left wingers." [...] Colorado won the series, and by the time the Avalanche swept the Florida Panthers in the finals, Detroit general manager Ken Holland was publicly crediting Smith with that key assist in Colorado's successful run. The Avalanche won another Cup in 2001, and Smith's name is now engraved on the Stanley Cup. He currently serves as the Avalanche's director of player personnel.|$|R
