25|$|Whilst the {{proliferation}} of freesheet newspapers continues to escalate, {{the impact on the}} environment is fast becoming a major concern to many environmentalists. Over 44 million editions are being produced every day worldwide; it takes 12 established trees to make one tonne of newsprint, which is enough to print 14,000 editions of an average-size tabloid. That means a daily usage of newsprint of a little over 3,142 tonnes. Which, in turn, means the felling of 37,714 trees. On average around 70% of paper used by the newspaper industry is claimed to be recycled. So after recycled paper usage, over 11,314 trees are being felled daily to feed the freesheet print presses in over 58 countries. Also, whilst the increased use of recycled paper is welcomed by many, the extensive bleaching (especially use of chlorine) and other chemical processes to make <b>reclaimed</b> <b>paper</b> blank again for reuse are not lessening the concerns of environmentalists.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the history of traditional Korean papermaking within its historical context: {{the relationship with the}} development of papermaking techniques in neighbouring countries were examined though primary focus was given to the development of materials and tools used. In order to understand the characteristics of historical Korean paper and the development of tools and materials used over time, surveys on Korean and Japanese collections at the British Library and a private Korean collection were carried out. Korean objects dated between the 12 th and the 18 th century were examined. The data collected from the surveys was compiled in a database and analysed. The data analysis revealed that the thickness of paper was closely related to the thickness of bamboo splints used in manufacture of papermaking screens. Research also included a summary of morphological characteristics and photomicrographs of fibres from nine indigenous plants which were used for traditional Korean papermaking. These standard fibre samples were used as reference to identify the fibres of unknown paper objects surveyed. This fibre identification confirmed the main material to be paper mulberry and, additionally, provided information on supplementary materials including rice straw, reed, hemp, and mechanical wood pulp of coniferous origin — a material that has not been recognised as one of the common supplementary materials in previous studies. In order to provide {{a better understanding of the}} materials and tools used in traditional papermaking in Korea, three papermaking experiments were carried out. Firstly, a papermaking experiment was conducted using a mucilaginous substance derived from the roots of Hibiscus Manihot, which has been employed as a formation aid for considerable time in Korea and Japan. Paper samples were then analysed to investigate the physical influence of the substance on the sample sheets. Secondly, a fixed laid screen was designed and sheets were produced using it. The intention here was to support a hypothesis which was proposed by the author in order to explain a possible chronological development of papermaking mould structure in China and its potential spread to neighbouring countries. The last experiment was conducted to simulate a technique of papermaking with <b>reclaimed</b> <b>paper.</b> Although the use of <b>reclaimed</b> <b>paper</b> was recorded in early literature, details of the process were unknown...|$|R

Until the cost of fossil fuels began rising rapidly, flue gas below 600 F was considered economically unworthy of <b>reclaim.</b> This <b>paper</b> will describe the latest system installation at the John Deere WeIland Works. Partially funded by the Canadian and Ontario Governments in order to demonstrate new energy saving technology, the Beckett Model 2002 employs a heat exchanger which does double duty. During low demand periods, the unit is gas-fired and produces 150 psi steam at high efficiency. In the fall, the heat exchanger is converted to accept flue gas from the large original water tube boilers. The flue gas heats water, which preheats make-up air and boiler feedwater. Several of the Beckett Systems presently operating use year-round heat recovery exchangers on constant loads.

40|$|Water {{reclamation}} and reuse {{provides a}} unique and viable opportunity to augment traditional water supplies. As a multi-disciplined and important element of water resources development and management, water reuse can help to close the loop between water supply and wastewater disposal. Effective water reuse requires integration of water and reclaimed water supply functions. The successful development of this dependable water resource depends upon close examination and synthesis of elements from infrastructure and facilities planning, wastewater treatment plant siting, treatment process reliability, economic and financial analyses, and water utility management. In this paper, fundamental concepts of water reuse are discussed including definitions, historical developments, the role of water recycling in the hydrologic cycle, categories of water reuse, water quality criteria and regulatory requirements, and technological innovations for the safe use of <b>reclaimed</b> water.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} wetland reclamation in England {{between the}} eighth and sixteenth centuries, {{with a special}} focus on the Pevensey Levels during the fourteenth century. Coastal marsh communities had access to significant raw materials and resources as well as increased agricultural productivity on sections of <b>reclaimed</b> land. This <b>paper</b> will examine medieval and Early Modern perceptions of wetland environments over time and evaluate scholarly theories of wetland marginality. Medieval populations could not effectively access the benefits wetlands provided without great exposure to risk factors, including flooding. Medieval coastal marsh communities in England developed a culture heavily influenced by constant exposure to risk that demonstrated high levels of cooperation, resilience, and ingenuity. The medieval risk culture represented in English marshes also produced risk sensitivity that could inform decisions regarding the probable success of reclamation efforts and their potential profitability. The 1396 Commission of Sewers for the Pevensey Levels, East Sussex demonstrates the negligence of landowners, whose economic interests relied upon successful wetland reclamation and flood defences. This legal case, combined with national and local economic analyses and {{an investigation into the}} role of climate change and increased storm activity along the English coast during the fourteenth century, will facilitate a discussion relating to negligence within medieval wetland risk cultures during a period of increased risk...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analytical {{study of a}} major landslide that occurred in a newly dredged slope during port development {{in the city of}} Tianjin, northern China. The slope comprised mainly underconsolidated and submerged soft soils. The landslide consisted of a number of individual slides that occurred sequentially and extended retrogressively and laterally into the <b>reclaimed</b> land. The <b>paper</b> proposes a slope stability assessment methodology for the examination of such slope failures, with retrogressive and lateral extension into reclaimed land. Both the total and the effective stress approaches are adopted in the slope stability assessment. Eight different sets of soil shear strength parameters are used in the assessment. They were determined by using different methods in the laboratory and in the field or by back analysis. The assessment results indicate that the total stress approach, together with undrained vane strength values, gives the best result in the stability assessment of the original dredged slope and the subsequent failed slopes. The paper further examines the factors that might have caused or triggered the occurrence of the landslide. Backfilling of a thick general soil layer and a sand cushion for vacuum preloading of the hydraulic fill in the reclaimed land might have rendered the entire slope marginally stable. Lowering of the tidal level might also have had an effect in triggering the landslide. The engineering approach and results presented in this study could be useful in the design and construction of dredged slopes in underconsolidated soft soils. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Mineral {{exploration}} is {{in a race}} {{to employ}} drilling technology that can perform the exploration and drilling investigation in a fast and inexpensive manner. After an extensive study of the available drilling technologies in the market, coiled tubing was chosen {{as a tool to}} be employed for mineral exploration due to its flexible mobility and ease of operation with minimum number of personnel. Since coiled tubing technology is primarily used in oil and gas industry, it was important to re-design the coiled tube rig to drill hard rocks in a fast and feasible manner. The main requirements were to drill the smallest feasible hole diameter and go as deep in the ground as possible, in the shortest reasonable time. The drilled rock particles, cuttings, are to be collected and analysed at the surface for their metal mineral contents. The process also needs to be repeated multiple times at different locations for mapping, without the need to change the tube on the rig due to failure or potential failure. The focus of the new designed coiled tube, for drilling and mineral exploration, is three fold. First is to increase the rate of penetration (ROP) in drilling by designing a small high speed turbo motor. Second is to determine the controlling parameters of cuttings transport to effectively lift the cuttings to the surface for analysis and third is to minimize the overall weight of the rig for manoeuvring and to prolong the life span of the coiled tube string. In this paper, a small downhole turbo motor, 5 cm outer diameter, is designed to achieve a rotation speed of up to 10, 000 rpm to fit on a small bit, coiled tube drilling assembly. The motor design utilised multiple finite volume and finite element analysis software for fluid flow study and fluid structural interaction analysis. The paper is also introducing the concept of flow slurry loop that is designed to lift the cutting particles to the surface for mineralisation analysis. The controlling parameters of the cuttings transportation are the particles physical properties such as size, density, concentration and shape, as well as the rheological properties of the carrying fluid, drilled hole angle, as well as the fluid flow rate and flow dynamics within the annulus gap between the coiled tube and drilled hole. Such parameters are addressed via experimental work as well as numerical analysis. The paper is also presenting the selection and testing procedure of the material type for the coiled tube string. The tube needs to be light in weight for rig transportation and to drill few dozens of drill investigations holes before failing due to fatigue. A fatigue bending machine is designed to test the endurance limit of candidate materials for coiled tube string and performance index methodology is followed for material selection of the optimum material. The coiled tube rig is designed to be light in weight for transportation and relocation.
