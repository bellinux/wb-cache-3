5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or <b>precast</b> molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E

5|$|The built {{environment}} around Coatbridge's town centre is characterised by its mixture of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sandstone buildings and late twentieth-century <b>precast</b> concrete shops. The leafy Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas {{to the west}} and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various twentieth-century local authority housing buildings. Several high rise flats dominate the skyline. Due to the decline of industries, several private housing estates have been built on reclaimed land.|$|E
5|$|The {{demise of}} the once {{thriving}} canal and maltings businesses brought about a serious decline in Banagher's fortunes, including a significant population decrease. However, a number of businesses kept {{many people in the}} locality employed during lean times. The most notable of these was Bord na Móna, a semi-state company founded in 1946 to manage the harvesting of peat from Ireland's bogs, the most extensive of which are located in the midlands. However, the advancement of mechanised harvesting, the exhaustion of the bogs and the closure of a number of peat-fired power stations, means that this is no longer a significant employer in the region. Green Isle Foods had a facility just outside Banagher and provided good employment during the 1970s and 1980s. It was taken out of production some years ago and is now used as a storage facility only. The largest industry in Banagher these days is Banagher <b>Precast</b> Concrete Limited, a company specialising in <b>precast</b> concrete structures. The company employs approximately 150 people {{and was one of the}} largest concrete firms in the country, employing over 400 people at its peak in 2008. It has supplied components for many major projects, including the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park, Channel Tunnel, the Dublin Port Tunnel, Thomond Park and the Limerick Tunnel, and most recently Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. Other notable employers include Banagher Sawmills and the cruise liner businesses located at the marina.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The Construction {{industry}} is a major generator of waste material. Construction waste should be minimized at source. If we are to significantly reduce the level of construction waste designers should consider reducing construction waste during the design process. The majority of construction waste is generated from the concreting process. In general, any reduction in on-site concreting leads to waste reduction. <b>Precasting</b> and prefabrication therefore offers significant opportunities for the reduction of waste. If <b>precasting</b> is adopted there are significant implications for the design phase of the project. Additional information is needed by design staff, construction expertise is required {{as part of the}} design process. This paper shows how information modeling and Design Structure Matrix, (DSM), techniques enable designers to model and understand the implications of such decisions within the detailed design process...|$|R

5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts and within a few weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the <b>precast</b> concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} of {{multi-storey}} car parks {{since the middle of}} the twentieth century, many constructions of such structures have been using <b>precast</b> concrete to reduce the construction time. The design involves putting parking structure parts together. The parts of <b>precast</b> concrete include multi-storey structural wall panels, interior and exterior columns, structural floors, girders, wall panels, stairs and slabs. The <b>precast</b> concrete parts are transported using flatbed semi-trailers to the sites. The structural floor modules may need to be laid tilted during the transportation in order to cover as large floor area as possible while they can be easily transported on the roadways. The modules are lifted using <b>precast</b> concrete lifting anchor systems at the sites for assembly. Decorations may include using of covers to close the holes in the <b>precast</b> concrete that contains the lifting anchors, and installing facades to the exterior of the structures.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{therapists}} {{often use}} casting {{as an adjunct}} to traditional management of patients with brain injury. Casts generally are used on these patients for one of two reasons: 1) to increase range of motion with the use of serial casting or 2) to augment functional treatment with the use of inhibitive casting. This clinical report describes serial and inhibitive casts and introduces a <b>precasting</b> work sheet that promotes the selection of appropriate casting patients and necessary planning. The work sheet guides the therapist through an assessment of patient data relevant to casting, including passive range of motion, postural tone and abnormal reflexes, and voluntary movement.

25|$|City Hall was {{constructed}} using mainly cast-in-place and <b>precast</b> Portland cement concrete and some masonry. About {{half of the}} concrete used in the building was precastroughly 22,000 separate componentsand the other half was poured-in-place concrete. All of the concrete used in the structure, excluding that of the columns, is mixed with a light, coarse rock. While {{the majority of the}} building is created using concrete, <b>precast</b> and poured-in-place concrete are distinguishable by their different colors and textures. For example, cast-in-place elements are coarse and grainy textured because the concrete was poured into fir wood frames to mold it, while <b>precast</b> elements, such as trusses and supports, were set in steel molds to gain smooth, clean surfaces. This distinction can also be seen {{in the fact that the}} exterior poured-in-place pieces are of type I cement, a lightly colored cement, while the exterior <b>precast</b> components use type II cement, a dark colored cement. The base of the building is dark with brick, Welsh quarry tiles, mahogany walls, and darker concrete. As the building ascends, the overall color lightens, as lighter concrete is used.|$|E

25|$|Deep-set {{windows in}} {{rectilinear}} shapes, a Breuer trademark, were {{planned for the}} facade. The window frames were made of <b>precast</b> concrete. The building was the first Breuer-designed structure in the United States to use a <b>precast</b> concrete facade, {{and this was the}} first federal building to be built of <b>precast</b> concrete. The facade was designed to be load-bearing, with the panels on the second, third, and fourth floors designed to carry the weight of the building. The window frames on the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors were slightly thinner, because although they were not load-bearing they had to contain HVAC piping. The panels on the middle floors required the least amount of fabrication, according to architect Herbert Beckhard (an associate in Breuer's firm who helped design the building), as they did not need to bear as much load nor contain much piping. The windows do not meet {{at the corner of the}} concrete frame. Pipes from the I-395 tunnel (which runs below the building) run up through the building's walls and vent at the corners of the window frames, dispersing automobile exhaust fumes high in the air. Each concrete unit is three feet (0.9 metres) thick and weighs almost 13 tons (11.8 metric tonnes). The firm which supplied the window frames had no previous experience producing architectural concrete, but instead had supplied <b>precast</b> forms for bridges and parking garages.|$|E

It has been explained that the specification required in DIN 1045 E with regard to structural strengths can, with some accuracy, be maintained without any difficulty, but that it should suitably be completed by stating a fractile. On the basis of the test results it was recommended to modify the specified strength of higher concrete qualities stated in DIN 1045 E as a constant value beta [R] = 0. 7. beta W[28].
