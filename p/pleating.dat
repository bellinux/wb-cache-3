25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways insects can be fossilized and preserved including compressions and impressions, concretions, mineral replication, charcoalified (fusainized) remains, and their trace remains. Compressions and Impressions are the most extensive types of insect fossils, occurring in rocks from the Carboniferous to Recent. Impressions are like a cast or mold of a fossil insect, showing its form and even some relief, like <b>pleating</b> in the wings, but usually little or no color from the cuticle. Compressions preserve remains of the cuticle, so color distinguishes structure. In exceptional situations, microscopic features such as microtrichia on sclerites and wing membranes are even visible, but preservation of this scale also requires a matrix of exceptionally fine grain, such as in micritic muds and volcanic tuffs. Because arthropod sclerites are held together by membranes, which readily decompose, many fossil arthropods are known only by isolated sclerites. Far more desirable are complete fossils. Concretions are stones with a fossil at the core whose chemical composition {{differs from that of}} the surrounding matrix, usually formed as a result of mineral precipitation from decaying organisms. The most significant deposit consists of various localities of the Late Carboniferous Francis Creek Shale of the Carbondale Formation at Mazon Creek, Illinois, which are composed of shales and coal seams yielding oblong concretions. Within most concretions is a mold of an animal and sometimes a plant that is usually marine in origin.|$|E
500|$|Zahner of Kansas City, Missouri, was the {{subcontractor}} for the pavilion's ribbons, {{described as}} [...] "stainless steel panels {{that appear to}} be peeling back from the central opening".

2500|$|Accordion [...] pleats or knife pleats are a form {{of tight}} <b>pleating</b> which allows the garment to expand its shape when moving. Accordion <b>pleating</b> is also used for some dress sleeves, such as <b>pleating</b> {{the end of the}} elbow, with the {{fullness}} of the pleat gathered closely at the cuff.

2500|$|Modern kilts may be {{made with}} either box <b>pleats</b> or knife <b>pleats,</b> and can be <b>pleated</b> to the stripe or <b>pleated</b> to the sett (see main article [...] ).|$|R
50|$|A kilt can be <b>pleated</b> {{with either}} box or knife <b>pleats.</b> A knife <b>pleat</b> {{is a simple}} fold, while the box <b>pleat</b> is bulkier, {{consisting}} of two knife <b>pleats</b> back-to-back. Knife <b>pleats</b> {{are the most common}} in modern civilian kilts. Regimental traditions vary. The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders use box <b>pleats,</b> while the Black Watch make their kilts of the same tartan with knife <b>pleats.</b> These traditions were also passed on to affiliated regiments in the Commonwealth, and were retained in successor battalions to these regiments in the amalgamated Royal Regiment of Scotland.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, true <b>pleats</b> {{can be made}} by {{folding the}} knitted fabric over and {{knitting}} the matching stitches together pairwise. Any style of <b>pleat</b> can be made in this way, e.g., knife <b>pleats</b> or box <b>pleats.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Cartridge pleats {{are used}} to gather {{a large amount of}} fabric into a small {{waistband}} or armscye without adding bulk to the seam. [...] This type of <b>pleating</b> also allows the fabric of the skirt or sleeve to spring out from the seam. [...] During the 15th and 16th centuries, this form of <b>pleating</b> was popular in the garments of men and women. [...] Fabric is evenly gathered using two or more lengths of basting stitches, and the top of each pleat is whipstitched onto the waistband or armscye. [...] Cartridge <b>pleating</b> was resurrected in 1840s fashion to attach the increasingly full bell-shaped skirts to the fashionable narrow waist.|$|E

2500|$|Rolled pleats create tubular pleats which run {{the length}} of the fabric from top to bottom. [...] A piece of the fabric to be pleated is pinched and then rolled until it is flat against the rest of the fabric, forming a tube. [...] A {{variation}} on the rolled pleat is the stacked pleat, which is rolled similarly and requires at least five inches of fabric per finished pleat. [...] Both types of <b>pleating</b> create a bulky seam.|$|E
2500|$|Kingussie <b>pleats,</b> {{named after}} the town in Scotland, are a very rarely seen type of <b>pleat</b> used in some Scottish kilts. [...] They consist of a single {{centrally}} located box <b>pleat</b> {{in the rear of}} the kilt with knife <b>pleats</b> fanning out on either side.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pleats</b> {{just below}} the {{waistband}} on the front typify many styles of formal and casual trousers, including suit trousers and khakis. There may be one, two, three, or no <b>pleats,</b> which may face either direction.

2500|$|The costumes of Ovo were {{designed}} by Liz Vandal and evoke the appearance of insects. [...] The costumes were created to have areas that appear as sections to replicate the segmented bodies of insects; this was achieved by using permanent <b>pleating,</b> varying finishes, and coloring methods. [...] To also provide the illusion of exoskeletons, a mixture of fabrics were used to create both hard and soft flexible fabrics, thus providing {{the look of a}} hard shell without inhibiting the artists' movements.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{featured}} a low modern body {{line with a}} prominent waist level groove reminiscent of the then fashionable Chevrolet Corvair. [...] At a time when monocoque construction was becoming mainstream, the 24 sat on a separate and very strong tubular steel chassis: [...] it was therefore possible, even using the economically available materials of the time, to keep the window pillars relatively thin which gave the car an airy cabin and outstanding all-round visibility, while class leading structural rigidity for the body could nonetheless be claimed, thanks to the <b>pleating</b> and reinforcement of the roof panel. The tubular steel front and rear subchassis were bolted to a platform frame that comprised {{the floor and the}} flat steel sidemembers. Under the skin, the structural architecture was little changed from that of the Dyna 54.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of β-strands are arranged adjacent to other strands and form an extensive hydrogen bond network {{with their neighbors}} in which the N−H groups in the backbone of one strand establish hydrogen bonds with the C=O groups in {{the backbone of the}} adjacent strands. In the fully extended β-strand, successive side chains point straight up, then straight down, then straight up, etc. Adjacent β-strands in a β-sheet are aligned so that their Cα atoms are adjacent and their side chains point in the same direction. The [...] "pleated" [...] appearance of β-strands arises from tetrahedral chemical bonding at the Cα atom; for example, if a side chain points straight up, then the bond to the C′ must point slightly downwards, since its bond angle is approximately 109.5°. The <b>pleating</b> causes the distance between C and C to be approximately , rather than the [...] expected from two fully extended trans peptides. The [...] "sideways" [...] distance between adjacent Cα atoms in hydrogen-bonded β-strands is roughly [...]|$|E
2500|$|Plissé <b>pleats</b> are narrow <b>pleats</b> set by {{gathering}} fabric with stitches, wetting the fabric, and [...] "setting" [...] the <b>pleats</b> {{by allowing}} the wet fabric to dry under weight or tension. [...] Linen chemises or smocks <b>pleated</b> with this technique {{have been found in}} the 10th century Viking graves in Birka.|$|R
2500|$|Box <b>pleats</b> are knife <b>pleats</b> back-to-back, {{and have}} a {{tendency}} to spring out from the waistline. [...] They have the same 3:1 ratio as knife <b>pleats,</b> and may also be stacked to form [...] "stacked-" [...] or [...] "double-box pleats". [...] These stacked box <b>pleats</b> create more fullness {{and have a}} 5:1 ratio. [...] They also create a bulkier seam.

6000|$|As to bodily {129n} pride, it is discovered, that is, {{something}} of it, {{by all the}} particulars mentioned before; for though {{they are said to}} be symptoms of pride of heart, yet they are symptoms of that pride, by their shewing of themselves in the Body. You know diseases that are within, are seen oft-times by outward and visible Signs, yet by them very signs even the outside is defiled also. So all those visible signs of heart-pride, are signs of bodily pride also. But to come to more outward signs: The putting on of Gold, and Pearls, and costly array; the <b>pleating</b> of the hair, the following of fashions, the seeking by gestures to imitate the proud, either by speech, looks, dresses, goings, or other fools baubles, (of which at this time the world is full) all these, and many more, are signs, as of a proud heart, so of bodily pride also. {130b} ...|$|E

Another {{reason why}} professors are so proud, (for those {{we are talking}} of now) {{is because they are}} more apt to take example of those that are of the World, than they are to take example of those that are Saints indeed. Pride is of the world. For all that is of the world, the lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, are not of the Father but of the world. {132e} Of the world {{therefore}} Professors learn to be proud. But they should not take them for example. It will be objected, No, nor your saints neither, for you are as proud as others: Well, let them take shame that are guilty. But when I say, professors should take example for their life by those that are saints indeed, I mean as Peter says: They should take example of those that were in old time, the saints; for saints of old time were the best, therefore to these he directeth us for our pattern. Let the wives conversation be chast, and also coupled with fear.
