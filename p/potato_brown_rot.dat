In vitro, four isolates of S. maltophilia (PD 3531, PD 3532, PD 3533, and PD 3534) appeared antagonistic. The isolate (PD 3533) was screened as the most promising antagonist for the in vivo tests. In the greenhouse, the antagonist was applied directly to soil or by bacterization of potato eyepieces. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia significantly suppressed <b>potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> in Egyptian clay soil but not in Dutch clay soil. Survival of a rifampicin and chloramphenicol-resistant S. maltophilia strain PD 4560 was investigated in two pairs of clay soils, conventionally and organically managed, from Egypt and the Netherlands. The survival of S. maltophilia was significantly less in Dutch than in Egyptian soils, while the converse occurred for R. solanacearum. These results are in agreement with those obtained in the in vivo biocontrol tests.

40|$|Ralstonia solanacearum is {{a genetically}} diverse and {{geographically}} widespread plant pathogen. It {{has a wide}} host range and is a significant pathogen of <b>potato,</b> causing <b>brown</b> <b>rot.</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> {{is caused by a}} distinct, closely-related, intraspecific group: race 3, biovar 2 A.

A molecular strain-typing method principally used in clinical microbiology, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), was used to study genetic variation within a collection of 106 R. solanacearum isolates, principally race 3 biovar 2 A isolates from potato, S. dulcamara and contaminated water sources. Twenty-seven isolates from contaminated water and S. dulcamara from Scotland and other isolates from diverse geographic locations, from a variety of diseased plants and the environment, were resolved into 16 sequence types. A subsequent follow-up to the first experiment was carried out by looking at more variable genes within the race 3, biovar 2 A genome and again similar or identical relationships were uncovered. All Scottish isolates were found to be identical and similar to most race 3 biovar 2 A isolates tested. Analysis of Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) confirmed this observation. After sequencing one of the tandem repeat regions, the results strongly suggest that contamination of the River Tay in Scotland occurred as a single or limited event, since the Scottish isolates had a unique tandem repeat pattern different from the patterns observed {{for the rest of the}} race 3 biovar 2 A isolates and strains studied.

40|$|Abstract: Potato crop in Egypt {{occupies}} 20 % of {{the total}} area devoted for vegetable plantations and any disturbance in its production affects severely its local and export impact. <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> disease on <b>potato</b> is the most cereous disease affecting potato exportation. Therefore, competing such disease is an obligate practice to control the pathogenic causal bacterium. Biological control became recently an effective strategy for fighting plant pathogens, where the antagonist {{have the ability to}} compete with the phytopathogens. The present study was carried out with a biocontrol bacterium and proved a potent antagonist against Ralstonia solanacearum. The in planta trials were carried out using healthy and infected tuber-seeds treated with the biocontrol agent Biocine S 2 HA either by soaking or powdering or both. The Biocine S 2 HA was produced in large-scale using controlled bioreactor to obtain the optimal amount and active Biocine S 2 HA agent. Treating the healthy or infected tuber-seeds prior to plantation with biocine S 2 HA as soaking or powdering increased the potato yield compared with the untreated tuber-seeds. However, using the treated healthy tuber-seeds was better than using the infected ones. In addition, the most effective practices were powdering the growing plants near the stem base. The effectiveness of consequence powdering treatment is due to the repeatable treatment of root area with the biocine S 2 HA carried on the talk powder either in the infested soil or even in the infected tuber-seeds.

40|$|Ralstonia solanacearum is {{the causal}} {{agent of the}} disease known as <b>potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> or {{bacterial}} wilt (BW).

Bacterial wilt is the second most important constraint to potato production in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Quarantine measures necessary to avoid spread of the disease to BW-free areas often restrict the production of seed potatoes and limit the commercialization of ware potatoes between countries and between infected and non-infected regions within a country.

The highest bacterial wilt severity was recorded in Munshigonj (3. 80), while the lowest wilt severity was recorded in Jamalpur (2. 90). A total of 44 isolates (R. solanacearum) were obtained from the wilted potato plant samples i. e. 20 from Munshigonj, 17 from Nilphamari and 7 from Jamalpur and the isolates were divided into three groups.

40|$|The {{potential}} of Biological Soil Disinfestation (BSD) to control <b>potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot,</b> caused by Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2, was investigated. BSD involves the induction of anaerobic soil conditions by increasing microbial respiration through incorporation of fresh organic amendments (here: grass or potato haulms) and by reducing re-supply of oxygen by covering with airtight plastic sheets. Control treatments were left without cover and amendment, or amended without covering or covered only without amendment. The effect of BSD on survival of R. solanacearum was tested at three different scales: in 1 -l glass mesocosms under laboratory conditions, in 1. 2 -m-diam microplots positioned in an outdoor quarantine field, {{and in a}} naturally infested commercial field. Within a few days, anaerobic conditions developed in the BSD-treated soils. In the mesocosm and microplot experiment, anaerobic conditions persisted {{till the end of}} the 4 -week experimental period. In the field experiment, the period of anaerobiosis was shorter due to birds damaging the plastic cover. In all three experiments, BSD reduced soil populations of R. solanacearum significantly by 92. 5 % to > 99. 9 % compared to the non-amended and uncovered control treatments. In the field experiment, BSD also resulted in a significant reduction of R. solanacearum survival in potato tubers buried at 15 or 35 cm and in the rapid decomposition of superficially buried potatoes remaining after harvesting, thus destroying an important inoculum reservoir of R. solanacearum. The treatments with grass amendment only or covering with only plastic did not result in anaerobic conditions and did not decrease R. solanacearum populations during the experimental period. PCR-DGGE analyses of 16 S-rDNA from soil samples of the various treatments in the mesocosm and microplot experiments revealed that BSD hardly affected bacterial diversity but did result in clear shifts in the composition of the bacterial community. The possible implications of these shifts are discussed.

40|$|<b>Potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot,</b> {{caused by}} Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 (Phylovar II, sequevar 1), {{is a serious}} endemic disease in the Nile Delta of Egypt. It is a {{quarantine}} disease in the EU, and export of potatoes from Egypt is restricted to pest-free areas in the desert. This thesis is directed at survival and eradication of the pathogen in areas that may become contaminated and at brown rot control in infested areas. R. solanacearum survival and disease suppression were studied for soils differing in origin (Dutch versus Egyptian soils), type (san d versus clay), and management (organic versus conventional). Effects of amendment of conventional soils with NPK and organic soils with compost or cow manure were compared with non-amended controls. The pathogen survived longer in Dutch than in Egyptian soils, and in clay than in san dy soils from both countries. Survival was never longer than 180 days {{and in many cases}} much shorter, especially in Egyptian san dy soil. Organic management reduced pathogen survival in Egyptian soils, especially in the san dy soil, but not in Dutch soils. Pathogen survival was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil, negatively with organic matter (OM) content at similar DOC content, and negatively with bacterial diversity estimated from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of eubacterial 16 S rDNA extracted from soil. NPK ferti li zation and cow manure amendment reduced pathogen survival in most soils while compost was not effective. There was a clear shift in microbial community after manure amendment, a weak shift by compost amendment, and no shift after NPK ferti li zation. Disease development was highest in Dutch san dy soils and similar in all other soil types. It was positively correlated with DOC (substrate availabi li ty), and negatively with K and Ca contents in soil, which may increase plant resistance. The disease was s li ghtly suppressed in organic compared to conventional san dy soils from Egypt while organic management increased disease incidence in all Dutch soils. This was related to a high DOC content in organic Dutch soils. There were no differences in bacterial diversity and composition in different rhizosphere soils, and no correlations between disease development and bacterial diversity. Manure ferti li zation suppressed brown rot in most soils with a clear shift in rhizospere bacterial community. Stenotrophomonas maltophi li a, isolated from the rhizosphere of eggplant in the Egyptian Delta, was antagonistic to R. solanacearum in vitro; its antagonistic activity was not Fe-siderophore dependent. A selected S. maltophi li a strain survived longer and reduced R. solanacearum survival more in Egyptian than in Dutch clay soils, and suppressed <b>potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> in Egyptian soil (by at least 36 %) but not in Dutch soil. Survival and suppressive activity of S. maltophi li a were positively correlated with OM, which was highest in Egyptian organic clay soil. The effect of biological soil disinfestation (BSD) was tested in glass vessels, microplots, and in an accidentally infested commercial field. BSD is based on production of toxic organic acids through anaerobic digestion of fresh organic matter. BSD was accomp li shed by incorporating grass or potato haulms in soil and covering the soil with airtight plastic. Survival of R. solanacearum in soil and potato tubers was significantly reduced in the BSD treatment (> 93 %), and not in separate g rass amendment -or plastic cover treatments.

To study the relationship between <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> infections in <b>potatoes</b> and possible risk factors, we evaluated two epidemiological models, i. e. a compartmental state-variable model, and a spatial individual-based model (IBM). Our approaches differ from most existing ecological applications of the two modelling techniques in that they focus on disease epidemiology within the industrially defined dynamics of the <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> pathogen in the potato production chain. The state-variable model proved useful for obtaining insight into the basic principles of <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> dispersal.

40|$|Background: Ralstonia solanacearum is a {{vascular}} soil-borne {{plant pathogen}} with an unusually broad host range. This economically destructive and globally distributed bacterium has thousands of distinct lineages within a heterogeneous and taxonomically disputed species complex. Some lineages include highly host-adapted strains (ecotypes), {{such as the}} banana Moko disease-causing strains, the cold-tolerant <b>potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> strains (also known as R 3 bv 2) and the recently emerged Not Pathogenic to Banana (NPB) strains. Results: These distinct ecotypes offer a robust model to study host adaptation {{and the emergence of}} ecotypes because the polyphyletic Moko strains include lineages that are phylogenetically close to the monophyletic brown rot and NPB strains. Draft genomes of eight new strains belonging to these three model ecotypes were produced to complement the eleven publicly available R. solanacearum genomes. Using a suite of bioinformatics methods, we searched for genetic and evolutionary features that distinguish ecotypes and propose specific hypotheses concerning mechanisms of host adaptation in the R. solanacearum species complex. Genome-wide, few differences were identified, but gene loss events, non-synonymous polymorphisms, and horizontal gene transfer were identified among type III effectors and were associated with host range differences. Conclusions: This extensive comparative genomics analysis uncovered relatively few divergent features among closely related strains with contrasting biological characteristics; however, several virulence factors were associated with the emergence of Moko, NPB and brown rot and could explain host adaptation.

These belonged to phylotype IIB sequevar 1 and were identical to known <b>potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> strains, which were probably introduced. Phylotype I isolates were grouped into 10 sequevars. Sequevar 15 was predominant (34 out of 56 isolates). Its distribution covered the whole island and it was largely associated with solanaceous crops such as tomato, and with tomato field soil. A total of 14 haplotypes were identified based on a partial endoglucanase gene sequence. Parsimony network analysis revealed that haplotype A was the oldest haplotype in the local population. It encompassed all but one of the sequevar 15 isolates. Large variation in virulence on tomato was observed among the 58 isolates, and seven pathotypes were identified. Significant genetic differentiation was detected among pathotypes. Moreover, genetic differentiation was detected between biovar 3 and biovar 4 subgroups and between the strains associated with solanaceous and non-solanaceous species, but none was detected between strains from different geographic origins.

Brown rot infection was only slightly reduced in organically compared to conventionally managed sandy soils from Egypt, but organic management significantly increased disease incidence and pathogen survival in Dutch sandy and clay soils, which correlated with high DOC contents in the organic Dutch soils. There was no correlation between disease incidence or severity and bacterial diversity in the potato rhizosphere in differently managed soils (as determined by 16 S DGGE).

Cow manure amendment significantly reduced disease incidence in organic Dutch sandy soils, but did not affect the bacterial population.

40|$|AbstractIt {{is often}} {{proposed}} that <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> basidiomycetes use extracellular {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) to accomplish the initial depolymerization of cellulose in wood, but little evidence has been presented {{to show that the}} fungi produce these oxidants in physiologically relevant quantities. We used [14 C]phenethyl polyacrylate as a radical trap to estimate extracellular ROS production by two <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> fungi, Gloeophyllum trabeum and Postia placenta, that were degrading cellulose. Both fungi oxidized aromatic rings on the trap to give monohydroxylated and more polar products in significant yields. All of the cultures contained 2, 5 -dimethoxyhydroquinone, a fungal metabolite that has been shown to drive Fenton chemistry in vitro. These results show that extracellular ROS occur at significant levels in cellulose colonized by <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> fungi, and suggest that hydroquinone-driven ROS production may contribute to decay by diverse <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> species...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{genetic and}} {{phenotypic}} diversity of Côte d'Ivoire Ralstonia solanacearum strains was assessed on a 168 -strain collection sampled on Solanaceae {{both in the}} southern lowlands and western highlands. Phylotypes I, II, and III were prevalent, though at unexpected frequencies. Phylotype I strains (87. 5 %) were genetically diverse and overrepresented in all agroecological areas, including highlands (AEZ III). Phylotype II strains (10. 7 %) only belonged to one tropical lowland-adapted broad host range lineage (IIA- 35), whereas no highland-adapted <b>potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> (IIB- 1) or Moko strains were detected. African phylotype III strains were rare (1. 8 %). They originated from a single Burkina Faso lineage (III- 23) and were only found in lowlands. Three phylotype I strains were found harboring pRSC 35, a plasmid identified in phylotype III strains in Cameroon. From pathogenicity tests performed on commercial varieties and tomato/eggplant/pepper references, the virulence diversity observed was high, with five pathoprofiles described. Eggplant accessions MM 152 and EG 203 and tomato HW 7996 displayed the largest resistance spectrum and highest level. Two highly virulent phylotype I strains were able to bypass resistance of HW 7996 and the eggplant reference AG 91 - 25. Collectively, these points lead {{to the conclusion that}} the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is specific towards other African countries, and specifically from the Cameroon reference, and that within phylotype I can exist a high virulence diversity. This calls for similar studies in neighboring West African countries, linking R. solanacearum pathogen genetic diversity to strain virulence at the regional level, for the rationalization of regional resistance deployment strategies and future resistance durability studies.

40|$|Ralstonia solanacearum biovar 2, the causative {{agent of}} <b>potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot,</b> {{probably}} originates from {{the cradle of}} potato, the Andes and from there has incidentally spread to {{different regions of the}} world. In the Netherlands, bacterial wilt has been reported as from the mid- 1990 -ies. The organism can still be found in local waterways. Patricia Stevens hypothesized that the organism, which is of tropical and warm temperate origin, may have experienced conditions that are strongly selective for particular genotypic and/or phenotypic adaptations. To investigate whether the Dutch R. solanacearum population has diversified, strains were isolated by Stevens from water, bittersweet plants and sediment from a high risk area. These newly obtained strains (n= 42) were genetically and phenotypically analyzed and compared to two strains isolated from potato, i. e one Dutch and one tropical strain. Overall, the strains showed a clonal structure using a range of molecular methods. However, heterogeneity across strains was seen that appeared mostly related to recombination processes. Stevens identified a 17. 6 Kb putative genomic island (PGI- 1), which was deleted from the genome of environmental strain KZR- 5. Although the exact set of functions harbored by PGI- 1 is as yet unknown, the island encompasses two genes of potential ecological relevance, i. e. one encoding a hypothetical protein with a RelA/SpoT domain and a putative cellobiohydrolase. Stevens thus assessed the behavior of several strains under different environmental conditions. Her results indicate that environmental strain KZR- 5 has incurred altered fitness, with divergent outcomes, i. e. enhanced tolerance to cold stress versus reduced competitiveness during growth and in plant invasion. ...|$|E
40|$|Two biologically active {{strains of}} Bacillus circulans (SF 1 and DE 62), {{described}} in Egypt as silicate dissolving bacteria, were experimented {{for the control}} of <b>potato</b> <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. In in vitro studies, the isolate SF 1 as well as DE 62 were antagonistic to certain isolates of the pathogen. Both spore forming isolates produce nitrogenase, hydrolytic enzymes and mobilize potassium. Our results show in general, a tendency of R. solanacearum population to increase in the rhizosphere of potato raised in Bacillus circulans treated soil. Similar trend was observed for the Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) and wilt severity. At cultivars level, cv., Cara (late mature) showed highly significant increase in AUDPC and wilt severity over Inova (early mature) and Picasso (medium mature) either in {{presence or absence of}} Bacillus circulans. The greater increase of the pathogen, in B. circulans treatments, was attributed to the nitrogen fixation potential and further enrichment of the micro ecosystem, i. e., the rhizosphere, with nutrients due to hydrolytic enzymes produced by the above mentioned strains. Raising potatoes in clay soil with increasing percentage of sand up to 20 % revealed a tendency for disease severity decrease. The effect was attributed to an easier flushing of the pathogen under alkaline soil conditions. The significant increase in plant height and weight in the B. circulans treatments was attributed to greater availability of nutrients especially nitrogen and potassium. It could be concluded that the results of antagonism in vitro may be inconclusive under certain circumstances following soil application, in biological control trails. Other inherent physiological and biological activities of the antagonist may be considered as limiting factors in biological control success...|$|E
