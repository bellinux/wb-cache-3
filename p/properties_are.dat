5|$|Because of {{excellent}} thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure {{similar to that of}} carbon nanotubes, i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, but the <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> very different.|$|E

50|$|Private <b>property</b> <b>is</b> a legal {{designation}} for {{the ownership}} of property by non-governmental legal entities. Private <b>property</b> <b>is</b> distinguishable from public <b>property,</b> which <b>is</b> owned by a state entity; and from collective (or cooperative) <b>property,</b> which <b>is</b> owned {{by a group of}} non-governmental entities. Private <b>property</b> <b>is</b> further distinguished from personal property, which refers to property for personal use and consumption. Private <b>property</b> <b>is</b> a legal concept defined and enforced by a country's political system.|$|R

5000|$|Premise P1 is an {{intuitive}} premise; generally we distinguish between properties and relations. An intrinsic <b>property</b> <b>is</b> just a <b>property</b> {{that something has}} independently of anything else; an extrinsic <b>property</b> <b>is</b> had only in relation to something. An example of an extrinsic <b>property</b> <b>is</b> [...] "fatherhood": something is a father only if that something is a male and has a child. An example of an alleged intrinsic <b>property</b> <b>is</b> [...] "shape".|$|R
50|$|When {{we speak}} of access semantics, in context of <b>properties,</b> what <b>is</b> meant is simply that (unlike a field) the {{read-write}} operations on an object's <b>property</b> <b>are</b> managed and observed. Thus {{we can say that}} 'A <b>property</b> <b>is</b> a virtual data element of an object and the access to the <b>property</b> <b>is</b> managed by getter/read and setter/write methods'.|$|R

5|$|Listed <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{in one of}} five broad categories, although there are special considerations for other types of properties that in any one, or into more specialized subcategories. The five general categories for National Register properties are: building, structure, site, district, and object. In addition, historic districts consist of contributing and non-contributing properties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Properties</b> <b>are</b> not {{protected}} in any strict sense by the Federal listing. States and local zoning bodies {{may or may}} not choose to protect listed historic places. Indirect protection is possible, by state and local regulations on development of National Register properties, and by tax incentives.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} in multi-wall CNTs is complicated as their <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> determined by contribution of all individual shells; those shells have different structures, and, {{because of the}} synthesis, are usually more defective than SWCNTs.

50|$|Receiving stolen {{property}} {{and possession of}} stolen <b>property</b> <b>are</b> treated as separate offenses in some jurisdictions. The distinguishing element is when the person knew that the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> stolen. If the person knew that the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> stolen {{at the time he}} received it, the crime <b>is</b> receiving stolen <b>property.</b> If the person did not know the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> stolen at the time she received it but found out after receiving possession, the crime is possession of {{stolen property}}.|$|R
50|$|Personal <b>property</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} considered <b>property</b> that <b>is</b> movable, {{as opposed to}} real property or real estate. In common law systems, personal <b>property</b> may also <b>be</b> called chattels or personalty.

5|$|Thus, most {{einsteinium}} {{samples are}} contaminated, and their intrinsic <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time. Other experimental techniques {{to circumvent the}} contamination problem include selective optical excitation of einsteinium ions by a tunable laser, such as in studying its luminescence properties.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic <b>properties,</b> <b>are</b> classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|According to Quancast, twenty-seven {{million people}} in the US used Twitter as of September 3, 2009.

The NHLs in Michigan comprise approximately 2% of the 1,757 properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan as of January 2012. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, while other NRHP <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> deemed significant at the local or state level.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar.

It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium.
