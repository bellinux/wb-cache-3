They are popular in Turkish as Ilmihal (from the Arabic Ilm ul-Hal, Situation Science). The first chapter is the book of cleanliness and first to be taught are subjects such as: which are clean, what is clean and what is not clean, what <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cleansed from, how they should clean, and which water should they use to clean.|$|E

It is not only the average person who needs to be educated in the dimensions of their own genomic sequence but also professionals, including physicians and science journalists, who must be provided with the knowledge required to inform and educate their patients and the public. Examples of such efforts include the Personal Genetics Education Project (pgEd), the Smithsonian collaboration with NHGRI, and the MedSeq, BabySeq and MilSeq projects of Genomes to People, an initiative of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure {{of what we call}} civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E
25|$|People {{with only}} a casual concern for Internet privacy need not achieve total anonymity. Internet users may protect their privacy through {{controlled}} disclosure of personal information. The revelation of IP addresses, non-personally-identifiable profiling, and similar information might become acceptable trade-offs for the convenience that users could otherwise lose using the workarounds needed to suppress such details rigorously. On the other hand, some people desire much stronger privacy. In that case, they may try to achieve Internet anonymity to ensure privacy — use of the Internet without giving any third parties the ability to link the Internet activities to personally-identifiable information of the Internet user. In order to keep their information private, <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful with what they submit to and look at online. When filling out forms and buying merchandise, that becomes tracked and because the information was not private, some companies are now sending Internet users spam and advertising on similar products.|$|E

Well, then the sanctity of marriage just has to be destroyed. It's just too bad. You can't have one set of benefits and only give them to some of the people." ...|$|E

[...] With the bass line, I wasn’t really thinking ‘Let’s make a Michael Jackson song,’ I was just like ‘let’s make something that feels great.’ Chris was like, 'We got to do some real shit this album.

2500|$|The {{opposition}} to children's rights far outdates any current trend in society, with recorded statements against {{the rights of}} children dating to the 13th century and earlier. Opponents to children's rights believe that young <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> protected from the adultcentric world, including the decisions and responsibilities of that world. In a dominantly adult society, childhood is idealized as a time of innocence, a time free of responsibility and conflict, and a time dominated by play. The majority of opposition stems from concerns related to national sovereignty, states' rights, the parent-child relationship. Financial constraints and the [...] "undercurrent of traditional values in {{opposition to}} children's rights" [...] are cited, as well. The concept of children's rights has received little attention in the United States.|$|E

[...] The SIDS charity is registered to Messenger's husband, Leslie Bailey. Messenger stated that cancelling the lectures would set a bad precedent as <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> informed and have all sides presented {{in order to make}} good parenting decisions.

The very act of singing, however dire the sound, makes us feel good." [...] Ballinger noted that the TV show Glee (to which Miranda submitted an [...] "audition" [...] in 2010) is causing a resurgence of interest in singing in schools: [...] "Everyone is talking about Glee and choirs and musical theatre, igniting a flame that has been dimmed for a long time. ... Live performance and musical theatre were almost a lost art ... <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reminded that it takes a lot more effort to sing than just watching movies or TV shows." [...] Miranda followed up on this idea, saying: [...] "Since I became so famous ... everyone is watching more music and singing more – because everyone wants to be more like me." [...] As the Miranda character matured, its popularity grew especially with younger audiences of the Glee generation, with most of those attending her concerts being teenagers or in their twenties. Ballinger says that she gets the most satisfaction from her live performances.|$|E
