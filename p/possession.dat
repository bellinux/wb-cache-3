5|$|The {{defensive}} play of Taylor, Oliver, and Johnson greatly {{affected the}} course of the game and is apparent in Georgia's time of <b>possession</b> and average starting position in each of the quarters. During the first and second quarters, Georgia had average starting positions on their own 19and26-yard lines, respectively. Their first-quarter time of <b>possession</b> was just 5:41, and their second-quarter <b>possession</b> time was 6:34.

In the third quarter, their average starting <b>possession</b> gained tenyards to the Georgia 36, and during the final quarter, their average starting position was the Virginia Tech 36-yard line. This fact allowed Georgia to capitalize on the Virginia Tech turnovers, turning them into points on the scoreboard.|$|E

Partners in a relationship may create digital <b>possessions</b> frequently. However, after a relationship ends, individuals typically seek to disconnect from their ex-partner. This becomes difficult due to the partners' interwoven digital presence and digital <b>possessions.</b> In this paper, we report on a qualitative study exploring individuals' experiences of relationship break up in a digital context, and discuss their attitudes towards digital <b>possessions</b> from those relationships. Five main themes emerged: digital <b>possessions</b> that sustain relationships, comparing before and after, tainted digital <b>possessions,</b> digital <b>possessions</b> and invasions of privacy, involved and emotional reminiscing. Design opportunities were identified in managing attitudes towards digital <b>possessions,</b> disconnecting and reconnecting, and encouraging awareness of digital <b>possessions...</b>|$|R

When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next <b>possession.</b> Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} nature of the {{boundaries}} between the extended self and <b>possessions</b> (including potentially extended <b>possessions)</b> in the context of gift giving for Hong Kong Chinese consumers.

In addition, by the virtue of their material presence, these extended <b>possessions</b> acted as continuous reminders of these extended selves. The extended <b>possessions</b> hence provided the informants with an anchoring point to increase the relatively stability of their relationships with others, thereby countering the labile nature of ever-changing identity narratives.

Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty claimed by each other.

40|$|This study investigates consumers' {{relationship}} to <b>possessions</b> in {{the condition of}} contemporary global nomadism. Prior research argues that consumers form enduring and strong attachments to <b>possessions</b> because of their centrality to identity projects. This role is heightened in life transitions including cross-border movements as <b>possessions</b> anchor consumer's identities either to their homeland or to the host country. This study reexamines this claim via in-depth interviews with elite global nomads, deterritorialized consumers who engage in serial relocation and frequent short-term international mobility. An alternative {{relationship to}} <b>possessions</b> characterized by detachment and flexibility emerges, which is termed "liquid. " Three characteristics of a liquid relationship to <b>possessions</b> are identified: temporary situational value, use-value, and immateriality. The study outlines a logic of nomadic consumption, that of instrumentality, where <b>possessions</b> and practices are strategic resources in managing mobility. A liquid perspective on <b>possessions</b> expands current understandings of materiality, acculturation, and globalization...|$|R
