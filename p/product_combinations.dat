40|$|The human kinome {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} classes of drug target, and there is emerging necessity for treating complex diseases by means of polypharmacology (multi-target drugs and <b>combination</b> <b>products).</b> However, the advantages of the multi-target drugs and the <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> are still under debate. A comparative analysis between FDA approved multi-target drugs and <b>combination</b> <b>products,</b> targeting the human kinome, was conducted by mapping targets onto the phylogenetic tree of the human kinome. The approach of network medicine illustrating the drug-target interactions was applied to identify popular targets of multi-target drugs and <b>combination</b> <b>products.</b> As identified, the multi-target drugs tended to inhibit target pairs in the human kinome, especially the receptor tyrosine kinase family, while the <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> were able to against targets of distant homology relationship.

40|$|In {{classification}} tasks {{it may be}} wise {{to combine}} observations from di!erent sources. Not only it {{decreases the training time}} but it can also increase the robustness and the performance of the classi"cation. Combining is often done by just (weighted) averaging of the outputs of the di!erent classi"ers. Using equal weights for all classi"ers then results in the mean combination rule. This works very well in practice, but the combination strategy lacks a fundamental basis as it cannot readily be derived from the joint probabilities. This contrasts with the <b>product</b> <b>combination</b> rule which can be obtained from the joint probability under the assumption of independency.

40|$|There {{have been}} renewed {{interests}} in natural products as drug discovery sources. In particular, natural <b>product</b> <b>combinations</b> have been extensively studied, clinically tested, and {{widely used in}} traditional, folk and alternative medicines. But opinions about their therapeutic efficacies vary from placebo to synergistic effects. The important questions are whether synergistic effects can sufficiently elevate therapeutic potencies to drug levels, and by what mechanisms and at what odds such combinations can be assembled. We studied these questions by analyzing literature-reported cell-based potencies of 190 approved anticancer and antimicrobial drugs, 1378 anticancer and antimicrobial natural products, 99 natural product extracts, 124 synergistic natural <b>product</b> <b>combinations,</b> and 122 molecular interaction profiles of the 19 natural <b>product</b> <b>combinations</b> with collective potency enhanced to drug level or by > 10 -fold.

40|$|There is a {{substantial}} literature in economics that focuses on explaining the reasons for intra-firm <b>product</b> <b>combinations,</b> such as bundling. Little is known, however, {{about the implications of}} inter-firm <b>product</b> <b>combinations</b> that are frequent in pharmaceutical markets. We propose and estimate a model to study the pricing strategies and the welfare effects of this practice. We find that firms increase their profits by participating in inter-firm combinations as they achieve further product differentiation, and consumers in general benefit from the extra variety. In addition, we find that if a firm introduces a second regimen, profits decrease as a less cooperative equilibrium arises, and consumers experience larger welfare gains. The last result suggests that inter-firm combinations may inhibit further innovation. Please send comments to minjae. song@simon. rochester. ed...|$|E
40|$|Class-based storage policy {{distributes}} products among {{a number}} of classes and for each class it reserves a region within the storage area. The procedures reported in the literature for formation of storage classes primarily consider order-picking cost ignoring storage-space cost. Moreover, in these procedures items are ordered {{on the basis of their}} cube per order index (COI), and items are then partitioned into classes maintaining this ordering. This excludes many possible <b>product</b> <b>combinations</b> in forming classes which may result in inferior solutions. In this paper, a simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) is developed to solve an integer programming model for class formation and storage assignment that considers all possible <b>product</b> <b>combinations,</b> storage-space cost and order-picking cost. Computational experience on randomly generated data sets and an industrial case shows that SAA gives superior results than the benchmark dynamic programming algorithm for class formation with COI ordering restriction.

Contrary to popular impression, a few such combinations are shown to remain essentially unconstrained. 1 Though the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [1] is a leading candidate for new physics beyond the standard model, the conservation of R-parity, Rp, which is assumed in the model has no real theoretical justification. This has motivated many authors [2] to consider alternatives in which Rp is explicitly broken. In such models, sparticles can decay into non-supersymmetric particles alone, leading to novel signatures in search experiments and unusual decay processes. The most general Rp-violating superpotential that one can write with the MSSM superfields, in the usual notation, is W = λijkLiLj Ēk + λ ′ ijkLiQj ¯ Dk + λ ′...|$|E
40|$|Drug-device <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> {{introduced}} a new dynamic on medical product development, regulatory approval, and corporate interaction that provide valuable lessons {{for the development of}} new generations of <b>combination</b> <b>products.</b> This paper examines the case studies of drug-eluting stents and transdermal patches to facilitate a detailed understanding of the challenges and opportunities introduced by <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> when compared to previous generations of traditional medical or drug delivery devices. Our analysis indicates that the largest barrier to introduce a new kind of <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> is the determination of the regulatory center that is to oversee its approval. The first product of a new class of <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> offers a learning opportunity for the regulator and the sponsor. Once that first product is approved, the leading regulatory center is determined, and the uncertainty about the entire class of <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> is drastically reduced. The sponsor pioneering a new class of <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> assumes a central role in reducing this uncertainty by advising the decision on the primary function of the <b>combination</b> <b>product.</b> Our analysis also suggests that this decision influences the nature (pharmaceutical, biotechnology, or medical devices) of the companies that will lead the introduction of these products into the market, and guide the structure of corporate interaction thereon.
