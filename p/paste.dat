Because their bodies can assume almost any curved shape, splines are the natural tool for modelling ferrets. Surface <b>pasting</b> is a hierarchical method of modelling with spline surfaces, where features are added onto a base surface.

Using the task of modelling a ferret as a driving force, I propose a method of <b>pasting</b> cylinders in world space; I looked at methods for reducing distortion of <b>pasted</b> features; and I created a method for <b>pasting</b> trimmed features to allow for features {{that do not have}} the rectilinear shape of standard <b>pasting.</b> With my methods, modelling ferrets with surface <b>pasting</b> is easier, and the resulting models are closer to a real ferret...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Miniature {{electrochemical}} sensors can {{be produced}} by thick film technology (TFT). The optimal properties of thick film electrode materials are main problems of sensors design. The optimisation of graphite <b>pastes</b> properties for TFT chemical sensor is discussed. The commercial TFT graphite <b>pastes,</b> which are used for common application, are cheap and easily producible, {{but they are not}} efficient for electrochemical measurement. These <b>pastes</b> have insufficient sensitivity and they have other bad properties. Graphite <b>pastes,</b> which were designed for special chemical analysis, are technically known, but these <b>pastes</b> are not workable by screen-printing. The first step in rheological properties addition to graphite electrochemical <b>pastes</b> is the goal of this work. This will ensure the <b>pastes</b> printability that will enable the reproducible mass production. The graphite powder with paraffin wax mixture is the basic component of common chemical graphite <b>pastes.</b> There were examined different properties of these <b>pastes</b> in dependence on graphite powder and binding material content in this work. Finally there are described some measurement with commercial and specially prepared TFT graphite electrodes.

40|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA) is an 18 -carbon fatty acid with multiple health benefits, including anti-obesity and anti-carcinogenic properties. CLA-rich soy oil (CLARSO) {{can be produced}} through a heterogeneous catalysis process, and this oil was previously used to produce CLA-rich margarines and shortenings. The objective {{of this study was}} to produce CLA-rich chocolate <b>pastes</b> by replacing a portion of the fat with CLARSO and compare the rheological (flow), textural, and thermal properties of these <b>pastes</b> to controls made with either soy oil or traditional fats. CLARSO was used to prepare <b>pastes.</b> Rheology, firmness, and thermal behavior of the <b>pastes</b> were determined. The CLARSO chocolate <b>pastes</b> contained no additional saturated fat relative to soy oil controls but the <b>pastes</b> had more solid-like rheology and were firmer. Relative to non-soy controls, CLARSO <b>pastes</b> had similar rheology, despite containing less saturated fat. The fat crystals of all samples were in the same polymorphic form. Therefore, it was successfully demonstrated that CLARSO has the ability to produce chocolate <b>pastes</b> with similar physical properties as traditional products containing more saturated fat...|$|R

Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian.

In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{microstructure}} {{of complex}} binder <b>pastes</b> was investigated {{by means of}} XRD and SEM-EDS. The results show that adding fly ash means decline of cement content in cementitious materials, {{which leads to the}} decrease of Ca(OH) 2 content in complex binder <b>pastes.</b> The Ca(OH) 2 crystal still exists in the complex binder <b>pastes</b> at the age of 360 days. By replacing part of cement with fly ash, the early microstructure of complex binder <b>pastes</b> becomes loosened. With the extension of curing ages, a great quantity of low CaO/SiO 2 ratio of C-S-H gel is generated, which makes complex binder <b>pastes</b> compact gradually...|$|R

Surface <b>pasting</b> is a composition method in which a feature surface is attached to a base surface to provide details on the underlying surface.

40|$|Developers {{often need}} to modify <b>pasted</b> code when {{programming}} with copy-and-paste practice. Some modifications on <b>pasted</b> code could involve lots of editing efforts, and any missing or wrong edit could incur bugs. In this paper, we propose a clone-based and interactive approach to recommending {{where and how}} to modify the <b>pasted</b> code. In our approach, we regard clones of the <b>pasted</b> code as the results of historical copy-and-paste operations and their differences as historical modifications on the same piece of code. Our approach first retrieves clones of the <b>pasted</b> code from a clone repository and detects syntactically complete differences among them. Then our approach transfers each clone difference into a modification slot on the <b>pasted</b> code, suggests options for each slot, and further mines modifying regulations from the clone dif-ferences. Based on the mined modifying regulations, our approach dynamically updates the suggested options and their ranking in each slot according to developer’s modifications on the <b>pasted</b> code. We implement a proof-of-concept tool CCDemon based on our ap-proach and evaluate its effectiveness based on code clones detected from five open source projects. The results show that our approach can identify 96. 9 % of the to-be-modified positions in <b>pasted</b> code and suggest 75. 0 % of the required modifications. Our human study further confirms that CCDemon can help developers to accomplish their modifications of <b>pasted</b> code more efficiently...|$|R
