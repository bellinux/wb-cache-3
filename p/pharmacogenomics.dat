5|$|Some of a patient's single {{nucleotide}} polymorphismsslight {{differences in their}} DNAcan help predict how quickly they will metabolise particular drugs; this is called <b>pharmacogenomics.</b> For example, the enzyme CYP2C19 metabolises several drugs, such as the anti-clotting agent Clopidogrel, into their active forms. Some patients possess polymorphisms in specific places on the 2C19 gene that make poor metabolisers of those drugs; physicians can test for these polymorphisms and {{find out whether the}} drugs will be fully effective for that patient. Advances in molecular biology have helped show that some syndromes that were previously classed as a single disease are actually multiple subtypes with entirely different causes and treatments. Molecular diagnostics can help diagnose the subtypefor example of infections and cancersor the genetic analysis of a disease with an inherited component, such as Silver-Russell syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pharmacogenomics</b> may {{be applied}} to several areas of medicine, {{including}} Pain Management, Cardiology, Oncology, and Psychiatry. A place may also exist in Forensic Pathology, in which <b>pharmacogenomics</b> {{can be used to}} determine the cause of death in drug-related deaths where no findings emerge using autopsy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pharmacogenomics</b> {{is a form}} of {{individualized}} medicine.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} <b>pharmacogenomics</b> as {{the study of}} DNA {{sequence}} variation {{as it relates to}} differential drug response in individuals, i.e., the use of genomics to determine an individual’s response. <b>Pharmacogenomics</b> refers to the use of DNA-based genotyping in order to target pharmaceutical agents to specific patient populations in the design of drugs.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{appears to}} be very {{invested}} in the science of <b>pharmacogenomics</b> as is demonstrated through the 120 and more FDA-approved drugs that include pharmacogenomic biomarkers in their labels. On May 22, 2005, the FDA issued its first Guidance for Industry: Pharmacogenomic Data Submissions, which clarified the type of pharmacogenomic data required to be submitted to the FDA and when. Experts {{recognized the importance of}} the FDA’s acknowledgement that <b>pharmacogenomics</b> experiments will not bring negative regulatory consequences. The FDA had released its latest guide Clinical <b>Pharmacogenomics</b> (PGx): Premarket Evaluation in Early-Phase Clinical Studies and Recommendations for Labeling in January, 2013. The guide is intended to address the use of genomic information during drug development and regulatory review processes.|$|E
25|$|In medicine, modern {{biotechnology}} finds applications {{in areas such}} as pharmaceutical drug discovery and production, <b>pharmacogenomics,</b> and genetic testing (or genetic screening).|$|E
25|$|Although {{other factors}} {{contribute}} to the slow progression of <b>pharmacogenomics</b> (such as developing guidelines for clinical use), the above factors {{appear to be the}} most prevalent.|$|E
25|$|Demonstrating the {{cost-effectiveness}} of pharmacogenomics: Publications for the pharmacoeconomics of <b>pharmacogenomics</b> are scarce, therefore {{sufficient evidence}} does {{not at this}} time exist to validate the cost-effectiveness and cost-consequences of the test.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{benefits}} of uncovering {{the human genome}} will be focused more on identifying causes of disease and less on treating disease, through: improved diagnostic methods, earlier detection of a predisposing genetic variation, <b>pharmacogenomics</b> and gene therapy.|$|E
25|$|Discovered in {{the early}} 1980s, CYP2C19 {{is the second most}} {{extensively}} studied and well understood gene in <b>pharmacogenomics.</b> Over 28 genetic variants have been identified for CYP2C19, of which affects the metabolism of several classes of drugs, such as antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pharmacogenomics</b> {{was first}} {{recognized}} by Pythagoras around 510 BC {{when he made}} {{a connection between the}} dangers of fava bean ingestion with hemolytic anemia and oxidative stress. Interestingly, this identification was later validated and attributed to deficiency of G6PD in the 1950s and called favism.|$|E
25|$|Full genome {{sequencing}} holds large promise {{in the world}} of healthcare in the potential of precise and personalized medical treatments. This use of genetic information to select appropriate drugs is known as <b>pharmacogenomics.</b> This technology may allow treatments to be catered to the individual and the certain genetic predispositions they may have (such as personalized chemotherapy).|$|E
25|$|In personalised medicine, {{diagnostic}} {{testing is}} often employed for selecting appropriate and optimal therapies {{based on the}} context of a patient’s genetic content or other molecular or cellular analysis. The use of genetic information has {{played a major role in}} certain aspects of personalized medicine (e.g. <b>pharmacogenomics),</b> and the term was first coined in the context of genetics, though it has since broadened to encompass all sorts of personalization measures.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{advances}} in <b>pharmacogenomics</b> {{has proven to}} be a blessing in research. As a simple example, for nearly a decade the ability to store more information on a hard drive has enabled us to investigate a human genome sequence cheaper and in more detail with regards to the effects/risks/safety concerns of drugs and other such substances. Such computational advances are expected to continue in the future. The aim is to use the genome sequence data to effectively make decisions in order to minimise the negative impacts on, say, a patient or the health industry in general. A large amount of research in the biomedical sciences regarding <b>Pharmacogenomics</b> as of late stems from combinatorial chemistry, genomic mining, omic technologies and high throughput screening. In order for the field to grow, rich knowledge enterprises and business must work more closely together and adopt simulation strategies. Consequently, more importance must be placed on the role of computational biology with regards to safety and risk assessments. Here, we can find the growing need and importance of being able to manage large, complex data sets, being able to extract information by integrating disparate data so that developments can be made in improving human health.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{increased}} metabolism of codeine to morphine, ultrarapid metabolizers (those possessing more than 2 functional {{copies of the}} CYP2D6 allele) {{are at increased risk}} of adverse drug effects related to morphine toxicity. Guidelines released by the Clinical <b>Pharmacogenomics</b> Implementation Consortium (CPIC) advise against administering codeine to ultrarapid metabolizers, where this genetic information is available. The CPIC also suggests that codeine use be avoided in poor metabolizers, due to its lack of efficacy in this group.|$|E
25|$|A {{potential}} role <b>pharmacogenomics</b> {{may play}} {{would be to}} reduce the occurrence of polypharmacy. It is theorized that with tailored drug treatments, patients {{will not have the}} need to take several medications that are intended to treat the same condition. In doing so, they could potentially minimize the occurrence of ADRs, have improved treatment outcomes, and can save costs by avoiding purchasing extraneous medications. An example of this can be found in Psychiatry, where patients tend to be receiving more medications than even age-matched non-psychiatric patients. This has been associated with an increased risk of inappropriate prescribing.|$|E
25|$|An {{aspect of}} this is <b>pharmacogenomics,</b> which uses an individual’s genome {{to provide a more}} {{informed}} and tailored drug prescription. Often, drugs are prescribed with the idea that it will work relatively the same for everyone, but in the application of drugs, {{there are a number of}} factors that must be considered. The detailed account of genetic information from the individual will help prevent adverse events, allow for appropriate dosages, and create maximum efficacy with drug prescriptions. The pharmacogenomic process for discovery of genetic variants that predict adverse events to a specific drug has been termed toxgnostics.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} <b>pharmacogenomics</b> {{tailored}} drug therapies {{may be most}} evident in a {{survey conducted by the}} Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University from February 1998 to April 2007. The study elucidated that an average of 82% of adults in the United States are taking at least one medication (prescription or nonprescription drug, vitamin/mineral, herbal/natural supplement), and 29% are taking five or more. The study suggested that those aged 65 years or older continue to be the biggest consumers of medications, with 17-19 % in this age group taking at least ten medications in a given week. Polypharmacy has also shown to have increased since 2000 from 23% to 29%.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the first}} {{official}} publication dates back to 1961, circa 1950s marked the unofficial beginnings of this science. Reports of prolonged paralysis and fatal reactions linked to genetic variants in patients who lacked butyryl-cholinesterase (‘pseudocholinesterase’) following administration of succinylcholine injection during anesthesia were first reported in 1956. The term pharmacogenetic was first coined in 1959 by Friedrich Vogel of Heidelberg, Germany (although some papers suggest it was 1957 or 1958). In the late 1960s, twin studies supported the inference of genetic involvement in drug metabolism, with identical twins sharing remarkable similarities to drug response compared to fraternal twins. The term <b>pharmacogenomics</b> first began appearing around the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacogenomics: type {{of genetic}} testing that determines the {{influence}} of genetic variation on drug response. When a person has a disease or health condition, <b>pharmacogenomics</b> can examine an individual’s genetic makeup to determine what medicine and what dosage would be the safest and most beneficial to the patient. In the human population, there are approximately 11 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in people’s genomes, making them the most common variations in the human genome. SNPs reveal information about an individual’s response to certain drugs. This type of genetic testing {{can be used for}} cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of the cancer tissue can be sent in for genetic analysis by a specialized lab. After analysis, information retrieved can identify mutations in the tumor which can be used to determine the best treatment option.|$|E
25|$|Patient A {{suffers from}} schizophrenia. Their {{treatment}} included {{a combination of}} ziprasidone, olanzapine, trazodone and benzotropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transition to quetiapine. Trazodone was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduction into their treatment due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, cogwheeling, tremor and night sweats. When benztropine was added they experienced blurry vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain, sedation, developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, cogwheel and dyskinetic ocular movements. A <b>pharmacogenomics</b> test later proved the patient had a CYP2D6 *1/*41, with has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with predicted phenotype of IM as well.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there appears}} to be a general {{acceptance}} of the basic tenet of <b>pharmacogenomics</b> amongst physicians and healthcare professionals, several challenges exist that slow the uptake, implementation, and standardization of <b>pharmacogenomics.</b> Some of the concerns raised by physicians include: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pharmacogenomics</b> is {{the study}} {{of the role of the}} genome in drug response. Its name ( [...] + genomics) {{reflects}} its combining of pharmacology and genomics. <b>Pharmacogenomics</b> analyzes how the genetic makeup of an individual affects his/her response to drugs. It deals with the influence of acquired and inherited genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with pharmacokinetics (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) and pharmacodynamics (effects mediated through a drug's biological targets). The term <b>pharmacogenomics</b> is often used interchangeably with pharmacogenetics. Although both terms relate to drug response based on genetic influences, pharmacogenetics focuses on single drug-gene interactions, while <b>pharmacogenomics</b> encompasses a more genome-wide association approach, incorporating genomics and epigenetics while dealing with the effects of multiple genes on drug response.|$|E
2500|$|Examples {{of the use}} of {{personalized}} medicine include oncogenomics and <b>pharmacogenomics.</b> Oncogenomics is a field of study focused on the characterization of cancer–related genes. With cancer, specific information about a tumor is used to help create a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. [...] <b>Pharmacogenomics</b> is the study of how a person's genome affects their response to drugs. This field is relatively new but growing fast due in part to an increase in funding for the NIH <b>Pharmacogenomics</b> Research Network. Since 2001, there has been an almost 550% {{increase in the number of}} research papers in PubMed related to the search terms <b>pharmacogenomics</b> and pharmacogenetics. This field allows researchers to better understand how genetic differences will influence the body's response to a drug and inform which medicine is most appropriate for the patient. These treatment plans will be able to prevent or at least minimize the adverse drug reactions which are a, [...] "significant cause of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States." [...] Overall, researchers believe <b>pharmacogenomics</b> will allow physicians to better tailor medicine to the needs of the individual patient. As of November 2016, the FDA has approved 204 drugs with pharmacogenetics information in its labeling. These labels may describe genotype-specific dosing instructions and risk for adverse events amongst other information.|$|E
2500|$|In cancer treatment, <b>pharmacogenomics</b> {{tests are}} used to {{identify}} which patients {{are most likely to}} respond to certain cancer drugs. In behavioral health, pharmacogenomic tests provide tools for physicians and care givers to better manage medication selection and side effect amelioration. <b>Pharmacogenomics</b> is also known as companion diagnostics, meaning tests being bundled with drugs. Examples include KRAS test with cetuximab and EGFR test with gefitinib.

2500|$|<b>Pharmacogenomics</b> aims {{to develop}} {{rational}} means to optimize drug therapy, {{with respect to}} the patients' genotype, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects. [...] Through the utilization of <b>pharmacogenomics,</b> it is hoped that pharmaceutical drug treatments can deviate from what is dubbed as the [...] "one-dose-fits-all" [...] approach. <b>Pharmacogenomics</b> also attempts to eliminate the trial-and-error method of prescribing, allowing physicians to take into consideration their patient's genes, the functionality of these genes, and how this may affect the efficacy of the patient's current or future treatments (and where applicable, provide an explanation for the failure of past treatments). Such approaches promise the advent of precision medicine and even personalized medicine, in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for narrow subsets of patients or even for each individual's unique genetic makeup. Whether used to explain a patient's response or lack thereof to a treatment, or act as a predictive tool, it hopes to achieve better treatment outcomes, greater efficacy, minimization of the occurrence of drug toxicities and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). For patients who have lack of therapeutic response to a treatment, alternative therapies can be prescribed that would best suit their requirements. In order to provide pharmacogenomic recommendations for a given drug, two possible types of input can be used: genotyping or exome or whole genome sequencing. Sequencing provides many more data points, including detection of mutations that prematurely terminate the synthesized protein (early stop codon).|$|E
2500|$|Omeprazole {{undergoes}} a chiral shift in vivo which converts the inactive (R)-enantiomer to the active (S)-enantiomer, doubling {{the concentration of}} the active form. This chiral shift is accomplished by the CYP2C19 isozyme of cytochrome P450, which is not found equally in all human populations. Those who do not metabolize the drug effectively are called [...] "poor metabolizers". The proportion of the poor metabolizer phenotype varies widely between populations, from 2.0–2.5% in African Americans and white Americans to >20% in Asians; several <b>pharmacogenomics</b> {{studies have suggested that}} PPI treatment should be tailored according to CYP2C19 metabolism status.|$|E
