In such systems a <b>protection</b> <b>mechanism</b> is required to ensure that programs can access precisely those objects {{they are supposed to}} access and no others. In a monolingual system this protection can be provided by the type system of the programming language; in systems which support multiple persistent languages a separate <b>protection</b> <b>mechanism</b> must be supported.

[...] The information must be protected while in motion and while at rest. During its lifetime, information may pass through many different information processing systems and through many different parts of information processing systems. There are many different ways the information and information systems can be threatened. To fully protect the information during its lifetime, each component of the information processing system must have its own <b>protection</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The building up, layering on and overlapping of security measures is called defense in depth. In contrast to a metal chain, which is famously only as strong as its weakest link, the defense-in-depth aims at a structure where, should one defensive measure fail, other measures will continue to provide protection.|$|E
