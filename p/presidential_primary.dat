5|$|Paul {{considered}} {{campaigning for}} President in 1992, but instead chose to endorse Pat Buchanan that year, {{and served as}} an adviser to Buchanan's Republican <b>presidential</b> <b>primary</b> campaign against incumbent President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|When he {{lost the}} Republican Party <b>presidential</b> <b>primary</b> {{election}} in 2008, Paul criticized the two major political parties, saying {{that there was no}} real difference between the parties and that neither of them truly intended to challenge the status quo. He refused to endorse the Republican Party's nominee for president, John McCain, and lent his support to third-party candidates instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Cooper again won {{re-election}} over John Y. Brown, Sr., by 217,000 votes, {{breaking his}} own record of largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate, and carrying {{the vote of}} 110 of Kentucky's 120 counties. In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican <b>presidential</b> <b>primary,</b> he endorsed New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam. Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain non-specific about how they would handle it. As Rockefeller's candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton, to seek the presidency, but Morton declined. The nomination– and eventually, the presidency– went to Republican Richard Nixon.|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamentals}} matter less in {{the outcome}} of <b>presidential</b> <b>primaries.</b> One prominent theory holds that the outcome of <b>presidential</b> <b>primaries</b> is largely determined by the preferences of party elites. <b>Presidential</b> <b>primaries</b> are therefore less predictive, as all kinds of events may impact elites' perception of the viability of candidates. Gaffes, debates and media narratives play a greater role in <b>primaries</b> than in <b>presidential</b> elections.|$|R
5|$|In 2008 Clinton, a Senator and {{candidate}} for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, became the first American woman to win a <b>presidential</b> <b>primary.</b> Traister discusses Clinton's political campaign, which did not focus on her gender, and the misogynistic reactions she received from the media and political opponents. She argues that the Democratic Party's lack of response to the sexism of Clinton's opponents led {{a large number of}} liberal female voters to abandon the party, and blames Mark Penn for advising Clinton not to advertise herself as a feminist. Although she originally supported John Edwards' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, she became a strong supporter of Clinton.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} vote of 2008, she placed {{third in the}} January 3 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards. Obama gained ground in {{national}} polling {{in the next few}} days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary. Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly. It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's <b>presidential</b> <b>primary</b> for the purposes of delegate selection. Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.|$|E
5|$|On January 17, 2009, Obama {{hosted a}} whistle stop train tour {{in honor of}} the 200thanniversary of the birth year of Abraham Lincoln. Obama reenacted the final part of Lincoln's 1861train tour from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Washington,D.C. to capture the mood of the 1861Springfield to Washington train tour {{traveled}} by Lincoln to his own inauguration. For his train ride to the nation's capital, Obama rode in the Georgia300, a vintage railroad car used by past presidents and the same one he used for touring Pennsylvania during his <b>presidential</b> <b>primary</b> campaign. On the tour, Obama was accompanied by his wife Michelle, their daughters Malia and Sasha, and a host of friends and guests.|$|E

5|$|One of Barack Obama's first {{decisions}} as president-elect was to appoint Hillary Clinton, US Senator from New York and former Democratic <b>presidential</b> <b>primary</b> opponent, as Secretary of State; Clinton resigned her Senate seat {{to take the}} position. The district's seat became vacant in January 2009 when Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to the United States Senate to replace Clinton. On February 23, 2009, Governor Paterson issued a proclamation setting the date for the special election as March 31, 2009. Under state law, Paterson was not required to issue a proclamation for a special election until July 2010. Both the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report listed the race as a toss-up.|$|E
5|$|Pritzker was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Obama's political career, helping to finance his 2004 Senate campaign. Early in the democratic <b>presidential</b> <b>primary,</b> Pritzker's financing helped Obama's candidacy survive when Obama was trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls. Pritzker remained a major fundraiser for Obama during the 2008 democratic primary and raised millions overall for his White House bid. She served as the national finance chair of Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Under her direction, the campaign reached out to small donors. Pritzker also hosted more lavish fundraisers {{as part of her}} effort to raise money.|$|E
5|$|Red Riding Hood, {{directed}} by Catherine Hardwicke, was Appian Way's first release in 2011. The film, {{set in a}} village haunted by werewolves, follows a young girl {{who falls in love}} with an orphan woodcutter, much to her family's displeasure. Earlier in production, the film was titled The Girl with the Red Riding Hood. Although it was poorly received by critics—Mary Pols of Time named it one of the Top 10 Worst Movies of 2011—it had moderate box-office returns. The company's second release in 2011 was Detachment, a Tony Kaye-directed drama about the high school education system. George Clooney directed and co-produced the company's final film of the year The Ides of March, which is based on Beau Willimon's play Farragut North. Starring Ryan Gosling, Clooney and Philip Seymour Hoffman, this political drama takes place during a <b>presidential</b> <b>primary,</b> when an ambitious press secretary (Gosling) becomes embroiled in a political scandal. The film received positive reviews; one from The Guardian praised the direction and the performances of the cast.|$|E

5|$|Though Sanford {{enjoyed his}} time as Duke's president, he still harbored {{political}} ambitions. As the 1972 <b>presidential</b> <b>primary</b> season began, he was approached by several people who felt that the field of Democratic candidates was weak. He was particularly keen to challenge Alabama governor George Wallace {{in an effort to}} show that Wallace's segregationist views did not represent majority Southern opinion. Announcing his candidacy on March 8, he faced long odds in a crowded field. Knowing that he could not win a majority of delegates in the primary, he hoped to secure enough to emerge as a compromise candidate in a deadlocked convention. Even in the North Carolina primary, however, Wallace beat Sanford by 100,000 votes, and Sanford managed only a fifth-place finish at the 1972 Democratic National Convention with 77.5 votes, behind George McGovern (1,864.95), Henry M. Jackson (525), Wallace (381.7), and Shirley Chisholm (151.95).|$|E
5|$|Much {{support has}} been {{achieved}} by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates {{his share of the}} proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, blogosphere, and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican <b>presidential</b> <b>primary,</b> and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. Former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election.|$|E
