5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal.

Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment.

Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> in no state to express a considered view.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of Hexuemingmu tablets {{for the treatment}} of subconjunctival hemorrhage, and to seek a treatment which can shorten the course of disease and improve the efficacy.

Three <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> excluded because of difficulty with insertion and suspected rupture of the parenchymal balloon. There was no intraparenchymal waveform or ICP reading, and comparison to ventricular ICP was not possible. Three <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> excluded because of unavailability of the investigator for study enrollment or data collection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This article {{describes}} the retrospective analysis of the patients who presented with a drug-related intoxication to the emergency department of the Erasmus Medical Centre in 2000. METHODS: Data were collected from the emergency department's electronic database and the medical charts of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 243 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> seen with a drug-related intoxication caused by ingestion {{of one or more}} medical substances, drugs of abuse (DOA) or combinations with alcohol. Mono-intoxication occurred in 58 % of the patients, predominantly caused by DOA (56 patients), analgesics (17 patients) or benzodiazepines (14 patients). Benzodiazepines (55 patients), analgesics (42 patients), alcohol (42 patients), DOA (40 patients) and antidepressants (23 <b>patients)</b> <b>were</b> predominant in combined intoxications. More than half of the <b>patients</b> (142) <b>were</b> discharged after being treated in the emergency department and 80 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> admitted to the wards. Eighteen <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> admitted elsewhere and three <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> lost to follow-up. Eventually, 70 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> discharged after having <b>been</b> admitted, five <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> admitted to other institutions, two patients died and three <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: DOA, benzodiazepines, analgesics, alcohol and antidepressants accounted for approximately 65 % of the drug-related intoxications in 2000 and in a third of the presenting <b>patients,</b> toxicity <b>was</b> such that admission to the wards was warranted...|$|R
