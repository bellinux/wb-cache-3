40|$|Abstract. If the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> {{adhesive}} is {{coated on}} the back, {{it can be}} used for bonding electronic tag, overburden, protective layer, and RFID layer. The acrylate <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesives are simple and less pollution, so more and more companies pay attention on this kind of binder. Since the thickness of adhesive layer is relatively small, ink-jet printing is now widely used to easily obtain thin layer and design the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesive shape of different parts. So how to get superior performance <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesive which is suitable for ink-jet printing become an urgent problem in printed electronics. The experiment was conducted through solution copolymerization of various vinyl monomers which were selected on the principle of solvent parameter prepared by free radical polymerization. The monomer, initiator mixture solution was dropped in continuous and synchronization process. By regulating the amount of initiator and polymerization temperature, we could effectively reduce the system viscosity and prepare high quality high-solids acrylate UV-curable <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesives with low viscosity for ink-jet printing. The influence of initiator, solvents, transfer reagents and temperature on the structure and properties of the resin were discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurements of}} static {{pressures on the}} stator vane suction side of a high-speed single stage fan using the technique of <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint (PSP). The paper illustrates development in application of the relatively new experimental technique to the complex environment of internal flows in turbomachines. First, there is a short explanation of the physics of the PSP technique and a discussion of calibration methods for <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint in the turbomachinery environment. A description of the image conversion process follows. The recorded image of the stator vane pressure field is skewed due to the limited optical access and must be converted to the meridional plane projection for comparison with analytical predictions. The experimental results for seven operating conditions along an off-design rotational speed line are shown in a concise form, including performance map points, mindspan static tap pressure distributions, and vane suction side pressure fields. Then, a comparison between static tap and <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint data is discussed. Finally, the paper lists shortcomings of the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint technology and lessons learned in this high-speed fan application...|$|R

40|$|Pyrene-based <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paints (PSP) {{have certain}} {{advantages}} {{due to their}} high pressure sensitivity and low temperature coefficient but their major drawback is the paint degradation under wind tunnel conditions. This {{is due to the}} loss of pyrene as a result of diffusion and sublimation from the coating. We have developed a novel stable binary PSP formulation in which pyrene is covalently bonded to the polymer binder so that paint degradation is prevented. The coating thus obtained is a siloxane-based hybrid organic–inorganic material. The <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint also contains an additional reference luminophore, which is insensitive to <b>pressure</b> but <b>sensitive</b> to intensity variations on the model surface. The second luminophore is incorporated in the paint to correct for the excitation intensity variations during the wind tunnel experiment.

40|$|Tack, {{ease of use}} and {{viscoelastic}} {{damping properties}} are the key features of <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhe-sives, opening {{a wide range of}} potential applications [1]. However creep under static mechanical load conditions and low strength at elevated temperatures limit the possibilities of using <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesive joints in semi-structural and structural applications [2]. The principle of combining different joining technologies {{is often referred to as}} hybrid joining [3]. In hybrid joining two or more joining operations are carried out either simultaneously or sequentially, leading to enhanced properties of the joint due to a synergistic load bearing interaction under service conditions.

40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> {{paint is}} a newly-developed optical {{measurement}} technique with {{which one can}} get a continuous pressure distribution in much shorter time and lower cost than a conventional pressure tap measurement. However, most of the current <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint applications are restricted to steady pressure measurement at high speeds {{because of the small}} signal-to-noise ratio at low speed and a slow response to pressure changes. In the present study, three phases of work have been completed to extend the application of the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint technique to low-speed testing and to investigate the applicability of the paint technique to unsteady flow. First the measurement system using a commercially available PtOEP/GP- 197 <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint was established and applied to impinging jet measurements. An in-situ calibration using only five pressure tap data points was applied and the results showed good repeatability and good agreement with conventional pressure tap measurements on the whole painted area. The overall measurement accuracy in these experiments was found to be within 0. 1 psi. The <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint technique was then applied to low-speed wind tunnel tests using a 60 deg delta wing model with leading edge blowing slots. The technical problems encountered in low-speed testing were resolved by using a high grade CCD camera and applying corrections to improve the measurement accuracy. Even at 35 m/s, the paint data not only agreed well with conventional pressure tap measurements but also clearly showed the suction region generated by the leading edge vortices. The vortex breakdown was also detected at alpha= 30 deg. It was found that a pressure difference of 0. 2 psi was required for a quantitative pressure measurement in this experiment and that temperature control or a parallel temperature measurement is necessary if thermal uniformity does not hold on the model. Finally, the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint was applied to a periodically changing pressure field with a 12. 8 s time period. A simple first-order pole model was applied to deal with the phase lag of the paint. The unsteady pressure estimated from the time-changing <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint data agreed well with the pressure transducer data in regions of higher pressure and showed the possibility of extending the technique to unsteady pressure measurements. However, the model still needs further refinement based on the physics of the oxygen diffusion into the paint layer and the oxygen quenching on the paint luminescence...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} static {{upper eyelid}} pressure and {{contact with the}} ocular surface {{in a group of}} young adult subjects. Methods Static upper eyelid pressure was measured for 11 subjects using a piezoresistive pressure sensor attached to a rigid contact lens. Measures of eyelid pressure were derived from an active pressure cell (1. 14 mm square) beneath the central upper eyelid margin. To investigate the contact region between the upper eyelid and ocular surface, we used <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paper and the lissamine-green staining of Marx’s line. These measures combined with the pressure sensor readings were used to derive estimates of eyelid pressure. Results The mean contact width between the eyelids and ocular surface estimated using <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paper was 0. 60 ± 0. 16 mm, while the mean width of Marx’s line was 0. 09 ± 0. 02 mm. The mean central upper eyelid pressure was calculated to be 3. 8 ± 0. 7 mmHg (assuming that the whole pressure cell was loaded), 8. 0 ± 3. 4 mmHg (derived using the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paper imprint widths) and 55 ± 26 mmHg (based on contact widths equivalent to Marx’s line). Conclusions The <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paper measurements suggest that a band of the eyelid margin, significantly larger than the anatomical zone of the eyelid margin known as Marx’s line, has primary contact with the ocular surface. Using these measurements as the contact between the eyelid margin and ocular surface, we believe that the mean pressure of 8. 0 ± 3. 4 mmHg is the most reliable estimate of static upper eyelid pressure...|$|R
