40|$|Early in {{pregnancy}} {{women and their}} partners face the complex decision {{on whether or not}} to participate in <b>prenatal</b> <b>testing</b> for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Several studies show that the majority of pregnant women currently do not make informed decisions regarding <b>prenatal</b> <b>testing.</b> As the range of <b>prenatal</b> <b>tests</b> is expanding due to the development of new techniques such as non-invasive <b>prenatal</b> <b>testing</b> (NIPT), autonomous reproductive decision-making is increasingly challenging. In this study, a randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of a web-based multimedia decision aid on decision-making regarding <b>prenatal</b> <b>testing.</b> The decision aid provided both written and audiovisual information on <b>prenatal</b> <b>tests</b> currently available, that is, prenatal screening by first-trimester combined testing, NIPT and invasive diagnostic testing through chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Furthermore, it contained values clarification exercises encouraging pregnant women to reflect on the potential harms and benefits of having <b>prenatal</b> <b>tests</b> performed. The use of the decision aid improved informed decision-making regarding <b>prenatal</b> <b>testing.</b> Of pregnant women allocated to the intervention group (n= 130) 82. 3 % made an informed choice compared with 66. 4 % of women in the control group (n= 131), P= 0. 004. As the vast majority of pregnant women made decisions consistent with their attitudes towards having <b>prenatal</b> <b>testing</b> performed, this improvement in informed decision-making could be attributed mainly to an increase in decision-relevant knowledge.

50|$|Confined placental mosaicism (CPM) {{represents}} a {{discrepancy between the}} chromosomal makeup of the cells in the placenta and the cells in the baby. CPM was first described by Kalousek and Dill in 1983. CPM is diagnosed when some trisomic cells are detected on chorionic villus sampling and only normal cells are found on a subsequent <b>prenatal</b> <b>test,</b> such as amniocentesis or fetal blood sampling. In theory, CPM is when the trisomic cells are found only in the placenta. CPM is detected in approximately 1-2% of ongoing pregnancies that are studied by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Chorionic villus sampling is a prenatal procedure which involves a placental biopsy. Most commonly when CPM is found it {{represents a}} trisomic cell line in the placenta and a normal diploid chromosome complement in the baby. However, the fetus is involved in about 10% of cases.|$|E

50|$|PUBS {{is a type}} {{of fetal}} blood {{sampling}} which was originally developed to determine the presence of hereditary abnormalities. Currently, it can detect a number of abnormalities including pH levels, oxygen levels, chromosomal issues, and infections. PUBS dates back to 1964 when Freda and Adamsons reported the removal of a uterus containing a fetus who had a buildup of fluid and ended up dying; however, {{this was one of the}} first procedures that showed promise for current day PUBS. Valenti hypothesized in 1972 that the procedure he used to obtain fetal tissue could be used to obtain fetal blood, and in 1973, he was able to sample fetal vessels; fetoscopy was used and refined between 1974 and 1983 as a <b>prenatal</b> <b>test</b> to determine fetal status as well as obtain fetal blood and perform transfusions in some cases. Fetoscopy is a procedure in which a device is inserted through the abdomen of the mother in order to visualize the fetus. The first documented use of PUBS came in 1983 by Daffos and colleagues who sampled blood from an umbilical vein with a needle and monitored its maneuvers with an ultrasound. PUBS has presented a more successful and less dangerous alternative to fetoscopy, which had a miscarriage risk of 5-10%.With the development of modern medicine and new techniques, PUBS is not used often except when rapid diagnosis and decisions must be made in regards to the fetus and suspected abnormalities suspected. PUBS has been predominantly replaced by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which is a more detailed investigation of chromosomal abnormalities.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyse {{population-based}} trends {{over the}} entire history of <b>prenatal</b> <b>testing</b> for aneuploidy. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of state-wide data sets. SETTING: Australian state of Victoria with ~ 70   000 annual births. POPULATION: All pregnant women undergoing invasive <b>prenatal</b> <b>testing</b> at < 25  weeks' gestation from 1976 to 2013. METHODS: Analysis of three state-wide data sets: (1) Prenatal diagnosis data set of 119   404 amniocenteses and chorionic villus samplings from 1976 to 2013; (2) central serum screening laboratory data set from 1996 to 2013; (3) government birth statistics from 1976 to 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual numbers and uptake rates of invasive <b>prenatal</b> <b>tests</b> and serum screening, indications for invasive <b>prenatal</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>prenatal</b> diagnoses of aneuploidy, diagnostic yield of invasive tests. RESULTS: Annual numbers of invasive <b>prenatal</b> <b>tests</b> climbed steadily from 1976, then declined from 2000. In 2013, the number of invasive <b>prenatal</b> <b>tests</b> was the lowest in 25  years, while the number of trisomy 21 diagnoses was the highest ever recorded. Annual uptake of serum screening climbed from 1. 6 to 83 % over 1996 - 2013. Results from 2013 showed a high diagnostic yield (15. 8 %) for a low rate of invasive testing (3. 4 % of births). Over four decades, the number of invasive procedures performed for each diagnosis of major chromosome abnormality declined from 100 to six. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates historic reductions in the proportion of women undergoing invasive testing and dramatic improvements in diagnostic yield. Monitoring the impact of new prenatal technologies on this progress remains an important research priority.
