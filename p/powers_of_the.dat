5|$|One {{check on}} a magistrate's power was his collegiality. Each magisterial office {{would be held}} {{concurrently}} by at least two people. Another such check was provocatio. Provocatio was a primordial form of due process. It was a precursor to habeas corpus. If any magistrate tried to use the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal {{the decision of the}} magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their imperium extended. In effect, they would retain the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office (as a promagistrate), without officially holding that office.|$|E
5|$|The Senate convened on 18 September, to {{validate}} Tiberius's position as Princeps and, {{as it had}} done with Augustus before, extend the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position to him.
