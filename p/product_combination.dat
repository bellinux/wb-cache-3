As an offshoot of this success ADR recognized {{the need for a}} highly efficient and sophisticated application development language for Datacom/DB. This development language would need to offset the normal difficulties of writing telecommunication-based application programs. ADR’s Princeton-based application language development team had developed MetaCOBOL, which generated detailed and accurate COBOL statements from a high-level logical language set. Soon after the purchase of Datacom the team designed IDEAL. “Interactive Development Environment for an Application Lifecycle” was a watershed achievement in database application language development. Combining IDEAL and its highly-productive programming environment with Datacom/DB’s ease-of-use and Datacom/DC’s high performance gave ADR a very potent <b>product</b> <b>combination</b> which dominated industry performance throughout the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A popular {{effective}} countermeasure {{to protect}} block cipher implementations against differential power analysis (DPA) attacks is {{to mask the}} internal operations of the cryptographic algorithm with random numbers. While the masking technique resists against first-order (univari-ate) DPA attacks, higher-order (multivariate) attacks were able to break masked devices. In this paper, we formulate a statistical model for higher-order DPA attack. We derive an analytic success rate formula that distinctively shows the effects of algorithmic confusion property, signal-noise-ratio (SNR), and masking on leakage of masked devices. It further provides a formal proof for the centered <b>product</b> <b>combination</b> function being optimal for higher-order attacks in very noisy scenarios. We believe that the statistical model fully reveals how the higher-order attack works around masking, and would offer good insights for embedded system designers to implement masking techniques...|$|E
