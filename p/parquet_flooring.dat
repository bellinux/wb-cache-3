25|$|After the war, John Chattell (born 1931) {{bought the}} estate, {{dividing}} the house into eleven apartments. However, dry and wet rot became increasingly problematic {{and the house}} uninhabitable; its listed building description (written after a visit in November 1953) noted that it was already 'empty and boarded up', and placed it at Grade II status (it was later upgraded to Grade I). In 1973, rock band Led Zeppelin bought Hammerwood at auction {{with the hope of}} turning it into a music centre, recording studio and flats. Although the house did make an appearance {{at the beginning of the}} film The Song Remains the Same, their plans did not progress. Significant vandalism saw three tons of lead removed from the roof, compromising it in fourteen different places and allowing thousands of gallons of water to leak into the structure. The progression of the dry and wet rot accelerated, leading the house to become increasingly structurally unsafe (with the collapse of a first-floor bathroom which had previously been held aloft by its own plumbing leading to the bath installed therein falling into the Drawing Room below, and overflowing onto its 18th century <b>parquet</b> <b>flooring).</b> The house was subsequently boarded up in 1976, and put on sale in 1978.|$|E

Many critics felt these set design choices lent the production an air of Brechtian verfremdungseffekt. Stanley Wells wrote of the set that it was intended to invite the viewer to [...] "accept the play's artificiality of language and action," [...] Michael Hattaway describes it as [...] "anti-illusionist," [...] Susan Willis argues that the set allows the productions [...] "to reach theatrically toward the modern world" [...] and Ronald Knowles writes [...] "a major aspect of the set was the subliminal suggestion of childlike anarchy, role-playing, rivalry, game and vandalism, as if all culture were precariously balanced on the shaky foundations of atavistic aggression and power-mad possession." [...] Another element of verfremdungseffekt in this production is seen when Gloucester and Winchester encounter one another at the Tower, both are on horseback, but the horses they ride are hobby-horses, which the actors (David Burke and Frank Middlemass respectively) cause to pivot and prance as they speak. The ridiculousness of this situation works to [...] "effectively undercut their characters' dignity and status." [...] The [...] "anti-illusionist" [...] set was also used as a means of political commentary; as the four plays progressed, the set decayed and became more and more dilapidated as social order became more fractious. In the same vein, the costumes become more and more monotone as the four plays move on. The First Part of Henry the Sixt features brightly coloured costumes that clearly distinguish the various combatants from one another, but by The Tragedy of Richard III, everyone fights in similarly coloured dark costumes, with little to differentiate one army from another. Graham Holderness saw Howell's non-naturalistic production as something of a reaction to the BBC's adaptation of the Henriad in seasons one and two, which had been directed by David Giles in the traditional and straightforward manner favoured by then series producer Cedric Messina; [...] "where Messina saw the history plays conventionally as orthodox Tudor historiography, and [...] employed dramatic techniques that allow that ideology a free and unhampered passage to the spectator, Jane Howell takes a more complex view of the first tetralogy as, simultaneously, a serious attempt at historical interpretation, and as a drama with a peculiarly modern relevance and contemporary application. The plays, to this director, are not a dramatisation of the Elizabethan World Picture but a sustained interrogation of residual and emergent ideologies in a changing society [...] This awareness of the multiplicity of potential meanings in the play required a decisive and scrupulous avoidance of television or theatrical naturalism: methods of production should operate to open the plays out, rather than close them into the immediately recognisable familiarity of conventional Shakespearean production." ...|$|E

Another element of verfremdungseffekt in this production is the use of doubling, particularly the use of the actors David Burke and Trevor Peacock. Burke plays both Henry's closest advisor and most loyal servant, Gloucester, and after Gloucester's death, he plays Jack Cade's right-hand man, Dick the Butcher. Peacock plays Cade himself, having previously appeared in The First Part of Henry the Sixt as Lord Talbot, representative of chivalry. Both actors play complete inversions of their previous characters, re-creating both an authentically Elizabethan theatrical practice and a Breachtian political commentary.

They were newly rich contractors who, having bought houses, motors, hand-painted pictures, and gentlemanliness, were now buying a refined ready-made philosophy.

60|$|Apparently {{there was}} to be no end to royal graciousness this morning, as every one who looked could see. Hardly was the coat on M. le Contrôleur's {{shoulders}} than the King engaged him in conversation, whilst Mme. de Pompadour dropped into the armchair lately vacated by Monseigneur de Courtenai. The well-drilled circle of courtiers and ladies, including la belle Irène herself, retired discreetly. Once more there was a barrier of emptiness and <b>parquet</b> <b>flooring</b> round the inner group, now composed of His Majesty, of M. le Contrôleur-Général, and of Mme. de Pompadour.

Through them came the pleasing sound of the perpetual drip from the monumental fountains, the twitter of sparrows, the scent of lingering roses and of belated lilies. No other sound from that outside world, no other life save the occasional footstep of a gardener along the sanded walks. But within all was chatter and bustle; women talked, men laughed and argued, society scandals were commented upon and the newest fashions in coiffures discussed. The men wore cloth coats of sober hues, but the women had donned light-coloured dresses, for the summer was at its height and this August morning was aglow with sunshine.|$|E

60|$|Gottfried Plattner is, {{in spite}} of his name, a freeborn Englishman.

Gottfried's age is seven-and-twenty. He is, by virtue of his heritage of three languages, Modern Languages Master in a small private school in the south of England. To the casual observer he is singularly like any other Modern Languages Master in any other small private school. His costume is neither very costly nor very fashionable, but, on the other hand, it is not markedly cheap or shabby; his complexion, like his height and his bearing, is inconspicuous. You would notice, perhaps, that, like the majority of people, his face was not absolutely symmetrical, his right eye a little larger than the left, and his jaw a trifle heavier on the right side. If you, as an ordinary careless person, were to bare his chest and feel his heart beating, you would probably find it quite like the heart of anyone else. But here you and the trained observer would part company. If you found his heart quite ordinary, the trained observer would find it quite otherwise. And once the thing was pointed out to you, you too would perceive the peculiarity easily enough. It is that Gottfried's heart beats {{on the right side of}} his body.|$|E
6000|$|On this {{particular}} morning {{the sight of}} Lady Bastable enthroned among her papers gave Clovis the hint towards which his mind had been groping all breakfast time.

Bursting wildly into the kitchen quarters, Clovis screamed a frantic though strictly non-committal summons: [...] "Poor Lady Bastable! In the morning-room! Oh, quick!" [...] The next moment the butler, cook, page-boy, two or three maids, and a gardener who had happened to be in one of the outer kitchens were following in a hot scurry after Clovis as he headed back for the morning-room. Lady Bastable was roused from the world of newspaper lore by hearing a Japanese screen in the hall go down with a crash. Then the door leading from the hall flew open and her young guest tore madly through the room, shrieked at her in passing, [...] "The jacquerie! They're on us!" [...] and dashed like an escaping hawk out through the French window. The scared mob of servants burst in on his heels, the gardener still clutching the sickle with which he had been trimming hedges, and the impetus of their headlong haste carried them, slipping and sliding, over the smooth <b>parquet</b> <b>flooring</b> towards the chair where their mistress sat in panic-stricken amazement. If she had had a moment granted her for reflection she would have behaved, as she afterwards explained, with considerable dignity.
