40|$|This paper {{shows an}} {{exploratory}} {{study on the}} use of institutional or cultural <b>proximities</b> on growth model. The justification dealing with spillovers problems in growth models with such connection matrices is detailed. The empirical study answers two questions. First, do institutional and cultural weights are really different to geographical ones? Second, do these <b>proximities</b> have an impact on growth estimation? Analyze concludes that institutional and cultural <b>proximities</b> do differs from geographical <b>proximities.</b> Furthermore, both show autocorrelation with growth. Finally, the spatial estimates point out that institutional weights have a similar impact to geographical weights in growth model. Cultural ponderation seems to be insignificant for growth spillovers problems. ...|$|R

40|$|We created {{synthetic}} data-sets {{analogous to}} those {{shown in the}} lower-right panel of Fig. 3 in the main text, but using “real ” WMs representing the binding specificities of yeast TFs, and using branch lengths in the phylogenetic tree that are proportional to those for the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species. Formally, we took each of the 102 WMs inferred in [1] and made them all uniform width w = 10. WMs wider than w = 10 were cropped symmetrically, and WMs shorter than w = 10 were padded with random columns wa = wc = wg = wt = 1 / 4. For each data-set we chose one of the 102 WMs at random and embedded s = 4 sites in a random sequence of length L = 500. We then created S = 5 descendant sequences at phylogenetic distances that are proportional {{to those of the}} 5 Saccharomyces sensu stricto species. Those <b>proximities</b> are given by qcer = 0. 8, qpar = 0. 8, qmik = 0. 58, qkud = 0. 5, and qbay = 0. 45. The <b>proximities</b> are related to branch lengths by the equality qs = e −bs. (1) Using this we first transform all <b>proximities</b> qs into branch lengths. For the synthetic data we multiply each branch length with a factor λ, with λ ranging from λ = 0. 25 to λ = 4. Finally, we transform the branch lengths back to <b>proximities</b> using (1). At λ = 0. 25 this leads to <b>proximities</b> q 1 = 0. 948, q 2 = 0. 948, q 3 = 0. 873, q 4 = 0. 841, q 5 = 0. 819. At λ = 1 the <b>proximities</b> of course match the Saccharomyces <b>proximities,</b> and at λ = 4 the <b>proximities</b> are q 1 = 0. 41, q 2 = 0. 41, q 3 = 0. 11, q 4 = 0. 06, q 5 = 0. 04.
