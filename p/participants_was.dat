5|$|From 1958, the Danish {{championship}} {{was arranged}} through one calendar year, and the 1956–57 season lasted 18 months with the teams playing each other thrice for a 27 games total. From 1958 to 1974, the tournament was expanded to 12 teams, playing each other twice for 22 games per season each, {{but now the}} bottom two teams faced relegation. The number of teams was increased to 16 for the 1975 season, which resulted in 30 games per season. In 1986, the number of <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> altered once more, this time decreasing the number of teams to 14, {{and the number of}} games to 26.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> 1,587, with 894 in the Open and 693 in the Women's event. The number of {{registered}} teams was 180 from 175 countries in the Open section and 142 from 138 countries in the Women's section. Both sections set team participation records. Eritrea, Kosovo, and South Sudan competed in the tournament for the first time. The venue of the Chess Olympiad was the Baku Crystal Hall. The Chief Arbiter of the event was Azerbaijan's International Arbiter Faiq Hasanov.|$|E
5|$|Centralized {{order and}} {{oversight}} among the revolt's armed <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> difficult to establish {{because of the}} diversity and independence of the rebel factions. A meeting of rebel leaders {{was held in the}} Ghouta village of Saqba on 26 November. Sa'id al-'As accused al-Kharrat and others of plundering in the Ghouta, while al-Kharrat alleged that al-Shallash extorted the residents of al-Midan and the Ghouta town of Douma. The meeting concluded with an agreement to elect a government to replace the French authorities, increase recruitment of the Ghouta's inhabitants, coordinate military operations under a central command, and establish a revolutionary court to execute spies. The meeting also designated the area between the village of Zabdin and north of the Douma-Damascus road as being part of al-Kharrat's zone of operations. Despite his leading role in the rebels' military efforts, al-Kharrat {{was not included in the}} newly formed rebel leadership council, nor were any of al-Bakri's allies. Instead, al-'As served as the rebels' overall head.|$|E
50|$|The tournament's 8 <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> from {{at least}} two confederations. Two <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> unknown.|$|R
30|$|The mean <b>participant</b> age <b>was</b> {{approximately}} 66.9 (SD[*]=[*] 7.74) years. Demographic {{information was}} also collected {{to know that}} all the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> unrelated Caucasian men. Due to the characteristics of this pathology, all of the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> men.|$|R
30|$|For {{detecting}} high size effects (d >  1), 16 <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{required at}} power β =  0.8 and 21 <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{required for a}} power β =  0.9.|$|R
5|$|On the June 30 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, a match between six wrestlers {{for a new}} top-tier SmackDown! {{championship}} was held. JBL, one of the <b>participants,</b> <b>was</b> victorious in the match, but Theodore Long {{announced that he was}} still not the champion. Instead he had won the right to a match against the World Heavyweight champion, Batista, who was SmackDown!'s final 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to SmackDown!. The following week, it was announced Batista would meet JBL at The Great American Bash with the World Heavyweight championship on the line. At the Great American Bash, Batista was disqualified for attacking JBL with a chair and JBL was declared the winner. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August the IDF {{announced}} {{one of the}} Hezbollah <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> {{captured in}} a commando operation.|$|E
25|$|The study {{consisted}} of 232 college students, {{the average age of}} <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> 20, who had been cheated on within the last month. The study examined the link between the emotional distress caused by infidelity and health-compromising behaviors, perception of blame and self-esteem, and the differences in reactions of men and women(“How Psychological Distress”, 2017).|$|E
30|$|All <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{provided}} with BB and Cisco ASDM monitoring tools. Two <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> randomly selected (here identified as Participant 2 and <b>Participant</b> 4) and <b>were</b> furnished with EtherApe, which represented the “enhanced visualization” condition.|$|R
50|$|During a whispered speech test, the <b>{{participant}}</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind the participant and say a series of words in a soft whisper. The <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to repeat what is heard. If the <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> unable to distinguish the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until the <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> able {{to understand what is}} being said. The other ear is then tested.|$|R
30|$|This {{categorization}} {{was supported}} by the way the research <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned to treatment and control groups, as defined by Shadish et al. (2002). During the coding process, two main categories emerged: (a) randomized, where the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> randomly selected and assigned to the treatment or control group, and (b) quasi-experimental, where the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned by the researchers.|$|R
25|$|Initial {{estimates}} {{placed the}} number of athletes participating in Soviet event venues at approximately 8,000. Later, {{the number of}} expected <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> lowered to 2,300, representing 49 countries. However, not all the expected athletes showed up. The exact number of athletes {{who took part in}} events held outside of the Soviet Union is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{lasted from}} 22 March 2006 to 23 May 2007. The number of <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> cut from 12 teams to eight {{following}} the 2005 edition, but the matches were lengthened {{from three to}} four days, and each team qualifying for the main stage played three games, instead of two in the 2005 and 2004 editions.|$|E
25|$|Lorcaserin (Belviq) was {{approved}} June 28, 2012 for obesity with other co-morbidities. The average weight loss by study <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> modest, {{but the most}} common side effects of the medication are considered benign. It reduces appetite by activating a type of serotonin receptor known as the 5-HT2C receptor in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus, which is known to control appetite.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, three program <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}} for the inaugural One Week Job Program. Spots for the program were awarded based on public votes during an online competition. The first three <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> from Toronto, Texas and Tennessee. Each <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> awarded a scholarship of $3,000 (CDN) and given eight weeks to try eight different jobs.|$|R
30|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> 42 Temple University {{undergraduates}} (31 females) fulfilling {{a requirement}} for an introductory psychology course. Two <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> excluded from the analysis for not following instructions.|$|R
30|$|All <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> given full {{anonymity}} in {{this research}} project. As a result, no details, images, or videos relating to individual <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> included in the paper.|$|R
25|$|From October 19 to October 27, Hou {{played in}} the main even of 16th Univé Hoogeveen Chess Festival {{as part of the}} Univé Crown Group, a four player double round robin tournament. The average rating of the <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> 2695, making this a {{category}} 18 tournament. Hou finished in last place with a 2/6 score (-2 =4, TPR 2605).|$|E
25|$|In a 2012 study, {{researchers}} found that activation of specific brain regions while viewing images of opposite-sex speed dating <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> predictive {{of whether or not}} a participant would later pursue or reject the viewed participants at an actual speed dating event. Men and women made decisions in a similar manner which incorporated the physical attractiveness and likability of the viewed participants in their evaluation.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{recruiting}} <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> also initially controversial. Participants were sent letters of invitation based on names, addresses, and dates of birth {{provided by the}} NHS to the UK Biobank organisers. Although compliant with UK data protection law, some people objected to the NHS passing on such data to third parties without explicit consent, and also had concerns about the data security in such a large project.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} {{activity}} following the preshow, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> led into a cylindrical room (Control Freak's electronic lair), {{in which the}} walls are decked with multiple control panels, and {{the aim of this}} activity was to sprint from one control panel to another, to switch off the falling televisions. Following the activity, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> led into a room with an arrangement of cannons (a similar setup to Toy Story Midway Mania!) and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> to shoot down city scenes constructed from junk foods, with broccoli, carrots and blueberries for ammunition. For the third activity, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> led into a room with a dancing grid, and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> encouraged to partake in a physically active dance routine, and likely to get Leadbottom to dance along as well.|$|R
25|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> then {{divided into}} 2 groups to {{evaluate}} the computer’s performance and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to describe this performance from the choice of about 20 adjectives. Half of the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned to evaluate on computer #1, the computer that praised its own work. The other half were sent to another computer {{across the room to}} evaluate computer#1’s performance.|$|R
30|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> 160 South Korean {{respondents}} recruited {{through an}} online survey company in South Korea (48.1 % male, Mage =  22.94  ±  2.06  years; age range 20 – 29  years). The experiment was conducted using a mobile platform {{provided by the}} online survey company. Three <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> excluded due to incompleteness in their data; thus, the responses of 157 <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> analyzed.|$|R
25|$|The next {{sighting}} {{between any}} of the <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> on 9 August, when Taeping and Fiery Cross exchanged signals some 12° north of the Equator, in the Atlantic. Winds were light and variable, so they remained in company until 27 August, when a breeze sprang up which carried Taeping {{out of sight in}} four or five hours, whilst Fiery Cross suffered the enormous misfortune to remain becalmed for another 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|The film {{is set in}} 1817 in the Salta Province of {{northwest}} Argentina during the Argentine War of Independence. It {{is based on the}} actions taken by the guerrillas under the command of the general Martin Güemes against the royalist army, loyal to the Spanish monarchy. For exterior filming, a village was established in the same area where the actual conflict had taken place. The cast of some thousand <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> unprecedented in Argentine cinema until that time.|$|E
25|$|A {{new type}} of {{assessment}} centre opened in 2014 to collect imaging data. The visits extended the initial dataset to include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brain and chest regions, whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan of bones and joints, ultrasound measurements of the carotid arteries and resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Initial data on 4,000 <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> released {{at the end of}} 2015 and it was planned to scan 100,000 participants between 2015 and 2020 or later.|$|E
30|$|Eligible <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> between 18 and 70  years of age {{and have}} at least one {{headache}} attack per month. <b>Participants</b> <b>are</b> diagnosed according to at least three major criteria not including occipital nerve blockage from the diagnostic criteria of the Cervicogenic Headache International Study Group (Sjaastad et al. 1998; Knackstedt et al. 2010). All <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> diagnosed by a neurologist.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary role}} of PSI <b>participants</b> <b>is</b> {{to abide by}} the Statement of Interdiction Principles, with the primary purpose of interdicting subject weapons and materials. Additionally, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{recommended}} to enact legal statutes to facilitate effective interdiction and seizure of such items. Finally, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> to take measures to ensure that their national facilities are not utilized to transfer illicit weapon cargoes.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> then {{divided into}} 2 groups to {{evaluate}} the computer’s performance and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to describe this performance from the choice of about 20 adjectives.

The other half were sent to another computer {{across the room to}} evaluate computer#1’s performance.|$|R
25|$|Further {{experiments}} have documented similar findings. In one study, when {{participants were given}} cognitively demanding concurrent tasks, the results showed a paradoxical higher frequency of target thoughts than controls. However other controlled studies have not shown such effects. For example, Wenzlaff and Bates found that subjects concentrating on a positive task experienced neither paradoxical effects nor rebound effects—even when challenged with cognitive load. Wenzlaff and Bates also note that the beneficiality of concentration in their study <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> better optimized when the subjects employed positive thoughts.|$|E
25|$|Lee Ying-chuen, one {{of seven}} {{survivors}} in the crisis, wrote an open letter urging Hong Kong people to help Filipinos fight for a better society and justice, and not {{to see them as}} scapegoats for their corrupt government. On August 28, 2010 a candlelight vigil with a thousand <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> held in Hong Kong to mourn the victims. Legislators from different political parties organized a march on August 29, which according to organizers, was attended by about 80,000 people; the police gave a figure of 30,000. 400 Filipinos also held a vigil for the victims in Chater Gardens on August 29.|$|E
25|$|The tournament, {{part of the}} {{qualification}} process for the 2016 World Twenty20, was contested by six members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) – two associate members and four affiliate members. The number of <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> reduced by two from the previous tournament in 2012. Of the competing teams, Nigeria had been relegated from 2013 Division One and Swaziland promoted from 2014 Division Three, with the other four qualifying {{by virtue of their}} position in the last Division Two tournament. The six teams played each other in a round-robin over a period of five days. Ghana and Zambia finished equal on points, but Ghana had a better net run rate, thus winning the tournament and qualifying for the 2015 Division Two tournament.|$|E
30|$|For {{each test}} {{sentence}} in the survey paper, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to complete three tasks about the {{sentence in the}} following order: (1) acceptability judgement, (2) grammaticality judgement, and (3) subject selection. In the acceptability judgement task, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> required to rate the acceptability of a test sentence on a 7 -point Likert scale. In the grammaticality judgement task, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> required to decide whether a test sentence was grammatical or not. In the subject selection task, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> required to choose the subject out of the two NPs in a test sentence; a third choice ‘cannot decide’ was also allowed. To ensure that the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{paying attention to the}} subject selection task, for half of the tasks, the presented order of the two NPs in the question was the reverse of their positions in the test sentences. Before completing the survey, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> instructed that there were no standard answers to the tasks and that they should base their answers on their first impressions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>are</b> {{encouraged}} {{to use these}} values in decision-making concerning their own sexuality and relationships. Throughout the program, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{encouraged to}} explore and learn to articulate their own values.|$|R
30|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> {{recruited}} through word of mouth, radio advertisements, local e-mail subscription services, social media, and flyers. All potential <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{screened for}} exclusion criteria via telephone scripts and face-to-face interviews.|$|R
