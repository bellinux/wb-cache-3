40|$|This paper mainly {{examines}} {{whether or}} not the celebrated Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) offers any ground-breaking provisions that are not in the Revised Kyoto Convention (RKC). A comparative study of the two ‘laws ’ then reveals that the TFA is mainly a reflection of the RKC provisions. Besides, the very few aspects of the TFA which are not regulated by the RKC are, in fact, catered for by other instruments and tools of the World Customs Organization (WCO). From the above, and in light of the current impasse concerning the adoption of the <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>Amendment</b> that would lead to incorporation of the TFA into the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) legal framework, it is opined that even if the TFA were to fail to come into force, a further developed RKC – incorporating, for instance, some aspects of the ‘SAFE Package ’ like the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) – would make a perfect substitute. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the improvement of quality of radiotherapy and compliance to the <b>protocol</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> EORTC study 08941. The radiotherapy-specific data were analysed from 154 patients with stage IIIA-N 2 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer who were actually irradiated after response to 3 cycles of platinum-based induction chemotherapy. The parameters of quality, assessed in 93 patients before and in 61 after protocol amendment, included: time interval between last chemotherapy course and start of thoracic radiotherapy, the use of a 3 -D planning CT, dose and fractionation scheme to the primary tumour, the involved and uninvolved mediastinum, duration of radiotherapy and toxicity. A significant improvement of all quality parameters was noted, except for the overall treatment time, which decreased slightly. Protocol amendment resulted in an improvement of the quality and the compliance of most observed parameters, at the cost of some increase in overall treatment time. The latter reflects logistical problems rather than poor compliance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{criminal}} offence “killing and torturing animals” under Article 269 of the Criminal Code {{says that it}} can be committed only “contrary to regulations”. The regulations governing the treatment of experimental animals are the Animal Welfare Law from 2009 and the Law on the Ratification of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes amended by the <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> to the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes from 2010. The first one imposes numerous obligations and introduces numerous prohibitions in the treatment of experimental animals, which at first sight make the possibilities of committing this {{criminal offence}} greater. The other law does not contain most of the prohibitions and restrictions that are included in the Animal Welfare Law. Thanks to a legal rule which says that a later law regulating the same subject replaces the former one (lex posterior derogate legi priori) and the aforementioned unconstitutionality of many provisions of the Animal Welfare Law, researchers and teachers in Serbia are not in particular danger of criminal prosecution.

40|$|The Amazon region {{contains}} the world’s largest river, the world’s biggest tropical forest, and the world’s richest biodiversity and {{is shared by}} nine countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, French Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela), each with its individual approach {{as to how to}} protect this environment. However, due to its unique value in the local, national, regional and global context, cooperation is required to manage this ecosystem. This thesis thus evaluates the approaches of environmental protection in the Amazon region at the national, regional, and international levels through the lens of forest protection. At the international scale the international law on forests and negotiations to create a binding instrument were analyzed. Although there is no single binding document on forests, we analyze how other treaties and conventions can induce protection. At the regional level, we analyze the Treaty for Amazonian Cooperation (ACT), signed by Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela in 1978, and the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO), established by the <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>Amendment</b> to ACT, signed in 2002 by its signatories, within a context of cooperation within the Amazon region. At the core of this thesis, the development of this organization is studied, along with its practical effects. At the national scale institutional framework of forest management in Bolivia, Brazil, and Ecuador were evaluated as illustrations of how some Amazon countries are addressing the complex issues within the region and how national law related to the international and regional attempts of protection. By analyzing the cooperation among Amazon countries in different scales overlapped in the Amazon, this study demonstrated that despite the existence of cooperation, forest governance is still incipient and current mechanisms have to evolve to further provide for a true sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|This {{entry into}} force of the World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS Agreement in 1995 {{transformed}} the international intellectual property system. The harmonization of basic intellectual property standards has operated to protect investment in innovation, limiting risks from unjustified 2 ̆ 7 free riding. 2 ̆ 7 Yet these same harmonized IP standards sharply curtailed the traditional capacity of suppliers of public goods, {{such as health care}} and nutrition, to address the priority needs of less affluent members of society, particularly in (but not limited to) developing countries. In the Doha Declaration, the Waiver Decision of 30 August 2003 and the Article 31 bis <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>Amendment,</b> stakeholders concerned with re-opening policy space for the supply of newer pharmaceutical products pushed back against the restrictive elements of the TRIPS Agreement. Governments around the world {{are in the process of}} deciding whether to ratify and accept the Article 31 bis Amendment. Based on their Study for the International Trade Committee of the European Parliament, the authors argue that acceptance of the Amendment will provide a 2 ̆ 7 net benefit 2 ̆ 7 for countries seeking to improve access to medicines. At the insistence of WTO delegations acting on behalf of the originator pharmaceutical industry lobby, Article 31 bis regrettably is saddled with unnecessary administrative hurdles. Nonetheless, through skillful lawyering, political determination and coordinated planning, the system can be made to work. Among other options, expeditious back-to-back compulsory licensing linked with pooled procurement strategies may effectively achieve economies of scale in production and distribution of medicines. The authors doubt that the international political environment would support renegotiation of an 2 ̆ 7 improved 2 ̆ 7 solution. They express concern that failure to bring the Amendment into force will open the door to a campaign to undermine the Waiver Decision. Recent events in Brazil and Thailand illustrate both the opportunities and risks associated with implementing TRIPS exception mechanisms, and help to inform views on the negotiating environment. Specific proposals for regional cooperation in implementing the Amendment are laid out, and the authors emphasize the importance of pursuing concrete transfer of technology measures in support of developing country pharmaceutical manufacturing. Over-reliance on private market mechanisms for the supply of public health goods leaves the international community with an unresolved collective action problem on a large scale...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The U. S. -Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) follows current U. S. {{free trade}} {{agreement}} (FTA) practice in containing two types of formal dispute settlement: (1) State-State, applicable to disputes between the Parties to the PTPA, and (2) investor-State, applicable to claims by an investor of one State Party against the other State Party for breach of a PTPA investment obligation. A defending Party in a State-State dispute found to be in violation of a PTPA obligation is generally expected to remove the complained-of measure; remedies for noncompliance include compensation and the suspension of PTPA concessions or obligations (e. g., {{the imposition of a}} tariff surcharge on the defending Party 2 ̆ 7 s products), with the defending Party having the alternative of paying a fine to the prevailing Party or, in some cases, into a fund that may be used to assist the defending Party in complying with its obligations in the case. An investor-State tribunal may only make monetary awards to the claimant and thus may not direct a PTPA Party to withdraw or modify a violative measure. If the defending State Party does not comply with an award, the investor may seek to enforce it under one of the international conventions for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards to which the United States and Peru are party. State-State dispute settlement may also be initiated against the non-complying Party. The PTPA State-State dispute settlement mechanism differs from earlier U. S. FTAs in that it applies to all obligations contained in the labor and environmental chapters of the PTPA instead of only domestic labor or environmental law enforcement obligations. In addition, in the event a Party is found to be in breach of one of these obligations and has not complied in the dispute, the prevailing Party may impose trade sanctions instead of, as under earlier agreements, being limited to requesting that a fine be imposed on the non-complying Party with the funds to be expended for labor or environmental initiatives in that Party 2 ̆ 7 s territory. The changes stem from a bipartisan agreement on trade policy between Congress and the Administration finalized on May 10, 2007 (May 10 agreement), setting out various provisions to be added to completed or substantially completed FTAs pending at the time. Among the aims of the agreement was to expand and further integrate labor and environmental obligations into the U. S. {{free trade agreement}} structure. The same approach to labor and environmental disputes is found in FTAs entered into with Colombia, Korea, and Panama, each of which continue to await congressional approval. Implementing legislation approving the PTPA and providing legislative authorities needed to carry it out was signed into law on December 14, 2007 (P. L. 110 - 138). The agreement entered into force on February 1, 2009. A <b>protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> revising the PTPA to incorporate provisions involving labor, the environment, intellectual property, port services, and investment, as set out in the May 10 agreement, entered into force on the same day. To date, there have not been any disputes brought under either PTPA dispute settlement mechanism. In general, resort to panels under FTA State-State dispute settlement has been uncommon, and thus there has been relatively little experience with the operation of this mechanism over a range of agreements and issues. FTA investor-State claims have been filed under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) against each of the three agreement Parties. Four claims have been filed by U. S. investors under the Dominican Republic - Central America - United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), one against the Dominican Republic, two against El Salvador, and one against Guatemala. To date, no investor-State claims have been filed under other U. S. FTAs...|$|E
