A {{numerical}} {{approach was}} used to investigate the flow characteristics around a butterfly valve with the diameter of 2108 mm by the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT 6. 3. The simulation was carried out to predict flow field structure, flow resistance coefficient, hydrodynamics torque and so on, when the large diameter butterfly valve operated at various opening degrees. The three-dimensional simulation results shown that there are vortexes presented near valve back region as the opening degree smaller than 40 degree; the flow resistance coefficient reduces rapidly with the increasing of opening degree and the resistance coefficient is quite small as the angle larger than 50 degree; the hydrodynamic torque reduces with the increasing of opening degree and the hydrodynamic torque is smaller than 20 % of maximum torque; the torque ratio and the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> <b>ratio</b> are reduce with the increasing of opening degree, the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> <b>ratio</b> reduces rapidly as the opening degree is smaller than 50 degree...|$|E

40|$|By merging two {{standard}} swirl chambers, {{an alternative}} cooling configuration named double swirl chambers (DSC) has been developed. In the DSC cooling configuration, the main physical phenomena of the swirl flow in swirl chamber and {{the advantages of}} swirl flow in heat transfer augmentation are maintained. Additionally, three new physical phenomena {{can be found in}} DSC cooling configuration, which result in a further improvement of the heat transfer: (1) impingement effect has been observed, (2) internal heat exchange has been enhanced between fluids in two swirls, and (3) “∞” shape swirl has been generated because of cross effect between two chambers, which improves the mixing of the fluids. Because of all these improvements, the DSC cooling configuration leads to a higher globally-averaged thermal performance parameter (Nu¯¯/Nu∞/(f/f 0) 1 / 3) than standard swirl chamber. In particular, at the inlet region, the augmentation of the heat transfer is nearly 7. 5 times larger than the fully developed non-swirl turbulent flow and the circumferentially averaged Nusselt number coefficient is 41 % larger than the standard swirl chamber. Within the present work, a further investigation on the DSC cooling configuration has been focused on the influence of geometry parameters e. g. merging ratio of chambers and aspect ratio of inlet duct on the cooling performance.

Continues shear stress and heat flux conditions at the interface are used to determine the interface velocity and temperature. The velocity and temperature profiles in the channel for different values of Darcy number, thermal conductivity ratio, and porous layer thickness are plotted and discussed. The values of Nusselt number and friction factor of a fully clear fluid channel (Nu cl = 4. 12 and fRe cl = 24) are used to define heat transfer increment ratio (ε th = Nu p/Nu cl) and <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> increment <b>ratio</b> (ε p = f Re p/f Re cl) and observe the effects of an inserted porous layer on the increase of heat transfer and <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> The heat transfer and <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> increment <b>ratios</b> are used to define an overall performance (ε = ε th/ε p) to evaluate overall benefits of an inserted porous layer in a parallel plate channel.

In this study, the effects of inlet flow rate, inlet oil volume fraction, and oil droplet diameter on the separation efficiency and <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> <b>ratio</b> have been investigated along the hydrocyclone body. All the simulations were performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, in which the Eulerian multiphase model and the Reynolds stress turbulent model were employed for the prediction of multiphase and turbulent flow parameters through the hydrocyclone.

The results of the simulations illustrate good agreement with the reported experimental data. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that the separation efficiency almost increases twofold, when the droplet diameter increases from 25 to 50 micron. The effect of inlet flow rate on the separation efficiency is so significant that an increase in inlet flow rate from 5 to 25 l/min causes a sharp increase in the separation efficiency and raises it 2. 5 times the initial value. However, the inlet oil volume fraction showed a minor effect on the hydrodynamic flow behavior in the hydrocyclone body compared to the other investigated parameters...|$|E

The SFBD features an annular bed with inclined injection of gas through an array of blades which acts as the hot air distributor, which then imparts the swirling motion to the bed.

30|$|Zahid et al. (2012) {{show the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> profile versus {{injection}} rate during low- and high-salinity seawater injection through oil-saturated limestone cores. Diluting seawater ten times increased the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> 10 times at 0.1  cc/min injection rate and five times at 0.5 and 1  cc/min injection rates. Diluting seawater should decrease its viscosity because its density goes down with dilution. The {{increase in the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> when using low-salinity diluted seawater instead of seawater {{can be attributed to}} the calcium sulfate precipitation and the capillary pressure effects. Carlberg and Matthews (1973) show the relation between water salinity and calcium sulfate solubility in the water. Diluting seawater ten times will decrease the calcium sulfate solubility in the water, the precipitation rate of calcium sulfate will increase, and in turn, the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> will increase. The <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> increase <b>ratio</b> was low at higher injection rate due to the low contact time between the injected water and brine; therefore, the precipitation rate of calcium sulfate will be lower at injection rates 0.5  cc/min compared to that at 0.1  cc/min. From the previous work, we can conclude that low-salinity water injection was good in oil recovery, but it precipitated calcium sulfate and this will reduce the water injectivity. The solution of this problem is to add chelating agents to the injected water at low concentrations on a slug mode to prevent the sulfate scale precipitation. Chelating agents such as EDTA, HEDTA, HEIDA, MGDA, GLDA, NTA, and DTPA can be used for this purpose. Chelating agents should be used at high pH to avoid corrosion and compatibility problems with the seawater and formation brine.|$|R

Thermally and hydrodynamically fully developed conditions are considered. The flow inside the porous material is modelled by the Darcy–Brinkman–Forchheimer equation. The thermal boundary conditions at the interface between the porous medium and the clear region are described by two different models. For each interface model exact solutions are developed for the solid and fluid temperature fields. The Nusselt number (Nu) associated with each interface model is derived {{in terms of the}} porous insert normalised thickness (S) and other pertinent parameters such as thermal conductivity ratio (k), Biot number (Bi), and Darcy number (Da). The differences between the two interface models in predicting the temperature fields of the solid and fluid phases and validity of the Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE) assumption are examined. Subsequently, for each model the values of S, Bi, k and Da at which LTE holds are determined. Further, the maximum values of S up to that the two models predict LTE condition are found as a function of Bi, k and Da. For each model and for different pertinent parameters the optimum value of S, which maximises the Nu number, is then found. The results show that, in general, the obtained Nu numbers can be strongly dependent upon the applied interface model. For large values of k and Bi, there are significant disparities between the Nu numbers predicted by the two models. Nonetheless, for most values of k and Bi, and under different values of Da numbers both models predict similar trends of variation of Nu number versus S.

After a chapter on the determination of the incipient fluidizing velocity, the following aspects of multi-orifice distributor plates in gas fluidized beds have been studied: (i) The effect of the distributor on bubble formation related {{to the way in which}} even distribution of bubbles on the top surface of the fluidized bed is obtained, e. g. the desirable <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> <b>ratio</b> ?PD/?PB for the even distribution of gas across the bed. Ratios of distributor pressure drop ?PD to bed pressure drop at which stable fluidization occurs show reasonable agreement with industrial practice. There is evidence that larger diameter beds tend to be less stable than smaller diameter beds when these are operated with shallow beds. Experiments show that in the presence of the bed the distributor pressure drop is reduced relative to the pressure drop without the bed, and this pressure drop in the former condition is regarded as the appropriate parameter for the design of the distributor. (ii) Experimental measurements of bubble distribution at the surface has been used to indicate maldistribution within the bed. Maldistribution is more likely at low gas flow rates and with distributors having large fractional free area characteristics (i. e. with distributors having low pressure drops). Bubble sizes obtained from this study, as well as those of others, have been successfully correlated. The correlation produced implies the existence of a bubble at the surface of an orifice and its growth by the addition of excess gas from the fluidized bed. (iii) For a given solid system, the amount of defluidized particles stagnating on the distributor plate is influenced by the orifice spacing, bed diameter and gas flow rate, but independent of the initial bed height and the way the orifices are arranged on the distributor plate. II. In Part two, solids flowback through single and multi-orifice distributors in two-dimensional and cylindrical beds of solids fluidized with air has been investigated. Distributors equipped with long cylindrical nozzles have also been included in the study. An equation for the prediction of free flowback of solids through multi-orifice distributors has been derived. Under fluidized conditions two regimes of flowback have been differentiated, namely Jumping and weeping. Data in the weeping regime have been successfully correlated. The limiting gas velocity through the distributor orifices at which flowback is completely excluded is found to be indepnndent of bed height, but a function of distributor design and physical properties of gas and solid used. A criterion for the prediction of this velocity has been established. The decisive advantage of increasing the distributor thickness or using nozzles to minimize solids flowback in fluidized beds has been observed and the opportunity taken to explore this poorly studied subject area. It has been noted, probably for the first time, that with long nozzles, there exists a critical nozzle length above which uncontrollable downflow of solids occurs. A theoretical model for predicting the critical length of a bundle of nozzles in terms of gas velocity through the nozzles has been set up. Theoretical calculations compared favourably with experiments...|$|E
40|$|Choke valves {{are used}} to {{regulate}} the pressure from natural gas reservoirs. Traditional choke valves control the reservoir pressure drop using a single variable orifice. At choked flow conditions a shock wave forms in the vena contracta in the valve creating high downstream velocities and shock cell turbulence interaction. The high velocities increase erosion when there are sand particles in the gas. Shock cell turbulence interaction is a highly efficient noise generation mechanism and can create noise far in excess of industrial limits. Multistage (MS) technology is used to reduce high pressure in stages within a valve. Instead of a single port the MS valve uses a flow path of sequential restrictions and expansions. The segmenting of the pressure drop eliminates the presence of shock waves. This reduces the velocity (and hence erosion) and changes the primary noise generation mechanism to less efficient turbulent shear. A new MS valve geometry was developed by Cameron Flow Control. As part of this development a flow equation was required to determine the restrictive area in the valve (referred to as valve coefficient or Cv) which is necessary to control a set of reservoir conditions. The Cv of the valve {{is a function of}} its internal geometry and is complicated {{by the nature of the}} MS flow path. A mathematical model of flow through the MS path was constructed based on a series of sequential thick walled orifice plates. The choked flow conditions for the single stage geometries were investigated and linked to the gas expansion factor (Gy) and critical <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> <b>ratio</b> (τc). Experimental data and theory taken from (Rhode, 1969) was used to estimate a Cv value for the overall flow path for a series of different pressure differentials. The fluid properties were modelled using a suitable gas compressibility equation (Peng et al, 1976) and a Joule Thomson relationship (Bessieres et al, 2006) to account for changes in the expansion zones. The mathematical model did not produce a choked flow condition. Experimental tests were conducted using a model of the MS flow path, a mass flow loop and a Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measurement system. The mass flow rate tests showed that the rate of change of flow rate reduced significantly at high pressure drops without the gas becoming choked. The LDA velocity measurements indicated the existence of three flow phenomena within the MS path. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to investigate the mechanism that caused the reduction in flow rate. Both the mass flow rate and LDA velocity measurements were used to benchmark the CFD simulations. Three large vortices were proven to exist in the restrictive channels and their size and location were shown to ultimately limit the effective flow area. A full flow test was conducted on the MS valve to finalise the sizing equation and account for any upstream or downstream geometrical effects caused by the valve body. At the outlet of the MS paths, which exited into the same volume, further vortices were seen. These proved to further reduce the overall flow rate of the valve. The primary outcomes of this research were the design of an effective MS valve (EU Patent Number: IB 2008053368). As part of this, a new limiting flow mechanism was described and included as part of the sizing equation. In addition, a specific case where high inlet pressures created shock waves at the outlet was presented. Furthermore this research detailed the first use of LDA velocities measurements taken within a MS valve with a full scale design. This research expands on the state of the art knowledge of valve sizing and design...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the {{diagnosis}} of coronary stenosis is primarily based on the well-established functional diagnostic parameter, fractional flow reserve (FFR: ratio of pressures distal and proximal to a stenosis). The threshold of FFR has a “gray ” zone of 0. 75 – 0. 80, below which further clinical intervention is recommended. An alternate diagnostic parameter, <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> coefficient (CDP: <b>ratio</b> of trans-stenotic <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> to the proximal dynamic pressure), developed based on fundamental fluid dynamics principles, has been suggested by our group. Additional serial stenosis, present downstream in a single vessel, reduces the hyperemic flow, ~Qh, and <b>pressure</b> <b>drop,</b> D~p, across an upstream stenosis. Such hemodynamic variations may alter the values of FFR and CDP of the upstream ste-nosis. Thus, {{in the presence of}} serial stenoses, {{there is a need to}} evaluate the possibility of misinterpretation of FFR and test the efficacy of CDP of individual stenoses. In-vitro experiments simulating physiologic conditions, along with human data, were used to evaluate nine combinations of serial stenoses. Different cases of upstream stenosis (mild: 64 % area stenosis (AS) or 40 % diameter stenosis (DS); intermediate: 80 % AS or 55 % DS; and severe: 90 % AS or 68 % DS) were tested under varying degrees of downstrea...|$|R
40|$|Catalysts {{deposited}} on structured supports, such as ceramic or metallic monoliths, have several advantages over conventional packed bed reactors: increase of mass and heat transfer, lower <b>pressure</b> <b>drop,</b> larger surface-to-volume <b>ratio</b> and compact reactor design. Structured supports permit {{to decrease the}} particle size of the active metals by using low metal content, maintaining high catalytic performance. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} obtain nickel supported catalysts with high resistance toward carbon deposition. In the present work, several Ni structured catalysts were prepared using commercial cordierite monoliths with 400 cpsi cell density. The l carrier was deposited by reliable wash coating method whereas nickel was deposited by either wet impregnation or controlled adsorption methods. Catalysts were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, H 2 -TPR, BET techniques. The catalytic activity for DRM was evaluated at 1073 K during time on stream at different GHSV...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 30 % of {{the energy}} from an {{internal}} combustion engine is rejected as heat in the exhaust gases. An inverted Brayton cycle (IBC) is one potential means of recovering some of this energy, {{in order to improve}} the overall system efficiency. When a fuel is burnt, water and CO 2 are produced and expelled as part of the exhaust gases. In an IBC, in order to reduce compression work, the exhaust gases are cooled before compression up to ambient pressure. If coolant with a low enough temperature is available, it is possible to condense some of the water out of the exhaust gases, further reducing compressor work. In this study the condensation of exhaust gas water is studied. The results show that the IBC can produce about 50 kW/kg/s for the conditions investigated. The main factors that influence the power output are heat exchanger <b>pressure</b> <b>drop,</b> turbine expansion <b>ratio</b> and coolant temperature. A lower coolant temperature significantly increases power output, particularly when condensation occurs. Larger turbine expansion ratios produce more power and slightly lower the temperature at which condensation onset occurs. The system is very sensitive to heat exchanger <b>pressure</b> <b>drop,</b> as larger <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> increase the compressor pressure ratio whilst leaving the turbine expansion ratio unchanged. Higher turbine inlet pressures can also increase net power, but the higher exhaust backpressures pressures may increase engine pumping losses. Finally, for conditions when condensation is possible, the water content of the exhaust gas has a significant influence on power output. The hydrogen to carbon ratio of the fuel has the most potential to vary the water content and hence the power generated by the system. If there is no condensation, water content has a small impact on performance. The effect on power in the condensing region is predominantly due to reduced mass flow in the compressor...|$|R
