5|$|During {{her years}} in Minneapolis, Hickok {{lived with a}} society {{reporter}} named Ella Morse, {{with whom she had}} an eight-year relationship. In 1926, Hickok was diagnosed with diabetes, and Morse <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> take a year's leave from the newspaper so the pair could travel to San Francisco and Hickok could write a novel. At the beginning of the leave, however, Morse unexpectedly eloped with an ex-boyfriend, leaving Hickok devastated. Unable to face a return to Minneapolis, Hickok moved to New York, landing a job with the New York Daily Mirror.|$|E

5|$|Maria's {{character}} and beliefs {{led her to}} become involved in the movements directed against intemperance and slavery. She {{was a member of the}} Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society and <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> husband to become an abolitionist. James had previously expressed antislavery sentiments, but Maria urged him towards more active expression and involvement. His second volume of poems Miscellaneous Poems expressed these antislavery thoughts, and its 1,500 copies sold well.|$|E
5|$|Mary met {{her husband}} in Zagreb on 4July. She officially {{remained}} Sigismund's co-ruler {{until the end of}} her life, but her influence on government was minimal. Sigismund's land grants were always confirmed with Mary's own great seal {{during the first year of}} their common rule, but thereafter the grantees rarely sought her confirmation. Royal charters counted her regnal years not from her ascension, but from her husband's coronation. Nevertheless, Mary <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> husband to torture and execute John Horvat who was captured in July 1394 although Sigismund would have been willing to spare his life.|$|E

5|$|Reich and Ilse Ollendorff {{divorced}} in September 1951, ostensibly {{because he thought}} she had had an affair. She continued working with him for another three years. Even after the divorce, he suspected her of having affairs, and <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> to sign confessions about her feelings of fear and hatred toward him, which he locked away in the archives of his Orgone Institute. He wrote several documents denouncing her, while having an affair himself with Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Institute Press.|$|E
5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} One Foot in the Grave were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> {{to return to work}} on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E
5|$|While an undergraduate, she {{did some}} {{practice}} {{teaching at the}} Chinese high school in town shortly before graduating in 1952. She had won a scholarship to study music at the Philippine Women's University under Maestra Adoracion Reyes, {{a close friend of}} Imelda's cousin, Loreto Romualdez Ramos. She had a job at a music store but left this for a better one at the Central Bank. Straight from the Central Bank, she hurried to the University every day. After a few lessons, Adoracion was convinced Imelda had talent and <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> to enroll at the College of Music and Fine Arts at PWU, under a special arrangement that would put her on register while Adoracion would continue to give her free lessons.|$|E

5|$|William's father, Charles Blackstone, was a silk mercer from Cheapside, {{the son of}} {{a wealthy}} apothecary. He became firm friends with Thomas Bigg, a surgeon and the son of Lovelace Bigg, a gentleman from Wiltshire. After Bigg's sister Mary came to London, Charles {{eventually}} <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> to marry him in 1718. This was not seen as a good match for her, but the couple lived happily and had four sons, three of whom lived into adulthood. Charles (born August 1719) and Henry (May 1722), both became fellows of New College, Oxford and took holy orders. Their last son, William, was born on 10 July 1723, five months after Charles' death in February.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in her teens, Regina {{traveled}} to Germany {{to visit her}} brother. It was there she met geneticist and future Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met Hans-Gerhardt, whom she married in November 1933. In 1938, Hans-Gerhardt and Regina had a daughter, Joan Fischer. The reemergence of anti-Semitism under Stalin prompted Regina to go with Joan to Paris, where Regina became an English teacher. The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan {{to go to the}} United States in 1939. Hans-Gerhardt attempted to follow the pair but, at that time, his German citizenship barred him from entering the United States. Regina and Hans-Gerhardt had separated in Moscow, although they did not officially divorce until 1945.|$|E
5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E

5|$|Being {{a part of}} Best's family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which {{included}} meeting well-known sports personalities {{of the time and}} receiving preferential treatment when booking a table in a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre. The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family's large home in West Derby, which was called Ellerslie, but Mona fell out with John Best's sister, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton's public house) but Mona was always looking for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller semi-detached house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroom house in Princess Drive, Mona <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> parents, Thomas and Mary Shaw, to leave India and live with them in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Ho Yuen Hoe {{was born}} on 18 February 1908, to a family of silk weavers in Guangzhou, China, the second of three children. Her family was poor, and she was sold when she was five years old. Barely two years later, the {{spinster}} who had purchased her died, and Ho was sold by the woman's nephew, to become a maid. After a few years she was sold again. In her late teens, a group of snakeheads <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> and several other girls to emigrate to Singapore, ostensibly {{to work on a}} rubber plantation, but the job did not materialise. At the age of 21, alone and penniless, she married the owner of a grocery business. When the business failed, they left for Hong Kong, hoping for better fortune. Ho became a hairdresser in nearby Macau, but after discovering that her husband had another wife and children she decided to return to Singapore alone, vowing never to remarry. At about that same time, she became a vegetarian.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bessell's efforts {{ensured that}} {{for the time being}} the Scott threat was kept at bay. The missing {{insurance}} card meant that Scott's wife, who was pregnant, could not claim maternity benefits. Scott threatened to talk to newspapers, but the matter was resolved by the issue of an emergency card after Bessell's intervention at the Department of Health and Social Security. In 1970 Scott's marriage collapsed; he blamed Thorpe, and again threatened exposure. Bessell successfully prevented Thorpe's name being mentioned in court during the divorce proceedings, and arranged that Thorpe would anonymously pay the legal costs. Early in 1971 Scott moved to a cottage in the village of Talybont in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones. He sufficiently <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> of his mistreatment at the hands of Thorpe that she contacted the Liberal MP for the adjoining constituency of Montgomeryshire—Emlyn Hooson, on {{the right wing of the}} party and a friend of neither Thorpe nor Bessell. Hooson suggested a meeting at the House of Commons.|$|E

5|$|Suspicion {{continued}} to grow, and Maria's stepmother began talking of dreams that Maria {{had been murdered}} and buried in the Red Barn. On 19 April 1828, she <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> husband {{to go to the}} Red Barn and dig in one of the grain storage bins. He quickly uncovered the remains of his daughter buried in a sack. She was badly decomposed but still identifiable. An inquest was carried out at the Cock Inn at Polstead (which still stands today), where Maria was formally identified by her sister Ann from some physical characteristics. Her hair and some clothing were recognisable, and she was known to be missing a tooth which was also absent from the jawbone of the corpse. Evidence was uncovered to implicate Corder in the crime: his green handkerchief was discovered around the body's neck.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} {{prominent}} women at court {{during and after}} Wu's reign, including Shangguan Wan'er (664–710), a poet, writer, and trusted official in charge of Wu's private office. In 706 the wife of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, Empress Wei (d. 710), <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> husband to staff government offices with his sister and her daughters, and in 709 requested that he grant women the right to bequeath hereditary privileges to their sons (which before was a male right only). Empress Wei eventually poisoned Zhongzong, whereupon she placed his fifteen-year-old son upon the throne in 710. Two weeks later, Li Longji (the later Emperor Xuanzong) entered the palace with a few followers and slew Empress Wei and her faction. He then installed his father Emperor Ruizong (r. 710–712) on the throne. Just as Emperor Zhongzong was dominated by Empress Wei, so too was Ruizong dominated by Princess Taiping. This was finally ended when Princess Taiping's coup failed in 712 (she later hanged herself in 713) and Emperor Ruizong abdicated to Emperor Xuanzong.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1934, deHavilland was offered a {{scholarship}} to Mills College in Oakland to pursue her chosen career as an English teacher. She was also offered the role of Puck in the Saratoga Community Theater production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. That summer, Austrian director Max Reinhardt came to California for a major new production of the same play to premiere at the Hollywood Bowl. After one of Reinhardt's assistants saw her perform in Saratoga, he offered her the second understudy position for the role of Hermia. One week before the premiere, the understudy Jean Rouverol and lead actress Gloria Stuart both left the project, leaving 18-year-old deHavilland to play Hermia. Impressed with her performance, Reinhardt offered her the part in the four-week autumn tour that followed. During that tour, Reinhardt received word that he would direct the Warner Bros. film version of his stage production, and he offered her the film role of Hermia. With her mind still set on becoming a teacher, deHavilland initially wavered, but eventually Reinhardt and executive producer Henry Blanke <b>persuaded</b> <b>her</b> to sign a five-year contract with Warner Bros. on November 12, 1934, with a starting salary of $200 a week.|$|E
