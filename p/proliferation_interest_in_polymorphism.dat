It further reveals that this form and functioning of grandfathering is regulated by the quality and character of intergenerational relationships (as conceptualised by Katz and Lowenstein, 2010), which influences how men perform and construct their identities in a variety of ways. A ‘new’ identities approach (Fairhurst, 2003) is suggested to make sense of how the contemporary context shapes the familial and intergenerational relationships of men in middle- and old-age, and gives rise to multiple grandfathering roles and experiences.

Further, we conducted a meta-analysis on PRND T 174 M comparing the data of the four studies conducted to date. For SNP 1368 and PRNP M 129 V, we found significant evidence for linkage disequilibrium. No evidence was found for a relation of SNP 1368 to CJD independent of PRNP M 129 V. We further found a significant increased prevalence of M homozygotes at PRND T 174 M among sporadic CJD patients, when adjusting the analyses for the other genotypes. In the haplotype analyses, the association was strongest for persons homozygous for PRNP 129 M and PRND 174 M (odds ratio 4. 35, 95 % confidence interval 1. 05 - 8. 09; P = 0. 04). The meta-analysis on the PRND T 174 M polymorphism did not show a consistent effect across studies, raising the question as to whether PRND 174 M is causally related to CJD, or whether the PRND allele is in linkage disequilibrium with another polymorphism related to CJD. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{special issue}} of PORTAL Journal of Multidisciplinary International Studies is {{entitled}} ‘Italian Cultures: Writing Italian Cultural Studies in the World,’ guest edited by Ilaria Vanni (University of Technology Sydney). The issue aims at updating existing scholarship and scoping the <b>proliferation</b> of <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> the growing field of Italian cultural studies, whether conducted in Italy or outside that country. The issue proceeds from the premise that cultural studies practitioners write multiple Italies within Italy itself and from provincialized Italies, with a perspective that is both global and informed by specific local knowledge. As Vanni says in her introduction to the special issue, {{a number of questions}} arise when critics attempt both to imagine and work within the relatively recent field of Italian cultural studies: ‘Is there a specific genealogy to the study of cultures in Italy that intersects with the Anglophone definition of cultural studies? Is Italian cultural studies confined to cultural practices in Italy, or does it expand to include the cultural practices of the Italian diaspora? If there is an Italian cultural studies tradition, where is it? What do Italian cultural studies academics write about?' The contributions included here respond to such questions by drawing on a range of disciplinary and critical traditions to problematise received ideas about what Italy signifies and for whom. &# 13; &# 13; This issue of PORTAL also contains an essay and two cultural works in its cultural works section. ‘In the Age of Schizophrenia, Icebergs, and Things that Grip the Mind,’ from the Vietnam-based visual artist, curator, and writer, Sue Hajdú, is an evocative meditation on Saigon as represented in the work of five Vietnamese photographers— Ngo Dinh Truc, Lam Hieu Thuan, Nguyen Tuong Linh, Bui The Trung Nam, and Bui Huu Phuoc— who were born in the 1970 s and whose work is reproduced by permission here. In her response to these young artists’ representations of contemporary Saigon, Hajdú notes how each photographer is inevitably grappling with the historically and nationally specific notion of contemporary Vietnamese time, ‘the monumental demarcation line’ signified by 1975.

In this study, several molecular pathways are explored using cultured KCs and KCs freshly isolated from psoriatic plaques. p 16 and p 14 ARF are predominantly expressed spontaneously when foreskin-derived early-passage KCs undergo confluency-induced premature senescence. Induction of p 14 ARF on confluency occurred with low E 2 F- 1 levels. Suspension of KCs in methylcellulose induced p 12 expression. Addition of various cytokines (interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α) or a phorbol ester [12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) ] only induced p 16, but not p 14 ARF. Confluent KCs up-regulated Ras activity and the downstream signaling involving ERK. Addition of MAPK inhibitor blocked cytokine and TPA-induced p 16 expression. Confluency and interferon-γ induced premature senescence and p 16 expression was linked to induction of the transcription factor Egr- 1. KCs derived from chronic psoriatic plaques were characterized by enhanced p 16, p 14 ARF, and p 12 expression accompanied by elevated Egr- 1 levels. These results demonstrate that multiple and highly divergent stimuli can trigger the senescent checkpoint in human KCs with differential regulation of p 16, p 14 ARF, and p 12. Although abnormal mitogenic signaling by oncogenic Ras is generally cited as being responsible for induction of premature senescence, our findings indicate that a broader perspective is warranted, to include confluency and cytokine-/TPA-induced pathways for KCs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Optometric <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{the vision}} of athletes {{has led to the}} {{development}} of a distinct professional sub-division usually termed sports vision. The basic premise of sports vision is that eyes feed information to the brain, which interprets the data and then sets muscles into a coordinated motion. When the eyes’ messages are inaccurate or incomplete, performance may suffer Sports vision therefore encompasses performance oriented comprehensive vision care programs involving education, evaluation, correction, protection and enhancement of the athlete. This also true for referees officiating in many open skill sports. The study will endeavour to find an objective and reliable way to evaluate visual motor performance in rugby referees. In this study, a battery of fourteen (14) vision related procedures will be performed on the 27 top rugby referees in South Africa as requested by SARU. The procedures will be divided into hardware and software visual skills. Using existing protocols, a comparison with existing norms is made with the emphasis on the visual skills related to decision making. Separate standardised norms will also be developed for this referee population according to the performance of their visual skills. Over the past two decades, there has been a <b>proliferation</b> of research <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cognitive sport psychology or the scientific study of mental processes in sports performers. This welcome trend is evident in the abundance of recent studies on cognitive processes such as anticipation or the ability to select from many available cues to predict what is yet to occur and attention, focus and concentration to ensure consistent accurate performance and avoid distraction. Decision making is therefore the ability to make the best choice between a set of alternatives. The ability to make effective decisions is critical for rugby referees and draws on all forms of perceptual and cognitive skills available. This study showed that overall performance of rugby referees visual skills was reduced and below par and highlighted that certain visual skills are more important than others, in this case visualization and central peripheral awareness were deemed to be the two most important skills that affect overall refereeing performance [...] .

No statistical significance was observed for the distribution frequency of the NFKBIA [...] 519 C/T, - 826 C/T, or - 881 A/G genotype and haplotype polymorphisms between HCC patients and controls. Furthermore, female HCC patients carrying the NFKB 1 - 94 <b>Ins</b> <b>polymorphism</b> were associated with lower clinical stages and smaller tumor sizes. Our results indicate that the NFKB 1 - 94 <b>Ins</b> promoter <b>polymorphism</b> increased the risk of HCC, and may be applied as a predictive factor for the clinical stage and tumor size in female HCC patients...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. {{agricultural}} policy process {{is marked by}} a <b>proliferation</b> of organized <b>interests</b> and rising transaction costs. These pose a barrier for countries negotiating with the United States on trade issues. This paper examines the causes of this <b>proliferation</b> of <b>interests,</b> the impact of this proliferation on trade policy decisions, and the consequences of these escalating transaction costs for countries negotiating with the United States. The results suggest that other countries must anticipate that the U. S. position in trade negotiations will be the result of an accommodation of conflicting interests and that any agreement will pass Congress only if it contains gains for U. S. export industries.
