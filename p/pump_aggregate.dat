To represent accurately stresses on the ground-water flow system, ground-water flow models require that pumping rates be distributed temporally and spatially among three aquifer units.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An in situ annular flume (Sea Carousel) was {{deployed}} in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario, {{to assess the}} structure, stability, and transformation of lacustrine surface fine-grained laminae (SFGL). Such laminae typify depositional lacustrine environments and occur at the sediment–water interface.

30|$|The second {{parameter}} is performance. How effective is a {{heat pump}} {{at a given}} outside temperature? Manufacturers often state a heating season performance factor (HSPF), which is the heat provided over the entire heating season in BTUs divided by the electricity consumed in kWh. This factor can be translated into a coefficient of performance (COP), which is usually used to measure instantaneous performance, and {{has the advantage of}} using the same units in the numerator and denominator (in this case kWh). Over the entire heating season, the COP can average in the range of 2 – 3 or more [17, 33, 37]. Performance can be adversely affected by many factors. When temperatures are high, single speed heat pumps must cycle on and off to deliver only the heating required by the home. Cycling can reduce performance, but is mitigated by new variable speed heat pump technology that allows the heat pump to match output to indoor needs. As temperatures fall, it becomes more difficult to draw heat from the outside air, and while this will reduce the need to cycle on and off, it increases the risk of frost, ice and snow building up on the outdoor heat exchanger. To combat this inevitability, defrost cycles are periodically activated by reversing the refrigerant flow and dumping heat outside to melt any ice or snow that has built up [30]. As temperatures fall further, the heat pump will struggle to provide adequate heating and require backup heating from a conventional heating system. In Ontario, even modern variable speed heat pumps {{may not be able to}} provide for all of a home’s heating needs throughout the heating season. Despite all of these problems, modern heat pumps can operate at very low outdoor temperatures and many can maintain their full heating capacities at temperatures of - 15 ^∘C [19, 30, 37]. Because the COP varies over both the range of operating temperatures and amongst different models of heat <b>pumps,</b> an <b>aggregated</b> estimate of performance is necessary to predict energy requirements over the geographic and temporal ranges studied.|$|R
40|$|Groundwater pumping causes {{depletion}} of groundwater storage. The rate of depletion incurred by any new well is gradually decreasing and eventually becomes zero {{in the long}} run, after induced recharge and reduction of natural discharge of groundwater combined (capture) have become large enough to balance the pumping rate completely. If aquifer-wide <b>aggregated</b> <b>pumping</b> rates are comparatively large, then such a new dynamic equilibrium may not be reached and groundwater storage may become exhausted. Decisions to pump groundwater are motivated by people’s need for domestic water and by expected benefits of using water {{for a variety of}} activities. But how much finally is abstracted from an aquifer (or is considered to be an optimal aggregate abstraction rate) depends {{on a wide range of}} other factors as well. Among these, the constraint imposed by the groundwater balance (preventing aquifer exhaustion) has received ample attention in the professional literature. However, other constraints or considerations related to changes in groundwater level due to pumping are observed as well and in many cases they even may dominate the decisions on pumping. This paper reviews such constraints or considerations, examines how they are or may be incorporated in the decision-making process, and evaluates to what extent the resulting pumping rates and patterns create conditions that comply with principles of sustainability. groundwater development; groundwater storage depletion; socio-economic impacts; environmental impacts; groundwater resources management; sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Efficient use {{of water}} and energy {{resources}} are significant requirements for increasing irrigated rice productivity. However, the ever increasingly complex interplay between energy, water and agriculture in feeding both machinery and people, respectively, plus the added impact on and of climate change, have significant implications on the management of our natural resources. This paper holistically analysed a rice-dominated gravity-fed irrigation system using the Upper Pumpanga River Integrated Irrigation System (UPRIIS) in Central Luzon, the Philippines as demonstration example to quantify the water, energy and economic implications of water reuse at five different spatial scales. Water reuse was determined through daily measurements of all surface water inflows and outflows, rainfall, evapotranspiration, and the quantities of water internally reused through check dams and shallow <b>pumping,</b> and <b>aggregated</b> into seasonal totals for five spatial scales {{during the dry season}} of 2001. Energy auditing was later used to evaluate the energy implications of water reuse. Results show that ∼ 30 % of the total surface water applied was reused by internal check dams and pumping from shallow groundwater. Across the five spatial scales, water productivity with water reuse was always higher than without water reuse, which reflects the significance of water reuse. The cost-benefit ratio indicates enhanced rice profitability at all five spatial scales with and without water reuse. However, economic benefits of water reuse were lower than economic benefits from surface water, which was mainly due to the higher costs of pumping. Irrigation requires a significant expenditure of fossil energy both for pumping and delivering water to crops. Total energy inputs of water reuse were 28 % higher than the energy inputs without water reuse, which was mainly attributed to higher diesel energy inputs. Whilst water reuse contributes significantly to water productivity across the five spatial scales, it does increase energy use due to pumping. Our holistic analysis indicated a tradeoff between yield and energy use. Achieving higher water productivity would require additional use of fossil energy, which in turn could increase the energy use competition and decrease economic returns. Given the increasing global concerns about climate change and sustainable energy use, an optimal combination {{of water and}} energy use is absolutely essential. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBy {{altering}} the number, size, and density of {{particles in the}} ocean, the activities of different phytoplankton, zooplankton, and microbial species control the formation, degradation, fragmentation, and repackaging of rapidly sinking aggregates of particulate organic carbon (POC) and are responsible {{for much of the}} variation in the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. A more systematic understanding of these processes will allow the biological pump to be included in global models as more than an empirically-determined decline in POC concentrations with depth that may not adequately represent past or future conditions. Although progress has been made on this front, key areas needing work are the amount of POC flux associated with appendicularians, the mechanisms by which coccoliths and coccolithophorid POC reach depth, and the impact of polymers such as TEP on the porosity of aggregates. In addition, an understanding of the interaction between biological and physical aspects of the <b>pump,</b> such as <b>aggregate</b> loading with suspended mineral particles, is also important for understanding the transmission of biogenic materials through the meso- and bathypelagic realms. Data suggest that variable biogenic silica to POC production ratios in various ocean regions are responsible for the poor correlation observed between silica and POC in deep sediment traps, and that high concentrations of suspended coccoliths in deep waters may be responsible for the homogeneous calcium carbonate to POC ratios observed in these same traps. Sedimentation of foraminiferal calcite {{does not appear to be}} as tightly correlated to POC flux as coccolith sedimentation. Suspended calcium carbonate particles, scavenged by sinking organic aggregates, have been observed to both fragment and increase the density of these aggregates. Analysis of the data suggests that scavenging of minerals by aggregates decreases the porosity of the aggregates and may increase their sinking velocities by hundreds of times...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer-based}} {{analog model}} to determine market potential for electric power-driven water pumps in developing countries. The {{purpose of this}} study is to develop a computer-based model that predicts the market potential for electric water pumps in developing nations. The logic employed in such an analysis first seeks out countries which at some point in their recent history have exhibited unusually high growth rates in <b>aggregate</b> <b>pump</b> demand during a period of several years. Next, the researcher evaluates the significance of specific social and economic "indicator" variables when matched with raw trade statistics for that country via stepwise regression [...] a computer assisted procedure. Finally, by isolating the economic and/or social factors that most closely parallel a country's pump demand, one can identify and rank the developing countries offering the greatest potential sales. The systematically chosen highpotential markets are then worthy of individual consideration and additional resource contribution in a given firm's strategic marketing plan. Since reach of the data were locally unavailable, a trip to the Department of Com©erce in Washington, D. C. and the United Nations in New York City was required. Funding to proceed with Part III of this report was solicited from, and granted by, a major domestic producer of electric water pump motors. The results of the research identified eight indicator variables directly correlated to the demand for imported pumps in developing nations. The regression equation composed of these eight variables, then, will be accepted as the best available model for predicting a country's pumpdemand. The regression equation also shows that each of the eight indicator variables contributes to changes in pump demand in different magnitudes. The research has identified forty-four developing nations with significant growth-rates in one or more of the eight indicator variables. Market projections are finally derived by comparing an individual country's indicator variable growth-rate to its historical pump demand growth-rate. Thesis (M. B. A. ...|$|R
