On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived {{off the edge of}} the summit with insufficient airspeed, but <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>speed</b> as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E

25|$|Preparing the Vampire for {{take-off}} {{would only}} require pilots to perform six vital actions: setting the trim to neutral, opening {{the high and}} low-pressure fuel cocks, activating the booster pump, setting the flaps, and retracting the air brakes. If laden with external fuel tanks or bombs, pilots would have to retract the undercarriage quite quickly upon leaving the ground, else increasing airflow as the aircraft <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>speed</b> would prevent the undercarriage doors from closing. Landing procedure was similarly free of complexity: disengaging the wheel brakes, lowering the undercarriage, setting the flaps to fully down, and effecting the air brakes. Typically, power-on landings were conducted due to the slow response of the engine to throttle changes, while the wheel brakes had to be applied carefully {{in order to avoid}} locking the wheels; there was no anti-lock braking system present.|$|E

Other photographs of the lahars and the impact of the disaster captured attention worldwide and led to controversy over the degree to which the Colombian government was responsible for the disaster.

However, Frances {{remained}} stable at Category2 intensity with [...] maximum sustained winds while it battered {{the east coast of}} Florida between Fort Pierce and West Palm Beach for much of September 4. At 11pm, the western edge of Frances' eyewall began moving onshore. Because of Frances' large eye, which was roughly [...] across, and its slow forward motion, the center of circulation remained offshore for several more hours. At 1am EDT on September 5 (0500 UTC), the center of the broad eye of Frances made landfall along the Florida coast, {{at the southern end of}} Hutchinson Island, near Sewall's Point, Jensen Beach and Port Salerno, Florida. Late on September 5, Frances <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>speed</b> due to a strengthening high pressure system to its north and crossed the Florida Peninsula, emerging over the Gulf of Mexico near Tampa as a tropical storm. After a short trip over the Gulf of Mexico, Frances made a second landfall near St. Marks, Florida. Frances headed inland, weakening to a tropical depression and causing heavy rainfall over the southern and eastern United States. As Tropical Depression Frances turned northeast, United States meteorologists at the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center continued issuing advisories on the system until it crossed the Canada–United States border into Quebec, where heavy rainfall also fell.|$|E

[...] The plane then finally plowed into an empty field in Stonycreek, Pennsylvania, about 20 minutes' flying time from Washington, D.C. The last entry on the voice recorder was made at 10:03:09. The last piece of flight data was recorded at 10:03:10. There is some controversy between some of the family members of the passengers and the investigative officials as to whether the passengers managed to breach the cockpit. The 9/11 Commission Report concluded that [...] "the hijackers remained at the controls but must have judged that the passengers were only seconds from overcoming them." [...] However, many of the passengers' family members, having heard the audio recordings, believe that the passengers breached the cockpit and killed {{at least one of the}} hijackers guarding the cockpit door; some interpreted the audio as suggesting that both the passengers and hijackers struggled for control of the yoke.|$|E
500|$|While {{on patrol}} {{near the mouth}} of the Co Chien River {{in the early hours of}} 20 June, the skipper of Point League noted a large radar contact which, upon further investigation, was found to be running without {{navigation}} lights. After informing the CSC of the situation the cutter went to general quarters and spotlighted the incoming trawler. The trawler ignored a hail from Point League and two bursts of machine gun fire across its bow. The trawler returned with heavy machine gun fire hitting the cutter's bridge and wounding the executive officer and a crewman manning the mortar on the forecastle. The trawler dropped the line on a towed junk and <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>speed</b> in an effort to beach along the shore. When the commanding officer of Point League noticed that the trawler was headed for shoal water {{near the mouth of}} the river, he let the trawler run aground [...] from shore and moved to a position [...] away while keeping the target illuminated with mortar rounds. Point League then came under fire from Viet Cong elements operating from just behind the shoreline. With assistance from Point Slocum the two cutters poured machine gun fire into the grounded trawler. Just after dawn the trawler was sunk by what was probably a scuttling charge resulting in a large fire. At 07:15 destroyer escort [...] arrived on scene and assumed control of the operation. With the assistance of two U.S. Air Force F-100 Super Sabre aircraft providing close air support, resistance from the shoreline was finally controlled. It was decided by the commanding officer of the Haverfield that salvage of the trawler would be attempted in order to learn more about the trawler, its origins and the cargo on board.
