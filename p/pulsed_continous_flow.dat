The corroded fibres were characterized in terms of dissolution velocities and the appearance of corroded surfaces. The majority of investigated fibres maintained their typical shape and reached constant velocities with time. For these cases, dissolution velocities were a decisive criterion to compare the dissolution behaviour of different fibres. For several other cases, two types of corrosion damage were identified beside the dissolution process, i. e. corrosion layer formation and pitting corrosion. Both effects were probably due to the production process, and lead to a loss of cylindric geometry during corrosion.

40|$|Abstract. Recently the {{knowledge}} extraction community takes {{a closer look}} to new models where data arrive in timely manner like a fast and <b>continous</b> <b>flow,</b> i. e. data streams. As {{only a part of}} the stream can be stored, mining data streams for sequential patterns and updating previously found frequent patterns need to cope with uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical approach which biaises the initial support for sequential patterns. This approach holds the advantage to maximiez either the precision or the recall, as chosen by the user, and limit the defradation of the other criterion. Moreover, these statistical supports help building statistical borders which are the relevant sets of frequent patterns to use into an incremental mining process. Theoretical results show that the technique is not far from the optimum, from the statistical standpoint. Experiments performed on sequential patterns demonstrate the interest of this approach and the potential of such techniques. ...|$|R

In this paper, we report the selective manipulation of soil particles using an AC electrokinetic microfluidic system. Four heterogeneous soil samples (smectic clay, kaolinitic clay, peaty loam, and sandy loam) were characterised using dielectrophoresis to identify the electrical difference to a target organism.

40|$|Regulated {{exocytosis}} is {{the process}} whereby vesicles fuse with the cell membrane upon a specific signal, usually calcium, to trigger the release of their contents into the extracellular space. It must be distinguished from constitutive exocytosis where a <b>continous</b> <b>flow</b> of constituents is delivered by vesicular transport and fusion to the plasma membrane {{in a variety of}} cells.

Two classes of proteins essential in these processes, SNAREs and synaptotagmins, are reviewed hen in light of the recent experimental advances. SNARE members constitute a large family of proteins characterised by structural and functional similarities and are the minimal machinery required for lipid bilayer fusion in several intracellular trafficking events. Synaptotagmins are calcium-binding proteins acting as main Ca 2 +-sensors in neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system and have a still undefined role in nonneuronal tissues. The coupling of SNAREs with members of the synaptotagmin family may form a calcium-regulated fusion machinery responsible for the final steps of regulated secretion...|$|R

My aim is to clarify the content of the classes mainstream and alternative, the reasons they have come to be, why they persist, and how they are related to each other.

The growth {{performance}} of duckweed (Spirodela polyrrhiza) and its removal rate of nitrate and phosphorus in sewages taken from {{sewage treatment plant}} with different processes were studied. The experiments were conducted in an environmentally controlled growth chamber. Three kinds of sewages were taken from a grit chamber, a sedimentation tank, and the anoxic pond in a sewage treatment plant, respectively. The fourth kind of sewage was mixed using the sedimentation tank sewage and the anoxic pond sewage in a volumetric ratio 1 : 1. The weight of duckweed biomass were determined with a balance. Wastewater samples taken from the media were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 –N), total phosphorus (TP), phosphate–phosphorus (PO 4 –P) using AA 3 <b>Continous</b> <b>Flow</b> Analyzer. The results showed that Spirodela polyrrhiza grew well in sewages taken from grit chamber and sedimentation tank of a sewage treatment plant, whereas a lot of duckweed fronds were dead in the sewage taken from the anoxic pond due to the high TP (higher than 7. 9 mg/L) and TN (higher than 51. 6 mg/L). The suitable TN concentration for Spirodela polyrrhiza growth should not be higher than 45 mg/L. Compared with the treatments without duckweed, the NH 4 –N concentrations were reduced more than 60 % in ST and GC sewages with duckweed due to the NH 4 –N uptake by duckweed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the response mechanisms of grapevine to Fe-deficiency and to potential Fe chlorosis prevention strategies. The {{results show that the}} presence of bicarbonate in the nutrient solution shifted the activity of PEPC and TCA cycle enzymes and the accumulation/translocation of organic acids in roots of Fe-deprived plants. The rootstock 140 Ruggeri displayed a typical behavior of calcicole plants under bicarbonate stress. The Fe chlorosis susceptible rootstock 101 - 14 reacted to a prolonged Fe-deficiency reducing the root activity of PEPC and MDH. Noteworthy, it accumulates high levels of citric acid in roots, indicating a low capacity to utilizing, transporting and/or exudating organic acids into the rhizosfere. In contrast, 110 Richter rootstock is capable to maintain an active metabolism of organic acids in roots, accumulating them to a lesser extent than 101 - 14. Similarly to 101 - 14, SO 4 genotype displays a strong decrease of mechanisms associated to Fe chlorosis tolerance (PEPC and MDH enzymes). Nevertheless it is able to avoid excessive accumulation of citric acid in roots, similar as 110 Richter rootstock. Intercropping with Festuca rubra increased leaf chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis. In addition, intercropping reduces the activity of PEPC in roots, similary to Fe-chelate supply. Applications of NH 4 + with nitrification inhibitor prevents efficiently Fe-deficiency, increases chlorophyll content, and induces similar root biochemical responses as Fe-EDDHA. Without the addition of nitrification inhibitors, the effectiveness of NH 4 + supply on Fe chlorosis prevention resulted significantly lower. The aspects intertwined in this investigation highlight the complexity of Fe physiology and the fine metabolic tuning of grapevine genotypes to Fe availability and soil-related environmental factors. The experimental evidences reveal the need to carry out future researches on Fe nutrition maintaining a <b>continous</b> <b>flow</b> of knowledge between theoretical and agronomical perspectives for fully supporting the efforts devoted to convert science into practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Candida albicans biofilms are {{commonly}} found on indwelling medical devices. However, the molecular basis of biofilm formation and development {{is not completely}} understood. Expression analysis of genes potentially involved in these processes, such as the ALS (Agglutinine Like Sequence) gene family can be performed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). In the present study, we investigated the expression stability of eight housekeeping genes potentially useful as reference genes to study gene expression in Candida albicans (C. albicans) biofilms, using the geNorm Visual Basic Application (VBA) for Microsoft Excel. To validate our normalization strategies we determined differences in ALS 1 and ALS 3 expression levels between C. albicans biofilm cells and their planktonic counterparts. Results The eight genes tested {{in this study are}} ranked according to their expression stability (from most stable to least stable) as follows: ACT 1 (β-actin) / PMA 1 (adenosine triphosphatase), RIP (ubiquinol cytochrome-c reductase complex component), RPP 2 B (cytosolic ribosomal acidic protein P 2 B), LSC 2 (succinyl-CoA synthetase β-subunit fragment), IMH 3 (inosine- 5 '-monophosphate dehydrogenase fragment), CPA 1 (carbamoyl-phosphate synthethase small subunit) and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase). Our data indicate that five genes are necessary for accurate and reliable normalization of gene expression data in C. albicans biofilms. Using different normalization strategies, we found a significant upregulation of the ALS 1 gene and downregulation of the ALS 3 gene in C. albicans biofilms grown on silicone disks in a <b>continous</b> <b>flow</b> system, the CDC reactor (Centre for Disease Control), for 24 hours. Conclusion In conclusion, we recommend the use of the geometric mean of the relative expression values from the five housekeeping genes (ACT 1, PMA 1, RIP, RPP 2 B and LSC 2) for normalization, when analysing differences in gene expression levels between C. albicans biofilm cells and planktonic cells. Validation of the normalization strategies described above showed that the ALS 1 gene is overexpressed and the ALS 3 gene is underexpressed in C. albicans biofilms grown on silicone in the CDC reactor for 24 hours. </p...|$|R

The research studied the attitudes and behaviour of high wage earners in three mass or <b>continous</b> <b>flow</b> companies. During 1961 - 1962, married, male workers from three Luton factories (Vauxhall, Skefco and Laporte) were firstly interviewed at work and then, again, {{at home with their}} wives. Additionally, a sample of middle-class white-collar workers from the same companies were interviewed only at home. This qualitative data collection comprises a digitised subset of the Luton study interviews, (see below for details of the full collection). For this subset, 30 married male Vauxhall workers' completed questionnaires were selected from boxes 01 and 02 from the full collection, as the handwriting on the original papers was legible, and follow-up home interviews were available as well as the initial workplace interview. The resulting data have been collated into tabular form, within an MS Access database. The tables replicate the structure and variables of the questionnaires used in the original study. Street, place and personal names were standardised by the original investigators, and care has been taken to retain original spellings. The subset database therefore contains a total of 60 interviews, each with 464 variables. This research formed part of a wider ESRC project Living Standards, social identities and the working class in England, c. 1945 -c. 1970.

40|$|The adverse {{environmental}} impact of trace metals {{is an issue of}} current concern. The increasing recognition that it is the chemical form of a metal which determines its toxicity and bioavailability presents a new challenge for analytical chemists. Techniques are required which are sufficiently sensitive and selective to enable the quantitation o f metal species at lower levels than ever before. The importance of trace metal speciation in environmental samples is reviewed in Chapter 1. The effects of inorganic complexation, organic complexation and oxidation state on metal uptake and toxicity to the biota are discussed. Special reference is made to two currently topical metals, cadmium and selenium. Cadmium is recognised as a particularly toxic metal with no beneficial effects on living organisms while selenium is a cumulative toxin which is essential at low levels. In both cases, however, toxicity is clearly dependent on the metal species present. The complexation of cadmium by Suwannee River fulvic acid is reported in Chapter 2. Metal complexation by aquatic humic materials has important consequences for metal transport and mobility in the environment. Due to the polyelectrolyte nature and heterogeneity of these naturally occuring organic ligands, characterisation of their metal binding ability is complex. The application of " 3 Cd NMR for this purpose is presented. The complexation of cadmium by the International Humics Substances Society fulvic acid standard is examined. The concept of selenium speciation is explored in Chapter 3. The analytical techniques currently used for selenium determination are reviewed and two novel techniques are presented. An extraction technique, termed matrix solid phase dispersion, is applied to selenium determination in milk and fish samples. A procedure is also described to enable the simultaneous determination of the two inorganic selenium species, selenite and selenate in aqueous samples. The uptake of copper by the filamentous fungus Rhizopus arrhizus is discussed in Chapter 4. Microbial biomass has the ability to sequester metal ions from aqueous solution by a variety of mechnisms.

The LES model cannot lead to spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking (SMSB) either in closed systems with a homogeneous temperature distribution nor in closed systems with a stationary non-uniform temperature distribution.
