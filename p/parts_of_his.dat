5|$|Barrhill flourished {{until about}} 1885, when {{population}} in the village itself peaked at 50, and two effects caused a population decline. Firstly, a recession set in across New Zealand that made people move to where work opportunities presented themselves, and locally those opportunities were created near the stations of the Methven Branch railway. Wason began to gradually sell off <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> land holdings from the mid-1880s.|$|E

5|$|Maedhros, {{the oldest}} son of Fëanor, was called Russandol (copper-top) by his brothers: He had earned this epessë {{because of his}} ruddy hair. His father-name had been Nelyafinwë (Finwë the third: Fëanor's own father-name had been (Curu) Finwë), and his mother-name Maitimo (well-shaped one).

5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E

5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house have survived. It was substantially different in plan {{from the older}} hall-style houses, which had the private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were well away from the building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was not quite a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E

She argues that Winfrey's choice of Night may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility.

His grand vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, later suggested this practice of dating hatt-ı hümayuns to Abdulhamid's successor Selim III {{so that he could}} follow up whether his orders were carried out.
