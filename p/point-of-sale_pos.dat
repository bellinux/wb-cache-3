The verification is performed using a credit card payment terminal or <b>point-of-sale</b> (<b>POS)</b> system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a magnetic stripe or chip on the card; the latter system is called Chip and PIN in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is implemented as an EMV card.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{proposes a}} model to analyze individual customer preferences using purchase records such as <b>Point-of-Sales</b> (<b>POS)</b> data. To some extent, we can identify the interests of customers from their demographics. Consumers are, however, essentially heterogeneous. It {{is difficult to determine}} individual customer behavior in detail through aggregate-level estimation. In this paper, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to construct a hierarchical model for tackling this problem. The model encompasses both “commonality ” and “heterogeneity. ” We apply this MCMC method to the music CD market, where customers have some commonalities although they are heterogeneous. This empirical analysis shows that a hierarchical Bayes (HB) model has a high predictive performance as compared to the naïve forecasting and aggregate-level models...|$|R
40|$|Store {{operations}} {{are often the}} weakest link of retail supply chains. Automated store ordering (ASO) could potentially solve {{many of the problems}} at store level. However, the majority of retailers have only just started to implement ASO systems. And although leading retailers have used automatically generated orders and order suggestions for years, there are very few companies that employ automated ordering for managing promotions. ASO could help to improve availability and reduce inventories also during promotions. In this paper, we suggest a model for effectively managing promotions with automated store ordering systems. The idea is to quickly react to promotion demand and automatically update the initial forecast that drives the ordering system. We have used simulation with real <b>point-of-sales</b> (<b>POS)</b> data from a North European retailer to test the model, and the results are very promising...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{advanced}} {{capabilities of the}} chip-enabled, debit and credit cards, fraud in payment transactions has not diminished- it has shifted. The reason lies in {{the lack of a}} trusted communication path between the smartcard and the cardholder. More explicitly, because users have no means of verifying the authenticity of the <b>Point-of-Sales</b> (<b>POS)</b> terminal, they do not know how much they are about to pay nor to whom. We propose to use the camera-enabled mobile phone and a previously shared secret to create a two-way, secure communication channel. Messages from the card are displayed by the POS terminal as visual codes, then captured and decoded by the phone. Messages from the cardholder are computed by the phone and manually typed in as one-time PINs. We extend the EMV payment protocol to provide explicit verification and confirmation of the transaction amount. In the process we also improve cardholder authentication, protect against stolen PIN and cards, and eliminate the POS terminal from the trust chain altogether. The implementation requires minimal software updates and no hardware modifications. ...|$|R

30|$|Another service {{related to}} risk {{assessment}} is fraud detection. The illegal {{use and abuse}} of borrowers’ information to get financial products is certainly different from the regular credit application scenario. By using heterogeneous data, an individual’s behaviors on different platforms can be jointly considered in fraud detection. Note {{that it is possible}} for individuals to behave differently in one/some dimensions of their life, such as in financial activities, but it is unlikely and difficult for a person to fake all aspects of his/her online life. So using multiple dimensions of data may lead to a more reliable assessment. For example, many financial institutions conduct credit risk assessment using <b>point-of-sales</b> (<b>POS)</b> terminal transactions, which infer revenue. Therefore, some dishonest enterprises make fake credit card transactions through POS to achieve a higher credit rating. However, if POS data and store owners’ personal online activities are combined, 100 Credit found that it was easier to identify fraud activities and reduce credit risk. 100 Credit’s fraud detection approach includes items such as blacklist checking, credit application analysis (on the pattern of making credit applications), and offline activity assessment (such as whether the device, location, etc. are changed frequently).|$|R
40|$|In {{the fashion}} retail industry, level of {{forecasting}} accuracy plays {{a crucial role}} in retailers' profit. In order to avoid stock-out and maintain a high inventory fill rate, fashion retailers require specific and accurate sales forecasting systems. One of the key factors of an effective forecasting system is the availability of long and comprehensive historical data. However, in the fashion retail industry, the sales data stored in the <b>point-of-sales</b> (<b>POS)</b> systems are always not comprehensive and scattered due to various reasons. This paper presents a new seasonal discrete grey forecasting model based on cycle truncation accumulation with amendable items to improve sales forecasting accuracy. The proposed forecasting model is to overcome two important problems: seasonality and limited data. Although there are several works suitable with one of them, there is no previous research effort that overcome both problems in the context of grey models. The proposed algorithms are validated using real POS data of three fashion retailers selling high-ended, medium and basic fashion items. It was found that the proposed model is practical for fashion retail sales forecasting with short historical data and outperforms other state-of-art forecasting techniques.

50|$|For example, a <b>point-of-sale</b> {{terminal}} (<b>POS</b> terminal, {{a computerized}} cash register) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, {{this list of}} grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a software program or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a calculator, this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total sales per customer or the average expenditure per {{day of the week}} by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times. Such information could then become data for further processing, for example as part of a predictive marketing campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a database, which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways.|$|R
