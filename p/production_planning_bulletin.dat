Based on {{credibility}} {{theory and}} two-stage fuzzy optimization method, {{this paper presents}} a type of multi-product multi-period (MPMP) <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> model. Since the proposed <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> problem includes fuzzy variable coefficients with an infinite support, it is infinite-dimensional optimization problem. The approximation of the <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> problem is discussed, and the convergence of the objective value (optimal value) of the original <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> problem to the objective value (optimal value) of the approximating <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> problem is also considered.

In order to meet these requirements, integrated system of production, sales and distribution is needed. Three critical success factors below are pointed out {{for the success of}} this system. (1) More elaborate sales planning Generally, sales is too roughly planned and it causes rough <b>production</b> <b>planning.</b> (2) Rapid making and remaking of <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> Changing of <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> takes much time and {{it is not easy to}} coordinate departments.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> in manufacturing, which can be loosely defined as the problem of finding a release plan for jobs that minimizes the total cost (or maximizes the total profit). <b>Production</b> <b>planning</b> is a challenging optimization problem due to the variability in manufacturing systems and uncertainty in future demand, {{both of which have}} not been adequately addressed by existing <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> models.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>production</b> <b>plan,</b> which {{describes}} how core assets {{are used to}} develop products, has {{an important role in}} product line engineering as a communication medium between core asset developers and product developers. Recently, there have been efforts to address issues related to production planning; however, most of them focus on the process and business/management aspects of <b>production</b> <b>planning,</b> and not much emphasis is given to technical issues such as deciding features that will be made as core assets and their granularity. In this paper, we introduce a feature-based approach to product line <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> and illustrate how our approach addresses these technical issues. In our approach, a feature model and feature binding information are used as primary input to <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> development. A product line <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> developed using our approach could be easily customized to a product-specific <b>production</b> <b>plan,</b> because it was developed with consideration of units of product configurations as well as their integration techniques. ...|$|R
