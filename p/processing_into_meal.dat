ABSTRACT Leather cassava is {{waste that}} still contain high {{nutrient}} {{and can be}} processed into flour. Skin contains HCN cassava which can be reduced by soaking, drying, boiling and fermentation. Lime water immersion can reduce sap or mucus, relieving distorted, making durable and prevent browning. The {{purpose of this study}} utilizing cassava peel in the manufacture of starch and know the content of protein, moisture content, as well as the organoleptic properties of the skin cassava flour. The treatment in this study was a long time soaking solution of CaCO 3 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours and the temperature of the oven 300 C, 400 C, 500 C with repetitions three times. Parameters measured include protein content, moisture content and organoleptic properties of the protein content of data analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis, while the water content and organoleptic test using a Two Way Anova. The results showed the highest protein content in the treatment of CaCO 3 2 hours soaking time and oven temperature of 300 C is 3. 03 grams. Highest water levels at treatment 3 hours soaking time and oven temperature of 300 C is 81. 30...|$|E

Each owner of the bakeries had a horse and bread cart delivering bread over the country. There was also a saw mill driven by a steam engine with the assistance of a windmill which also supplied power to a mill, for grinding Indian corn <b>into</b> <b>meal</b> and crushing oats, and for printing.
