40|$|Abstract. Spatially {{controlled}} electronic actions (e. g. opening gates, buying tickets, starting or stopping engines, etc.) require human attentiveness by con-ventional interaction metaphors via display and/or keystroke at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>event.</b> However, attentiveness for {{pressing a}} button or glimpsing at a display may occasionally be unavailable when the involved person {{must not be}} dis-tracted from performing a task or is handicapped through wearable limitations (e. g. gloves, protective clothing) or disability. To automatically trigger those ac-tions just at spatial proximity of a person, i. e. dismissing displays and keypads for launching the execution of electronic code in order to ease human computer interaction by innovative mobile computing paradigms is the main research focus of this paper...|$|E

40|$|In a {{computer}} simulation study of earthquakes a seismically active {{strike slip fault}} is represented by coupled mechanical blocks which are driven by a moving plate and which slide on a friction surface. Elastic forces and time independent friction are used to generate main shock events, while viscoelastic forces and time dependent friction add aftershock features. The study reveals that the size, length, and time and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> occurrence are strongly influenced by the magnitude and degree of homogeneity in the elastic, viscous, and friction parameters of the fault region. For example, periodically reoccurring similar events are observed in simulations with near-homogeneous parameters along the fault, whereas seismic gaps are a common feature of simulations employing large variations in the fault parameters. The study also reveals correlations between strain energy release and fault length and average displacement and between main shock and aftershock displacements...|$|E
40|$|Two {{computer}} simulation models of earthquakes were studied for {{the dependence of}} the pattern of events on the model assumptions and input parameters. Both models represent the seismically active region by mechanical blocks which are connected {{to one another and}} to a driving plate. The blocks slide on a friction surface. In the first model elastic forces were employed and time independent friction to simulate main shock events. The size, length, and time and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> occurrence were influenced strongly by the magnitude and degree of homogeniety in the elastic and friction parameters of the fault region. Periodically reoccurring similar events were frequently observed in simulations with near homogeneous parameters along the fault, whereas, seismic gaps were a common feature of simulations employing large variations in the fault parameters. The second model incorporated viscoelastic forces and time-dependent friction to account for aftershock sequences. The periods between aftershock events increased with time and the aftershock region was confined to that which moved in the main event...|$|E
40|$|Extracting the "correct" {{location}} information from text data, i. e., determining the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>event,</b> {{has long been}} a goal for automated text processing. To approximate human-like coding schema, we introduce a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies each location word to be either correct or incorrect. We use news articles collected from around the world (Integrated Crisis Early Warning System [ICEWS] data and Open Event Data Alliance [OEDA] data) to test our algorithm that consists of two stages. In the feature selection stage, we extract contextual information from texts, namely, the N-gram patterns for location words, the frequency of mention, and the context of the sentences containing location words. In the classification stage, we use three classifiers to estimate the model parameters in the training set and then to predict whether a location word in the test set news articles is the place of the event. The validation results show that our algorithm improves the accuracy rate of the current geolocation methods of dictionary approach by as much as 25 %...|$|E

40|$|Background: Head injury (HI) is {{preventable}} {{and knowledge}} of the epidemiology of children's HI is essential for developing preventive strategies. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} survey pediatric HI patients admitted to emergency wards at Poursina Hospital in Rasht, Iran, from 2009 to 2010, and to identify the cause of HI in these children. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, all HI patients under the age of 18 who were admitted to emergency wards between March 2009 and March 2010 were enrolled in the study. Demographic, etiologic, and injury data were collected and a descriptive analysis was performed. Results: A total of 668 patients were included in this study. The mean age was 10. 4 ± 5. 3 years. The most frequent cause of HI was traffic accidents. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 14. 5 ± 1. 6. The ratio of boys to girls was approximately 3 to 1. The ratio of boys to girls increased with increasing age (P < 0. 01). Moreover, an association was found between age at injury and etiology of HI as well as a significant association between age at injury and the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> (P < 0. 01).

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} view of {{transformation}} of character of live reports in television news and shows current nature of live reports {{in the sphere of}} Czech media. Live broadcasting is the heart of television and radio as electronic media. Despite the fact that live broadcasting started together with the beginning of television broadcasting, only television news managed to keep the nature of live broadcasting for the whole time of its existence. Live reporting is specific part of live broadcasting and belongs to phenomenons that have been changing in the course of time. These changes are caused by constant technological development and improvement of technical equipment. The breakthrough came with the transformation from analogue to digital broadcasting. Digitalization meant significant simplification of realization of live reports and natural result there was considerable growth of their numbers. However, together with growing quantity changed also their quality. Original intention - to ensure witness directly from the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> {{at the time of its}} performance, transformed to the effort to drag viewers into the event at the cost of everything. As a result there are live reports from the places that are not connected with the event at all. Besides legitimate live reports there are "live for the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Summary Objectives: to {{evaluate}} and indicate the procedure to be followed in the health unit, both for diagnosis and the treatment of acute exogenous intoxications by carbamates or organophosphates. Methods: a descriptive study based on retrospective analysis of the clinical history of patients diagnosed with intoxication by carbamates or organophosphates admitted at the emergency unit of the Hospital de Urgências de Sergipe Governador João Alves (HUSE) between January and December of 2012. Some criteria were evaluated, such as: intoxicating agent; patient's age and gender; <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>event,</b> cause, circumstances and severity of the intoxication; as well as {{signs and symptoms of}} the muscarinic, nicotinic and neurological effects. Results: seventy patients (average age: 25 ± 19. 97) formed the study's population. It was observed that 77. 14 % of them suffered carbamate intoxication. However, organophosphate intoxications were more severe, with 68. 75 % of patients presenting moderate to severe forms. Suicide attempt was the leading cause of poisoning, with 62 cases (88. 57 % of total). Atropine administration was an effective therapeutic approach for treating signs and symptoms, which included sialorrhea (p= 0. 0006), nausea (p= 0. 0029) and emesis (p lt 0. 0001). The use of activated charcoal was shown effective, both in combating the signs and symptoms presented by both patient groups (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: it is concluded that the use of atropine and activated charcoal is highly effective to treat the signs and symptoms developed by patients presenting acute exogenous intoxication by carbamates or organophosphates...|$|E
