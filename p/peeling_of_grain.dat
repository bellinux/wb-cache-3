After SPS and HSPS, the 30 mm and 60 mm alloys (except 60 mm-SPS) had a relative density (> 99. 2 %) {{close to the}} theoretical density. Phase, microstructure and mechanical properties evolution of W-Ni-Fe alloy during SPS and HSPS were studied. The microstructural evolution of the 60 mm alloys varied {{from the edge of}} the sample to the core of the sample. Results show that the grain size and the hardness vary considerable from the edge to the core of sintered sample of 60 mm sintered using conventional SPS compared to hybrid SPS. Similarly, the hardness also increased from the edge to the core. The 60 mm-HSPS alloy exhibit improved bending strength than the 60 mm-SPS, 1115 MPa and 920 MPa respectively, former being similar to the 30 mm-SPS and HSPS alloys. The intergranular fracture along the W/W grain boundary is the main fracture modes of W-Ni-Fe, however in the 60 mm-SPS alloy <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grains</b> was also observed which diminished the properties. The mechanical properties of SPS and HSPS 93 W- 4. 9 Ni- 2. 1 Fe heavy alloys are dependent on the microstructural parameters such as tungsten grain size and overall homogeneity...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide, West-Bengal {{is one of}} {{the areas}} most {{affected}} by elevated levels of arsenic in groundwater (50 - 3000 mu g/l). This groundwater does not only endanger humans owing to its use as drinking water. More and above that, irrigation of rice paddies consumes huge quantities of arsenic contaminated groundwater. Consequently, arsenic accumulates in soil and endangers the nutrition chain via arsenic uptake by plants. Rice {{is one of the}} staple foods in this region. Lately, there is a considerable intensification of research on the fate of arsenic in affected agricultural systems with most of them resorting to bulk analytical methods. However, so far, knowledge on the it-scale distribution of arsenic in soil and plants in such agricultural systems is rather limited. This case study combined mu-synchrotron studies on soil, rice root and rice grain from a rice paddy irrigated with groundwater containing about 519 mu g/L As. The investigation of a soil aggregate has shown that As is mainly associated with Fe and is not equally distributed over the whole aggregate but occurs in local enrichments of few tens mu m in size. In soil, As was mainly associated with Fe-(oxy) hydroxides. Rice root coatings consisted of a similar assemblage of arsenic bearing minerals. Furthermore the incorporation of soil matter in the coating could be shown. On mu m-scale, As concentrations in rice root coatings showed an inhomogeneous, patchy distribution (100 - 2400 mg/kg; median 500 mg/kg) and correlated with Fe Concentrations. Some small amounts of arsenic could also be detected in the interior of the root (3 - 60 mg/kg; median 21 mg/kg). In the rice grain, trace elements such as Zn and Cu were mainly enriched along the grain coating, while As in contrast showed the highest concentrations in the germ and some hot spots in the coating (up to 13 mg/kg). Thus, <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> rice <b>grain</b> would remove some, but not all of the arsenic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Organic farmers and producers {{have become more}} and more interested in marginal crops such as the tetraploid emmer wheat because of its suitability for organic farming. In spite of its historical role, present distribution of emmer is very limited. The work analyzes the problem of growing possibilities of emmer and its suitability for cultivation in organic farming. In the Czech Republic it is grown only a few farms, but in Austria is more popular now. Possible candidates for the cultivation of emmer has several options about where to obtain a suitable variety. The best option appears to be the choice of legally protected variety Rudico. Another option would be to obtain seed from abroad or multiplication of seed of its own genetic resources. Among important properties of emmer belongs e. g. considerably high resistance to some fungal diseases, which make it advantageous in organic system <b>of</b> growing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to define irrigation scheduling for coffee trees in the brazilian Cerrado region to optimize yield and coffee grain quality. The experimental treatments were: a) irrigation all over the year (RH 1), suplemental water application after blossoming induced by rain (RH 4), stop water application, at the harvesting time from June 15 to end of August until leaf water potential measured at pre-dawn reached - 2. 0 MPa (RH 3) and - 3, 4 MPa (RH 4) and rainfed crop. The soil water content was monitored by using a profile probe of 1 m. Water was applied to fill the soil profile of 0. 40 m until field capacity (- 0, 0008 MPa) as soil water depletion reached 50 % of available soil water. The results shows that stopping irrigation from June 15 to end of August, until leaf potential, measured at pre-drawn, reached value of - 2. 0 MPa resulted in just on uniform blossoming period, more than 80 % pf mature grain at harvesting time and yield of 4. 200 kg. ha(- 1) <b>of</b> <b>peeled</b> coffee <b>grain</b> in the last three comercial harvesting. 200...|$|R
