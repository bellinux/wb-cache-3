40|$|Smart cards {{have many}} {{applications}} such as health, ID verification and access control, electronic purse card, banking card, <b>payphone</b> <b>card,</b> passport card and license card. Since, there are many kinds of smart cards, {{it is difficult to}} carry and protect them. Losing one card means losing a lot of important information. As everyone knows, carrying and protecting one smart card is easier and more comfortable than carrying two or more smart cards. Multipurpose smart card is a smart card with manzy different applications in one smart card. Multipurpose smart card would be giving all services and making data processing and data transfer more efficient and secure. We choose three most important cards such as health card, aadhaar cards and passport cards to be combined in one smart card and find an encryption method to make it enough secure. It should also be efficient in transferring information. The advanced encryption standard algorithm should be effective encryption system for these three applications in a multipurpose smart card...|$|E

50|$|A BT Chargecard is a {{considerably}} cheaper way to call from any UK landline, including <b>Payphones.</b> Other <b>cards</b> {{which can be}} used are the Post Office phonecard, Tesco international calling card and many other telephone cards which can be bought from newsagents.|$|R
50|$|Electronic access card/Smart card - Smart card are credit card-sized plastic {{cards that}} house an {{embedded}} integrated circuit. They {{can be used}} in electronic commerce for providing personal security, stored value and mobility. At the functional level, smart cards can be categorised as either memory cards or microprocessor cards. Memory cards, such as disposable pre-paid <b>payphone</b> <b>cards</b> or loyalty card, are the most cheapest form of smart card. They contain a small amount of memory in the form of ROM (read only memory) and EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read only memory). Microprocessor cards are more advanced than simple memory cards in that they contain a microprocessor CPU (central processing unit) and RAM (random access memory) in addition to ROM and EEPROM. The ROM contains the card's operating system and factory-loaded applications.|$|R
50|$|A stored-value phonecard {{contains}} the balance {{available on the}} card. This balance can be read by a public payphone machine when the card is inserted into the <b>payphone's</b> <b>card</b> reader. This is superficially similar to a bank automated teller machine, but a stored-value card is more closely analogous to a change purse. While ATMs (as well as the remote memory systems discussed below) use the card merely to identify the associated account and record changes in a central database, stored-value systems make a physical alteration to the card to reflect the new balance after a call. Used primarily for payphones, stored-value systems avoid the time lag and expense of communication with a central database, {{which would have been}} prohibitive before the 1990s. There are several ways in which the value can be encoded on the card.|$|R
