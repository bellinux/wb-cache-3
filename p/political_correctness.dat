Alexandra Petri of The Washington Post called for {{the character}} to be judged on the quality of its stories, which have garnered positive reviews.|$|E
25|$|The Triggering: Has <b>Political</b> <b>Correctness</b> Gone Too Far? was {{an event}} {{hosted by the}} College Republicans Club of the University of Massachusetts Amherst on April 25, 2016, {{featuring}} former philosophy professor and host of The Factual Feminist YouTube series Christina Hoff Sommers, political commentator Steven Crowder and former Breitbart senior technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. The topic of discussion was the effect of <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> on free speech, and whether <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> culture has grown to be detrimental. Additional topics included social justice, feminism, trigger warnings, and microaggressions. Some students attending began protesting mid-event, accusing the panelists of hate speech and demanding that they leave campus.|$|E

25|$|In series 1 of the British {{alternative}} {{comedy series}} Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, Hitler (played by Paul Putner) appears in black & white newsreel-style footage making {{a speech in}} which he sarcastically derides <b>political</b> <b>correctness.</b>|$|E
25|$|He also {{coined the}} term Regressive left to denote {{the section of the}} western left which, for the sake of <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and respect for other cultures, excuses, overlooks and {{sometimes}} passively encourages illiberal and bigoted ideas emerging from minority communities.|$|E
25|$|William Burroughs {{said that}} the American {{revolution}} begins in books and music, and political operatives implement the changes after the fact. To this maybe we can add art. And Helnwein's art might {{have the capacity to}} instigate change by piercing the veil of <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> to recapture the primitive gesture inherent in art.".|$|E
25|$|Other criticisms {{include the}} publish or perish {{pressures}} creating trivial or junk research, a caste system treating those without tenure poorly, and indolence after having achieved tenure. The tenured faculty can resist necessary reforms by administrators who they generally outlast. The tenured faculty also usually can control appointments which contributes to <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and groupthink.|$|E
25|$|It's {{just too}} dreadful. While the book's {{storytelling}} virtues are enormous, you don't {{have to be}} a bluestocking of <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> to find some of this fantasy anti-Arab, or anti-Eastern, or anti-Ottoman. With all its stereotypes, mostly played for belly laughs, there are moments you'd like to stuff this story back into its closet.|$|E
25|$|Peter Jonathan Hitchens (born 28 October 1951) is an English {{journalist}} and author. He has published six books, including The Abolition of Britain, The Rage Against God, and The War We Never Fought. He {{is a frequent}} critic of <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> and describes himself as an Anglican Christian and Burkean conservative, {{as well as a}} social democrat.|$|E
25|$|Waters {{has also}} been cited many times by lower courts. At the appellate level, {{there have been several}} notable cases where it has {{factored}} into the analysis, sometimes helping to decide the case, and in others allowing judges to develop aspects of the holding in greater depth. Two cases concerned academic freedom and <b>political</b> <b>correctness.</b> Others involved same-sex marriage and satanic ritual abuse.|$|E
25|$|Some ethnonyms {{have been}} {{considered}} offensive, although not always by the group involved, but {{because they had been}} used by others or in the past in a derogatory sense and were therefore considered tainted, and requiring replacement for that reason. Examples are Gypsy, Negro, Vandal, Bushman, Philistinism. This change is not, however, a matter of anglicisation but of <b>political</b> <b>correctness.</b>|$|E

It is written by Tom Bailey and , with songs by Allan Stelmach, and it depicts Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu {{and their son}} Valentin {{in a piece of}} meta musical theatre that is also a comment upon celebrity culture and the role social media and <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> play in {{creating}} social pariahs.|$|E
25|$|The case {{received}} {{extensive coverage}} on blogs. One blog which supported the three students was Durham-in-Wonderland authored by Brooklyn College history professor KC Johnson. Johnson also co-authored {{a book on}} the case with journalist Stuart Taylor, entitled Until Proven Innocent: <b>Political</b> <b>Correctness</b> and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case. The players' lawyers stated that they used the blog as a resource throughout the case, and Seligmann made a point of thanking Johnson in his statement following the dismissal of charges.|$|E
25|$|David is {{a failed}} comedian and rocker who also fails {{to grasp the}} notion of <b>political</b> <b>correctness.</b> He tends to either {{make a fool of}} himself in front of the office crew or make it {{intensely}} uncomfortable. The one who seems to enjoy him the most is Sam Bisaillon, former army cadet who worships David. He shares his desk with Louis Tremblay, who is secretly in love with the shy receptionist Anne Viens. The problem is that Anne is engaged to Luc, a macho warehouse employee.|$|E
25|$|Rantel is a {{political}} conservative and is {{a supporter of the}} policies and presidency of Ronald Reagan. He is distinctively critical of what he perceives to be <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> very supportive of Israel, and irritated by antisemitism, outsourcing of tech support, excessive body weight, and certain statements of Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante and Madeleine Albright. Primarily in regard to differences with the Bush administration over illegal immigration issues, Rantel was noticeably at odds with specific policies of George W. Bush and Republican members of Congress.|$|E
25|$|The Last Eagle Scout (2012) US; In the not-so-distant future, {{society has}} allowed <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> {{to go beyond}} the point of the absurd. For years the Boy Scouts have been under the {{government}} microscope and finally have been mandated to close their doors for good. Boy Scout, Cliff Elliot, stirs the pot as he tries to cling to the last shreds of patriotism and earn his Eagle Scout Award. In this 'dramedy', watch as Cliff jumps through ridiculous hoops, avoids the bumbling antics of government cronies, and tries to escape murderous plots against him, as he sets out to accomplish what he sees as the ultimate honor—becoming the Last Eagle Scout.|$|E
25|$|Nawaz notes how all {{transnational}} {{social movements}} of today, whether European Neo-fascism or Islamism, are extremist in nature, and democracy aspirants {{all over the}} world are left behind. He criticises the idea of <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> and the hesitation of democrats in asserting the universality of democratic norms. He also points to the political failure of many states in the Muslim world as a contributing factor. According to Nawaz, there is absence of democratic choice in many Muslim-majority countries, which means that their democratic parties often find themselves competing with non-democratic parties, including theocratic and military-backed ones. The political failure of democratic parties is taken as a failure of democracy itself in the Muslim world.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of {{measures}} passed in 1947-48, the state took over the 2,300 elementary schools and 24 high schools operated by the Orthodox Church. A new campaign struck the church in 1958-62 when {{more than half of}} its remaining monasteries were closed, more than 2,000 monks were forced to take secular jobs, and about 1,500 clergy and lay activists were arrested (out of a total of up to 6,000 in the 1946-64 period). Throughout this period Patriarch Justinian took great care that his public statements met the regime's standards of <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and to avoid giving offence to the government; indeed the hierarchy at the time claimed that the arrests of clergy members were not due to religious persecution.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{movements}} are opposed {{by a variety}} of individuals and organizations. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermine the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother. Some opponents of gay rights say that such rights may conflict with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations in accordance with one's religious views, and that the acceptance of homosexual relationships by religious organizations might be forced through threatening to remove the tax-exempt status of churches whose views do not align with those of the government. Some critics charge that <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> has led to the association of sex between males and HIV being downplayed.|$|E
25|$|Rafał A. Ziemkiewicz. In the 1990s {{he was one}} of {{the most}} popular Polish science fiction authors. For his novels Pieprzony los kataryniarza (1995) and Walc stulecia (1998), as well as his short story Śpiąca królewna (1996) he was awarded the prestigious Zajdel Award. A popular theme in his works is the fate of Poland and more broadly, Europe, in the near future (from several to several dozen years). His books often paint the future in dark colours, showing the Commonwealth of Independent States {{disintegrate}} into a civil war, European Union becoming powerless in the face of Islamic terrorism, and predatory capitalism and <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> taken ad absurdum leading to the erosion of morality and ethics. Thus his books are often classified as political fiction and social science fiction, although they stop short of being seen as dystopian fiction.|$|E
25|$|The {{modern day}} ROC {{military}} is styled after western military systems, mostly the US military. Internally, {{it has a}} political warfare branch/department that tightly controls and monitors each level of the ROC military, and reports directly to the General Headquarters of the ROC military, and if necessary, directly to the President of the ROC. This is a carryover from the pre-1949 era, when KMT and its army were penetrated by Communist agents repeatedly and led to frontline units defecting to Communist China. To strengthen their control over the military and prevent massive defection after retreating to Taiwan in 1949, CKS and CCK employed tight control over the military, by installing political officers and commissioners down to the company level, {{in order to ensure}} <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> in the military and loyalty toward ROC leadership. This gave the political officers/commissars a great deal of power, allowing them to overrule the unit commander and take over the unit. Only in recent years has the political warfare department (due to cutbacks) reduced its power within the ROC military.|$|E
25|$|Sales of The Yellow Tape were jump-started {{when the}} band {{was taken off the}} bill for the 1991 New Year's Eve concert in Nathan Phillips Square outside Toronto City Hall because a staffer for then-mayor June Rowlands saw the band's name and felt it {{objectified}} women; the decision was further affirmed by city councillor Chris Korwin-Kuczynski. The band shrugged it off and booked another show at McMaster University. However, the media got wind of the story and decided to write about it as an example of <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> gone too far. The first article earned the paper a large quantity of mail against City Hall's decision. The story became more and more prominent until about a week after New Years, when {{the band was}} asked to take a photo in front of City Hall for {{the front page of the}} Toronto Star. The stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved in the decision to remove the band from the concert, but in fact had been out of town at the time. The following week, sales of the Yellow Tape exploded — by February 1992, it was outselling even Michael Jackson's Dangerous, Genesis' We Can't Dance and U2's Achtung Baby in some downtown Toronto record stores. They received enough publicity from the incident that MuchMusic offered them its second-ever Intimate and Interactive special on January 17. The tape eventually became the first ever indie release to achieve platinum status (100,000 copies) in Canada.|$|E
500|$|However, Jenner also {{received}} criticism. Beginning in September 2015, she was depicted on the satirical American animated program South Park, which parodied her supporters' <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> {{as well as}} her driving record. The Jenner-related episodes were [...] "Stunning and Brave", [...] "Where My Country Gone?", [...] "Sponsored Content", [...] "Truth and Advertising" [...] and [...] "PC Principal Final Justice" [...] from the show's 19th season.|$|E
500|$|Chow Yun-fat's {{character}} stirred a {{great deal}} of controversy with the Chinese press. Perry Lam, of Hong Kong cultural magazine, Muse, found an offensive resemblance between Chow's character and Fu Manchu: [...] "Now Fu Manchu has returned after an absence of 27 years in the Hollywood cinema; except that, in a nod to <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and marketing realities, he is no longer called Fu Manchu." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Whacking Day" [...] finished tied for 25th {{in the weekly}} ratings for the week of April 26 – May 2, 1993 with a Nielsen rating of 12.2. It was the highest rated show from the Fox Network that week. For [...] "consciousness-raising on behalf of animal issues", the episode was awarded the Genesis Award for [...] "Best Television Prime Time Animated Series" [...] in 1994. Jeffrey Lee Puckett of The Courier-Journal cited [...] "Whacking Day" [...] as [...] "the series' richest episode". He wrote: [...] "In 22 remarkable minutes, 'Whacking Day' skewers the quality of America's educational system, self-aggrandizing politicians, greed, the mob mentality, sexuality {{in the age of}} <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and the whole notion of <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> and makes a hero of Barry White." [...] Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News noted the episode was one of the fourth season's best episodes in his review of the DVD. The show's creator Matt Groening considers Homer's [...] "I am evil Homer" [...] fantasy {{to be one of the}} greatest moments in the show's history. Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named Barry White his fifth favorite musical guest on The Simpsons out of a list of ten.|$|E
500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{was criticized for}} largely reporting the prosecutors' version {{of events in the}} 2006 Duke lacrosse case. Suzanne Smalley of Newsweek criticized the newspaper for its [...] "credulous" [...] coverage of the charges of rape against Duke University lacrosse players. Stuart Taylor, Jr. and KC Johnson, in their book Until Proven Innocent: <b>Political</b> <b>Correctness</b> and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case, write: [...] "at the head of the guilt-presuming pack, The New York Times vied in a race to the journalistic bottom with trash-TV talk shows." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{principal}} lines of controversy surrounding the cartoons concerned the limits of free speech, how much it should be legally or ethically constrained and whether the cartoons were an appropriate expression for a newspaper to print. The cartoons were first printed {{in response to the}} perception of some journalists at the newspaper that self-censorship was becoming a problem; the ensuing reaction did nothing to dispel that idea. Rose said: [...] Rose also highlighted what he believed to be a difference between <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and self-censorshipwhich he considered more dangerous. He said: ...|$|E
500|$|Author Michael Bronski {{highlights}} the [...] "attack on pre-Stonewall culture", particularly gay pulp fiction for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, {{which he describes}} as [...] "an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men", have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> Bronski writes, [...] "gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined {{to a large degree}} by rejection of the past." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by the series' co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The Mr. Hankey character was based on an idea from Parker's childhood; when Parker and Stone conceived the South Park series, they wanted to make Mr. Hankey the lead character. Heavily influenced by the Peanuts Christmas special A Charlie Brown Christmas from 1965, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] was the first Christmas-themed South Park episode, the first musical episode, and the only episode in season one (and therefore {{the first time in the}} series) in which Kenny does not die. It was a satire of <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and religious sensitivity.|$|E
500|$|... "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] is a satire on <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> and {{religious}} sensitivity, particularly in its {{portrayal of the}} characters organizing [...] "The Happy, Non-Offensive, Non-Denominational Christmas Play" [...] to avoid offending anyone of any religious backgrounds. While many Christmas specials focus on the religious, spiritual and moral values of the Christmas holiday rather than the commercial aspects, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] actually embraces commercialism in Christmas, suggesting viewers should enjoy those elements of the holiday without taking religion too seriously. York University Professor Alison Halsall said of {{this aspect of the}} episode, [...] "Again, Parker and Stone blur the sacred and the profane, in this instance, to gut holidays of their traditional meanings." ...|$|E
500|$|Dinklage later {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD film Tiptoes (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface. And I have my own opinions about <b>political</b> <b>correctness,</b> but I was just like, It's Gary Oldman. He can do whatever he wants, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E
500|$|At the premiere, John Williams {{conducted}} a live {{performance of the}} score. The new release grossed $68 million in total, with $35 million coming from Canada and the United States. The changes to it, particularly the escape scene, were criticized as <b>political</b> <b>correctness.</b> Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wondered, [...] "Remember those guns the feds carried? Thanks to the miracle of digital, they're now brandishing walkie-talkies.... Is this what two decades have done to free speech?" [...] Chris Hewitt of Empire wrote, [...] "The changes are surprisingly low-key...while ILM's CGI E.T. is used sparingly as a complement to Carlo Rambaldi's extraordinary puppet." [...] South Park ridiculed many {{of the changes in}} the 2002 episode [...] "Free Hat".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, scholar Stephen Groening {{argued that}} the show {{appeared}} {{as part of a}} reaction to the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States, in which issues such as Murphy Brown's motherhood, Tinky Winky's sexuality, and The Simpsons family values were extensively debated. The culture wars, and <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> in particular, were driven by the belief that relativism was becoming more relevant to daily life. Groening explained that South Park [...] "made a name for itself as rude, crude, vulgar, offensive, and potentially dangerous". Its critics {{argued that the}} Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny were poor role models for children while its supporters celebrated the show's defense of free speech.|$|E
500|$|While {{the term}} [...] "Jew's meat" [...] was a deprecatory term {{used for all}} fungi in the Middle Ages, the term is {{unrelated}} to the name [...] "Jew's ear". A further change of name to [...] "jelly ear" [...] was recommended in the List of Recommended Names for Fungi. The idea was rejected by mycologist Patrick Harding who considered it [...] "to {{be the result of}} <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> where it is not necessary", and who [...] "will continue to call [...] Jew's ear", explaining that, while anti-Semitism was commonplace in Britain, the name [...] "Jew's ear" [...] is in reference to Judas, who was a Jew. However, the name has been adopted in some recent field guides.|$|E
500|$|... "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep" [...] is an English nursery rhyme, the {{earliest}} surviving version of which dates from 1731. The words {{have not changed}} very much in {{two and a half}} centuries. It is sung to a variant of the 1761 French melody Ah! vous dirai-je, maman. Uncorroborated theories have been advanced to explain the meaning of the rhyme. These include that it is a complaint against Medieval English taxes on wool and that it is about the slave trade. In the twentieth century it was a subject of controversies in debates about <b>political</b> <b>correctness.</b> It has been used in literature and popular culture as a metaphor and allusion. The Roud Folk Song Index classifies the lyrics and their variations as number 4439.|$|E
500|$|Mark Malloch Brown, {{the former}} {{secretary}} general of the United Nations Development Program attributes the inefficiency of the UN administration to the [...] "disconnect between the merit and reward" [...] and further advocates [...] "reconnecting merit to make the UN again an international meritocracy" [...] to overcome the problem. He believes that the UN must stop promoting on the basis of <b>political</b> <b>correctness</b> that encourages promoting staffs proportionately from certain regions of the world, but instead make more use of Asia, Africa and other so-called less developed regions that now offer a large pool of talented, skilled, and highly motivated professionals. He argues that these individuals who are highly qualified will readily move up through the UN system without need of the [...] "cultural relativism which is used to promote incompetents." ...|$|E
