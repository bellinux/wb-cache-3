5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two <b>powered</b> <b>axles</b> and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E
25|$|All <b>powered</b> <b>axles</b> have clasp brakes {{operating}} on the wheel tread.|$|E
25|$|Superficially {{similar to}} the Mason Bogie is another design, the Forney locomotive. Like the Mason Bogie, the Forney has <b>powered</b> <b>axles</b> under the boiler and a {{trailing}} truck under the rear bunker and tank behind the cab. However, the Forney's driving wheels are fixed in the frame, rather than articulated. They were reasonably popular on American narrow gauge railroads.|$|E
2500|$|... "A1A-2" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks. The [...] "A1A" [...] truck is under {{the front of the}} unit, and has one <b>powered</b> <b>axle,</b> one idler axle, and one more <b>powered</b> <b>axle.</b> The [...] "2" [...] truck is under the back of the unit, and has two idler axles in a row. An example is the Silver Charger power car for the General Pershing Zephyr.|$|R

The [...] "A1A" [...] truck is under {{the front of the}} unit, and has one <b>powered</b> <b>axle,</b> one idler axle, and one more <b>powered</b> <b>axle.</b> The [...] "3" [...] truck is under the back of the unit, and has three idler axles in a row. An example is the Baldwin DR-6-2-10 [...] cab unit, only one of which was built for the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1948.|$|R
25|$|With an {{axle load}} of , the AA {{had reached the}} design limits of size and power {{possible}} with a two coupled axle locomotive type with Victoria's relatively light track infrastructure. Its high tractive effort and limited adhesive weight (due to axle load constraints and only two <b>powered</b> <b>axles)</b> combined to produce a less than ideal factor of adhesion of 3.5. Future VR locomotive designs were based on three or four coupled axles.|$|E
25|$|Trucks with dual {{tires on}} the rear axle and two driven axles are {{designated}} as 4×4s despite having six wheels because the paired rear wheels behave as a single wheel for traction and classification purposes. True 6×6 vehicles which have three <b>powered</b> <b>axles,</b> and are classified as 6×6s regardless of how many wheels they have. Examples of these with two rear, one front axle are the 6-wheeled Pinzgauer, which is popular with defense forces around the globe, and 10-wheeled GMC CCKW made famous by the U.S. Army in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Bombardier TRAXX is a {{modular product}} {{platform}} of electric and Diesel-electric mainline locomotives built by Bombardier Transportation, built in both {{freight and passenger}} variants. The first version was a dual voltage AC locomotive built from 2000 for German railways; later versions include DC versions, as well as quadruple voltage machines, able to operate on most European electrification schemes: 1.5/3.0 kV DC and 15/25 kV AC. The family was expanded to include diesel powered versions in 2006. Elements common to all variants include the steel bodyshells, the two bogies with two <b>powered</b> <b>axles</b> each, the three-phase asynchronous induction motors, the cooling exhausts on the roof edges, and the wheel disc brakes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, West German federal railway Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) sought to replace its ageing {{electric}} locomotive fleet {{with a single}} type. In the previous decade, DB introduced its first universal locomotives with three-phase asynchronous induction motors and two bogies with two <b>powered</b> <b>axles</b> each, the DB Class 120, which had been successful. In 1991, DB requested bids for about 1000 more universal locomotives with an improved design and increased power, the planned DB Class 121. The railway industry began developing new locomotives, but in October 1992, DB cancelled the tender due to {{the high price of}} the offers and the changed situation. In 1994, Deutsche Bundesbahn merged with the former East German Deutsche Reichsbahn, creating Deutsche Bahn, bringing over 600 modern DR Class 243 locomotives into the joint locomotive fleet. In addition, the merger coincided with a railway reform, dividing the rolling stock of Deutsche Bahn between its regional passenger, long-distance passenger and freight business areas, making the universal locomotive plans obsolete. From late 1993, the business areas of Deutsche Bahn and their predecessors called new bids for electric locomotives tailored for their specific needs.|$|E
500|$|The frames, {{running gear}} and riveted {{body for the}} {{prototype}} GG1 were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. The partially built locomotive was then shipped to the General Electric factory in Erie, Pennsylvania for the installation of its electrical components. Twelve traction motors, two {{on each of the}} GG1's six <b>powered</b> <b>axles,</b> produced [...] that was transmitted to the [...] driving wheels by a quill drive. Unlike other GG1s, access steps were installed {{at each end of the}} locomotive to ease maintenance of the pantographs; the pantographs were mechanically linked to a safety plate that blocked access to the steps when the pantographs were raised. The finished locomotive was [...] long and [...] tall, with both of its pantographs lowered.|$|E
2500|$|The AAR system counts axles {{instead of}} wheels. Letters refer to <b>powered</b> <b>axles,</b> and numbers to {{unpowered}} (or idler) axles. [...] "A" [...] refers to one powered axle, [...] "B" [...] to two <b>powered</b> <b>axles</b> in a row, [...] "C" [...] to three <b>powered</b> <b>axles</b> in a row, and [...] "D" [...] to four <b>powered</b> <b>axles</b> in a row. [...] "1" [...] refers to one idler axle, and [...] "2" [...] to two idler axles in a row. A dash ("") separates trucks, or wheel assemblies. A plus sign ("+") refers to articulation.|$|E
50|$|In late 2013, Metro {{awarded a}} 60-month fixed price {{contract}} to ORX to overhaul the <b>powered</b> <b>axle</b> assemblies for the then twenty-three year old P865/P2020's.|$|R
5000|$|... "A1A-A1A" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks under the unit. Each truck has one <b>powered</b> <b>axle,</b> one idler axle, and one more <b>powered</b> <b>axle.</b> This spreads {{the weight of the}} {{locomotive}} more evenly spread over the track and counteracts the tendency of trucks to oscillate at high speeds, which is a problem with two axle trucks. Examples include the EMD E-units and ALCO PAs, which were high speed passenger locomotives, and the dual service FM Erie-built. BNSF is scheduled to take delivery of ES44C4 locomotives with this type of truck in 2009.|$|R

50|$|All {{of these}} railcars {{had a single}} <b>powered</b> <b>axle</b> (1A-A1 wheel arrangement). Those built in 1930 used a 12V generator, but all {{subsequent}} ones used 24V, after Sentetsu opted to standardise with the L3-type 24V, 900W axle-mounted generator.|$|R
5000|$|... "1A-A1" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks (or wheel assemblies) under the unit. Each truck has one <b>powered</b> <b>axle</b> and one idler axle, with the idler axles to the outside. Examples include Budd RDC Diesel MU (DMU) cars.|$|R
2500|$|... "1B+D+D+B1" [...] {{means there}} are four sets of {{articulated}} axles under the unit. At each end there is one unpowered axle and two <b>powered</b> <b>axles,</b> hinged {{to a set of}} four <b>powered</b> <b>axles.</b> Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The [...] "Bi-Polar" [...] electric locomotives used by the Milwaukee Road used this arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|... "B-D+D-B" [...] {{means there}} are two sets of {{articulated}} axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two <b>powered</b> <b>axles,</b> and inboard of it are four <b>powered</b> <b>axles.</b> Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The W-1 class of electric locomotives built by General Electric for the Great Northern Railway used this arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|... "2-B+B+B+B-2" [...] {{means there}} are two sets of {{articulated}} axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are two <b>powered</b> <b>axles,</b> hinged to yet another set of two <b>powered</b> <b>axles.</b> Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. Examples include the Milwaukee Road EF-1 [...] "Boxcab" [...] electrics.|$|E

50|$|A {{transfer}} {{case is a}} part of the drivetrain of four-wheel-drive, all-wheel-drive, and other multiple <b>powered</b> <b>axle</b> vehicles. The {{transfer case}} transfers power from the transmission to the front and rear axles by means of drive shafts. It also synchronizes the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels, and may contain one or more sets of low range gears for off-road use.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Thumb was {{designed}} by Peter Cooper as a four-wheel locomotive with a vertical boiler and vertically mounted cylinders that drove the wheels {{on one of the}} axles. The [...] "design" [...] was characterized by a host of improvisations. The boiler tubes were made from rifle barrels and a blower was mounted in the stack, driven by a belt to the <b>powered</b> <b>axle.</b> [...] The engine was fueled by anthracite coal.|$|R

50|$|In 1955 the Swedish company {{tractor trailer}} {{manufacturer}} Lihnells Vagn AB (Livab) started {{to develop a}} specialized dump vehicle in cooperation with Volvo's tractor subsidiary Volvo BM (the future Volvo CE). This was essentially a trailer with a <b>powered</b> <b>axle</b> mated to an agricultural tractor and utilizing its power take-off shaft to drive the trailer's axle. These were not articulated haulers in the modern sense, as the tractor retained its front axle to provide steering.|$|R
