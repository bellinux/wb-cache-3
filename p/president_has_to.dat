Regardless if the declaration affects the entire country or sections of it, the Council of the Republic must be notified by the President and must seek their approval within three days of notification. The same rules applies if the President issues a state of martial law {{in the event of a}} possible military action against Belarus.

All of those decisions that the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{arguments}} that the President does not possess soft power stem from a strict interpretation of the Constitution and what are regarded as the traditional roles of the President. First, unless the Constitution states otherwise, the default position is that when exercising his functions the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> act according to {{the advice of the}} Cabinet. In the context of the Constitution, the word advice does not carry its typical meaning of mere opinion or suggestion. The President is obliged to follow the Cabinet's advice. Thus, the President does not have any liberty to exercise soft power. Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} since the President is elected to exercise the powers defined in the Constitution, the concept of [...] "political legitimacy" [...] posited by proponents would appear to be undermined by soft power, which has an unspecified and ambiguous scope.|$|E
