Fifty two (52) drivers were sampled and interviewed from 13 routes situated along four major corridors in the City of Nairobi. About two-thirds (61. 5 %) of the drivers reported having lowly complied with traffic regulations. The PSV industry was dominated by SACCOS/company-sole proprietor type of organization and operations characterized by setting of target amount of money to be given to the operator each day and casual employment with daily wage and no other benefits.

BACKGROUND In Kenya, the number of Public Service <b>Vehicles</b> (<b>PSVs)</b> increased rapidly from about 400 in the early 1960 s to an estimated 2, 000 in 1982 (Kapila, Manundu and Lamba, 1982) to abou...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{several cases}} have drawn our {{attention}} to problems associated with professional driving and mental disorder. All drivers are responsible for informing the licensing authority of any disability likely to cause them to drive hazardously. Medica! Aspects of FiÂ¡nessto Drive (Raffle (ed.), 1985) gives detailed guidelines to help doctors advise their patients. Those relating to ordinary licence holders appear intuitively correct and most psychiatrists would give similar advice without reading them. However, the guidelines for vocational drivers, especially holders of Public Service <b>Vehicle</b> (<b>PSV)</b> and Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) licenses, are more stringent because of the serious consequences when accidents occur.

50|$|The {{development}} of durable laminates for interior panel finish such as Wareite and Formica was another feature that Harrington started to pioneer. A belated {{change to the}} UK government construction and use rules in 1957 allowed fixed, rather than opening, driver's windscreens on public service <b>vehicle</b> (<b>PSV)</b> bodies. This, together with advances in toughened glass manufacture, at last {{made it possible to}} have a coach windscreen with a three-dimensional curvature. Early examples of this by Duple, Plaxton and (particularly) Burlingham on the Bedford, Commer and Ford Thames lightweight coaches from 1958 were apt to be 'over the top' echoing similar goldfish-bowl windscreens on large saloon cars by the US-owned carmakers such as the Vauxhall Cresta PA. Harrington did not slavishly adopt, it considered, the next design from Old Shoreham Road retained flat-glazed (optionally-opening) windscreens.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{sensitivity}} {{in the operation}} of conventional and alternatively fuelled Public Service <b>Vehicles</b> (<b>PSVs)</b> in operation across Merseyside. Each fuel is compared on a life cycle assessment (LCA) basis, with the addition of landfill gas (LFG) as a viable alternative. On a complete life cycle basis, LFG powered vehicles compare favourably with gas-powered vehicles and generally cause less pollution than the liquid-fuel powered vehicles, with electric vehicles generally producing the least pollution overall. In the majority of cases, the sensitivity analysis has revealed that the most significant stage in the life cycles of each fuel and vehicle is the end-use (fuel combustion) stage. In some cases this stage alone contributes to 90 % of the total life cycle emissions. Daily and annual changes in vehicle operation have a large influence on the amount of pollution released into the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Flexible-wheel (FW) {{suspension}} {{concept has}} been regarded {{to be one}} of the novel technologies for future planetary surface <b>vehicles</b> (<b>PSVs).</b> This study develops generalised models for fundamental stiffness and damping properties and power consumption characteristics of the FW suspension with and without considering wheel-hub dimensions. Compliance rolling resistance (CRR) coefficient is also defined and derived for the FW suspension. Based on the generalised models and two dimensionless measures, suspension properties are analysed for two FW suspension configurations. The sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effects of the design parameters and operating conditions on the CRR and power consumption characteristic of the FW suspension. The modelling generalisation permits analyses of fundamental properties and power consumption characteristics of different FW suspension designs in a uniform and very convenient manner, which would serve as a theoretical foundation for the design of FW suspensions for future PSVs...|$|R

50|$|Motor Tax (Irish: Cáin Mhótair) is {{an annual}} duty payable on motor {{vehicles}} (subject to exemptions) in Ireland {{for use in}} public places. A new system for new private cars was introduced on 1 July 2008 where the tax rates {{are based on the}} carbon dioxide emissions of the car while in operation. Prior to this, tax rates are assessed on engine displacement - this includes used imports first registered in their original country of sale before July 2008. Motorcycles are all taxed the same regardless of engine displacement, with a special rate for electrically powered cycles. For goods vehicles, commercial <b>vehicles</b> and <b>PSVs</b> it is based on weight or is a standardised fee. For taxation of cars with Wankel engines under the old size-based system, the actual engine displacement is multiplied by 1.5 so for example a Mazda RX-8 with a 1.3 litre rotary engine is taxed as a 1.8 litre car.|$|R
40|$|Occupant Restraint Systems (ORS) {{have been}} widely used in Public Service <b>Vehicles</b> (<b>PSVs).</b> A Wheelchair Tiedown and Occupant Restraint System (WTORS) has been {{developed}} to provide effective occupant protection for disabled people who are seated in wheelchairs. An international laboratory study had been conducted to produce a compliance test protocol that included specification of the sled deceleration versus time history and the crash pulse corridor. Currently effort at the international level is being focused through the International Standards Organisation (ISO) to produce standards for WTORS and transportable wheelchairs. Dynamic sled testing of WTORS was conducted in Middlesex University Road Safety Engineering Laboratory (MURSEL) to develop a test protocol in a WTORS System. This research has been concerned with the effects to which the occupant of a wheelchair secured by a WTORS is subjected in a frontal impact. Both occupant Forward Facing Frontal (FFF) and Rearward Facing Frontal (RFF) impact configurations have been considered. A Surrogate wheelchair with a tiedown restraint System, a Surrogate occupant restraint System, and an Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD) were used to facilitate highly controlled tests. Production wheelchairs were also crash tested to validate the response of the Surrogate System. A 48 km/h- 20 g crash pulse falling within the ISO standard crash pulse corridor was specified. The Crash Victim Simulation (CVS), one of the computer modelling methods, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models were designed to study the dynamic response of a restrained wheelchair and its occupant in a crash environment. Two CVS computer packages: MADYMO®, DYNAMAN® and one of FEA programs: PAFEC were used in WTORS models to predict the occupant response during impacts and hence provide data to optimise future system design. A modelling protocol for WTORS was developed {{based on the results of}} ninety (90) sled tests of WTORS Surrogate system and forty (40) dynamic tests of production wheelchairs. To illustrate the potential of these models the results of simulations were validated by sled tests. A random effects Statistical method was used to quantify the results. The load-time histories were also traced to qualify the test and model results. A literature review highlighted twenty years of wheelchair crash research. The correlation between computer model and experimental results was made more accurately. The modelling technique of interconnection of FEA models into CVS program was also introduced. The velocity profile and the natural frequency of WTORS analysis were used to explain why the wheelchair and dummy experienced acceleration amplifications relative to the sled. The shoulder belt load at floor-mounted configuration was found to be higher than that at B pillar configuration. Energy principles were also applied to show why more compliant wheelchair tiedown Systems subjected restraints to a less severe crash environment. A decomposition of forces using the computer model showed why quasi-static analysis is insufficient in WTORS design. It is concluded that the B pillar anchorage of the occupant diagonal strap is superior to the floor-mounted configuration...|$|R
