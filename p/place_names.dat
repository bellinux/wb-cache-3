5|$|Numerous <b>place</b> <b>names</b> in Scandinavia {{contain the}} Old Norse name Þórr.

The place name Þórslundr is recorded with particular frequency in Denmark (and has direct cognates in Norse settlements in Ireland, such as Coill Tomair), whereas Þórshof appears particularly often in southern Norway.
