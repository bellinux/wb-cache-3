40|$|Phylloxere notabilis Pergande, 1903, {{commonly}} known as the <b>pecan</b> <b>leaf</b> phylloxera, is a pest in the pecan-growing areas of the Southern and Eastern United States and Eastern Europe. Of the four species of Phylloxera known to occur on pecan, P. notebilis is the only species which has more than one generation of galls per year...|$|R
40|$|Host-Associated Differentiation (HAD) is the {{formation}} of genetically divergent hostassociated lineages maintained by ecological isolation. HAD is potentially an important route to ecological speciation in parasites including many insects. While HAD case studies are accumulating, there is a dearth of negative results in the literature {{making it difficult to}} know how common the phenomenon really is or whether there are specific traits of parasites which promote HAD. To address these two problems, studies are needed which both publish negative results (i. e., parasites not showing HAD) and test for HAD in multiple parasite species on the same pair of host species (i. e., control for host plant effects). In this study, HAD was tested in three species of herbivorous insects and one parasitoid species on the same two host tree species: pecan and water hickory. The insects were selected based on {{the presence or absence of}} two traits, parthenogenesis and endophagy. A test for HAD was considered ?positive? when population substructure was explained by host-association. To test for the presence of HAD, insects were sampled sympatrically to eliminate geographical isolation as a confounding factor, sampling was replicated spatially to assure that HAD persisted, and multiple loci were sampled from each individual. Genetic data was analyzed using cluster analyses. HAD was found in both <b>pecan</b> <b>leaf</b> phylloxera and yellow pecan aphid but not in pecan bud moth or in the parasitoid of the yellow pecan aphid, Aphelinus perpallidus. Interestingly, both taxa showing HAD are parthenogenetic and both taxa not showing HAD reproduce sexually. Species showing HAD were tested for the presence of a pre-mating reproductive isolating mechanism (RIM) which could be maintaining HAD despite the potential for gene flow. Selection against migrants to the alternative host was tested in yellow pecan aphid using a no-choice fitness experiment. The overall contribution of this RIM to total isolation was positive and ranged from 0. 614 to 0. 850. The RIM of ?habitat preference? was tested in <b>pecan</b> <b>leaf</b> phylloxera using a dual-choice preference experiment. In this species, preference was only detected for phylloxera originating from water hickory suggesting that host discrimination ability may be a less important factor promoting differentiation in phylloxera...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} leaf tissue {{sampling}} {{program is}} particularly appropriate for pecans, a long-lived perennial tree crop. Such programs are widely used in pecan production in the desert southwest. However, {{most of the research}} upon which leaf nutrient standards are based has been conducted in the southeastern U. S. We have conducted field studies to develop standards specifically for southwestern production. We have been conducting a two-year survey of commercially grown pecans in Arizona, collecting leaf nutrient levels and nut yield and quality data. Preliminary leaf nutrient standards based on the first year of that study are presented. We also conducted a two-year study of several varieties of pecans in Arizona and New Mexico for the purpose of determining rates of change of nutrient concentrations during the growing season. These data have been used to develop equations for normalizing early season leaf analyses to the standard late summer sampling period. OBJECTIVES Leaf tissue composition {{is a reflection of the}} amount of nutrients actually taken up and assimilated by the plant so it provides the most direct means for evaluating plant nutrient status. For this reason leaf tissue analysis has been widely used for nutrient evaluation of a large range of crop species. Leaf analyses are particularly useful for monitoring long-term fertility management in perennial crops such as pecans. The procedures for collecting, handling, and analyzing pecan leaves are well established and relatively simple. A sample usually consists of 100 middle leaflets of fully mature leaves from new growth collected in late July to early August. To interpret <b>pecan</b> <b>leaf</b> tissue analyses, nutrient levels are compared against standard nutrient values. It is critical that appropriate standards be used for analyses to be valid. Standard pecan values currently in use in Arizona an...|$|R
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to the <b>pecan,</b> sharing similar <b>leaf</b> shape and being {{classified}} in the same section of the genus Carya sect. Apocarya, but unlike the pecan, it does not have edible nuts. It is most readily distinguished from the pecan by the smaller number of leaflets, with many leaves having only 7 leaflets (rarely fewer than 9, and often 11-13, in the pecan). Hybrids with the pecan are known, and named Carya × brownii. A hybrid between the shagbark hickory (C. ovata) is also recognized, and is known as Laney's hickory (Carya ×laneyi).|$|R
