25|$|Hemolytic anemia* {{is a type}} of {{regenerative}} anemia {{found in}} dogs characterized by destruction of the red blood cell. The most important type is immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, which can be a <b>primary</b> <b>disease</b> or secondary to cancer, infection, drugs, or vaccinations. Antibodies are present on the cell surface, leading to lysis and severe anemia. Other causes of hemolytic lesion include hypophosphatemia, exposure to toxins such as lead, infections such as ehrlichiosis or babesiosis, and rarely, neonatal isoerythrolysis. The behavioral condition pica, especially when involving the eating of concrete dust, tile grout, or sand, may be a sign of hemolytic anemia, indicating the need for a complete blood count to investigate a possible diagnosis.|$|E

[...] Other reviewers held the opposite, that Vaillant did not see alcoholism as a disease. Addiction researcher James E.

Saunders of the School of Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth University, wrote that Vaillant [...] "maintains that alcoholism is both a disease and a behaviour disorder." [...] In his summary {{at the end of the}} book, Vaillant in fact wrote that [...] "Alcoholism can simultaneously reflect both a conditioned habit and a disease; and the disease of alcoholism can be as well defined by a sociological model as by a medical model." ...|$|E

Data were analyzed by SPSS 18. 0. P RESULTS: <b>Primary</b> <b>diseases</b> included glaucoma(n = 6), herpes simplex keratitis(n = 6; two patients were post-surgery of cataract), herpes zoster keratitis(n = 1), keratitis after corneal foreign body taken(n = 1) and keratitis/corneal ulcer with unknown etiology(n = 4). Mean number of drugs was 3. 3 Â± 1. 5 and the frequency was 9 Â± 3. 9 times a day. Keratopathy was found in 16 cases, while conjunctival changes were found only in 3 cases(One patient got corneal and conjunctival changes simultaneously).

Methods. Risk and protective factors of <b>primary</b> cardiac <b>disease</b> (pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, arrhythmias and/or valvular abnormalities) were evaluated. Results. of 1437 patients, 202 (14. 1 %) developed one or more manifestations: 164 pericarditis, 35 valvulopathy, 23 arrhythmias, 7 myocarditis and 1 endocarditis at follow-up; 77 of these patients also had an episode of <b>primary</b> cardiac <b>disease</b> at or before recruitment. in the multivariable parsimonious model, African/Latin American ethnicity [odds ratio (OR) 1. 80, 95 % CI 1. 13, 2. 86], <b>primary</b> cardiac <b>disease</b> at or before recruitment (OR 6. 56, 95 % CI 4. 56, 9. 43) and first SLICC/ACR Damage Index for SLE assessment (OR 1. 31, 95 % CI 1. 14, 1. 50) were risk factors for the subsequent occurrence of <b>primary</b> cardiac <b>disease.</b> CNS involvement (OR 0. 44, 95 % CI 0. 25, 0. 75) and antimalarial treatment (OR 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 44, 0. 89) at or before recruitment were negatively associated with the occurrence of <b>primary</b> cardiac <b>disease</b> risk. <b>Primary</b> cardiac <b>disease</b> was not independently associated with mortality.
