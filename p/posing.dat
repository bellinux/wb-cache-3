40|$|Abstract Most {{existing}} techniques for articulated human <b>pose</b> estimation consider each person independently. Here we tackle {{the problem in}} a new setting, coined Human <b>Pose</b> Co-estimation (PCE), where multiple persons are in a common, but unknown <b>pose.</b> The task of PCE is to estimate their <b>poses</b> jointly and to produce a prototype characterizing the shared <b>pose.</b> Since the <b>poses</b> of the individual persons should {{be similar to the}} prototype, PCE has less freedom compared to estimating each <b>pose</b> independently, which simplifies the problem. We demonstrate our PCE technique on two applications. The first is estimating <b>pose</b> of people performing the same activity synchronously, such as during aerobic, cheerleading and dancing in a group. We show that PCE improves <b>pose</b> estimation accuracy over estimating each person independently. The second application is learning prototype <b>poses</b> characterizing a <b>pose</b> class directly from an image search engine queried by the class name (e. g. ‘lotus pose’). We show that PCE leads to better <b>pose</b> estimation in such images, and it learns meaningful prototypes which can be used as priors for <b>pose</b> estimation in novel images.

40|$|In this paper, a novel method {{based on}} <b>pose</b> {{adaptive}} {{linear discriminant analysis}} (PALDA) is proposed to deal with <b>pose</b> variation problems in face recognition when each person has only one frontal training sample. The basic idea of the PALDA method is described as follows: first, the <b>pose</b> style of the test sample is estimated by one <b>pose</b> classifier; then, the corresponding LDA feature, which is robust to the variation between the estimated <b>pose</b> style and the frontal <b>pose</b> style, is extracted. Since human faces are very similar objects with similar geometrical shape and configuration, the facial images from the same <b>pose</b> style are similar to each other. So an effective <b>pose</b> classifier is designed. The variations of each specific person’s facial images, due to changes of <b>pose,</b> are also rather similar to each other, so varieties of LDA projection matrixes, {{each of which is}} robust to one variation between one specific <b>pose</b> style and the frontal <b>pose</b> style, are trained with offline face samples containing various <b>poses.</b> The comparison with other <b>pose</b> robust face recognition methods on CMUPie database has confirmed the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method. 1...|$|R
