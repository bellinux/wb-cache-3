5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in {{principle}} to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called <b>photosynthetic</b> reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of <b>photosynthetic</b> pigment present, with most <b>photosynthetic</b> bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E
5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic <b>photosynthetic</b> bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of <b>photosynthetic</b> bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|A lichen is a {{symbiosis}} of a macroscopic fungus with <b>photosynthetic</b> microbial algae or cyanobacteria.|$|E
5|$|Cnidaria {{that carry}} <b>photosynthetic</b> {{symbionts}} {{may have the}} opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove toxic. The animals produce large quantities of antioxidants to neutralize the excess oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing <b>photosynthetic</b> organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new <b>photosynthetic</b> plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Plants make various <b>photosynthetic</b> pigments, some {{of which}} can be seen here through paper chromatography.|$|E
5|$|Annual growth {{increases}} exponentially for {{the first}} eight years or so, but then slows down as resources are diverted into reproduction and the greater density of foliage results in reduced <b>photosynthetic</b> efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} <b>photosynthetic</b> single-celled algae that live within their tissues. These species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and <b>photosynthetic</b> algae, and corals with <b>photosynthetic</b> algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|In many plants, {{defensive}} or {{storage structures}} {{are made by}} modifications {{of the development of}} primary leaves, stems, and roots. Leaves are variously modified from <b>photosynthetic</b> structures to form the insect-trapping pitchers of pitcher plants, the insect-trapping jaws of Venus flytrap, and the spines of cactuses, all homologous.|$|E
5|$|In prokaryotes endomembranes are rare, {{although}} in many <b>photosynthetic</b> bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded {{and most of}} the cell cytoplasm is filled with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering membranes may even form enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Kimberella dwelt {{in shallow}} waters (up {{to tens of}} meters in depth), sharing the calm, well-oxygenated sea floor with <b>photosynthetic</b> organisms and {{microbial}} mats. Assemblages bearing Kimberella often also bear fossils of Andiva, Yorgia, Dickinsonia, Tribrachidium and Charniodiscus, suggesting that it lived alongside these organisms.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{biochemistry}} is {{the study}} of the chemical processes used by plants. Some of these processes are used in their primary metabolism like the <b>photosynthetic</b> Calvin cycle and crassulacean acid metabolism. Others make specialised materials like the cellulose and lignin used to build their bodies, and secondary products like resins and aroma compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen present in {{seawater}} depends primarily upon its temperature and the <b>photosynthetic</b> organisms living in it, particularly algae, phytoplankton, and {{plants such as}} seagrass. During the day, their <b>photosynthetic</b> activity produces oxygen, which dissolves into the seawater and is used by marine animals. The water's oxygen saturation is lower during the night and much lower in the deep sea. Below a depth of about , there is insufficient light for photosynthesis and consequently little dissolved oxygen. Below this, anaerobic bacteria break down falling organic material, producing hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). It is projected that global warming will reduce oxygen both in surface and deep waters, due to oxygen's decreased solubility as temperatures increase and increased oceanic stratification.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{wholesale}} destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary, {{there was a}} proliferation of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, {{that do not require}} photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, <b>photosynthetic</b> organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E
5|$|Free {{oxygen gas}} was almost nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before <b>photosynthetic</b> archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|In biology, manganese(II) ions {{function}} as cofactors {{for a large}} variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of <b>photosynthetic</b> plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause manganism, a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.|$|E
5|$|In <b>photosynthetic</b> prokaryotes the {{mechanisms}} of carbon fixation are more diverse. Here, carbon dioxide can be fixed by the Calvin– Benson cycle, a reversed citric acid cycle, or the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. fixation pathway in the phototrophic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus, the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle |journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=215 |issue=3 |pages=633–43 |year=1993 |pmid=8354269 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18074.x}} and H2 {{as a source of}} carbon and energy |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/5/2/156 |journal=FASEB J |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=156–63 |year=1991 |pmid=1900793}} Prokaryotic chemoautotrophs also fix CO2 through the Calvin– Benson cycle, but use energy from inorganic compounds to drive the reaction.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} enter as {{dissolved}} organic carbon through rivers and is converted by <b>photosynthetic</b> organisms into organic carbon. This can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer {{for long periods of}} time before either being deposited as sediment or being returned to surface waters through thermohaline circulation.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is also {{important}} in <b>photosynthetic</b> oxygen evolution in chloroplasts in plants. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) {{is a part of}} photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis, and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese. To fulfill this requirement, most broad-spectrum plant fertilizers contain manganese.|$|E
5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic <b>photosynthetic</b> dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many <b>photosynthetic</b> bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis is a {{tripartite}} lichen—containing a fungus, a green alga, and a cyanobacterium. Cephalodia (lichenized aggregations of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria) {{are present}} on the primary thallus; smaller cephalodia {{are also on the}} pseudopodetia. Hemispherical to irregularly shaped, and light to dark brown in color, they contain species from the genus Nostoc. The green algal <b>photosynthetic</b> symbiont (photobiont) associated with P.acicularis is Asterochloris magna (formerly Trebouxia magna).|$|E
5|$|The {{heterotrophic}} bacterial microbiota and {{the ecology}} of <b>photosynthetic</b> bacteria of the Lake Burton have been studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters, the microbiota activity caused depletion of oxygen, separate water bodies of distinct chemistry got formed, the intervening chemical gradients have created niches for colonization by unique microbial communities and 68 bacteria were isolated.|$|E
5|$|The ocean can be {{conceptualized}} as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and {{presence or absence}} of sunlight. Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the <b>photosynthetic</b> activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous Scleractinia coral genera {{failed to}} cross the K–Pg {{boundary}} into the Paleocene. Further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow tropical waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the photic zone) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg boundary. Colonial coral species rely upon symbiosis with <b>photosynthetic</b> algae, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K–Pg boundary, however, the use of data from coral fossils to support K–Pg extinction and subsequent Paleocene recovery, must be weighed against the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these have on their <b>photosynthetic</b> symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of chemical defences in plants {{is linked to}} the emergence of chemical substances that are not involved in the essential <b>photosynthetic</b> and metabolic activities. These substances, secondary metabolites, are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development or reproduction of organisms, and often produced as by-products during the synthesis of primary metabolic products. Although these secondary metabolites have been thought {{to play a major role}} in defenses against herbivores, a meta-analysis of recent relevant studies has suggested that they have either a more minimal (when compared to other non-secondary metabolites, such as primary chemistry and physiology) or more complex involvement in defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{green algae}} {{are a large}} group of <b>photosynthetic</b> eukaryotes that include many {{microscopic}} organisms. Although some green algae are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually but not always with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and filamentous forms. In the Charales, which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.|$|E
5|$|The water {{also appears}} murky {{due to a}} high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, {{prevents}} <b>photosynthetic</b> stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photosynthetic</b> {{electron}} transport {{chains are}} discussed in greater detail in the articles Photophosphorylation, Photosynthesis, <b>Photosynthetic</b> reaction center and Light-dependent reaction.|$|E
25|$|Carotenoids like {{lycopene}} {{are important}} pigments found in <b>photosynthetic</b> pigment-protein complexes in plants, <b>photosynthetic</b> bacteria, fungi, and algae. They {{are responsible for}} the bright orangered colors of fruits and vegetables, perform various functions in photosynthesis, and protect <b>photosynthetic</b> organisms from excessive light damage. Lycopene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of many important carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, and xanthophylls.|$|E
25|$|Photoinhibition is light-induced {{reduction}} in the <b>photosynthetic</b> capacity of a plant, alga, or cyanobacterium. Photosystem II (PSII) is more sensitive to light {{than the rest of}} the <b>photosynthetic</b> machinery, and most researchers define the term as light-induced damage to PSII. In living organisms, photoinhibited PSII centres are continuously repaired via degradation and synthesis of the D1 protein of the <b>photosynthetic</b> reaction center of PSII. Photoinhibition is also used in a wider sense, as dynamic photoinhibition, to describe all reactions that decrease the efficiency of photosynthesis when plants are exposed to light.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photosynthetic</b> endosymbionts inhabit many {{tropical}} sponges, {{and these}} require light to survive. Certain sponges {{as a result}} depend on light availability and intensity tdiko achieve their nutritional needs. In some species however, light may lead to growth inhibition as they are sensitive to ultraviolet radiation. Other than when the sponge has associated <b>photosynthetic</b> bacteria, optimal sea sponge growth occurs in dark conditions.|$|E
25|$|Most chloroplasts in a <b>photosynthetic</b> cell do {{not develop}} {{directly}} from proplastids or etioplasts. In fact, a typical shoot meristematic plant cell contains only 7–20 proplastids. These proplastids differentiate into chloroplasts, which divide {{to create the}} 30–70 chloroplasts found in a mature <b>photosynthetic</b> plant cell. If the cell divides, chloroplast division provides the additional chloroplasts to partition between the two daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|Aquaculture {{makes use}} of local <b>photosynthetic</b> {{production}} (extensive) or fish that are fed with external food supply (intensive).|$|E
