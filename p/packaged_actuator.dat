The evolution of end-effector design has traded off between simplistic single-taskers and highly complex multi-function grippers. For future space operations, launch payload weight and {{the wide range of}} desired tasks necessitate a highly dexterous design with strength and manipulation capabilities matching those of the suited astronaut using EVA tools. The human hand provides the ideal parallel for a dexterous end-effector design. This thesis discusses efforts to design an anthropomorphic robotic hand, focusing on the detailed design, fabrication, and testing of an individual modular finger with considerations into overall hand configuration. The research first aims to define requirements for anthropomorphism and compare the geometry and motion of the design to that of the human hand. Active and passive ranges of motion are studied along with coupled joint behavior and grasp types. The second objective is to study the benefits and drawbacks of an active versus passive actuation systems. Tradeoffs between controllability and <b>packaging</b> of <b>actuator</b> assemblies are considered.

40|$|Most robot {{designers}} {{make the}} mechanical interface between an actuator and its load as stiff as possible[9][10]. This makes sense in traditional position-controlled systems, because high interface stiffness maximizes bandwidth and, for non-collocated control, reduces instability. However, lower interface stiffness has advantages as well, including greater shock tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force control, less damage during inadvertent contact, {{and the potential}} for energy storage. The ability of series elasticity (usually {{in the form of a}} compliant coating on an endeffector) to stabilize force control during intermittent contact with hard surfaces is well known. This paper proposes that for natural tasks where small-motion bandwidth is not of paramount concern, actuator to load interfaces should be significantly less stiff than in most present designs.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} the membrane actuator has been designed and constructed based on our previous diaphragm actuator. It consists of ferromagnetic shape memory alloy composite (FSMA) diaphragm and an electromagnet system. The actuation mechanism of the membrane actuator is the hybrid mechanism that we proposed previously. The high momentum airflow will be produced by the oscillation of the circular FSMA composite diaphragm driven by electromagnets close to its resonance frequency. This membrane actuator is designed for the active flow control technology on airplane wings. The active flow control (AFC) technology has been studied and shown that it can help aircraft improve aerodynamic performance and jet noise reduction. AFC {{can be achieved by}} a synthetic jet actuator injecting high momentum air into the airflow at the appropriate locations on aircraft wings.

The silicon valve part, 7 × 7 × 1 mm 3 in dimensions, is a sandwich construction of two KOH etched silicon wafers {{with a layer of}} chemical resistant silicone rubber bonded in between. This middle layer provides the flexibility needed to move the valve boss positioned in the top wafer during valve operation, but also results in improved sealing if the valve is closed.

Such smart systems consist of standard IC <b>packaging,</b> sensors and <b>actuators.</b> It is required that such systems will survive about 15 years of usage. To assure correct functionality prognostic and health monitoring (PHM) methods can be used. The potential benefits from implementation of these methods include among others reduction of maintenance costs and early warning of possible failure. For automotive industry, for which typical load history is not sufficiently known, {{this seems to be}} suitable approach. In today's reliability models some assumptions about the typical load history have to be made, which leads to inaccurate estimations on the remaining useful life.

40|$|A {{transducer}} {{consisting of}} {{multiple layers of}} ionic polymer material is developed for applications in sensing, actuation and control. A multilayer transducer is fabricated by layering individual transducers {{on top of one}} another. Each multilayer transducer consists of two to four individual layers each approximately 200 µm thick. The electrical characteristics of the transducers can be varied by connecting the layers in either a parallel arrangement or a series arrangement. The tradeoff in deflection and force is obtained by controlling the mechanical constraint at the interface. Packaging the transducer in an outer coating produces a hard constraint between layers and reduces the deflection with a force that increases linearly with the number of layers. This configuration also increases the bandwidth of the transducer. Removing the outer <b>packaging</b> produces an <b>actuator</b> that maintains the deflection of a single layer with an increased force output. This is obtained by allowing the layers to slide relative to one another during bending. Experiments on transducers with one to three layers are performed and the results are compared to an equivalent circuit model which was modified to accommodate multilayer transducers. The modification is performed on four different boundary conditions: two electrical, the series and the parallel connection, and two mechanical, the zero interfacial friction and the zero slip on the interface. Expressions for blocked force, free deflection, and electrical impedance of the transducer are developed in terms of fundamental material parameters, transducer geometry, and the number of individual layers. The trends in the transducer response are validated using experiments on transducers with multiple polymer layers. PublishedN/...|$|R

This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130. [...] Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit. The HTTB first flew on 19 June 1984, with civil registration of N130X. After demonstrating many new technologies, {{some of which were}} applied to the C-130J, the HTTB was lost in a fatal accident on 3 February 1993, at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, in Marietta, Georgia. [...] The crash was attributed to disengagement of the rudder fly-by-wire flight control system, resulting in a total loss of rudder control capability while conducting ground minimum control speed tests (Vmcg). The disengagement was a result of the inadequate design of the rudder's integrated <b>actuator</b> <b>package</b> by its manufacturer; the operator's insufficient system safety review failed to consider the consequences of the inadequate design to all operating regimes.

Results demonstrate that the largest obstacle to obtaining good performance is water transport between the individual layers. Water crossover produces a near short circuit electrical condition and produces feedthrough between actuation layers and sensing layers. Electrical feedthrough due to water crossover eliminates the ability to produce a transducer that has combined sensing and actuation properties. Eliminating water crossover through good insulation enables the development of a small (5 mm x 30 mm) transducer that has sensing and actuation bandwidth on the order of 100 Hz. N/...|$|R

This dissertation reports the conceptual design, fabrication implementation, and experimental application of a piezoelectrically tunable Microoptoelectromechanical System (MOEMS) device as the central system for a combined spectral/time-resolved fluorescence biosensor for tissue characterization. From design point of view, this dissertation examined the theoretical characteristics using a piezoelectric multimorph model with the appropriate diffraction geometry and evaluated the ray tracing geometries to estimate the system spectroscopic performance. To realize the MOEMS device, the fabrication was divided into three main parts: 1) Piezoelectrically actuated grating, 2) microoptics for light coupling, and 3) a three-dimensional aligned <b>packaging.</b> The micrograting <b>actuator</b> was fabricated via bulk-micromachining process with a ZnO thin-film sandwich to provide linear actuation with input voltage.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and control of a hyper-articulated robot arm {{comprising}} just a few active joints driving a multitude of passive joints. This underactuated arm design was motivated by {{the need for a}} compact snake-like robot for assembly operations inside an aircraft wing. The interior of the wing is accessible only through small access portholes distributed along the length. Currently, such assembly operations are performed by human operators who crawl into the wing through its access portholes. The working conditions are ergonomically challenging and result in frequent injuries. The conflicting requirements of small form factor and high payload carrying capacity have been the primary bottlenecks in the development of assembly robots. We propose a nested-channel serial linkage structure for the hyper-articulated arm. When fully contracted, the arm is extremely compact and can access the interior of the wing through its access porthole. Once inside the wing, the arm may be expanded to access distal assembly locations. However, it is impossible to <b>package</b> current <b>actuator</b> technology to meet the payload requirements within the limited size of the robot arm. The joints of the hyper-articulated arm have no dedicated actuators. Instead, they are deployed by modulating gravitational torques. By tilting the base link appropriately, the gravitational torque drives each unactuated link to a desired angular position. With simple, compact locking mechanisms, the arm can change its configuration using the actuated base placed outside the wing. We analyze the system dynamics to gain physical insight into the interaction between the actuated and unactuated degrees of freedom. We make important approximations to capture the dominant effects in the system dynamics so as to facilitate control design. (cont.) The dynamics (actual, as well as approximate) of the unactuated links are essentially 2 nd order non-holonomic constraints, for which there are no general control techniques. We present several motion planning algorithms for sequential positioning of the free joints of the robot arm. The motion planning algorithms are formulated as parameterized non-linear two point boundary value problems. These algorithms demonstrate reasonable performance in the absence of disturbances. However, the end-effecter requires accurate positioning to perform assembly operations. To address this issue, we present a sequential closed-loop control algorithm for accurate positioning of the free joints. We synthesize a Lyapunov function to prove the convergence of this control scheme and to generate estimates of the domain of convergence. For faster deployment of the robot arm, multiple free links must move concurrently. We also present several motion planning algorithms to address this problem. We built two prototypes to illustrate {{the design and}} actuation concepts. The first prototype has 3 links and has a fixed axis of tilt in the horizontal plane. The second prototype has 4 links and may be tilted about an arbitrary axis in the horizontal plane. The motion planning and closed-loop control algorithms were implemented on both prototypes. The experimental results indicate the efficacy of such control schemes. by Binayak Roy. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2008.

40|$|Shape {{memory alloy}} (SMA) {{actuators}} provide the highest force-to-weight ratio of any known actuator. They {{can be designed}} {{for a wide variety}} of form factors from flat, thin packages, to form-matching <b>packages</b> for existing <b>actuators.</b> SMA actuators can be operated many thousands of times, so that ground testing is possible. Actuation speed can be accurately controlled from milliseconds to position and hold, and even electronic velocity-profile control is possible. SMA actuators provide a high degree of operational flexibility, and are truly smart actuators capable of being accurately controlled by onboard microprocessors across a wide range of voltages. The Miga Aero actuator is a SMA actuator designed specifically for spaceflight applications. Providing 13 mm of stroke with either 20 - or 40 -N output force in two different models, the Aero actuator is made from low-outgassing PEEK (polyether ether ketone) plastic, stainless steel, and nickel-titanium SMA wires. The modular actuator weighs less than 28 grams. The dorsal output attachment allows the Aero to be used in either PUSH or PULL modes by inverting the mounting orientation. The SPA 1 actuator utilizes commercially available SMA actuator wire to provide 3 / 8 -in. (approx. =. 1 cm) of stroke at a force of over 28 lb (approx. =. 125 N). The force is provided by a unique packaging of the single SMA wire that provides the output force of four SMA wires mechanically in parallel. The output load is shared by allowing the SMA wire to slip around the output attachment end to adjust or balance the load, preventing any individual wire segment from experiencing high loads during actuation. A built-in end limit switch prevents overheating of the SMA element following actuation when used in conjunction with the Miga Analog Driver [a simple MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) switching circuit]. A simple 2 D machined mechanical binary latch has been developed to complement the capabilities of SMA wire actuators. SMA actuators typically perform ideally as latch-release devices, wherein a spring-loaded device is released when the SMA actuator actuates in one direction.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{manufacture}} of a 26 -bladed 'active' rotor {{that will be used}} for developing an experimental database on turbomachinery aeroservoelastic phenomena, such as flutter and its control. The active rotor has blades made of two stress-bearing composite spars, aerodynamically shaped foam, piezoelectric actuators attached to the spar base and a root which allows the blade to be inserted into the rotor. The thesis analyzed the models developed for the active rotor blade design from previous studies and made suitable refinements in them. The following parameters were obtained - spar dimensions, their location and material, piezoelectric dimensions and material, foam material, and root structure and material. Next, technologies were developed for manufacturing the root and the twisted spar, <b>packaging</b> the piezoelectric <b>actuators</b> using copper-Kapton and bonding them to the spars, and wiring the spars and actuators. However, further investigation is necessary with regards to the issues of foam shaping, spar-foam attachment, and development of accurate leading and trailing edges of the blade. The final step involved testing the blade before and after spar-foam bonding. This required testing on the benchtop to obtain the blade performance limitations, and then testing it in vacuum while spinning inside a spin pit, which was constructed for this purpose. The latter gives the blade performance under rotation. The scope of the thesis is limited to the benchtop tests conducted on the active wired spars. Some of the blade and spin pit wiring issues need to be resolved before conducting the spin tests in vacuum. Also a rotor frame incorporating 26 active blades needs to developed to test under vacuum and in a wind tunnel. The results of the preliminary benchtop tests as well as the blade finite element model predict that the blade performance would be lower than the initial target. Several ways of improving its actuation capability considered were: (a) applying higher voltage with DC offset to the actuators, (b) using multi-wafer actuators, and (c) using active fiber composites. However, these issues need further work. The active rotor, when completed, will serve as a robust tool for aeroservoelastic testing over a significantly larger operating range than is currently possible. by Debashis Sahoo. Thesis (S. M.)
