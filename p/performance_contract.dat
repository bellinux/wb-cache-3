5|$|On 5 January 1840, Donizetti {{signed a}} {{rehearsal}} and <b>performance</b> <b>contract</b> with his librettists and Anténor Joly, who was operating a company named Théâtre de la Renaissance and giving performances at the Salle Ventadour in Paris. Théâtre de la Renaissance chose L'ange over Richard Wagner's Das Liebesverbot. Joly's company had premiered the French version of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor the previous year, and L'ange {{was meant to}} be its successor. The contract, which is on display at the Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra National de Paris, stipulates that L'ange be performed uninterrupted twenty times unless three consecutive performances sold poorly, and that Joly could not premiere any other opera until the revenue from L'ange started to decline. The contract contains nothing about Donizetti's compensation; therefore, it is possible that another contract existed. L'ange was set to begin rehearsal on 1 February 1840. Donizetti had two other operas in various stages of preparation at other theaters during this time: Les martyrs and La fille du régiment.|$|E

In this study, <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> refers to a framework that uses a form of ‘relational’ contract referred to as a performance agreement for performance management. This study sought to establish challenges in the implementation of <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> in the public sector. In addition, it sought to recommend interventions to improve implementation of <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> in the public sector. A qualitative research approach was used with Gauteng department of housing as a case study. The study focused on <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> for senior managers who are members of the senior management service The study established that although <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> has an important role to play in performance management, its implementation is hindered by several challenges. The complexity of performance agreements format templates; inadequate resources and managerial authority; political interference; inadequate leadership; inadequate personal training and development; systems and processes challenges; organization culture and a weak implementation strategy were identified as the main challenges in the implementation of <b>performance</b> <b>contracting.</b> The study recommends interventions to improve the implementation of <b>performance</b> <b>contracting.</b> These include: the development of a comprehensive implementation strategy that takes cognizance of the identified challenges and provision of adequate political and administrative leadership...|$|R

25|$|Although Uganda's {{official}} {{policy is to}} promote tariffs that cover all costs, the NWSC tariff actually covers only operation and maintenance costs. According to a 2003 published report, the second <b>performance</b> <b>contract</b> between the government of Uganda and NWSC provided for a tariff policy {{that in the long}} term covered operation, maintenance, and a part of the future investments. Although the current tariff structure does recover operation and maintenance costs, the tariffs are not high enough to finance system expansion, leaving system improvement and extension investments to the national government and international donors. According to UN-Water, full cost recovery tariffs including investments would require a significant rise of tariffs. William T. Muhairwe in 2006 asserted that full cost recovery in least developed countries is a myth. According to him, tariffs would have to increase by 90 percent to provide full cost recovery.|$|E
25|$|A drunken Raoul {{is sitting}} alone in a forlorn bar, contemplating the {{evolution}} {{of his relationship with}} Christine ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Meg enters and warns him that New York isn't a suitable place for his family, and she urges them to abandon Christine's <b>performance</b> <b>contract</b> and leave that night. Raoul refuses, citing their need for the money; he boasts that he is not afraid of the Phantom, unaware that his rival has since slipped in and replaced the barman behind the counter. When Meg leaves, the Phantom confronts Raoul and intimidates him with veiled remarks that cause him to question his paternity of Gustave. The Phantom also offers Raoul a bet: if Christine fails to perform tonight, the Phantom will pay off all their debts and allow them to leave together, but if she sings the aria he has written for her, Raoul must go back to France alone. Raoul accepts the Phantom's dare and then experiences a moment of panic at what he has done ("Devil Take The Hindmost").|$|E

50|$|A {{more recent}} {{phenomenon}} {{is the concept}} of combining the benefits of <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> with the benefits of green buildings, affectionately described as green <b>performance</b> <b>contracting.</b> The reason the concept makes sense is because for green buildings, the costliest pre-requisites to meet are usually the energy efficiency requirements. The LEED rating system requires buildings to be benchmarked using the EPA EnergyStar system. The minimum score to meet the LEED prerequisites is a score of 75 or greater (meaning the building is in the top 75 percentile of benchmarked buildings). Since <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> attempts to find all the sources of energy waste, then a building that has gone through the <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> process should meet the LEED prerequisite.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. California is {{the only}} state to entitle {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities to the services and supports required to live independent and productive lives. Fulfilling the entitlement has proved challenging for the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS), however, as California must demonstrate fiscal prudence, while still providing the right to entitlement to individuals with developmental disabilities. To address this issue, California established <b>performance</b> <b>contracts</b> to measure how well the DDS is meeting its government mandate. This thesis aimed at answering multiple questions, regarding the DDS <b>performance</b> <b>contracts.</b> First, what is the DDS currently measuring in its <b>performance</b> <b>contracts?</b> Second, what do the existing measures tell the reader about how well the department is performing? Lastly, are there any performance measures that the department should be measuring that it is not? This thesis evaluated the DDS??? 2009 <b>Performance</b> <b>Contracts</b> and Year-End Reports, measuring data, from each, against the mandatory rights of individuals with developmental disabilities, established by the Lanterman Act. A review of the performance measures determined how well the DDS is meeting its organizational goals and objectives. Findings and Implications The 2009 <b>Performance</b> <b>Contracts</b> sufficiently informed the public that the DDS meets its organizational goal of providing less restrictive living options to individuals with developmental disabilities. Yet, the study indicated that the DDS does not incorporate quality measures into its <b>performance</b> <b>contracts.</b> Additionally, the study suggested that while the DDS??? <b>performance</b> <b>contracts</b> may use some adequate measures to determine how well the department is achieving the expectations set forth in the Lanterman Act, the department lacks performance measures and data in a number of important areas. This suggests that the DDS would benefit from developing quality performance measures for all the mandatory rights outlined in the Lanterman Act. If the <b>performance</b> <b>contracts</b> adequately measure the department???s performance, the DDS can essentially take data from the <b>performance</b> <b>contracts</b> to create cost-saving ideas and service delivery improvements in collaboration with its clients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} an innovation in <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> {{for substance abuse}} services in the State of Maine and examine data on measured performance by providers {{before and after the}} innovation. DATA SOURCES AND COLLECTION: From the Maine Addiction Treatment System (MATS), an admission and discharge data set collected by the Maine Office of Substance Abuse (OSA). The MATS data for this study include information on clients of programs receiving public funding from October 1, 1989 through June 30, 1994. Additional data are drawn from the contracts between the state and providers, and from service delivery reports submitted to OSA. STUDY DESIGN: Client-level performance measures were calculated directly from MATS using OSA's formulas and standards, and then aggregated to the treatment program level. Multivariate regression analysis was done for each performance indicator as a dependent variable with <b>performance</b> <b>contracting,</b> time, extent of state funding, and provider characteristics as independent variables. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Performance</b> <b>contracting</b> is positively related to better performance for effectiveness indicators overall. Individual effectiveness indicators that showed improvement include drug use indicators (abstinence and reduction in use) and social functioning indicators. In addition, <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> is associated with an increase in efficiency performance, defined as delivery of the contracted amount of service, for agencies that depend heavily on OSA for funding. Finally, <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> appears unrelated to the special populations indicators that measure services to target populations that OSA considers harder to treat. CONCLUSIONS: There is tentative evidence of a relationship between provider performance and the introduction of <b>performance</b> <b>contracting.</b> More definite conclusions await more detailed analyses of client-level data...|$|R
