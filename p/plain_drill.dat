40|$|Since it is {{generally}} considered {{that the role of}} a Computer Algebra System (CAS) in education is to enable students to solve hard, real-life problems without getting bogged down in minutiae of symbolic computation, the issue of generating <b>plain</b> <b>drill</b> exercises within CAS environment is usually not viewed as important. The premise of this paper is that certain fundamental skills of basic algebra have to be mastered through repeated practice of drill exercises. Today, typical high-school algebra teachers are often faced with workbook / software combinations that do not meet their specific didactical needs. This is a surprising state of affairs, considering the power of existing CA systems. In this work, we will describe how an educational CAS can be used to generate problems that are based on teacher defined templates. Introduction to Algebrator Algebrator is a CA system specifically designed for high-school algebra students and teachers. Besides being able to solve a wide variety of symbolic problems, it also provides a step-by-step solution process an...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe English Channel {{has been}} an area of intense {{geological}} investigation for decades, spanning various subjects such as structural and basin evolution between variscan and alpine orogenic cycles or sediment transport over a wide platform under tidal and storm currents. Among these subjects, one specific feature of the English Channel is the occurrence of a complex network of channels with clear morphological expression at the seabed. Since {{the beginning of the}} 20 th century, and more pragmatically since the 1970 s and the development of high-resolution seismic acquisition, this network {{has been the focus of}} several studies that proposed various scenarii for its origin and age. The existence of two superimposed networks had already been proposed in the late 70 's. In 2015, in the framework of the geological mapping of the French continental shelf, BRGM acquired a dense grid of very high resolution marine seismic (MERCAUX 2015 cruise). Interpretation of these (i) confirms that several networks are superimposed, and (ii) details the real complexity and discontinuity of the older network(s) associated to the " Fosses de la Manche " system. Finally, thanks to high quality oil exploration seismic data (courtesy of HIS), we were able to reveal a local unexpected increase of bedrock incision and associated sedimentary fill up to c. 350 m. These observations and subsequent implications for networks origin and development are discussed with respect to regional geological settings and controlling parameters. Their significance in terms of source-to-sink features is a key aspect as the English Channel is certainly an important zone of sediment transfer during Neogene, collecting from a large catchment and delivering to the Western Approaches, the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay abyssal <b>plains.</b> <b>Drilling</b> selected targets to provide groundtruthing sounds now like the obvious next step...|$|R
40|$|Upper Jurassic {{calcareous}} nannofossil assemblages {{have been}} studied from strata cored over basement blocks now buried under the Iberia Abyssal <b>Plain</b> (Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Program Leg 173 Sites 1065 and 1069). The youngest Jurassic assemblages at each site are Tithonian in age, {{the same as those}} at nearby Leg 149 Site 901, an age that predates the breakup of the Iberia continental margin. The paucity of the assemblages, the prevalence of coccospheres, and the relatively high organic contents of the fine clastic sediments in which they occur are characteristic of a restricted interior basin that had little communication with the open ocean. During the major rifting episode (a Berriasian event), the Jurassic sequences were dispersed along with their underlying blocks of presumed continental crust across the ocean-continent transition of the Iberia Abyssal Plain, probably as a result of detachment faulting...|$|R

40|$|Backstripping {{analysis}} of the Bass River and Ancora boreholes from the New Jersey coastal <b>plain</b> (Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Project Leg 174 AX) provides newLate Cretaceous sea-level estimates and corroborates previously published Cenozoic sea-level estimates. Compaction histories of all coastal plain boreholes were updated using porosity^depth relationships estimated fromNew Jersey coastal plain electric logs. The new porosity estimates are considerably lower than those previously calculated at the o¡shore Cost B- 2 well. Amplitudes and durations of sea-level variations are comparable in sequences that are represented at multiple boreholes, suggesting that the resultant curves are an approximation of regional sea level. Both the amplitudes and durations of third-order (0. 5 ^ 5 Myr) cycles tend to decrease from the Late Cretaceous to the lateMiocene. Third-order sea-level amplitudes in excess of 60 m are not observed. Long-term (108 ^ 107 years) sea level was approximately constant at 30 ^ 80 m in the Late Cretaceous, rose to a maximum early Eocene value of approximately 100 ^ 140 m, and then fell through the Eocene and Oligocene...|$|R
40|$|Serpentinized ultramafic rocks {{recovered}} {{from beneath the}} southern Iberia Abyssal <b>Plain</b> (Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Programme Leg 173) provide the first record of fractal carbonate replacement patterns in a serpentinite. The patterns are expressed as microscopic branching aggregates (clusters) of aragonite disseminated throughout the serpentinites. Aragonite growth was the final mineralization event. The aragonite diminishes rapidly in quantity from an essential to a trace component of the serpentinite over a distance of ~ 40 m from a normal fault. Decreasing abundance of aragonite away from the normal fault links {{the growth of the}} carbonate to the multistage hydrothermal mineralization associated with the fault. Aragonite clusters are concentrated in picrolite, where they are interwoven with colloid-sized chrysotile, and show fractal growth habits. Areas adjacent to the clusters are sites of Mg enrichment of the serpentine medium relative to aragonite-free picrolite. It is interpreted that the aragonite clusters result from incursions of reactive seawater solutions through fine-scale pore structures in and around the fault in response to pressure gradients emanating from active tectonism. Cluster growth is interpreted to be a percolation phenomenon and provides a novel source of information on the nature of fine-scale reactive fluid flow, pore-space connectivity, and carbonate replacement processes in serpentinites...|$|R

40|$|The Atlantic City {{borehole}} was {{the second}} site drilled {{as part of the}} New Jersey coastal <b>plain</b> <b>drilling</b> project, Leg 150 X. It focused on middle middle Miocene to Oligocene "Icehouse" and middle-upper Eocene "Doubthouse" sequences known from previous rotary and cable tool wells. Recovery was not as good as at Island Beach (60 % vs. 87 %) because of hole stability problems; however, recovery was excellent for most of the critical lower-middle Miocene interval (390 - 937 ft; 81 %). The surficial Cape May Formation (uppermost Pleistocene-Holocene; 123 ft thick) contains nearshore gravelly sand and clay at the top and fluvial deposits at the base that apparently correlate with the Cape May Formation at Island Beach. The ?middle Miocene Cohansey Formation (96 ft thick) sand and sandy clay represents fluvial deposits not present at Island Beach. The ages of both units are uncertain. Recovery of the uppermost part of the 706 -ft-thick Kirkwood Formation was poor (no recovery from 293 to 390 ft), but recovery for the Kirkwood between 390 and 937 ft was excellent. The sand, silts, and clay facies expressed in the Kirkwood Formation at Atlantic City represent diverse fluvial, nearshore, and neritic (including prodelta) environments. Several upward-coarsening sequences can be recognized on the basis of lithofacies breaks, gamma-log changes, and hiatuses, corresponding with confining units at the base and aquifer units at the top. These lithostratigraphic and geohydrologic units correspond with similar units at Island Beach, and we suggest that they correlate. Numerous shell beds in the Atlantic City borehole allow preliminary dating of these sequences with Sr-isotopic stratigraphy, including the middle middle Miocene Kirkwood 3 sequence (13. 3 - 13. 5 Ma; from at least 401. 7 to at least 470 ft), the upper lower Miocene Kirkwood 2 sequence 17. 0 17. 9 Ma; 512 - 666 ft), and the uppermost Oligocene to lower Miocene Kirkwood 1 sequence (20. 3 - 25. 8 Ma; 666 - 937 ft). The Kirkwood 1 sequence may be divided into several additional sequences that have dramatic shell beds at their base and distinct ages determined by Sr isotopes: 20. 3 - 21. 9 Ma, 23. 6 - 23. 7 Ma, and - 25. 8 Ma. A sharp lithologic and gamma-log break at 741 ft may indicate another sequence boundary between 20. 3 and 20. 8 Ma, although Sr-isotopic resolution is not sufficient to document this hiatus unequivocally. The upper Eocene-Oligocene may be divided further into 3 sequences based on lithologic and gamma log changes that were dated with Sr isotopes: upper Oligocene (27. 4 - 28. 7 Ma), lower Oligocene (- 33. 4 Ma), and upper Eocene (36. 6 - 37. 7 Ma). Biostratigraphy is consistent with the Sr-isotopic ages and indicates additional lower upper Eocene and upper middle Eocene sequences. The systems tracts are generally well developed for these middle Eocene through middle Miocene sequences, with a basal shell or glauconite sand at the base and sands at the top. Further biostratigraphic and Sr-isotopic studies should refine the ages of the sequences, whereas lithostratigraphic and benthic foraminifer biofacies studies should reveal details of the depositional environments and systems tracts of these well-developed sequences...|$|R

40|$|Six {{sites were}} drilled on the {{southern}} Iberia Abyssal <b>Plain</b> during Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Program (ODP) Leg 173. Three holes (1067 A, 1068 A, and 1069 A) recovered Eocene sediments consisting of thinly bedded turbidite deposits with interbedded hemipelagic sediments (Bouma sequence Te) deposited near the calcite compensation depth. The hemipelagic sediments are barren of nannofossils, necessitating {{the use of the}} turbidite deposits to erect an Eocene biostratigraphy for these holes. Moderately preserved, diverse assemblages of nannofossils were recovered from silty clays (Bouma sequence Td) and poorly preserved, less diverse assemblages were recovered from sandy/silty clays (Bouma sequence Tc). Hole 1067 A has a continuous record of sedimentation (Subzones CP 9 a–CP 14 a) and Holes 1068 A and 1069 A have similar continuous records (Subzones CP 9 a–CP 12 a), although all holes contain barren intervals.

40|$|Drilling on the Iberia Abyssal <b>Plain</b> during Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Program Leg 173 {{allowed us}} to recover Upper Cretaceous through Paleocene sediments at Sites 1068 and 1069 and only upper Paleocene sediments at Site 1067, which expands {{considerably}} the Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene record for this region. Of these three sites, Site 1068 recovered uppermost Cretaceous sediments {{as well as the}} most complete Paleocene record, whereas Site 1067 yielded only uppermost Paleocene sediments (Zone CP 8). Site 1069 provided a rather complete upper Campanian through Maastrichtian section but a discontinuous Paleocene record. After a detailed calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy was documented in distribution charts, we calculated mass accumulation rates for Holes 1068 A and 1069 A. Sediments in Hole 1068 A apparently record the final stages of burial of a high basement block by turbidity flows. Accumulation rates through the Upper Cretaceous indicate relatively high rates, 0. 95 g/cm** 2 /k. y., but may be unreliable {{because of the lack of}} datum points and/or possible hiatuses. Accumulation rates in the Paleocene section of Hole 1068 A fluctuated every few million years from lower (~ 0. 35 g/cm** 2 /k. y.) to higher rates (~ 0. 85 g/cm** 2 /k. y.) until the latest Paleocene, when rates increased to an average of ~ 2. 0 g/cm** 2 /k. y. Mass accumulation rates for the Upper Cretaceous in Hole 1069 A indicate a steady rate of ~ 0. 60 g/cm** 2 /k. y. from 75 to 72 Ma. There may have been one or more hiatuses between 72 and 68 Ma (combined Zone CC 24 through Subzone CC 25 b), as indicated by the very low accumulation rate of 0. 15 g/cm** 2 /k. y. The Paleocene section of Hole 1069 A does not show the same continuous record, which may result from fluctuations in the carbonate compensation depth and poor recovery (average = 40 %). Zones CP 4 and CP 5 are missing within a barren interval; this and numerous other barren intervals affect the precision of the nannofossil zonation and calculation of mass accumulation rates. However, in spite of these missing zones, mass accumulation rates do not seem to indicate the presence of hiatuses as the rates for this barren interval average ~ 1. 0 g/cm** 2 /k. y. This study set out to test the hypothesis that a reliable biostratigraphic record could be constructed from sediments derived from turbidity flows deposited below the carbonate compensation depth. As illustrated here, not only could a reliable biostratigraphic record be determined from these sediments, but sedimentation and mass accumulation rates could also be determined, allowing inferences to be drawn concerning the sedimentary history of this passive margin. The reliability of this record is confirmed by independent verification by the establishment of a magnetostratigraphy for the same cores...|$|R
