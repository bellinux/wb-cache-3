40|$|AbstractProtoplasts {{isolated}} from petunia leaf mesophyll are non-cycling cells mostly with 2 C content. Cells regenerating from <b>protoplast</b> <b>culture</b> enter mitosis after 48 h. This experimental model {{is used to}} relate p 34 cd 2 kinase activity to cell cycle phase. Our {{results show that the}} histone Hl phosphorylation, and hence p 34 cdc 2 kinase activity, peaks with G 2 + early M cell cycle phase. However, a trace kinase activity was already present when most cells were entering S phase. To obtain a maximum of cells in G 1 +S phases, the <b>protoplast</b> <b>culture</b> was treated with the rare amino acid, mimosine. Mimosine blocked plant cells derived from <b>protoplast</b> <b>culture</b> both at g 1 and in early and mid S phase. Despite the increased G 1 +S level, p 34 cdc 2 kinase activity did not increase. This suggests that the trace activity appearing when the majority of cells are entering S does not correspond to any putative P 34 cdc 2 activation at G 1 /S transition but to the activation of the minor 4 C population initially present in the leaf: the hypothesis remains that p 34 cdc 2 kinase activity is solely related to G 2 +M phase in petunia...|$|E

Of the regenerated plants from suspension culture, 20 were abnormal in that they deviated from the PGI/ 2 phenotype of the donor plant. Among the abnormal plants two distinct isozyme variants absent in the original donor, which were probably the result of point mutations, were recorded. There was evidence of deletions of specific PGI/ 2 alleles. This was confirmed cytologically by the reduced chromosome number found in the relevant cell suspension derived plants. There was also evidence that an active allele had been transformed into a null allele. All the plants regenerated from <b>protoplast</b> <b>culture</b> had the same PGI/ 2 phenotype as the donor plant but were hyperpolyploid. The loss of activity of individual PGI/ 2 alleles in plants derived from protoplasts was masked by gene duplication because of their hyperpolyploid nature.

Roubelakis-Angelakis [1993] Physiol Plant 87 : 263 - 270), we further tested the hypothesis that oxidative stress may be implicated in the recalcitrance of plant protoplasts. The expression of catalase, a major defense enzyme against cell oxidation, was studied during isolation and <b>culture</b> of mesophyll <b>protoplasts</b> from the recalcitrant grapevine and regenerating tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Incubation of tobacco leaf strips with cell wall-degrading enzymes resulted in a burst of catalase activity and an increase in its immunoreactive protein; in contrast, no such increases were found in grapevine. The cathodic and anodic catalase isoforms consisted exclusively of subunits [alpha] and [beta], respectively, in tobacco, and of subunits [beta] and [alpha], respectively, in grapevine. The catalase specific activity increased only in grapevine <b>protoplasts</b> during <b>culture.</b> The ratio of the enzymatic activities to the catalase immunoreactive protein declined in dividing tobacco protoplasts and remained fairly constant in nondividing tobacco and grapevine <b>protoplasts</b> during <b>culture.</b> Also, in dividing tobacco protoplasts the de novo accumulation of the catalase [beta] subunit gave rise to the acidic isoenzymes, whereas in nondividing tobacco and grapevine protoplasts, after 8 d in culture, only the basic isoenzymes remained due to de novo accumulation of the [alpha] subunit. The pattern of catalase expression in proliferating tobacco leaf cells during callogenesis was similar to that in dividing protoplasts.

40|$|Lignin is an {{aromatic}} polymer {{derived from}} the combinatorial coupling of monolignol radicals in the cell wall. Recently, various glycosylated lignin oligomers have been revealed in Arabidopsis thaliana. Given that monolignol oxidation and monolignol radical coupling are known {{to occur in the}} apoplast, and glycosylation in the cytoplasm, it raises questions about the subcellular localization of glycosylated lignin oligomer biosynthesis and their storage. By metabolite profiling of Arabidopsis leaf vacuoles, we show that the leaf vacuole stores a large number of these small glycosylated lignin oligomers. Their structural variety and the incorporation of alternative monomers, as observed in Arabidopsis mutants with altered monolignol biosynthesis, indicate that they are all formed by combinatorial radical coupling. In contrast to the common believe that combinatorial coupling is restricted to the apoplast, we hypothesized that the aglycones of these compounds are made within the cell. To investigate this, leaf <b>protoplast</b> <b>cultures</b> were cofed with C- 13 (6) -labeled coniferyl alcohol and a C- 13 (4) -labeled dimer of coniferyl alcohol. Metabolite profiling of the cofed protoplasts provided strong support for the occurrence of intracellular monolignol coupling. We therefore propose a metabolic pathway involving intracellular combinatorial coupling of monolignol radicals, followed by oligomer glycosylation and vacuolar import, which shares characteristics with both lignin and lignan biosynthesis...|$|R

The state of dedifferentiation {{is evidenced by}} changes in cell morphology, genome organization, {{as well as by}} the capability of protoplasts to differentiate into multiple types of cells (depending on the type of the stimulus applied). The first change in the genome structure is connected with large-scale chromatin decondensation, affecting chromocentres involving various types of these repetitive sequences. This paper describes not only the de- and recondensation of satellite DNA type I and 5 S rDNA repetitive sequences, but it also compares the recondensation level of chromatin with the levels of oxidative stress which were decreased by using an antioxidant, as well as the capabilities of the antioxidative systems within protoplasts, during the first 72 h of their culture. It is demonstrated that the treatment of protoplasts with ascorbic acid not only decreased the level of oxidative stress but also positively stimulated the expression of the ascorbate peroxidase and catalase. It also led to a greater recondensation of the chromatin (when compared to the untreated protoplasts); in addition, it supported cell proliferation. It is concluded that large-scale genome relaxation is more directly connected with oxidative stress than with large changes in the expression of genes; and further, that its recondensation is related to the start of (as well as the level of) protection by the antioxidative systems...|$|R

Lysozyme digests of PG isolated using gel filtration from the supernatant medium of protoplasts grown in the presence of [14 C]acetate and L-[3 H]lysine contained small amounts of PG having KD expected for peptide cross-linked dimers and trimers. Addition of benzyl penicillin (300 mug/ml) to growing <b>protoplast</b> <b>cultures</b> did not affect the net amount of PG fragments synthesized but resulted in inhibition of synthesis of dimer and trimer fractions by 27 and 59 %, respectively. Failure of penicillin to completely inhibit the accumulation of the dimer fraction was attributed to the presence of atypical forms of dimer. In fact, the supernatant medium of penicillin-treated cultures did not contain detectable amounts of typical peptide cross-linked dimer. The degree of peptide cross-linkage of protoplast PG was at most only 13 % of that found in walls isolated from intact streptococci.

The total contents of amino acids and their profiles {{might be related to}} the recalcitrance for the growth and salt tolerance or halophilic nature of cells and basal media used for the maintenance of cell <b>cultures</b> or <b>protoplast</b> <b>cultures</b> of the mangrove species. This is the first report on callus induction from hypocotyls of A. alba.   </p...|$|R
40|$|A crucial {{pre-requisite}} in genetically manipulating higher plants involves {{systems for}} <b>culturing</b> plant <b>protoplasts</b> and cells under static conditions with an adequate oxygen supply. This is especially {{the case for}} cells from cryopreservation, where respiratory perturbations are known to occur during early post-thaw recovery. Therefore, studies were undertaken to assess the potential, and actual, beneficial effects involving culture of cells at an interface between inert, oxygen-gassed perfluorocarbon (PFC) liquid overlaid with liquid or semi-solidified media supplemented {{with or without the}} non-ionic surfactant, Pluronic F- 68. Assessments were also made to compare the efficacy of PFC supplementation with other physical (medium implanted with glass rods to increase the surface area available for gaseous exchange) and chemical (haemoglobin; Hb) options, both alone and in combination, for gaseous manipulation of plant <b>protoplast</b> <b>cultures.</b> Investigations involving novel PFC-mediated oxygen delivery to cultured protoplasts were carried out on a broad range of plant species, which included Petunia hybrida (a herbaceous species) and Passiflora giberti (a woody species), as model systems, together with cassava (Manihot esculenta) a relatively recalcitrant species in tissue culture. Studies revealed enhanced protoplast initial plating efficiencies (IPEs) as measured by increased mitotic division, thereby demonstrating no short-term detrimental effects of exposure to PFC. Similarly, supplementation of culture media with Hb, at 1 : 50 (v/v), increased the mean IPEs of both Petunia and Passiflora protoplasts over that of untreated controls. Additionally, supplementation of aqueous medium with 0. 01...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum are phytopathogenic species causing scab {{and root}} rot {{diseases}} in all {{small grain cereals}} worldwide including Turkey. In this study, resistance levels to geneticin (G 418) of 14 F. graminearum and 24 F. culmorum isolates collected from cereals were determined. Fungal cultures were grown on potato dextrose agar medium supplemented with 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/mL of G 418. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined as 25 mg/ mL. As a result, {{it was concluded that}} all isolates were highly sensitive to G 418. Plasmid pFA 6 -kanmx 4 containing geneticin resistance gene (kanmx) was introduced singly or co-electroporated with pEGFP 75 plasmid, containing GFP gene, into fungal <b>protoplast</b> <b>cultures</b> obtained with lytic enzyme. Transformants were grown in media including 25 mg/mL G 418. Transformation frequencies were 2. 8 and 1. 8 transformant per mg plasmid for F. graminearum and F. culmorum isolates, respectively. Transformation process was also confirmed by spectrofluorimetric assay. Relative fluorescence unit values in co-transformants were calculated as 1. 87 § 0. 04 for F. graminearum and 2. 26 § 0. 08 for F. culmorum. The results obtained from the study gave information about antibiotic resistance levels of two Fusarium species in Turkey. Moreover, it was shown that pFA 6 -kanmx 4 plasmid was a suitable vector, which can be used in genetic manipulation studies of these two fungal species in particular suppression of endogenous and/or the expression of exogenous genes...|$|R
