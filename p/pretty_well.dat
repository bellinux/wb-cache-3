5|$|In {{a modern}} note {{written on a}} {{fly-leaf}} {{at the end of}} the book it is said that the author of the Chronicle was one Gregory Skinner (meaning William Gregory of the Skinners' Company) who was Mayor of London in 1451, the thirtieth year of Henry VI. And when we turn to the Chronicle itself the fact seems to be <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> borne out by what the author himself says in the record of that year.|$|E

25|$|Katedra - {{best known}} Lithuanian heavy metal band that formed in 1986 and year later {{became one of}} the most popular bands at the time. Its first record Mors Ultima Ratio got <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> known in Europe. Katedra's success ended in early 90's when singer Povilas Meškėla left the band, though the band is still active to this day.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic Republican Party (or the Democratic Party) and the Whig Party (which {{had been}} <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> {{destroyed}} after the 1852 elections) {{had been the}} major political parties in the United States. Corbett had been a Whig and follower of Henry Clay but when the Republican Party was founded on July 6, 1854, in Jackson, Michigan, {{he was one of}} its early and enthusiastic supporters. The Republican Party was founded as the anti-slavery party in opposition to the pro-slavery Democratic Party {{in one of the few}} fundamental reorganizations of the American political system.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} no {{medium-sized}} sedan bearing the Citroen name since the 1930s. The Citroën GS introduced in 1970 finally plugged that gap in the Citroen range, {{and in the process}} paid tribute to the Panhard heritage. The GS was an exceptionally aerodynamic, modern and spacious medium-sized sedan with a compact air-cooled four-cylinder boxer motor driving the front wheels. Apart from the number of cylinders, that description fits <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> with the car the Panhard 24 would have become had Panhard been permitted to build the range into a more direct replacement for the Panhard PL 17.|$|E
25|$|Explaining {{the origins}} of the law that one can see in the Cities of Refuge, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that early forms of legal {{procedure}} were grounded in vengeance. Roman law and German law started from the blood feud, which led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud was bought off. Holmes reported that in Anglo-Saxon practice, the feud was <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> broken up by the time of William the Conqueror. The killings and house-burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson, and then the legal actions now familiar to lawyers.|$|E

25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played <b>pretty</b> <b>well.</b> It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Harper's Conservatives {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} their new party into power in Canada. While continuing weaknesses in Quebec and urban areas rightfully prompted most observers {{to consider a}} Conservative majority government to be mathematically difficult to achieve, early on, Harper's stated goal was to achieve one nonetheless. Though the Conservatives were ahead of the Liberals in Quebec, they remained far behind the Bloc Québécois, and additional gains in rural and suburban Ontario would have been necessary to meet Stephen Harper's goal. The polls had remained <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> static {{over the course of}} December, with the real shift coming in {{the first few days of}} the New Year. That is when the Conservatives took the lead and kept it for the rest of the campaign.|$|E
25|$|The Vizier {{wanted and}} did {{everything}} he could to get Yahya executed. The Sultan prohibited his execution but approved only to deprive him from his offices, which Rüstem Pasha did in the most offensive manner. As a member of the askeri class, apparently he could not be left to starve. In order to escape persecution, Yahya went to exile back in the Balkans, without forgetting to write a satirical lament on Rustem Pasha after his death. There are divergences on the location where he was sent. According to some sources, he took over an fief near Zvornik in today's Bosnia and lived <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> afterwards receiving a 27,000 or 30,000 akçe annual income. Others point to Tamışvar, center of the Province of Temeşvar, where he for sure fought at a certain point. Though not young anymore, he took part together with his men at the siege of Szigetvar in 1565. There he wrote a qasida and presented it to Sultan Suleiman. After that, due to his age, he turned to Islamic Mysticism.|$|E

25|$|A {{version of}} Yo soy Betty, la fea made by Bosnian Federalna Televizija (FTV), Croatian RTL Televizija and Serbian Fox Televizija began airing in October 2007. The {{title of the}} show was Ne daj se, Nina ("Don't give up, Nina"). After a long audition, {{newcomer}} Lana Gojak, who resembles America Ferrera, was cast {{in the role of}} Nina (Betty). Other cast members were established actors such as Robert Kurbaša, Edvin Livarić, Bojana Ordinačev, Petar Ćiritović, Andrija Milošević, Kristina Krepela and Sloboda Mićalović. The first, and only, season consisted of just over 50 episodes. Although the storyline basically followed that of Yo soy Betty, la fea, Lana Gojak's appearance as Nina seemed to be based more on the heroine of Ugly Betty than on that of Yo soy Betty, la fea. The series had a number of other elements that were directly borrowed from Ugly Betty, rather than from Yo soy Betty, la fea. The series did <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> in the ratings, but was too expensive to produce, so a second season was never ordered.|$|E
25|$|Super 8s {{has gone}} <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> for Sri Lankans, with their performances, only lost to South Africa and Australia. In the first Super 8 match for Sri Lanka vs South Africa, Malinga {{became the first}} bowler to take four wickets with four {{consecutive}} deliveries in international cricket. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat, and lost their first five wickets for 98, with Charl Langeveldt taking two in his first spell. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Russel Arnold built a sixth-wicket stand of 97 in nearly 20 overs, but Dilshan was caught off Makhaya Ntini's bowling, and then Langeveldt took 3 in 5 balls as Sri Lanka were bowled out in the final over for 209. In reply, Vaas had AB de Villiers bowled in the first over, but Jacques Kallis added 95 with Graeme Smith and 65 with Herschelle Gibbs, leading South Africa to within four runs of victory with his 86. Then Lasith Malinga struck and show begun. His four-in-four had Shaun Pollock, Andrew Hall, Kallis and Ntini. Though South Africa managed a run off Vaas in the intermediate over. South Africa now needed three runs to win with one wicket in hand, and eleven deliveries went by before Robin Peterson got an outside edge to a Malinga ball, which went {{out of reach of}} slip and went fine for four. South Africa won the match by only 1 wicket, in a very tied game. With this feat, Lasith Malinga became the only bowler to get four consecutive wickets in four balls in any form of the game.|$|E
25|$|The last group {{match was}} a thrilling {{match for the}} both teams, where Sri Lanka came as the {{favorites}} to win the match. Skipper Chandimal was out of play due to some injuries, so Lasith Malinga captained the match. By batting first, Sri Lanka scored only 119 all out, Mahela scored 25 runs as the best batsman. Blackcaps came to the crease as the favorites to win the match, because 120 is not a huge task at all to them as smashers - Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, and Corey Anderson. During the match, Anderson was injured and so New Zealand played with only 10 players in batting. New Zealand started <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> with Guptill and Kane Williamson. At this time, Malinga decided to go with Rangana Herath, who turned the match in nowhere. Herath ball Guptill and he lunges forward to push to mid-on. Sets off for a single straight away but his partner {{is not at all}} interested. The bowler is wise to the mistake, rushes across to his right and cuts the ball in its path and sends in a rocket throw and Sangakkara whips the bails off. After this run-out, it wall all Herath. he stumped skipper McCullum, then caught Ross Taylor to lbw. Next, Herath bowled James Neesham in first ball he faced. He then captured Luke Ronchi for lbw, and New Zealand were never in the game. Finally New Zealand all out for just 60 runs, which is the lowest score by a test playing nation in Twenty20 Internationals. Herath finished with 5 wickets for 3 runs, earned him Man-of-the-match. With this win, Sri Lanka moved their fourth consecutive World T20 semi-finals.|$|E

His name was changed after a Baptist preacher visited Jennings's parents and congratulated his mother for naming {{him after the}} Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas. Lorene Jennings, who had been unaware of the college, changed the spelling to Waylon. Jennings later expressed in his autobiography, [...] "I didn't like Waylon.

He finished with 1.5 tackles for loss. Cody worked out at API in Pensacola, Florida, along with Sam Bradford, Jason Worilds, and former Alabama teammates Mike Johnson and Roy Upchurch.

500|$|The AI in {{the game}} was also {{the subject of much}} commentary. [...] Reviewers said they needed to prompt the allied non-player {{characters}} to perform actions on several occasions, although the allied AI performed <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> most of the time. FiringSquad disagreed, calling their computer controlled teammates worthless and finding joy in leaving them to their deaths. The game review site thought the same of the enemy AI, a view echoed by IGN; enemies were unaware of the deaths of nearby teammates, and kept running into obstacles. ActionTrip, however, stated the enemy AI did well enough to take cover or flee when hurt, and constantly attack the player's base.|$|E

[...] Kuhl wrote to his parents about the incident, but asked them to [...] "just forget about it."

500|$|Although Shields feared a {{critical}} panning, reviews of Loveless were almost unanimously favourable. [...] "An album without parallel", wrote Andrew Perry in Select. [...] "Its creative inspiration defies belief. Though 'To Here Knows When' is <b>pretty</b> <b>well</b> the weirdest {{track of the}} eleven, that glorious distortion gives a fair signal of what to expect – the unexpected. Everything you hear confounds your idea of how a pop song should be played, arranged and produced." [...] "The instrumental 'Touched' is especially startling", noted Martin Aston in Q, [...] "like a drunken fight between a syrupy Disney soundtrack and an Eastern mantra. All in all, Loveless amounts to a virtual reinvention of the guitar." ...|$|E
