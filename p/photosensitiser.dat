These reactive photochemical intermediates are generated in what are known as Type I, Type II, and Type III processes, respectively. These various alternative processes and reactions can be controlled by choice of specific reaction conditions, leading {{to a wide range of}} different products. A common example is the -cycloaddition of singlet oxygen with a diene such as cyclopentadiene to yield an endoperoxide: ...|$|E
50|$|PDT is a {{multi-stage}} process. First a <b>photosensitiser</b> with negligible dark toxicity is administered, either systemically or topically, in {{the absence}} of light. When a sufficient amount of <b>photosensitiser</b> appears in diseased tissue, the <b>photosensitiser</b> is activated by exposure to light for a specified period. The light dose supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the <b>photosensitiser,</b> but not enough to damage neighbouring healthy tissue. The reactive oxygen kills the target cells.|$|E
50|$|Type-II {{processes}} {{involve the}} direct {{interaction of the}} excited triplet state <b>photosensitiser</b> (3Psen*) with ground state molecular oxygen (3O2, 3Σg); a spin allowed transition—the excited state <b>photosensitiser</b> and ground state molecular oxygen are of the same spin state (T).|$|E
5000|$|Photofrin had the {{disadvantages}} of prolonged patient photosensitivity and a weak long-wavelength absorption (630 nm). This {{led to the}} development of second generation <b>photosensitisers,</b> including Verteporfin (a benzoporphyrin derivative, also known as Visudyne) and more recently, third generation targetable <b>photosensitisers,</b> such as antibody-directed <b>photosensitisers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction â�� Photodynamic {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} modality that involves siteâ��directed generation of cytotoxic {{reactive oxygen species}} by lightâ��activated <b>photosensitisers.</b> Objective â�� In order to rapidly identify new <b>photosensitisers</b> from natural extracts, we developed a liquid chromatographyâ��photodiode arrayâ��mass spectrometry (LCâ��PDAâ��MS) method to rapidly identify plant extracts that contain <b>photosensitisers,</b> particularly those possessing a cyclic tetrapyrrole structure. Method â�� Six previously isolated compounds (1 â�� 6) were identified in bioactive fractions derived from 15 plant extracts {{on the basis of}} their chromatographic retention times, UVâ��visible profiles, accurate mass and fragmentation patterns. Results â�� Samples containing uncommon <b>photosensitisers</b> were rapidly identified using this method, and subsequent scaleâ��up isolation efforts led to two new compounds (7 and 8) which were confirmed to be active <b>photosensitisers</b> in a photoâ��cytotoxicity assay. Conclusion â�� This method serves as a useful tool in prioritising samples that may contain new <b>photosensitisers</b> out of a larger group of photoâ��cytotoxic natural products extracts.

50|$|While the {{disadvantages}} associated with first generation <b>photosensitisers</b> HpD and Photofrin (skin sensitivity and weak absorption at 630 nm) permitted some therapeutic use, they markedly reduced application {{to a wider}} field of disease. Second generation <b>photosensitisers</b> were key {{to the development of}} photodynamic therapy.|$|R
50|$|Excited triplet-state photosensitisers {{can react}} via Type-I and Type-II {{processes}}. Type-I processes can involve the excited singlet or triplet <b>photosensitiser</b> (1Psen*, S1; 3Psen*, T1), however {{due to the}} short lifetime of the excited singlet state, the <b>photosensitiser</b> can only react if it is intimately associated with a substrate. In both cases the interaction is with readily oxidisable or reducible substrates. Type-II processes involve the direct interaction of the excited triplet <b>photosensitiser</b> (3Psen*, T1) with molecular oxygen (3O2, 3Σg).|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of Type-II processes {{is dependent upon}} the triplet state lifetime τT and the triplet quantum yield (ΦT) of the <b>photosensitiser.</b> Both of these parameters have been implicated in phototherapeutic effectiveness; further supporting the distinction between Type-I and Type-II mechanisms. However, {{the success of a}} <b>photosensitiser</b> is not exclusively dependent upon a Type-II process. Multiple photosensitisers display excited triplet lifetimes that are too short to permit a Type-II process to occur. For example, the copper metallated octaethylbenzochlorin <b>photosensitiser</b> has a triplet state lifetime of less than 20 nanoseconds and is still deemed to be an efficient photodynamic agent.|$|E

50|$|<b>Photosensitisers</b> {{are a key}} {{component}} of photodynamic therapy used to treat cancers.|$|R
50|$|ALA accumulates {{more rapidly}} in {{comparison}} to other intravenously administered sensitisers. Typical peak tumour accumulation levels post-administration for PPIX are usually achieved within several hours; other (intravenous) <b>photosensitisers</b> may take up to 96 hours to reach peak levels. ALA is also excreted more rapidly from the body (∼24 hours) than other <b>photosensitisers,</b> minimising photosensitivity side effects.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>photosensitisers</b> {{are poorly}} soluble in aqueous media, {{particularly}} at physiological pH, limiting their use.|$|R
50|$|Haem is {{synthesised}} {{in every}} energy-producing {{cell in the}} body and is a key structural component of haemoglobin, myoglobin and other haemproteins. The immediate precursor to haem is protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), an effective <b>photosensitiser.</b> Haem itself is not a <b>photosensitiser,</b> due to the coordination of a paramagnetic ion in the centre of the macrocycle, causing significant reduction in excited state lifetimes.|$|E

50|$|Foscan has a {{singlet oxygen}} quantum yield {{comparable}} to other chlorin <b>photosensitisers</b> but lower drug and light doses (approximately 100 times more photoactive than Photofrin).|$|R
50|$|Another {{alternative}} {{that does not}} display the scattering problem {{is the use of}} moieties. Strategies include directly attaching <b>photosensitisers</b> to biologically active molecules such as antibodies.|$|R
50|$|To allow {{treatment}} of deeper tumours some researchers are using internal chemiluminescence {{to activate the}} <b>photosensitiser.</b>|$|E
50|$|Type-I {{processes}} can {{be divided}} into Type I(i) and Type I(ii). Type I (i) involves the transfer of an electron (oxidation) from a substrate molecule to the excited state <b>photosensitiser</b> (Psen*), generating a <b>photosensitiser</b> radical anion (Psen•−) and a substrate radical cation (Subs•+). The majority of the radicals produced from Type-I(i) reactions react instantaneously with oxygen, generating a mixture of oxygen intermediates. For example, the <b>photosensitiser</b> radical anion can react instantaneously with molecular oxygen (3O2) to generate a superoxide radical anion (O2•−), which can go on to produce the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH•), initiating a cascade of cytotoxic free radicals; this process is common in the oxidative damage of fatty acids and other lipids.|$|E

5000|$|Cytoluminescent Therapy is a {{proposed}} cancer treatment {{as a form}} of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) characterized by a <b>photosensitiser</b> that is supposedly eliminated from normal tissue but selectively accumulated in neoplastic and dysplastic tissue. This is followed by whole body irradiation with light of the specific wave length which activates the <b>photosensitiser.</b> The result is supposed to be selective damage or elimination of tumor cells while normal tissues are unharmed. However, tests as of 2003 did not show any positive clinical effects in a group of 48 patients treated in this way.|$|E

Results The ethanolic extract of the leaves from Phaeanthus ophtalmicus was able to reduce the in vitro viability of leukaemic HL 60 cells to 2 of a broad spectrum light at a concentration of 20 μg/mL.
