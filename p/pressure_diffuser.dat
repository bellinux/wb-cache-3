40|$|Palladium-silver (Pd-Ag) {{diffusers}} are mainstays {{of hydrogen}} processing. Diffusers separate hydrogen from inert {{species such as}} nitrogen, argon or helium. The tubing becomes permeable to hydrogen when heated to more than 250 C and a differential pressure is created across the membrane. The hydrogen diffuses better at higher temperatures. Experimental or experiential results have been the basis for determining or predicting a diffuser's performance. However, the process can be mathematically modeled, and comparison to experimental or other operating data can be utilized to improve the fit of the model. A reliable model-based diffuser system design is the goal which will have impacts on tritium and hydrogen processing. A computer model has been developed to solve the differential equations for diffusion given the operating boundary conditions. The model was compared to operating data for a low <b>pressure</b> <b>diffuser</b> system. The modeling approach {{and the results are}} presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|A {{high-speed}} jet flowing {{inside of}} a partially-open hydraulic valve {{is accompanied by a}} reaction force, also referred to as flow force. The nature of this force has remained a mystery despite an extensive research effort spanning many decades. The momentum theory on the flow force by Lee and Blackburn (1952) explains the origin of the flow force and offers a design solution to shape the valve spool as a turbine bucket. It provides a model to calculate the compensated flow force as well. This paper shows that the model applies to a different flow case due to incorrect assumptions made. A corrected equation is presented based on a detailed analysis of the static-pressure distribution in the valve cavity as well as on a literature review of <b>pressure</b> loss in <b>diffusers</b> and nozzles. The new equation is based on the compensation taking place upstream of the valve orifice, not downstream as assumed by the momentum theory. The new model can be applied to chamfers or notches on the valve spool without the need to machine a complete turbine-bucket profile.

40|$|This {{research}} {{characterizes the}} performance of a centrifugal compressor stage with a special focus on the pipe diffuser. Two diffuser configurations are studied, one of which is a truncated version of the other. Experimental data acquired on a research compressor stage is interrogated along with a set of well-designed Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes computations, complemented by reduced order flow modeling. The fundamental performance-limiting flow mechanisms in the diffuser are identified and used to physically relate important geometry features and operating conditions to the observed compressor pressure rise, efficiency, and operability characteristics. Despite large differences in their geometry, the two diffuser configurations exhibit similar pressure recovery characteristics due to differences in exit nonuniformity and flow angle which result in similar effective area ratios. Variations in the <b>diffuser</b> <b>pressure</b> recovery coefficient with operating point are found to be most influenced by the diffuser inlet flow angle, and secondly by the inlet Mach number. The diffuser inlet flow angle has the primary effect of setting the diffuser inlet one-dimensional area ratio, increasing diffusion at high flow angles. In addition, the diffuser incidence angle influences the formation of counter-rotating vortex pairs that persist throughout the diffuser passage. Using a two-dimensional integral boundary layer model that is modified to accommodate three-dimensional effects as source terms, these secondary flows are shown to detrimentally impact the <b>diffuser</b> <b>pressure</b> rise capability by accumulating high loss flow along the diffuser wall near the plane of symmetry between the vortices. This contributes to the extent and location of a large diffuser passage separation, especially for the baseline diffuser. The impact of the vortices on the boundary layer growth rate is shown to scale inversely with diffuser aspect ratio. The major performance difference between the two diffuser configurations is that the truncated diffuser configuration experiences enhanced stall margin over the baseline diffuser at the design speed. These differences are traced to reduced secondary flows influence and thus reduced separation extent for the higher aspect ratio truncated diffuser. It is hypothesized that the onset of stall for the baseline diffuser configuration is initiated by the transition of the vortex location and corresponding passage separation between <b>diffuser</b> <b>pressure</b> and suction sides with increasing cusp incidence. Conversely, because the extent of the passage separation in the truncated diffuser is diminished due to the higher aspect ratio, the switch in separation side does not immediately initiate instability. The fact that secondary flows have a large influence on <b>diffuser</b> <b>pressure</b> rise capability and compressor stability is counter to conventional preliminary diffuser design approaches which neglect such 3 D effects. The findings of this research may therefore be considered during preliminary design optimization to produce better-performing diffuser designs. by David W. Erickson. Thesis: S.

40|$|This paper aims to {{highlight}} {{the importance of the}} accurate computational modelling of both the inlet and outlet exhaust hood boundary conditions. The computations presented are calculated using the public domain low <b>pressure</b> exhaust <b>diffuser</b> test case proposed by Burton in 2012. The original test case did not include the effect of tip leakage on diffuser flows, but this paper describes the inclusion of tip leakage and the results are shown to be in line with the outputs produced by other authors. The key advance in this paper is that calculations were conducted with a representative condenser pressure gradient caused by the temperature variation inside the condenser tube nest. It is shown that accurately modelling the exit boundary calculation has a large influence on the flow structure and a smaller influence on the pressure recovery inside the exhaust diffuser. This influence is smaller than that seen by other authors when including unsteady effects or accounting for the circumferential non-uniformity of the turbine exit flow but will need to be included in design calculations as diffuser design advances...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} inlet {{conditions}} {{on the performance of}} conical diffusers is considered. The conditions at inlet which were independently varied are the cross-sectional time-meaned velocity distribution and the associated stream turbulence variation. The investigation formed part of a research programme on interaction effects between pipe and duct components. Sources of data on the effect of such variants include Kline, Winternitz, Livesey, Miller and Cockrell amongst others. Whereas these persons considered the symmetrical profile developments accompanying varying inlet pipe lengths and Reynolds numbers, Tyler and Williamson examined the effects of distorted time-mean velocity profiles at inlet. A very limited amount of experimental work has been published by Kline et al on the effect of varying the free stream turbulence intensity at the diffuser inlet when the associated boundary layer thickness is small. The thesis considers this previous work, then describes the development of a turbulence generator with which a mean velocity distribution, barely distinguishable from fully-developed flow is obtained in a few pipe diamters. This mean velocity is accompanied by a turbulence intensity which is capable of being increased up to three times that normally associated with fully-developed flow. Conical diffusers were mounted downstream of the turbulence generator and pressure recovery characteristics over a wide range of expansion angle and area ratio were obtained. In general the results show a significant increase in pressure recovery over values associated with normal fully-developed inlet flow. An integral computational method is developed for ducts, pipes and conical diffusers which leads to successful predictions of boundary layer growth and <b>diffuser</b> <b>pressure</b> recovery {{for a wide variety of}} inlet boundary layer thicknesses. Possible extensions of this method to admit inlet turbulence level as a parameter which influences <b>diffuser</b> <b>pressure</b> recovery are considered.
