40|$|As the {{photovoltaics}} (PV) {{industry has}} grown, {{the need for}} accurately monitoring the solar resource of PV power plants has increased. Historically, the PV industry has relied on thermopile <b>pyranometers</b> for irradiance measurements, and {{a large body of}} historical irradiance data taken with <b>pyranometers</b> exists. However, interest in PV reference devices is increasing. In this paper, we discuss why PV reference devices are better suited for PV applications, and estimate the typical uncertainties in irradiance measurements made with both <b>pyranometers</b> and PV reference devices. We assert that the quantity of interest in monitoring a PV power plant is the equivalent irradiance under the IEC 60904 - 3 reference solar spectrum that would produce the same electrical response in the PV array as the incident solar radiation. For PV-plant monitoring applications, we find the uncertainties in irradiance measurements of this type to be on the order of +/- 5 % for thermopile <b>pyranometers</b> and +/- 2. 4 % for PV reference devices...|$|R

50|$|The light sensitivity, {{known as}} ''''{{spectral}} response'''', {{depends on the}} type of <b>pyranometer.</b> The figure to the right shows the spectral responses of the three types of <b>pyranometer</b> in relation to the Solar Radiation Spectrum. The Solar Radiation Spectrum represents the spectrum of sunlight that reaches the Earth’s surface at sea level, at midday with A.M. (air mass) = 1.5.The latitude and altitude influence this spectrum. The spectrum is influenced also by aerosol and pollution.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} a silicon <b>pyranometer</b> in the ISO 9060, a photodiode-based <b>pyranometer</b> can detect {{the portion of the}} solar {{spectrum}} between 400 nm and 900 nm, with the most performant detecting between 350 nm and 1100 nm. The photodiode converts the aforementioned solar spectrum frequencies into current at high speed, thanks to the photoelectric effect.

50|$|A glass dome. It {{limits the}} {{spectral}} response from 300 to 2,800 nanometers (cutting off the part above 2,800 nm), while preserving the 180° field of view. It also shields the thermopile sensor from convection. For first class and secondary standard <b>pyranometers</b> (see ISO 9060 classification of thermopile <b>pyranometers)</b> a second glass dome is used. This construction provides an additional “radiation shield”, {{resulting in a}} better thermal equilibrium between the sensor and inner dome, compared to using a single dome. The effect of having a second dome is a strong reduction of instrument offsets.|$|R

In net radiometers, shortwave radiation is measured with <b>pyranometers</b> which measure incoming shortwave radiation and reflected shortwave radiation (albedo), and longwave radiation is measured with pyrgeometers. The working range of <b>pyranometers</b> is 300 to 2800 nm wavelength and that of pyrgeometers is 4500 to 100000 nm wavelength.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{feasibility}} of using <b>pyranometers</b> for continuous estimation of ground cover fraction (GCF) at remote, unattended sites. Photographical techniques were used for measuring GCF (GCF ref) at a table grape vineyard grown under a net. Daily pyranometer-driven GCF estimates (GCF pyr) were obtained from solar radiation measurements {{above and below the}} canopy. For GCF pyr computation, solar radiation was averaged for two hours around solar noon (midday periods) and for daylight periods (8 : 00 to 18 : 00 Universal Time Coordinated). GCF pyr and GCF ref (daylight periods) showed a good agreement: mean estimation error, 0. 000; root mean square error, 0. 113; index of agreement, 0. 967. The high GCF attained, the large measurement range for GCF and the presence of the net above the table grape were the likely reasons for the good performance of GCF pyr in this crop despite the short number of <b>pyranometers</b> used. Further research is required to develop more appropriate calibration equations of GCF pyr and for a more detailed evaluation of using a short number of <b>pyranometers</b> to estimate GCF. </p...|$|R
