40|$|The {{unconfined}} aquifer of the Belgian {{coastal plain}} consists mainly of quaternary sands which are intercalated by peat and in lesser extent clay layers. These quaternary deposits are approximately maximum 30 m thick and are situated above Tertiary clay, sandy clay and sand, dipping gently in north-eastern direction. The intercalated <b>peat</b> <b>layers,</b> {{the so called}} surface peat, influence importantly the ground water flow and the water quality distribution. During the Dunkirkian, salt water infiltrated the aquifer. Later replacement by fresh water is highly influenced by {{the distribution of the}} intercalated <b>peat</b> <b>layers.</b> This water quality distribution and the relation with the location of the <b>peat</b> <b>layers</b> are considered here by reevaluating data gathered extensively in the past and is supplemented by new observations...|$|R

2500|$|On 6 May 1950, {{brothers}} Viggo and Emil {{from the}} small village of Tollund on the Jutland peninsula were cutting peat in the Bjældskovdal peat bog, [...] west of Silkeborg, Denmark. As they worked, one of their wives, who was helping to load the peat on a carriage, noticed a corpse in the <b>peat</b> <b>layer.</b> It appeared so fresh that the workers believed they had discovered a recent murder victim. After much deliberation, the woman notified the police in Silkeborg. The find was reported to the police on Tuesday 8 May 1950. They were baffled by {{the condition of the}} body and, in an attempt to identify the time of death, they brought in archaeology professor P. V. Glob. Upon initial examination, Glob suggested that the body was over 2,000 years old and most likely the victim of a ritual sacrifice.|$|E
2500|$|Soil borings in {{the area}} of the 17th Street Canal breach showed a layer of peat {{starting}} at about [...] below the surface, and ranging from about [...] to [...] thick. Engineers misjudged the strength of the peat which is from the remains of the swamp on which some areas of New Orleans (near Lake Ponchartrain) in the 20th century were built. The shear strength of this peat was found to be very low and it had a high water content. According to Robert Bea, a geotechnical engineer from the University of California, Berkeley, the weak soil made the floodwall very vulnerable to the stresses of a large flood. [...] "At 17th Street, the soil moved laterally, pushing entire wall sections with it.... As Katrina's storm surge filled the canal, water pressure rose in the soil underneath the wall and in the <b>peat</b> <b>layer.</b> Water moved through the soil underneath the base of the wall. When the rising pressure and moving water overcame the soil's strength, it suddenly shifted, taking surrounding material– and the wall– with it." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{characteristics}} of the major and trace element accumulation in fen peat of two minerotrophic mires located in depressions of the Austrumkursa Highland. Concentration of the 13 elements and their occurrence in fen peat was determined by using atomic absorption spectrometry.

The upper <b>layers</b> of the <b>peat</b> profile show predominantly anthropogenic impacts and precipitation effects, while characteristics of the lower layers indicate groundwater flow/saturation effects.

40|$|Indicators {{are needed}} to check whether {{policies}} on protection of groundwater are effective and if regulations are complied with. We evaluated various indicators at different scales, both in space and in time, and at different degrees of complexity. Groundwater was sampled on 34 arable farms for 3 years. Nitrate concentration in upper groundwater was low on clay soil. On sandy soil, <b>peat</b> <b>layers</b> reduced the nitrate concentration with about 80 mg/l on average. Sandy soils with high groundwater tables had nitrate concentrations that were {{less than half of}} those at sandy soils with low groundwater tables. The relationship between different fertilization variables and nitrate in groundwater was investigated for sandy soils without <b>peat</b> <b>layers.</b> N surplus poorly correlated with nitrate concentrations in groundwater when individual sampling points were studied, but clearly increased when data were averaged at the farm level. Soil mineral nitrogen correlated best with nitrate concentrations in groundwater.

In this study, fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) {{was applied}} to assess the abundance and depth distribution of these bacteria in nine different acidic wetlands of Northern Russia.

50|$|Genuine ombrotrophic bogs on the North German Plain {{are usually}} sharply {{divided into two}} layers: an {{underlying}} black <b>peat</b> <b>layer,</b> which is strongly decomposed, and an overlying white <b>peat</b> <b>layer</b> which is less decomposed. This difference {{is a result of}} changes in the hydrology of the bog. The white peat grew more rapidly under humid conditions than the black peat. This is attributed to a climate change with high precipitation and low evaporation around 1000 to 500 BC. As a result, the peat moss growth grew locally and the black peat/white peat boundary layer was formed, although this did not develop simultaneously in all raised bogs.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTPeatlands {{consist of}} {{hundreds}} of gigatons of soil carbon storage. Once a peatland is drained, however, it {{is transformed into a}} carbon source, since better aerated conditions promote the aerobic microbial decomposition of the <b>peat</b> soil <b>layers.</b> Since the aerobic depth should depend on the balance between the capability of the <b>peat</b> <b>layers</b> to transport the O 2 and the intensity of the O 2 consumption by aerobic microbes, our aim {{in the present study was}} to characterize the soil gas diffusivity (Ds/D 0) and the soil water retention curves (SWRCs) of two types of peat soils found in sub-boreal and tropical peatlands. We also numerically simulated the effects of Ds/D 0 and SWRCs on the aerobic depth into which the atmospheric O 2 can penetrate in unsaturated <b>peat</b> <b>layers</b> with various groundwater table levels. For the numerical simulations, we modified the Millington-Quirk-type Ds/D 0 model, while the O 2 consumptive behavior in the <b>peat</b> <b>layers</b> was described by the Monod-type equation. The Ds/D 0, as a function of the air-filled porosity, was consistently larger for the tropical-peat samples than for the sub-boreal ones, implying that the tropical-peat samples had less tortuous pore geometry than the sub-boreal ones. However, the features of the SWRCs indicated that the tropical-peat samples showed higher water retentivity than the sub-boreal ones; and therefore, lowering the groundwater table would not raise the air-filled porosity of the tropical-peat samples more than that of the sub-boreal ones. Through numerical simulations contrasting the features of the Ds/D 0 and the SWRC curves for the tropical-peat samples with those of the sub-boreal ones, unsaturated anaerobic layers were seen to form more easily in the simulations representing the tropical-peat samples than in those representing the sub-boreal ones, suggesting high water retentivity. In turn, the difficulty in aeration inhibited the gaseous diffusion in the tropical-peat soils even though the Ds/D 0 values for the tropical-peat samples were higher than those for the sub-boreal ones for a series of air-filled porosity. Furthermore, the development of unsaturated anaerobic layers caused a “ceiling” for the increase in the surface CO 2 emission rate associated with the fall in the groundwater table...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry (KTM) peat is {{determined}} in Finland as [...] "slowly renewable biomass fuel". The definition {{is from the}} report: Patrick Crill (USA), Ken Hargreaves (UK) and Mr. Atte Korhola (FIN) Turpeen asema Suomen kasvihuonekaasutaseissa (2000) ordered by KTM. This report has been criticised by several scientists. For example, environment experts and university academics Mr. Raimo Heikkilä (Oulu), Mr. Tapio Lindholm (Helsinki) and Mr. Heikki Simola (Joensuu) wrote an opponent review in 2007. In short: The use of peat fuel releases carbon that was bound long before the industrial revolution. The renewal of <b>peat</b> <b>layers</b> in thousands of years is insignificant compared to the carbon emissions of the peat fuel {{in regard to the}} climate change. It is highly questionable to claim that the human created problem would be compensated by a natural process elsewhere. For the greenhouse gas inventories the natural peat lands are basically neutral since storage of carbon equals release of methane. The agricultural land use will never restore the carbon permanently in the ecosystem equal to the original <b>peat</b> <b>layers.</b> There is no difference in the burning of peat or coal in respect to the climate warming.|$|R
