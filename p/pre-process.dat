50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, the {{increasing}} use of <b>pre-processed</b> ingredients - such as artificial flavorings, emulsifiers, and preservatives - further broadened the scope of kosher certification.

According to a 2013 estimate, the 135,000 food products then certified kosher contained more than one million food additives. Certification agencies regularly send mashgichim to factories in China, Thailand, and the Philippines to oversee the production of <b>pre-processed</b> ingredients and ensure their kosher status.

40|$|Abstract-The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the impact of various pre-processing models on the forecast capability of artificial neural network (ANN) when auditing financial accounts. Hence, the focus of this paper is on the pre-processing of the data. ANNs are selected for auditing purposes because they are capable of learning complex, non-linear underlying relationships. Therefore, they are used to model the dynamics and the relationships between account values in order to find unexpected fluctuations. This study uses a multi-layered neural network with the backpropagation algorithm. The artificial neural network model used in this study was built by using the financial statements of 31 manufacturing companies over four years. The values of the accounts were regarded as a time-series. The data were <b>pre-processed</b> in four different ways. Firstly, all the data were scaled linearly. Secondly, the data were <b>pre-processed</b> linearly on a yearly basis. Thirdly, the data were <b>pre-processed</b> linearly on a company basis.

40|$|Abstract—Incorporating multi-resolution {{capabilities}} into im-agers renders additional {{power saving}} mechanisms in the subse-quent image processing. In this paper, we show how, by exploiting a certain mask structure, 3 3 kernels {{can be reduced}} to 2 2 kernels if charge redistribution is provided at the focal plane of the imaging device. More precisely, by successively averaging two shifted half-resolution pixel grids, we will have a <b>pre-processed</b> image, subsampled by a factor of 2 on each dimension. It can also be extended to even lower resolution images if required. These <b>pre-processed</b> images can be filtered, for kernels matching the prescribed conditions, with a mask of a reduced size. Very useful image filtering kernels, like a 3 3 Gaussian kernel for image smoothing, or the well-known Sobel operators, fall into this category of reducible kernels. Operating onto the <b>pre-processed</b> image with one of these reduced kernels represents a smaller number of operations per pixel than realizing all the multiply-accumulate operations needed to apply a 3 3 kernel. Memory accesses are reduced in the same fraction. Concerning the difficulties of providing this <b>pre-processed</b> image representation, we propose a methodology for obtaining it at a very low power cost. It requires the implementation of user definable image subdivision and subsampling. Experimental results are given, obtained from measurements on a CMOS imager prototype chip incorporating these multi-resolution capabilities. I...|$|R
