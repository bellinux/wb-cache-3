50|$|During the Cold War, NATO land {{forces in}} what was {{designated}} the Central Region (most of the Federal Republic of Germany) would have been commanded in wartime by two 'army groups'. Under Allied Forces Central Europe and alongside air force elements, the two army groups would {{have been responsible for}} the defence of Germany against any Soviet/Warsaw Pact invasion. These two <b>principal</b> <b>subordinate</b> <b>commanders</b> had only limited peacetime authorities, and issues such as training, doctrine, logistics, and rules of engagement were largely a national, rather than NATO, responsibility.|$|E
50|$|NATO's {{military}} operations are {{directed by the}} Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, and split into two Strategic Commands long both commanded by U.S. officers, assisted by a staff drawn from across NATO. The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the NATO Military Committee for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of command. The Strategic Commanders are the former 'Major NATO Commanders', who sat atop a command hierarchy consisting of Major Subordinate Commanders (MSCs), <b>Principal</b> <b>Subordinate</b> <b>Commanders</b> (PSCs) and Sub-PSCs. The Military Committee had an executive body, the Standing Group, made up of representatives from France, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The Standing Group was abolished during the major reform of 1967 that resulted from France’s departure from the NATO Military Command Structure.|$|E

50|$|Commander Iberian Atlantic Area was {{eventually}} established in 1967 as a <b>Principal</b> <b>Subordinate</b> <b>Commander</b> (PSC), reporting to CINCWESTLANT. The commander was a U.S. Navy rear admiral who {{also served as}} chief of the Military Assistance and Advisory Group in Lisbon. In 1975 IBERLANT was described as 'probably of greater symbolic value to Portugal than of military value to NATO' in internal cables of the U.S. Department of State. In 1981 the command included the Island Command Madeira. In 1982 NATO agreed to the upgrading of IBERLANT into a Major Subordinate Command (MSC), becoming Commander-in-Chief Iberian Atlantic Area (CINCIBERLANT). A Portuguese Navy Vice Admiral, dual-hatted as the fleet commander, took over the position. It was planned that Commander, Portuguese Air (COMPOAIR), a sub-PSC, would eventually {{take responsibility for the}} air defence of Portugal, reporting through CINCIBERLANT to SACEUR. Thus the Portuguese mainland would be 'associated' with Allied Command Europe.|$|R
50|$|Pezza {{had already}} {{organized}} {{a small band}} of irregulars {{in the northern part of}} the Terra di Lavoro, and soon became one of Ruffo's <b>principal</b> <b>subordinate</b> <b>commanders.</b> His massa ("band") quickly grew to some 4,000 men, including his three brothers and the scions of a number of the leading families of Itri, such as Pasquale-Maria Nofi, who served as his adjutant with the rank of lieutenant. With these men, he raided French outposts far and wide. On one occasion he slipped into heavily occupied Fondi in the guise of a priest — thus becoming once again “Fra Diavolo” — to cut down the “Liberty Tree” which the French had planted there, replacing it with a cross that still stands. He even harassed French forces holding Gaeta, the great fortress dominating the northwestern route into the Kingdom of Naples, ambushing supply trains (he once made off with 1,400 sheep) and couriers. Pezza made the Fortino di San Andrea his base of operations, and spread terror against French supporters over a wide area. He soon had a substantial price on his head.|$|E
