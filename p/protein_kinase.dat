The average patient with {{type 2 diabetes}} has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third. The molecular mechanism of metformin is incompletely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed, including; inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> A (PKA), inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and an effect on gut microbiota.|$|E
5|$|In drug design it is {{important}} to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to adenosine triphosphate, one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.|$|E

Their diversity and their role in signaling makes them an interesting object of study. Various other kinases act on small molecules such as lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleotides, either for signaling or to prime them for metabolic pathways. Specific kinases are often named after their substrates. <b>Protein</b> <b>kinases</b> often have multiple substrates, and proteins can serve as substrates for more than one specific kinase.

Well-conserved and lineage-specific <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> have previously been identified from various completely sequenced genomes of eukaryotes. The current work describes a genome-wide analysis for <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> encoded in the Plasmodium falciparum genome. Using a few different profile matching methods, we have identified 99 <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> or related <b>proteins</b> in the parasite genome. We have classified these kinases into subfamilies and analyzed them {{in the context of}} noncatalytic domains that occur in these catalytic <b>kinase</b> domain-containing <b>proteins.</b> Compared to most eukaryotic <b>protein</b> <b>kinases,</b> these sequences vary significantly in terms of their lengths, inserts in catalytic domains, and co-occurring domains. Catalytic and noncatalytic domains contain long stretches of repeats of positively charged and other polar amino acids.
