5|$|With Floyd's arrival to take {{command of}} Fort Donelson, Pillow took over leading the Confederate left. Feeling overwhelmed, Floyd left {{most of the}} actual command to <b>Pillow</b> <b>and</b> Buckner. At {{the end of the}} day, there had been several skirmishes, but the {{positions}} of each side were essentially the same. The night progressed with both sides fighting the cold weather.|$|E
5|$|After Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant {{captured}} Fort Henry on the Tennessee River in February 1862, {{he turned}} his sights on nearby Fort Donelson on the Cumberland. Western Theater commander Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston sent Buckner {{to be one of}} four brigadier generals defending the fort. In overall command was the influential politician and military novice John B. Floyd; Buckner's peers were Gideon J. <b>Pillow</b> <b>and</b> Bushrod Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} morning attack, {{access to an}} open escape route, and to the amazement of Floyd and Buckner, Pillow ordered his men back to their trenches by 1:30p.m. Buckner confronted <b>Pillow,</b> <b>and</b> Floyd intended to countermand the order, but Pillow argued that his men needed to regroup and resupply before evacuating the fort. Pillow won the argument. Floyd also believed that C. F. Smith's division was being heavily reinforced, so the entire Confederate force was ordered back inside the lines of Fort Donelson, giving up the ground they gained earlier that day.|$|E

5|$|Late {{that night}} the generals held a council of war in which Floyd and Pillow {{expressed}} satisfaction with {{the events of the}} day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for treason if captured by the North, sought Buckner's assurance that he would be given time to escape with some of his Virginia regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. <b>Pillow</b> <b>and</b> Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) accidentally outs her cousin, Randy (Jeffery Self) to {{his family}} at a New Year's Eve party, so he comes {{to live with her}} in New York City. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) enters a fake {{relationship}} with actor James Franco, in order to counteract rumors that he is in love with a Japanese body pillow. Jenna feels slighted when she realizes that she wants a real relationship, and encourages James to follow his own passions, resulting in Jenna ending things with him. Later, Liz and Randy go to a nightclub, where Liz runs into James and his pillow. The two get drunk and end up sleeping together. The next morning, at Liz's apartment, Randy is shocked to see James coming out of Liz's bedroom with his body <b>pillow,</b> <b>and</b> because of this decides to go back home to Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate Navy also {{supported}} the position. Flag Officer George N. Hollins commanded six gunboats {{in the river}} between Fort <b>Pillow</b> <b>and</b> Island No. 10. All of these were unarmored; the armored ram CSS Manassas would have been there also, but she {{was found to be}} unable to operate in the relatively shallow water. She was damaged by running aground on the way north, so she was sent back to New Orleans.|$|E

25|$|While {{with the}} Western Gunboat Flotilla, Mound City {{took part in}} combat at Island No. 10, at Fort <b>Pillow,</b> <b>and</b> in an {{expedition}} on the White River in Arkansas. At Fort Pillow, she was rammed by Confederate vessels of the River Defense Fleet and averted sinking only by retreating into shoals. On the White River during the Battle of Saint Charles, a chance Confederate shot penetrated the steam drum of her engines, resulting in 105 of its sailors being killed. An additional forty-five crew members were reported wounded, primarily by scalding. The ship suffered only minor damage.|$|E
25|$|The common {{materials}} of writing were the tablet and the roll, the former probably having a Chaldean origin, the latter an Egyptian. The tablets of the Chaldeans {{are among the}} most remarkable of their remains. There are small pieces of clay, somewhat rudely shaped into a form resembling a <b>pillow,</b> <b>and</b> thickly inscribed with cuneiform characters. Similar use has been seen in hollow cylinders, or prisms of six or eight sides, formed of fine terra cotta, sometimes glazed, on which the characters were traced with a small stylus, in some specimens so minutely as to be capable of decipherment only {{with the aid of a}} magnifying-glass.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{pronounced}} {{risk of suffocation}} in {{very young}} children, and the danger of a fall from the bed for other children, the addition of anything other than sheets (including quilts, <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> stuffed toys) into an infant bed is not recommended by health authorities. A sleepsack can be used instead to keep the baby warm. Older children can use items such as <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> toys to construct a platform to facilitate escape, defeating the major design criteria and endangering the child.|$|R
25|$|Pillow founder Ted Shawn was {{instrumental}} in beginning the careers of Martha Graham and Jack Cole, and the Pillow has continued this mentoring role in the careers of artists such as Alvin Ailey, José Limón, and Mark Morris. Companies such as Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Parsons Dance Company, and Trey McIntyre Project made their debuts at the <b>Pillow,</b> <b>and</b> international groups such as The Royal Danish Ballet, Nederlands Dans Theatre, Black Grace and Hofesh Shechter Company have made their U.S. debuts here. World premieres have been commissioned from choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor, and artists such as Margot Fonteyn and Mikhail Baryshnikov have been showcased in works.|$|E
25|$|On {{the door}} being opened it knocked against a table which {{was close to}} the {{left-hand}} side of the bedstead, and the bedstead was close against the wooden partition. The mutilated remains of a woman were lying two-thirds over, towards the edge of the bedstead, nearest the door. Deceased had only an under-linen garment upon her, and by subsequent examination I am sure the body had been removed, after the injury which caused death, from that side of the bedstead which was nearest to the wooden partition previously mentioned. The large quantity of blood under the bedstead, the saturated condition of the palliasse, <b>pillow,</b> <b>and</b> sheet at the top corner of the bedstead nearest to the partition leads me {{to the conclusion that the}} severance of the right carotid artery, which was the immediate cause of death, was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the bedstead and her head and neck in the top right-hand corner".|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{plans of}} the Confederate War Department (Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin at first, later George W. Randolph) in Richmond for defense of New Orleans were {{distorted}} by {{the belief that the}} primary threat to the city came from the north. Reflecting that belief, much of the material intended to protect the city was sent to strongpoints on the Mississippi, such as Island Number 10, Fort <b>Pillow,</b> <b>and</b> Memphis. The immediate vicinity of the city was actually weakened as guns were withdrawn for use in distant campaigns, as for example that leading to the Battle of Shiloh. The region was also stripped of men of military age. Confederate Major General Mansfield Lovell, commander of Department No. 1, put much more credence in the buildup in the Gulf than did his distant superiors. Flag Officer George N. Hollins, CSN, in charge of the Confederate naval forces on the Mississippi at the time, personally agreed with Lovell, but his orders did not permit him to act on his beliefs.|$|E
