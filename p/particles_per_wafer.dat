40|$|The {{effect of}} metal {{particles}} on thin film dielectric capacitors is characterized. Electrical characteristics of statistically {{significant numbers of}} capacitors are measured. A figure of merit {{is derived from the}} cumulative distribution of capacitor burnout voltages. The figure of merit is correlated with the number of <b>particles</b> <b>per</b> <b>wafer.</b> The use of the figure of merit in establishing process consistency and reproducibility is demonstrated. OBJECTIVES The objectives of the present work are: (1) To use a statistical basis to measure the effect of particles in the lower plate of the capacitor to burnout out voltage of the capacitor. (2) To derive a statistical figure of merit to rank capacitors on different wafer lots. (3) To establish the consistency of particle effects on capacitor properties...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} the cleanliness of minienvironments and process tools, PWP measurements are used. The PWP (<b>particles</b> <b>per</b> <b>wafer</b> pass) value is {{obtained from the}} difference between the measuring of particle sizes and counts on an unstructured wafer surface before and wafer handling in any kind of process equipment. For higher requirements, PWP-counts of e. g. 0. 005 - 0. 001 have to be obtained. Not only is the proof of these values are not economically viable due to of the large number of samples require, but also that these low particle additions on the wafer surface must be identified within the detection limit of the existing wafer measuring system. The previous qualification procedure with so many samples involved can not be used economically. Based on statistical considerations and the analysis of experiments, a cost-optimized procedure needs to be developed and proved. To fulfil this aim, an experimental set-up must also be installed. With the combination of statistical analysis and experimental investigations the expected PWP values and the qualification costs. This paper presents a procedure which allows an economic cleanliness qualification of process equipment with PWP measurements. With this procedure it is possible to calculate the cost of equipment qualification in advance based on given accuracy and PWP values...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a model developed {{to calculate the}} number of redundant good die <b>per</b> <b>wafer.</b> A block redundancy scheme is used here, where the entire defective memory subarray {{is replaced by a}} redundant element. A formula is derived to calculate the amount of improvement expected after redundancy. This improvement is given in terms of the ratio of the overall good die <b>per</b> <b>wafer</b> to the original good die <b>per</b> <b>wafer</b> after considering some key factors. These factors are memory area, available redundant elements, defect density and defect types with respect to the total reject die and defect distribution on the memory area. The model uses Poisson's equation to define the yield, then the appropriate boundary conditions that account for those factors are applied. In the case of a new product, knowing the die size, memory design, and total die <b>per</b> <b>wafer,</b> the model can be used to predict the redundancy yield for this product at different initial yield values. Optimizing the memory design by varying the number of memory blocks and/or redundant elements to enhance redundancy is also discussed. The model was applied to three products from two different process generations and showed good agreement with the measured data...|$|R

Solar cells are fabricated with both type of processes. On large area (149 mm 2) Cz-Si substrates 18 % efficiency have been achieved. Furthermore a cost calculation including process and equipment improvements is carried out for the thermal oxidation process and it is shown that the cost for such a process can be well below 10 ct <b>per</b> <b>wafer</b> for thick and below 5 ct <b>per</b> <b>wafer</b> for a thin oxide, thus meeting industrial requirements for cost effective production...|$|R

40|$|Feeding {{of liquid}} silicon during the {{directional}} solidification {{process is a}} promising opportunity for cost reduction by increased throughput and improved material homogeneity due to constant resistivity over ingot height. In this work, a liquid feeding apparatus was developed for an industrial type directional solidification furnace. One n-type G 2 sized High Performance multicrystalline ingot with liquid feeding of additional 14 kg of undoped silicon feedstock was crystallized. The resistivity was kept within a range of ± 0. 1 Ω cm of the target resistivity during the feeding sequence. A smaller mean grain area growth was observed during feeding, whereas the area fraction of recombination active dislocation structures was as low as in a reference ingot. Increased interstitial oxygen and substitutional carbon concentrations were measured for the ingot with liquid feeding. The measured mean bulk lifetime of 190 µs for passivated wafers in the feeding sequence can probably be increased by further pre-melting crucible improvements. For this laboratory experiment, energy reductions of 2 % <b>per</b> <b>wafer</b> and time savings of 16 % <b>per</b> <b>wafer</b> were realized...|$|R
