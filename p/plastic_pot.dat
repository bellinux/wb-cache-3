5000|$|An {{anthropologist}} by {{the name}} of Philip Newman describes witnessing the condition of wild pig syndrome and refers to the sufferer {{by the name}} Gambiri. Gambiri was a man in his mid-thirties, married, with one small child and another on the way. One late afternoon Mr. Newman was sitting in the front door of his home talking to a group of children when Gambiri approached them carrying a small bowl in his hand. One of the children began asking him for food. Gambiri indicated {{that he did not have}} any food, but as usual the child did not accept this answer and snatched the bowl from Gambiri to see for himself. There were further demands for food and further denials by Gambiri. As tempers flared the child ran off with Gambiri's bowl with Gambiri chasing the child. After a while Gambiri appeared again at Mr. Newman's door. He was carrying a bow and a sheaf of arrows in one hand and a long-knife in the other. He ordered the children away from the door and came in the house. He then began rummaging about in Mr. Newman's personal belongings, and when Mr. Newman asked what he was doing he replied by demanding in a loud voice that Mr. Newman give back his bowl that he had stolen from him. When Mr. Newman stated that he had not taken his bowl, Gambiri shouted, [...] "Maski", which is Neo-Melanesian for [...] "no." [...] Gambiri then saw a <b>plastic</b> <b>pot</b> used as a toilet and said in Neo-Melanesian, [...] "There is my bowl. I can take it and throw it away in the forest. It is not that heavy." [...] Gambiri was then gently guided outside by Mr. Newman's cook, who suggested that his missing bowl might be somewhere else. He then began trampling Mr. Newman's small flower garden. By this time a small crowd had gathered to watch and make comments on his behavior. When Gambiri made threats toward them they ran off laughing or screaming in mock terror. He grabbed a young girl and took away her bag that she was carrying. Then he demanded Mr. Newman to give him a piece of soap, which he gave to an onlooker, and a small knife that he gave Mr. Newman. He stated that the items were given to him by an Australian Patrol Officer for being a good worker on the government road. In about an hour his behavior became known to a wide audience. Others began calling out to other villages informing them of what was taking place. When a large audience gathered Gambiri hurried from place to place forcing his way into houses and demanding some small items as his, and engaged in aggressive verbalization. That evening he ran into the forest with his stolen bag full of stolen goods and was not seen again until the next morning. This time he was not carrying his bag. He spoke in the native language instead of Neo-Melanesian and did not exhibit any of the behavior he had during his Wild Pig attack.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Citrus plants {{strongly}} {{depend on}} arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) but low AM colonization {{found in the}} field. Therefore, mycorrhization of seedlings is vital for better citrus growth vigor. The study evaluated the effects of four containers (earthen pot, <b>plastic</b> <b>pot,</b> nursery cylinder, and nursery bag) on growth, mycorrhizal development, root system architecture (RSA) and chlorophyll concentration of trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedlings inoculated with Glomus versiforme. After five months, AM seedlings grown in an earthen pot displayed the best AM colonization, vesicles, entry points, shoot dry weight, total plant dry weight, plant height, stem diameter, leaf number, RSA traits (taproot length, total length, projected area, surface area, volume, and number of first lateral root), and chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll concentrations, the AM seedlings grown in nursery cylinder and nursery bag better, and the seedlings grown in <b>plastic</b> <b>pot</b> worst. It suggests that mouth diameter of containers is key to mycorrhization of seedlings. Meanwhile, earthen pot is the best container for mycorrhization of trifoliate orange seedlings...|$|E
