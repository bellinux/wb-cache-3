40|$|Vegetative {{cells of}} Myxococcus xanthus were immobilized in 25 -microns-diameter agarose {{microbeads}} and incubated in either growth medium or sporulation buffer. In growth medium, the cells multiplied, glided to the periphery, and then filled the beads. In sporulation buffer, up to 90 % {{of the cells}} lysed and ca. 50 % of the surviving cells formed resistant spores. A strong correlation between sporulation and cell lysis was observed; both phenomena were cell density dependent. Sporulation proficiency was {{a function of the}} average number of cells within the bead at the time that sporulation conditions were imposed. A minimum of ca. 4 cells per microbead was necessary for efficient lysis and sporulation to proceed. Increasing this number accelerated the lysis and sporulation process.

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method for quantitative measurement of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) levels in bacteria and yeasts by using flow cytometry, a method which allows viable microbial cells to be sorted {{on the basis}} of the expressed activity and to be recultivated. The method is based on encapsulating single cells in agarose microbeads 20 to 30 microns in diameter and analyzing the beta-gal activity of the colonies that develop (containing several hundred cells) by using the fluorogenic substrate fluorescein-di-beta-D-galactopyranoside (FDG). Three strains of Escherichia coli, containing different levels of beta-gal, served as a model system. A high degree of correlation was found between the average fluorescence measured <b>per</b> <b>bead</b> and the level of the enzyme in extracts of the respective strain. Although the use of FDG necessitates cell permeabilization, conditions were found under which a small part of each colony remained viable, yet most of the enzyme was exposed to the substrate.

40|$|Polymer beads are the {{starting}} point of many synthetic protocols, and in a number of combinatorial syntheses such studies are based on single beads. It has therefore become important that individual beads carry the same functional group activity and quality control of populations of beads requires a knowledge of the distribution of activity between the individual beads. A procedure was developed for the measurement of the thiol loading of single copolymer beads which is based on the bleaching of Michler's hydrol [4, 4 '-bis(dimethylamino) diphenylcarbinol (BDC-OH) ]. Flow injection colorimetry permits the small volumes of solution generated from single beads to be measured with rapid turnover and with a reproducibility of ca. 2 %. The solution detection limit of 0. 17 mM corresponds to a bead thiol concentration of 0. 33 mmol g(- 1). The procedure and the variability of a bead population were demonstrated using modified styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer beads.
