5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but {{this may be due to}} confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.|$|E
5|$|Turbinellus floccosus is {{poisonous}} to some <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> it, but {{has been}} consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A tricarboxylic acid known as α-tetradecylcitric acid {{may be responsible for}} the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E

5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E

500|$|Deficiencies of {{vitamins}} {{are classified as}} either primary or secondary. A primary deficiency occurs when an organism does not {{get enough of the}} vitamin in its food. A secondary deficiency may be due to an underlying disorder that prevents or limits the absorption or use of the vitamin, due to a [...] "lifestyle factor", such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, or the use of medications that interfere with the absorption or use of the vitamin. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> a varied diet are unlikely to develop a severe primary vitamin deficiency.

Recent studies suggest that older people can boost their brain power by eating more oily fish, what with regular consumers being able to remember better and think faster than those who don't consume at all. Other research has also suggested that adding more DHA to the diet of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder can reduce their behavioural problems and improve their reading skills, while there have also been links suggested between DHA and better concentration.

2500|$|Direct {{contact is}} rare in this route for humans in {{developed}} countries, but relatively common for humans in developing countries, especially those living in urban slums without access to adequate sanitation. More common in developed countries are the indirect routes; foodstuffs or water become contaminated (by people not adequately washing their hands before preparing food or tending to patients, or untreated sewage being released into a drinking water supply) and the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> and drink them become infected. In some developing countries, many people are not connected to sewer systems, and where they are, most sewage is discharged into the environment without treatment. However, a bigger problem in some developing countries is open defecation which leads to disease transmission via the fecal-oral route, especially for children. Even in developed countries there are periodic system failures resulting in a sanitary sewer overflow. [...] This is the typical mode of transmission for the infectious agents of (at least): cholera, hepatitis A, polio, Rotavirus, Salmonella, and parasites (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides).|$|E

2500|$|García Márquez confessed: [...] "My most {{important}} problem was destroying {{the line of}} demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic." [...] Isabel Allende was the first Latin American woman writer recognized outside the continent. Her most well-known novel, The House of the Spirits, is arguably similar to García Márquez's style of magical realist writing. Another notable novelist is Laura Esquivel, whose Like Water for Chocolate {{tells the story of}} the domestic life of women living on the margins of their families and society. The novel's protagonist, Tita, is kept from happiness and marriage by her mother. [...] "Her unrequited love and ostracism from the family lead her to harness her extraordinary powers of imbuing her emotions to the food she makes. In turn, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> her food enact her emotions for her. For example, after eating a wedding cake Tita made while suffering from a forbidden love, the guests all suffer from a wave of longing. The Mexican Juan Rulfo pioneered the exposition through a non-linear structure with his short novel Pedro Páramo that tells the story of Comala both as a lively town in times of the eponymous Pedro Páramo and as a ghost town through the eyes of his son Juan Preciado who returns to Comala to fulfil a promise to his dead mother.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after her}} {{election}} to Parliament, Hanson's book, Pauline Hanson – the truth : on Asian immigration, the Aboriginal question, the gun debate {{and the future}} of Australia, was published. In it she makes claims of Aboriginal cannibalism, in particular that Aboriginal women ate their babies and tribes cannibalised their members. Hanson told the media that the reason for these claims of cannibalism was to [...] "demonstrate the savagery of Aboriginal society". David Ettridge, the One Nation party director, said that the book's claims were intended to correct [...] "misconceptions" [...] about Aboriginal history. These alleged misconceptions were said to be relevant to modern-day Aboriginal welfare funding. He asserted that [...] "the suggestion that we should be feeling some concern for modern day Aborigines for suffering in the past is balanced a bit by the alternative view of whether you can feel sympathy for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> their babies". The book predicted that in 2050 Australia would have a lesbian president of Chinese-Indian background called Poona Li Hung who would be a cyborg. In 2004, Hanson said that the book was [...] "written by some other people who actually put my name to it" [...] and that while she held the copyright over The Truth, she was unaware that much of the material was being published under her name.|$|E

40|$|While {{insufficient}} protein {{consumption is}} a concern to many demographic segments in developed countries, it is a greater concern in developing nations where the cost or availability of traditional forms of animal protein results in protein deficiencies. Soy is a low-cost, highly available protein source, yet it is largely overlooked because of its unfamiliar taste and texture. To determine how to best encourage soy consumption, {{a convenience sample of}} 132 Indians and Pakistanis living in the United States was examined for insights in to what characterizes someone <b>who</b> regularly <b>eats</b> soy for taste-related reasons. Three groups of consumers were analyzed, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> soy primarily for taste-related reasons, those <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> it primarily for health-related reasons, and those <b>who</b> did not <b>eat</b> it. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> soy primarily for taste-related reasons were found to be more likely to appreciate fine food, to live with a great cook, and to be more of an opinion leader than did those in either of the other two groups. These along with additional findings have implications for targeting soy-predisposed consumers, who will adopt soy for the long-term, and who can influence others because of their role as opinion-leaders within their peer or reference group...|$|R
