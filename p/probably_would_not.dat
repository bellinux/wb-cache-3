5|$|Prior to the game, Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen placed a partial-game {{suspension}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew, including leading rusher, Da'Rel Scott, and senior wide receiver Danny Oquendo.

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} game, Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen placed partial-game {{suspensions}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew. The suspended players were linebackers Moise Fokou, Trey Covington, Antwine Perez, and Derek Drummond, cornerback Jamari McCollough, the quarterback's preferred third-down wide receiver Danny Oquendo, and leading running back Da'Rel Scott. All except Drummond were regular starters. Consequently, {{a much younger}} line-up started for Maryland, including, according to Friedgen, some who <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have seen playing time otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In late March, polls {{suggested}} McCarthy {{would likely}} win the Wisconsin Primary. Around this time, Johnson decided {{to drop out}} of the race. When he informed Humphrey of his decision, the Vice President urged Johnson to remain as a candidate. Johnson replied that it was not in the best interest of the nation to mix the partisan politics of a presidential election with the ongoing Vietnam crisis, and that if elected, he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to complete the term since the men in his family usually died in their early sixties. A week prior to the primary, on March 31, the President publicly announced that he would not seek nor accept the Democratic Party nomination, thus setting the stage for a Humphrey presidential run.|$|E

50|$|Before {{obtaining a}} Rampur Hound, size and {{exercise}} requirements {{should be taken}} into consideration. Relatively robust, it needs plenty of space to stretch its legs and <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be <b>not</b> be happy to be confined to a small apartment.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion {{of the head and}} neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all appeared to have been large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|The {{adductor}} muscle of the jaw {{appears to have}} attached to the quadrate instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and Nigersaurus is estimated to have {{had one of the}} weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have been able to chew. Nigersaurus wore its tooth crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its tooth replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each tooth was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to Nigersaurus, sauropods with lower tooth replacement rates and broader tooth crowns are thought to have been canopy browsers.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{released}} until 1992 due to legal complications, development of 386BSD, from which NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux. Torvalds has {{also stated that}} if 386BSD had been available at the time, he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have created Linux.|$|E
25|$|Tax credits, {{while they}} come in many forms, are {{authorized}} incentives under the Internal Revenue Code (and some state tax codes) to implement public policy. Congress, {{in an effort to}} encourage the private sector to provide a public benefit, allows a participating taxpayer a dollar for dollar reduction of their tax liability for investments in projects that <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> occur but for the credits.|$|E
25|$|After {{snapping}} the photograph, Ut took Kim Phúc and {{the other}} injured children to Barsky Hospital in Saigon, where {{it was determined that}} her burns were so severe that she <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> survive. After a 14-month hospital stay and 17 surgical procedures including skin transplantations, however, she was able to return home. A number of the early operations were performed by Finnish plastic surgeon Aarne Rintala (1926–2014).|$|E

25|$|A vaccine <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be {{available}} in the initial stages of population infection. A vaccine cannot be developed to protect against a virus which does not exist yet. The Avian Flu virus H5N1 has the potential to mutate into a pandemic strain, but so do other types of flu virus. Once a potential virus is identified and a vaccine is approved, it normally takes five to six months before the vaccine becomes available.|$|E
25|$|As {{he moved}} inland Cortés {{came into contact}} with a number of polities who resented Aztec rule; Cortés clashed with some of these polities, among them the Totonacs and Tlaxcalans. The latter {{surrounded}} his army on a hilltop for two agonizing weeks. Bernal Díaz del Castillo wrote that his numerically inferior force <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have survived {{if it were not for}} Xicotencatl the Elder and his wish to form an alliance with the Spaniards against the Aztecs.|$|E
25|$|On July 10, 2008, a Landmarks Commission {{official}} said the petition to grant the building special landmark status had been recommended for study, but <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be considered by the panel unless a plan to demolish the structure was imminent. Members of the group Citizens for City Hall also opposed Mayor Menino's {{plan to build a}} new City Hall on the South Boston waterfront because it would be a major inconvenience {{for tens of thousands of}} city residents.|$|E

Rachmaninoff was disappointed by the original painting when he later saw it, saying, [...] "If I had seen first the original, I, <b>probably,</b> <b>would</b> have <b>not</b> written my Isle of the Dead.

25|$|The AOA {{apparently}} {{looked at}} two options, using {{two of the}} s' 34 MW S6W reactors, and halving {{one of the two}} 550 MW(th) A4W reactors used in s. The first option would not even match Zumwalt for power, while the second option <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> fit into the Zumwalt hull. On the other hand, it would give plenty of headroom for future weapon systems such as directed-energy weapons and railguns, hence the proposal for the BMD ship of a larger hull with nuclear propulsion.|$|E
25|$|Modoc, {{like many}} other small towns, <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have been built if the I. B. & W. Railroad had not made its way across {{southern}} Randolph County, in 1878. The location was poorly drained, but it {{had the advantage of}} being rather flat. It was plagued, for many years, by typhoid fever outbreaks. The railroad was built by many contractors. The railroad came through Modoc from the west, and met the contractors, who were building the next section east, in what was then a strip of timber about one-half mile east of where the depot was located.|$|E
25|$|Fees will {{be charged}} using the {{existing}} FasTrak transponders used for tolling on the Bay Area bridges, and a network of cameras. Drivers {{will be allowed to}} pay by telephone, text message, online, mail or at designated stores. Among others, the study considered to exempt driver with disabilities, low-income drivers, and residents within the toll zones. Also discounts for commercial fleets were considered. Taxi drivers will be exempted and rental cars would be charged a fleet rate. Carpoolers <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> get a discount because they already have toll-free pass through the Bay Area bridges. The study made the assumption that tolls at the Bay Area bridges will remain the same.|$|E

25|$|Toshio Masuda {{was born}} in Kobe, Japan. His father was a seaman. He {{enrolled}} in a technical training school, however, his mindset did not mesh with the school's military indoctrination and he was expelled in July 1945. He next attended the Osaka University of Foreign Studies (now Osaka University) where he specialized in Russian literature. There he became enamoured with French cinema which led him away from Russian grammar and towards {{a career in the}} film industry. He thought he would have been bored as a salaryman and that filmmaking would better suit him but suggested he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have followed through had his friends not sought similar careers. After graduating in 1949, he moved to Tokyo to study screenwriting at the Shintoho Studio's Scenario Academy.|$|E
25|$|The logo for {{the company}} showed Fun Ho! in a script like form within an oval that {{included}} an odd portrait of a clown-like face that looks {{kind of like a}} laughing child with a beanie cap...or...a yelling oriental martial arts specialist. The riddle is solved when looking at a company catalog (leaflet) that zooms out showing a clown complete with ruffles and a tall pointed hat and carrying a Fun Ho! sign (Jordan 2015). The clown was most often printed in red, and was even used for company Christmas cards once upon a time (Jordan 2015). The logo was probably OK from the 1930s through the 1960s, but as an advertising gimmick, the design would <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> work well with children today.|$|E
25|$|Abortion {{was portrayed}} in 2001 {{with a story}} which divided the country when Kay decided to abort her {{pregnancy}} against {{the wishes of the}} father Malachy. As an older mother Kay has amniocentesis tests done which reveal the child has trisomy-13 which means that the child would be born severely disabled and <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> survive long after birth. The storyline was seen by the actors and producers as controversial and heart-breaking. They recognised the time sensitive nature of the decisions that had to be made and the potential impacts and worked to show it all. This storyline caused anti-abortion viewers to complain to the Justice Minister {{on the grounds that the}} story was hate speech against people with disabilities.|$|E
