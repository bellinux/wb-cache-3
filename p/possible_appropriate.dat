5000|$|The work {{originated}} a {{year after}} Yeston's musical, Nine, opened on Broadway in 1982. Yeston was still an Associate Professor in musicology at Yale. He noted that few {{if any of the}} well-known American ballets (the Aaron Copland masterpieces, or Balanchine’s ballet “On Your Toes”) were even as much as an hour in length, let alone three-acts. He {{came up with the idea}} of Twain’s “Tom Sawyer” as a <b>possible</b> <b>appropriate</b> subject for a full length form. The book [...] "seemed a natural fit principally because its form, like ballet, is episodic”, he said, citing [...] "The Painting of the Fence" [...] scene, [...] "Lost With Becky Thatcher in The Cave," [...] "Witnessing the Murder in the Graveyard," [...] as examples. Upon hearing the score William Whitener, Artistic Director of Kansas City Ballet, agreed to choreograph and mount the production, saying [...] "When I first heard Maury Yeston's score for Tom Sawyer, I realized that we had a grand opportunity to bring this classic story to life as a dance-drama. The wit and beauty within Mr. Yeston's music, and the charm and playfulness of Mark Twain's novel make an ideal match for a ballet".|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{functions}} of the D 1 - and D 2 -dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia have remained somewhat enigmatic, {{with a number of}} competing theories relating to the interactions of the ‘direct’ and ‘indirect pathways’. Computational models have been good at simulating properties of the system, but are typically divorced from the underlying neural architecture. In this article we propose a new model which re-addresses response selection {{at the level of the}} basal ganglia. At the core of this response selection system the D 1 DA receptor-expressing striatal pathways ‘prepare’ the set of <b>possible</b> <b>appropriate</b> responses.

40|$|This {{research}} introduces an agent-based {{simulation model}} representing the dynamic processes of cooperative R&D {{in the manufacturing}} sector of South Korea. Firms' behavior is defined according to empirical findings on the Korean Innovation Survey 2005 and captured in a multivariate probit regression model. The econometrics model identifies the determinants on firms' likelihood to participate in cooperation with other organizations when conducting innovation activities. These determinants are translated into simulation parameters which are calibrated {{to the point that}} the simulated artificial world are equivalent to the one observed in the real world. The aim of the simulation game is to investigate the differences in sector responses to internal and external changes, including cross-sector spillovers, when applying three different policy strategies to promote cooperation in innovation.

40|$|This paper {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{investigate the}} spectrum attenuation of free space optical (FSO) communication systems operating at visible and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths (0. 6 μm < λ < 1. 6 μm) under fog and smoke {{in a controlled}} laboratory condition. Fog and smoke are generated and controlled homogeneously along a dedicated atmospheric chamber of length 5. 5 m. A new wavelength dependent empirical model is proposed to predict the fog and smoke attenuation operating at visible and NIR wavelengths. Comparison of the new proposed model with the measured continuous attenuation spectrum from visible—NIR in the fog and smoke channels shows a close relationship than the semi-empirical Kim and Kruse fog models. The experimental results also show the selection for the <b>possible</b> <b>appropriate</b> wavelengths from visible—NIR for FSO links to achieve the maximum link span in dense fog conditions...|$|E
40|$|The use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{composites}} {{is now a}} widely-accepted {{solution for}} the strengthening of reinforced concrete structures. FRP strengthening schemes offer many well-documented benefits for the retrofit of many existing concrete buildings and bridges. However, the main drawback in using FRP for such purposes is the reduction in ductility that the strengthened structure displays after strengthening. This loss in ductility has led various design guidelines {{around the world to}} prohibit any redistribution of bending moments in continuous FRP-strengthened concrete structures. This means that continuous structures, which might have been designed, originally under assumptions of moment redistribution, should be designed for FRP strengthening according to elastic distribution of bending moment. This could lead to onerous conditions for such strengthening schemes, particularly in hogging regions. This paper sets out a rationale for the <b>possible</b> <b>appropriate</b> use of redistribution principles for FRP-strengthened concrete...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} quality of life in {{squatter}} settlements, the Zonal Improvement Program (ZIP), which aims to provide direct water connection and a private toilet to every housing unit, has been implemented in Metro Manila, Republic of the Philippines, since 1985. To estimate the impact of the program, particularly the improvement of the water supply, on diarrheal incidence among under-five-year-old children, a comparative survey between a ZIP area and a non-ZIP area was conducted. A significantly higher diarrheal incidence among under-five-year-old children was observed in the non-ZIP area. This may be attributed to the increase in water consumption as a result of the improvement of the water supply in the ZIP area. The Relative Risk (RR) of water consumption with diarrheal incidence was 2. 67, indicating a positive association. A water supply that provides for consumption of 60 (lpcd) could be a <b>possible</b> <b>appropriate</b> measure to reduce diarrheal cases...|$|E
