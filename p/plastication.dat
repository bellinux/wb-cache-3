40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the influence of the <b>plastication</b> phase in the injection moulding process on the rheological properties of polycarbonate. The study is divided into two phases: the first one aims at determining if the <b>plastication</b> process influences the melt viscosity while the second one is devoted to evaluate the influences of the main <b>plastication</b> parameters (melt temperature, residence time and screw rotational speed) on the rheological behaviour. An all-electric injection moulding machine and a twin bore capillary rheometer were used respectively to mould the specimens and to perform the rheological tests. A critical analysis of the results demonstrates that the <b>plastication</b> phase and, in particular, the melt temperature reduces polycarbonate viscosity...|$|E

The rotor configuration, rotor speed and machine barrel temperature were set as the variable parameters in this contrast experiment. What’s more, the experimental investigation showed that, the three factors had effects on the <b>plastication</b> performance. When the temperature of machine barrels and extrusion dies reached C 060 and the rotor speed was at min 30 r, the <b>plastication</b> performance of two rotor configurations was relatively better. And the rotor configuration II was better than I by synthesizing all kinds of factors...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to compare the effects of two {{different}} 40 mm screws on fiber breakage during <b>plastication.</b> A polypropylene, reinforced with 30 % long glass fibers, was tested. A standard three zone screw and a special profile screw were compared. The special screw has low compression ratio, a dynamic mixer and it is tapered over the whole length. The pitch is variable, increasing from the feeding zone to the screw front; {{the combination of these}} features gives higher productivity with better melt homogeneity and a very consistent dosing time end cushion. The <b>plastication</b> was performed at two different process conditions and the screw pull-out technique was used. The fibers length was measured at different distances from the hopper after the matrix pyrolysis. The experiments show that the different geometry of the screws, within the selected conditions, did not affect the fiber breakage. Residence time and aspect ratio of pellet length to channel width and length were also considered. A procedure was developed and validated in order to allow an accurate comparative analysis of the fiber breakage progression during <b>plastication...</b>|$|E
40|$|A process {{analysis}} {{is carried out}} systematically to quantify how the melt temperature at the nozzle exit {{is affected by the}} operating conditions during the <b>plastication,</b> dwell and injection phases in a thermoplastics injection molding process. The following process variables are considered in this study: rotation speed, back pressure, barrel heater temperatures, nozzle heater temperature, dwell time and injection velocity profile. The three consecutive phases, <b>plastication,</b> dwell, and injection are studied and modeled separately. A set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been developed to predict the effect of the operating conditions on the melt temperature during <b>plastication.</b> One dimensional heat conduction model is used to simulate the dwell period. A free boundary model for the injection phase is developed to simulate the melt flow pushed by the forward movement of the screw, and the finite element method (FEM) is used to solve this model. The over-all prediction of the nozzle melt temperature is in good agreement with the experimental measurements.

40|$|International audienceTo be able {{to predict}} the {{throughput}} of a single-screw extruder or the metering time of an injection moulding machine for a given screw geometry, set of processing conditions and polymeric material is important both for practical and designing purposes. The model is based on viewing the entire screw simply as a pump, conveying a solid and a molten fraction. The evolution of the solid fraction {{is the essence of}} the <b>plastication</b> process, but under a particular hypothesis on solid bed acceleration, its influence on the throughput is nil. This allows getting a good estimate on the throughput and pressure development along the screw. Calculations are compared to a large set of experiments available from the literature. Consistent agreement with these published results is obtained, both for throughput and pressure along the screw. The effect of the plasticating process on the throughput is non-existent if the <b>plastication</b> length is short, and more visible if the <b>plastication</b> length takes {{a good part of the}} screw length (for instance, at higher screw rotation frequency). This diminishes the throughput value and widens the pressure peak. The model also shows that the screw geometry is the most important parameter, followed by polymer rheology and processing conditions. Melting properties and length seem to intervene to a lesser extent. Finally, the model is used for screw design, highlighting the influence of the compression zone on throughput...|$|E
40|$|Injection {{molded part}} quality depends {{strongly}} {{on the key}} processing conditions such as injection velocity during filling phase, packing pressure during packing-holding phase, and melt temperature during <b>plastication</b> phase. Profiling methods of those key parameters are studied in this thesis. Injection velocity is profiled to keep a constant melt-front rate throughout the mold filling to produce uniform parts. It can be implemented by controlling the average-flow-length following a ramp. To measure the melt-position and also to collect data for modeling and control, a capacitive transducer is designed and experimentally tested for different materials and molds. Potential applications of such a transducer for the detections of V/P transfer, gate freezing-off point, and over-packing, are also discussed. As such a hardware transducer may not be conveniently installed in all molds, a soft-sensor is developed via a neural network model to correlate the average-flow-length with other online measurable variables. With this soft-sensor model, a profiling method based on optimization is proposed and experimentally verified. Two parameters defining a packing pressure profile, the gate freezing-off time, and the shape and level during packing-holding, are studied in this thesis. An online detection system for the gate freezing is developed, with results matching well with the established off-line method. Influences of the packing profiles on part weight, evenness, shrinkage, and flash are studied in details. Different types of packing profiles, including constant, ramp, and step change profiles, are compared using different mold inserts. Based on the rules concluded from this extensive experimental study, profiling methods are proposed. The melt temperature is affected by several parameters in <b>plastication</b> phase. A transparent and instrumented barrel is set up to observe and to promote {{the understanding of the}} melting and transport phenomenon in the injection <b>plastication.</b> The melt temperature is correlated to other molding parameters via a neural network model. For a given material and a required melt temperature, proper settings of the <b>plastication</b> conditions are obtained through optimization...|$|E
40|$|Long glass fiber-filled {{polypropylene}} composites {{are widely}} used in industry because of their low cost and high performance. To investigate the rheological properties of such composites in the molten state an in-line slit-die rheometer was developed and mounted on an injection molding machine. The shear viscosity of filled PP determined by the in-line rheometer was found to strongly depend on the fiber length distribution. In particular, a linear correlation was determined between the viscosity at a constant temperature and shear rate and the average fiber length equation proposed by Huq and Azaiez. The developed model and the in-line rheometer were then {{used to assess the}} effects of the main <b>plastication</b> parameters (i. e. screw rotation speed and backpressure) on fibers damage. The experiments were carried out according to a central composite design and optimal <b>plastication</b> conditions were determined by means of the response surface method...|$|E

A set of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been developed to predict the effect of the operating conditions on the melt temperature during <b>plastication.</b> The dwell period is treated as a heat conduction problem. A free boundary model for the injection phase is developed to simulate the temperature development and melt flow due to the forward motivation of the screw. The overall prediction of nozzle melt temperature is in good agreement with the experimental measurement, validating the proposed procedure combining ANNs and mathematical modeling.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of numerical simulations of the injection molding process depends {{mainly on the}} rheological characteristics of polymers. The rheological characterization of a polymer for injection molding is commonly carried out by a capillary rheometer. However in this method the measurement is carried out on a sample of unprocessed polymer, neglecting {{the influence of the}} <b>plastication</b> phase. This influence is demonstrated {{in the first part of}} the paper on a polycarbonate produced by Bayer. To improve the accuracy of rheological data by rejecting these simplifications, a laboratory test method has been developed for the physical simulation of polymers rheology under industrial process conditions. The method is based on an in-line slit-die rheometer which has been mounted as a mould on an injection molding machine. By means of this test it is possible to relate a polymer viscosity not only to its temperature and shear rate but also to those parameters that characterize the <b>plastication</b> process: screw rotation speed, residence time, temperature and geometry of the system...|$|E

High density polyethylene (HDPE), a commonly used thermoplastic, is chosen to demonstrate the polymer melting behavior in injection molding. Effects of processing conditions on the melting behavior are analyzed, suggesting that the modeling of the <b>plastication</b> phase should not be treated simply as an extrusion process.

40|$|In-line process {{monitoring}} and rheological characterization {{can help to}} understand the behaviour of polymer melt flows during manufacture and to make injection moulding a measurable process for manufacturing high quality parts. This work developed an in-line rheology measurement system using a slit die attached to a micro injection moulding machine. A series of dumbbell mould inserts was used to form the slit die with thickness ranging from 600 μm to 200 μm. Two combined pressure and temperature sensors were embedded into the slit die to measure the pressure drop. Based on the slit flow model, {{it was found that}} the viscosity of Pebax melts depends on the slit thickness in the actual injection moulding process. The competing effects of wall slip and non-isothermal conditions will determine the melt viscosity. The <b>plastication</b> induced thermo-mechanical history can also influence polymer viscosity, although it is neglected in conventional rheology measurements...|$|E
40|$|As an {{energy-intensive}} process, in injection molding, energy cost {{is one of}} {{the major}} cost components. The energy expenditure during molding can be divided into two forms: thermal and mechanical energy, although both are initially transferred from electrical energy. The former is mainly the energy consumed for heating the barrel, while the latter can be further partitioned as energy related to mechanical motions such as injection and mold clamping, and thermal relevant mechanical energy such as <b>plastication.</b> The energy saving problem has been addressed by many researchers from the equipment modification angle, for example, improving pump and motor efficiency. Different from that, this dissertation, from a system operation viewpoint, attempts to develop an energy-efficient control system. Energy over-consumption is mainly related to the overheating of melt, therefore the thermal related variables, including barrel temperatures, screw rotation speed and back pressure, are major variables concerned in this design. Proper controls and settings of these machine variables is the key to energy-efficient operation. In the previous research, the control and setting of these variables are usually considered separately, despite strong interactions existing among them. In this thesis, the energy problem is analyzed systematically first, and then control methods for these variables are developed. Afterwards, melt temperature, a key process variable, is studied to develop a faster process stabilization control strategy. Finally, an integrated setting approach for these key variables is proposed leading to an energy-efficient operation of the process...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{injection}} moulding, {{long glass}} fibre reinforced thermoplastics (LGFT) are an attractive way to produce large parts at low cost. However {{the strength of the}} part depends chiefly on the average fibre length, fibres which are subjected to considerable attrition during processing in conventional three stage screws. In this study, two models of fibre breakage are considered: The first mechanism is specific to <b>plastication</b> during which a fibre anchored at one end in the solid bed is submitted at the other end to the intense shear existing in the molten film, close to the barrel. The thickness of the molten film and the shear stress applied to the fibre vary with polymer viscosity, fibre strength and dimensions, and process parameters. As the melting of the solid bed progresses, more fibres are unlayered and submitted to bending. When the bending stress applied exceeds the fibre strength, the fibre breaks. This results in bimodal fibre length distributions. The sensibility of the model to main processing parameters such as screw rotation, initial fibre length, viscosity, barrel temper-ature and screw geometry is also investigated. The second mechanism addresses the fibre breakage occurring at a later stage in the process, when the screw channel is completely filled with melt. The basis for this {{is to look at the}} fibre as an array of bonded spheres. The flexibility of the fibre model is altered by changing the bending, stretching and twisting strength of the bond connecting adjacent spheres. The motion of the fibre in the flow field is determined by solving the translational and rotational motion equations for individual spheres under hydrodynamic forces and torques exerted on them. Again, the fibre fractures at the bond at which the applied stress exceeds the fibre strength...|$|E
40|$|During {{production}} of concentrated fruit juices, {{both physical and}} chemical losses of aroma compounds occur due to heat treatment such as pasteurisation and evaporation. This leads to an inferior quality of the final product. By recovering the aroma complex from fresh juice and then adding {{it back to the}} processed juice, heat treatment can be avoided. Hydrophobic pervaporation is an emerging membrane technique, which provides an interesting alternative when volatile organic compounds are to be separated from dilute aqueous mixtures. The intention of this thesis was to model and to optimise the pervaporation process for the application of aroma recovery from fruit juices, with focus on apple juice. Pervaporation was shown to be a promising alternative for the application of aroma recovery from natural apple juice, as it offers very high separation efficiency at mild process conditions. The operating conditions were shown to {{have a major impact on}} the performance of the process. Improved hydrodynamic conditions in the feed channel, increased feed temperature and decreased permeate pressure favour the aroma recovery. However, this has to be balanced with the energy input. Furthermore, due to the heat sensitivity of the aroma compounds, the temperature has to be kept at a reasonable level. There is also a possibility of controlling the composition of aroma compounds in the permeate via the process conditions. Optimum separation properties could be obtained when applying membranes designed with relatively thin selective layers using a modified silicone rubber polymer with a low degree of crosslinking in combination with a porous support of low resistance. A model for a poly[octylmethyl siloxane] membrane, which can predict the influence of permeate pressure for any permeant within the chemical groups of alcohols, aldehydes and esters was developed. The model provides a better understanding of the <b>plastication</b> phenomena inside the membrane and its effect on permeabilities. By use of the hydrophobicity, the molecular size and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, it was possible to predict the general trends regarding the permeabilities and their influence on temperature for the organics studied...|$|E
40|$|Thermoplastics {{injection}} molding involves <b>plastication</b> {{followed by the}} injection of the melt into a cold cavity. Packing is employed to compensate for shrinkage due to cooling. Ultimately, the solidified part is ejected from the mold without damage. The successful operation of an {{injection molding}} machine requires control of the process variables during each of the consecutive stages in addition to correctly identifying the points of transition from one stage to the next. Pressure and its variation during the injection molding cycle {{play an important role}} with regard to productivity, product quality, and product reproducibility. From the practical point of view, it is necessary to consider simultaneously hydraulic pressure, nozzle pressure, and the distribution of pressure in the cavity. Control of each phase of the injection molding process is best achieved by controlling one or a combination of the above pressure parameters. The present work describes a comprehensive study of the dynamics and control of pressure during each stage of the injection molding cycle. Deterministic models were obtained for cavity gate pressure during the filling and packing stages. Dynamic model predictions were in good agreement with experimental data. The response of cavity gate pressure exhibited nonlinear behavior which was investigated and rectified by a gain scheduling control strategy. Stochastic models were obtained for cavity gate pressure response in the filling stage for the purpose of comparison and future design of more advanced control algorithmsThe dynamic models were employed to design and evaluate control schemes for the injection molding cycle. Nozzle and cavity pressures were used in conjunction with PI, PID and Dahlin controllers. The hydraulic system of the injection molding machine was redesigned to incorporate two servovalves in order to achieve control over the cavity pressuretime profile during the packing stage as well as over peak cavity and hold pressures. The control loops were designed through a simulation study which also gave good indications of system limitations. On the basis of this study, very good and reliable integrated control over the filling, packing, and holding stages was achieved by a general control scheme which allows the transfer of control from one variable to another during the various stages of the process...|$|E
40|$|Le {{polyamide}} 11 est utilisé comme gaine d'étanchéité interne des conduites flexibles de transport de produits pétroliers. Dans certaines conditions d'utilisation, celui-ci subit une dégradation de ses propriétés mécaniques et physico-chimiques initiales. Des échanges de matières s'établissent entre le matériau et le fluide transporté : des composés constitutifs du fluide (eau, hydrocarbures) peuvent être absorbés par le polyamide {{tandis que}} le principal additif du matériau (le plastifiant) est extrait. Cette étude, entreprise pour déterminer l'influence de la composition du milieu chimique sur les propriétés du polyamide 11, a permis : 1) De développer une nouvelle méthode d'analyse des matières diffusant dans le polyamide 11. Le principe de cette méthode consiste à réaliser une thermodésorption des différentes matières présentes dans le polymère et à les analyser en ligne par spectrométrie de masse à moyenne résolution (résolution = 3000). Cette méthode permet l'analyse quantitative simultanée du plastifiant résiduel, de l'eau et des hydrocarbures absorbés ainsi que la détermination de la répartition par familles chimiques de ces hydrocarbures. 2) De proposer un modèle prédictif du vieillissement du polyamide 11 dans des milieux modèles constitués d'eau, d'une coupe gazole principalement aliphatique et d'une coupe gazole principalement aromatique. La composition de ces différents milieux de vieillissement a été choisie à l'aide d'un plan d'expériences appliqué aux mélanges. L'influence de l'eau sur les propriétés mécaniques (diminution de l'allongement à la rupture) et physico-chimiques (diminution de la masse moléculaire moyenne et augmentation du taux de cristallinité) a été mise en évidence. Par ailleurs, {{quel que soit}} le milieu de vieillissement, à 140 °C, le plastifiant est extrait du polyamide. L'influence du milieu aromatique sur la plastification du matériau a été démontrée et a pu être attribuée à certains types d'hydrocarbures dont la nature a été précisée. Les résultats obtenus ont permis de conclure que le phénomène principal mis en jeu au cours du vieillissement est une hydrolyse causée par l'eau absorbée dans le matériau et qui entraîne une coupure des chaînes macromoléculaires et la fragilisation du polymère. 3) D'étendre l'application du modèle établi avec des coupes gazoles au cas d'un vieillissement dans un pétrole brut et de vérifier son caractère prédictif. Polyamide 11 {{is used as a}} leakproof sheath inside flexible flowlines for petroleum products. Under some operating conditions, this polymer undergoes a degradation of its original physicochemical and mechanical properties, which may be assimilated with a phenomenon of aging. Material exchanges occur between polyamide 11 and the fluid transported. The components present in the fluid (water, hydrocarbons) may be absorbed, and the principal additive of the material (the plasticizer) is extracted. This study was carried out to determine the influence of the composition of the chemical environment of aging on the properties of polyamide 11. In the first phase, a new analysis method was developed for quantifying diffusing materials in polyamide 11. Effectively, several techniques can be used for determining such materials. However, interference problems may be encountered when the polymer is in contact with oil containing sulfur-bearing products. Likewise, none of these techniques is capable of simultaneously making a complete analysis of all the materials. The principle of the method developed consists in performing a thermodesorption of the different materials present in the polymer and in analyzing them on line by medium-resolution mass spectrometry (resolution = 3000). This resolution is also capable of determining the distribution, by chemical families, of the hydrocarbons absorbed. The method was checked with aged polyamide 11 samples containing either a single type of material or several materials. These materials were analyzed at the same time by thermodesorption coupled with mass spectrometry and by other techniques. The results obtained show that this new method is capable of quantitatively and simultaneous determining : (1) the residual plasticizer content, (2) the water and absorbed-hydrocarbon content, and (3) the distribution, by chemical families, of the absorbed hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics). In the second phase, since polyamide 11 has varying affinity for the different chemical families present in a petroleum environment, we tried to determine the influence of each type of compound on the mechanical properties (ultimate elongation) and physicochemical properties (rate of crystallinity, molecular weight, contents of diffusing materials). Aging was performed in the laboratory in model environments made up in varying proportions, i. e. water, a gas-oil cut composed mainly of aromatic hydrocarbons, a gas-oil cut composed mainly of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The composition of these different aging environments was chosen by means of an experimental plan applied to the mixtures, and a polynomial mathematical model has been postulated. The conditions of temperature, pressure and aging time were set at a constant level for all the tests, i. e. 140 °C, 6 bar of nitrogen, 15 days. The model obtained was used to plot isoresponse curves and to predict the properties analyzed {{as a function of the}} composition of the environment. The influence of water on the degradation of the mechanical properties (decrease in ultimate elongation) and the physicochemical properties (reduction of the molecular weight and increase in the rate of crystallinity) was revealed. Likewise, it was shown that, no matter what the aging environment was at 140 °C, the plasticizer is extracted and the aromatic environment influences the <b>plastication</b> of the material. By means of mass spectrometry, the chemical nature of the aromatic hydrocarbons absorbed preferentially, and having a pasticating role, was determined. These are two-cycle aromatics (alkylnaphthalenes, acenaphthenes, diphenyls, acenaphthylenes, fluorenes) and sulfur-containing aromatics (benzothiophenes and dibenzothiophenes). The different results led to the conclusion that the principal phenomenon involved in aging is a hydrolysis caused by the presence of absorbed water in the material, which leads to the cutting of the macromolecular chains and embrittlement of the polymer. Lastly, the model created with gas-oil cuts was applied to a case of aging of a crude oil, and this led to the satisfactory prediction of how the mechanical and physicochernical properties of the polymer evolve in such an environment...|$|E
