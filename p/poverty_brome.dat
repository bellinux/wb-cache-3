5000|$|Bromus sterilis is {{an annual}} or {{biennial}} species of bromegrass known as barren brome, <b>poverty</b> <b>brome,</b> and sterile brome.|$|E
5000|$|Bromus {{species are}} {{generally}} considered to have little economic value to humans, at least in present times. The Tarahumara Indians in northern Mexico use the grains of some native Bromus species to aid fermentation in making one of their cultural beverages. As names like <b>poverty</b> <b>brome</b> (B. sterilis) and ripgut brome (B. diandrus) attest, some species are not very useful as fodder because their leaves sclerotize quickly and may even be harmful to livestock due to the high silica content. Others, such as meadow brome (Bromus riparius), native to parts of Russia, are planted as forage in the Great Plains of North America. Brome grasses are not usually grown as ornamental plants due to most species' nondescript appearance. Some are useful to prevent erosion but such use must be cautiously controlled as most Bromus {{have the ability to}} spread, becoming invasive weeds. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is a particularly troublesome weed across much of western North America (from southern British Columbia to California.) ...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 reduced {{efficacy}} of grass weed herbicides to <b>poverty</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus sterilis) {{was observed in}} oilseed rape on a site in East Hessen. The field was cultivated by using the ploughless tillage system more than 25 years. The site showed high densities of <b>poverty</b> <b>brome</b> (> 1000 plants/m²) prior to herbicide treatment. <b>Poverty</b> <b>brome</b> seeds were collected in 2012 in the hessian oilseed rape field and from a site in East Westphalia, where <b>poverty</b> <b>brome</b> appeared at low densities (10 plants/m²) and was not suspected to resistance. The seeds were sown in to pots and plants cultivated. The plants were treated with two application rates (normal dose, double dose) with herbicides of different HRAC-classes. The time of treatment was adjusted to the best expectable treatment/efficiency conditions of the individual herbicides (see chapter 3). Clear differences in efficacy that were caused by herbicide, the origins of <b>poverty</b> <b>brome</b> and the dosages were recorded via visual rating eight weeks after spraying. The herbicides Agil and Focus Ultra were able to control about 90 % of the <b>poverty</b> <b>brome</b> plants of the East Westphalia site origin. However, only 20 - 30 % of the Hessian plants could be knocked out by the same herbicides. The ACCase-gene of single powerty brome leaf samples from the hessian site was analyzed after resistance assessment. A molecular genetic analysis on 7 variable positions identified target site resistance: Isoleucine (Ile) was replaced by asparagine (Asn) at position 2041...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} five {{adjuvants}} (non-ionic surfactant, paraffinic oil, vegetable oil, mixture of fatty acids methyl esters plus surfactant blend, and organosilicone) on diquat efficacy was assessed on <b>poverty</b> <b>brome,</b> sterile oat, and Italian ryegrass in field and pot experiments. All tank mixtures with diquat increased diquat efficacy from 50 - 54 % to 77 - 98 % as for fresh weight reduction, indicating significant enhancement of diquat efficacy on grasses. The increased efficacy {{was most likely}} attributed to better droplet retention and diffusion on the leaf surfaces. When combined with non-ionic surfactant, diquat showed slightly more rapid control of grass weeds (i. e. symptoms were visible {{within a few hours}} after application) ...|$|E
