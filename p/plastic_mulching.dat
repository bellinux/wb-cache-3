50|$|The {{indigenous}} criollo species “soloman torbon” is {{the root}} stock which is grafted with the Chinese eggplant. It takes about 75 days for the grafting to be completed and {{to take out the}} seedling for transplanting; the yield from the grafted plant is generally about 30% more than from the non-grafted variety. Greenhouses in Taiwan and China produce two varieties of the grafted plants, Exporter 1 and Exporter 3, which are sold to the farmers at US$ 0.05 (2lps) per grafted plant without any profit margin, rotation of crops is widely practiced by the farmers; maize, Solanaceae and cucurbitaceae are the inter-crops used for crop rotation in the field. To control pests, barriers (wind breaks) of sorghum, king grass and sugar cane are created; nematodes is one of the pests which generally infests the agricultural lands, however the transplanted plants are resistant to this pest. In mainland China, planting of eggplant (as an open field vegetable) is done by <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> and inter cropping with trellised cucurbit crops.

The netting was made of high-density polyethylene (pores of 12 mm 2) and was placed just above the ground canopy about 2. 2 m above soil surface. Black <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> was used to minimize soil evaporation. The surface renewal method was used to obtain values of sensible heat flux (H) from high-frequency temperature readings. Later, latent heat flux (LE) values were obtained by solving the energy balance equation. For the May–October period, seasonal ET c was about 843 mm in 2007 and 787 mm in 2008.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of reused plastic film mulching and no-tillage on maize yield and irriga-tion water productivity(IWP) in the marginal oasis in the middle of Hexi Corridor region of northwestern China. The aim is to provide an alternative tillage and cultivation pattern for reducing plastic film pollution, saving cost and increasing income, and improving resource use efficiency. The {{field experiment}} was carried out in three soils with different textures and fertility levels. Three treatments for each soil were set up:(1) conventional tillage,winter irrigation, and new <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> cultivation(NM);(2) no tillage, less winter irrigation and reused <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> cultivation (RM);(3) no tillage, less winter irrigation and reused <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> combined with straw mulching (RMS). The results showed that the average daily soil temperature in the two reused <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> treatment(RM and RMS) during maize sowing and elongation stage was lower 0. 6 ~ 1. 0 ℃(5 cm depth) and 0. 5 ~ 0. 8 ℃(15 cm depth) than that in the NM. This result suggested that no tillage and reused <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> cultivation still had the effect of increasing soil temperature. Maize grain yield in the RM was reduced by 4. 4 %~ 10. 6 % compared with the conventional cultivation(NM), while the net income increased due to saving in plastic film and tillage ex-penses. There was no significant difference in maize grain yield between the RMS and NM treatment, but the net income in the RMS was in-creased by 12. 5 %~ 17. 1 % than that in the NM. Compared with the NM, the two reused plastic film mulching treatments (RM and RMS) decreased the volume of winter irrigation, but maize IWP increased. Soil texture and fertility level affected significantly maize nitrogen uptake and IWP.

Compared with the CF treatment, grain yields were reduced by 31. 76 – 52. 19 % under the DI treatment, by 57. 16 – 61. 02 % under the FIM treatment, by 74. 40 – 75. 73 % under the FIN treatment, which were mainly from source limitation, especially a low dry matter accumulation during post-anthesis, in non-flooded irrigation. WUE was {{the highest in the}} DI treatment, being 1. 52 – 2. 12 times higher than with the CF treatment, 1. 35 – 1. 89 times higher than with the FIM treatment, and 2. 37 – 3. 78 times higher than with the FIN treatment. The yield contribution from tillers (YCFTs) was 50. 65 – 62. 47 % for the CF treatment and 12. 07 – 20. 62 % for the non-flooded irrigation treatments. These low YCFTs values were attributed to the poor performance in tiller panicles rather than the total tiller number.

40|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> film {{plays an}} {{important}} role in development of agriculture. However, a series of problems such as pollution of plastic film residue left in the field occur. It is required to make a reasonable assessment on film mulching and rationally utilize it. Based on its application, this study proposed a concept of crop safety period of plastic film mulching, and its estimation methods. Crop safety period through plastic film mulching means the appropriate choice of a photo-selective mulch film according to the transplant season, to the pedoclimatic conditions of the area under cultivation and, finally, to the type of crop. In the days before the transplant, the <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> film should be basic whole, and it works to decrease soil moisture evaporation, to warm soil and to prevent weeds. Successively, these functions almost reduce. The selection of crop safety period of plastic film mulching is helpful to manage agricultural activities efficiently; guiding film makers to produce both meet the demand of production and lower cost of plastic products; to help farmers due to the types of crop and production conditions choosing appropriate plastic mulch film. Based on measurement of function of plastic film mulching, and crop canopy density, 2 kinds of method were established. The first one is to continuously monitor soil moisture，temperature and weed control, to build relationship between the function of soil temperature, moisture, weed suppression and mulching treatments, with that to seek the intersection of them. The coincidence point means functions disappear of <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> and the days from starting mulching to this date is a certain crop safety period in a certain site. The second is crop canopy density to determine crop safety of plastic film mulching period, which includes 2 steps: to measure the change of crop canopy density, and the functions (soil temperature and moisture etc.) of mulching under no mulching and mulching at same time, to establish the curve of crop canopy density and the main function of plastic film in order to cross the best condition between crop canopy density and the contribute of mulch films aimed to the determination of the ideal crop safeguard period. All in all, <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> film has been widely used in global, especially in China, in the past 30 years, and its application area and efficacy works better than any other agronomic practices. Concept of crop safety period of plastic film mulching has been firstly proposed in this paper, and further research in the connotation and extension of its definition still need to be developed. Moreover, the mentioned estimation methods around crop safety period of plastic film mulching showed some usefulness in cotton in Xinjiang, corn in Northeast and tobacco in southwest planting, but more extensive research, application and improvement were needed by far.

The aims of this work were to investigate photosynthetic characteristics of rice during grain filling stage under three nonflooded irrigation treatments: furrow irrigation with <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> (FIM), furrow irrigation with nonmulching (FIN), and drip irrigation with <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> (DI). Compared with the conventional flooding (CF) treatment, those grown in the nonflooded irrigation treatments showed lower net photosynthetic rate (PN), lower maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), and lower effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (ΦPSII). And the poor photosynthetic characteristics in the nonflooded irrigation treatments were mainly attributed to the low total nitrogen content (TNC). Under non-flooded irrigation, the PN, Fv/Fm, and ΦPSII significantly decreased with {{a reduction in the}} soil water potential, but these parameters were rapidly recovered in the DI and FIM treatments when supplementary irrigation was applied. Moreover, The DI treatment always had higher photosynthetic productivity than the FIM and FIN treatments. Grain yield, matter translocation, and dry matter post-anthesis (DMPA) were the highest in the CF treatment, followed by the DI, FIM, and FIN treatments in turn.

Soil mulching (with plastic or straw) reduces evaporation, modifies soil temperature and thereby affects crop yields. Reported effects of mulching are sometimes contradictory, likely {{due to differences in}} climatic conditions, soil characteristics, crop species, and also water and nitrogen (N) input levels. Here we report on a meta-analysis of the effects of mulching on wheat and maize, using 1310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries. Our results indicate that mulching significantly increased yields, WUE (yield per unit water) and NUE (yield per unit N) by up to 60 %, compared with no-mulching. Effects were larger for maize than wheat, and larger for <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> than straw mulching. Interestingly, <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> performed better at relatively low temperature while straw mulching showed the opposite trend. Effects of mulching also tended to decrease with increasing water input. Mulching effects were not related to soil organic matter content.

Conventional furrow irrigation was compared to the partial root-zone drying (PRD) irrigation system at different watering levels, with and without <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching.</b> Reducing the supplementary water to one half, under both soil-climate conditions tested, did not affect fresh tuber yield; whereas water use efficiency (WUE) was equally incremented by all the reduced water treatments.

The results showed that application of irrigation water per unit area can be reduced relative to common practice in Inner Mongolia and Gansu, maintaining the tuber yields currently obtained by local farmers. A further reduction in the amount of supplemental water, without a substantial decrease in yield, might be feasible with the PRD technique but this may require a more sophisticated irrigation management; and further research to estimate the cost-benefit ratio of such sophistication is needed.

In spite of its benefit of increasing crop yields, the booming expansion of the <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> area has been changing the landscape patterns and affecting the environment. Accurate and effective mapping of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) can provide useful information for leveraging its advantages and disadvantages. However, mapping the PMF with remote sensing is still challenging owing to its varying spectral characteristics with the crop growth and geographic spatial division. In this paper, we investigated the potential of Radarsat- 2 data for mapping PMF. We obtained the backscattering intensity of different polarizations and multiple polarimetric decomposition descriptors. These remotely-sensed information was used as input features for Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The results indicated that the features from Radarsat- 2 data have great potential for mapping PMF. The overall accuracies of PMF mapping with Radarsat- 2 data were close to 75 %. Although the classification accuracy with the back-scattering intensity information alone was relatively lower owing to the inherent speckle noise in SAR data, it has been improved significantly by introducing the polarimetric decomposition descriptors. The accuracy was nearly 75 %. In addition, the features derived from the Entropy/Anisotropy/Alpha (H/A/Alpha) polarimetric decomposition, such as Alpha, entropy, and so on, made a greater contribution to PMF mapping than the Freeman decomposition, Krogager decomposition and the Yamaguchi 4 decomposition. The performances of different classifiers were also compared. In this study, the RF classifier performed better than the SVM classifier. However, it is expected that the classification accuracy of PMF with SAR remote sensing data can be improved by combining SAR remote sensing data with optical remote sensing data...|$|E

Mean weekly soil temperatures at 2 cm depth at 1400 hrs were highest under the clear plastic and were generally lowest under the black plastic covers. The plastic covers {{did not affect the}} viability of weed seeds in soil samples collected from 0 - 3 and 0 - 5 cm depths at 6 and 10 weeks after transplanting (WAT) respectively. When the plastic mulch was removed {{at the end of the}} experiment, significantly more weeds (P< 0, 05) had emerged under the clear plastic (324 weeds per m 2;) than in the uncovered control (99 weeds per m 2) and under the black plastic (6 weeds per m 2). Plant height at 12 WAT, number of plants with flowers and fruits at 7 WAT and 10 WAT respectively, were similar in the black and clear plastic treatments, but were lower (P< 0, 05) in the uncovered control. Yield was similar among the three treatments during the first four weekly harvests but <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> resulted in significantly higher yields (P< 0, 05) than the control in the last three weeks of harvesting. Cumulative yield over the 7 -week harvesting period significantly differed (P< 0, 01) among the three treatments being 18, 6; 14, 8 and 7, 82 tonnes per ha for the clear plastic, black plastic and uncovered control respectively. The <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> treatments enhanced tomato plant growth and yield by changing the temperature and light micro-environment around the plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{winter melon}} is widely {{grown in the}} open field in Sicily on about 6000 hectares. Plants are grown in the coutryside without {{irrigation}} as the annual rain precipitation provides sufficient water for the crop. In the last decades the use of plastic mulches are necessity of removal and dispostal after usage. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate effects of polyethylene and biodegradable films (transparent or black) in combination with two planting densities, 2667 plants/ha- 1 (1 plant/hill) or 5334 plants/ha - 1 (2 plants/hill) on yield, fruit size, quality and earliness of winter melon. All mulches markedly increased early and total yields in comparison to unmulched plots. The best results ewre obtained with the highest plant density and by mulching eith either transparent PE film or transparent biodegradable film. This study demonstrated that the transparent biodegradable film is an efficiente environmentally friendly alternative to <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching...</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{necessary}} {{to pay attention to}} a leaching of nutrient from the viewpoint of the effective utilization of fertilizer and water environmental preservation. Although some literatures describe that <b>plastic</b> <b>mulching</b> system has the benefit to reduce fertilizer loss because the rain that falls in a plastic-mulching field can run into furrows immediately flowing on the impervious plastic film, the facts that the water can infiltrate to the soil through a transplanting hole have been also reported. To analyze in detail the water movement under the mulching condition the procedure to evaluate the water collection function of crop was proposed, and the results of water collection experiment were used to consider the water flow into transplanting holes. The water collection characteristics of leafy vegetables were described relating the geometry of leaves. The results of analysis for the water movement under the mulching condition indicated that the infiltalation of rainfall into transplanting holes was quite larger than the quantity of the water that broccolo crop could collect to the center...|$|E
40|$|The {{modulating}} {{effect of}} black <b>plastic</b> <b>mulch</b> on the crop growing environment, crop growth and yield of two improved cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) varieties (TMS 30572 and TMS 4 (2) 1425) bred by International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) was studied in a soil described as Typic Paleustult at the Faculty farm of University of Nigeria, Nsukka, a derived savanna belt of Nigeria. The experimental design was a 2 x 2 factorial {{arranged in a}} randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. Results show that black <b>plastic</b> <b>mulch</b> influenced a 100 % weed control in the plots mulched and raised the morning (09. 00 GMT) soil temperature to 46 %. Moisture evaporation was effectively controlled as water vapour condensed beneath the <b>plastic</b> <b>mulch</b> and fell back as droplets into the soil. The fresh root tuber yield of the cassava varieties was increased to 40. 7 % (TMS 30572) and 48 % (TMS 4 (2) 1425) while the leaf area increased from 292. 5 cm 2 to 572. 8 cm 2 in TMS 30572 and from 266. 9 cm 2 to 428. 5 cm 2 in TMS 4 (2) 1425 by the <b>plastic</b> <b>mulch.</b> Generally, all growth and yield parameters measured were significantly (P> 0. 05) improved by the application of black <b>plastic</b> <b>mulch...</b>|$|R

30|$|The results {{indicated}} that the treatment of black <b>plastic</b> <b>mulch</b> was the superior treatment in controlling broadleaved, grassy, and total weeds as compared to other treatments under study. Metribuzin herbicide came in the second rank in controlling broadleaved weeds. Concerning to grassy and total weeds, banana leaf and cheeseweed straw mulches follow the black <b>plastic</b> <b>mulch</b> ideal treatment. The results also revealed that the use of black <b>plastic</b> <b>mulch</b> and banana leaf mulch followed by cheeseweed straw mulch led to the highest significant increase in growth characteristics and tuber yield of potato plants. This in turn correlated with a significant increase in tuber contents of phosphorus, potassium, and carbohydrate percentage than unweeded control treatment.|$|R
