Switchable solvents are {{a new class of}} compounds that change properties upon the application of some stimulus such as heat, UV light, or pH. We have developed the use of a new solvent, thiirane oxide, that has chemical properties similar to DMSO. Thiirane oxide, however, undergoes facile decomposition to two gases at temperatures above 100 C, which is much lower than the temperature required for removing DMSO. Thus we have a solvent with excellent solvation properties, but with a built-in switch for easier removal. However, thiirane oxide leaves behind sulfurous products which make the reverse reaction to reform the solvent unfeasible. We are also developing the use of another solvent, <b>piperylene</b> sulfone, which is expected to have good solvent properties, yet with decomposition products that can be reacted to reform the solvent.

In order to address the challenge of sustainability, researchers have used switchable solvents for both reaction and separation by utilizing a built-in switch to undergo a step change in chemical and physical properties. This allows us to facilitate reactions in the solvent then activate the switch to enable separation and facile product recovery. Subsequently, we can recover the solvent for reuse and avoid energy- or waste-intensive separation processes; thus we are developing and using these switchable solvents as sustainable and environmentally benign alternatives to traditional processes.

30|$|Sulfolene {{solvents}} {{have been}} proposed as recyclable substitutes for DMSO. The reversible reaction between a conjugated diene and SO 2 (cheletropic reaction) shown in Fig.  1 {{is the basis for}} the recyclability of these solvents. Initial experiments concerning the decomposition process of <b>piperylene</b> sulfone, trapping the volatile compounds, and reforming the solvent has previously been reported. As mentioned before, an 87  % recovery yield was obtained [5]. The loss of 13  % of the solvent was attributed to the small scale (5  mL) of the recycle process and the accompanying material loss due to surface adhesion to the tubing in the recycling apparatus. It was appropriate therefore to demonstrate the efficiency of the recycle process on a scale and in equipment which would minimize material losses. The results for the recycling of PS and BS reported here were conducted in the apparatus described in the “Experimental” section (Fig.  2). Each of the pure sulfolenes was allowed to undergo a thermal retro-cheletropic process at a specific temperature for a specified length of time. PS and BS undergo decomposition at a reasonable rate at 120 and 135  °C, respectively [23]. The pertinent processes were conducted on a 20  mL scale and compared to results conducted on a 5  mL scale. The products of the decomposition (the conjugated diene and SO 2) were captured and allowed to react to reform the original sulfolene. The overall process was meant to demonstrate the recyclability of these solvents. In this latter part of the process specific ratios of diene to SO 2 were investigated in the absence and in the presence of polymerization inhibitors. Table  1 summarizes the final results obtained for both PS and BS. Entries 1 and 2 show the effect of reaction scale for the recycle of PS. It is observed that increasing the amount of starting PS from 5 to 20  mL increased the recovery from an acceptable 89  ±  2  % to a near quantitative 98.3  ±  0.3  %. In addition, {{it is interesting to note}} that even though the molar ratio of SO 2 to <b>piperylene</b> in the reforming step was reduced from 8 to 6, the yield of PS was still excellent. Vinci’s result of 87  % recovery was performed at a 5  mL scale [5]. The results reported herein are consistent with his data.|$|E

Rate constants for hydrogen abstraction and thermal deactivation of the excited species have been estimated. The π-π* triplet states of the two carbonyl compounds are responsible for the hydrogen abstraction reaction. The naphthoyl compounds do not undergo photoreduction by secondary alcohols. Their low reactivity is attributed {{to the fact that the}} π-π* rather than the n-π* triplet is involved.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of the dimerization of butadiene and <b>piperylene</b> and the thermal rearrangements of the corresponding dimers are investigated by kinetic and stereochemical techniques. Particular attention {{is given to}} the question whether, in the Diets-Alder dimerization of the dienes la or lb, intermediates are involved that are common to the 1, 3 -sigmatropic rearrangements of the corresponding (2 + 2] dimers 3 a and 3 b. Substituents on the terminal vinyl position of cis- 1, 2 -divinylcyelobutane (Sa) retard the normal stereospecific boat-like Cope rearrangement to 3, 4 -dimethyl-cis,cis-cycloocta- 1, 5 -diene and permit the detection of a new "nonboat" process, whicp leads to a stereoisomeric pr 6 duct. The boat-like rate constant declines with increasing terminal cis-methyl sustitution in the series Sa > cTT- 8 > cCT- 8 > cCC- 8. The total range of the effect amounts to a factor of 1. 81 X I 05. The trans- 1, 2 -dipropenylcyclobutanes also give Cope rearrangement products, but this reaction occurs exclusively by an indirect mechanism: prior epimerization to the cis isomer followed by Cope rearrangement of the latter. The rearrangement of trans- 3, 4 -dimethyl-cis,trans-cycloocta- 1, 5 -diene (16) to cis- 3, 4 -dimethyl cis,cis-cycloocta- 1, 5 -diene (10), involving overall epimerization at one asymmetric center and geometric isomerization at one olefinic site, proceeds by a two-step mechanism in which cis. - 1, 2 -trans,trans-dipropenylcyclobutane (cTT- 8) is an intermediate. The 1, 3 -sigmatropic rearrangement of (I R, 2 R) -(+) -trans- 1, 2 -divinylcyclobutane (3 a) gives (R) -(+) - 4 -vinylcyclohexene (2 a) with 7. 7 % preservation of enantiomeric purity (corrected for competing racemization of 3 a). This corresponds to 54 % inversion and 46 % retention of configuration of the migrant carbon. By attaching stereochemical labels to the terminal vinyl positions as in optically active tTT- 9 and tCT- 9, the stereochemistry of the 1, 3 -sigmatropic rearrangement can be subdivided into the four possible pathways (Schemes IX and X), suprafacial inversion, antarafacial retention, suprafacial retention, and antarafacial inversion. In this way, it can be shown that relative rates through these four pathways are, respectively, 50. 2, 6. 0, 41. 1, and 2. 7 from tTT- 9, and 49. 5, 2. 8, 46. 8, and 0. 9 from tCT- 9. These results can be fitted by a biradical mechanism, but are more fruitfully interpreted as mainly the outcome of two competing concerted reactions, one allowed (suprafacial inversion) and one forbidden (suprafacial retention). The absence of any substantial antara contribution in the dipropenyl systems rules out a stereorandom biradical intermediate in the tTT- 9 and tCT- 9 rearrangements and makes it unlikely in the divinyl system 3 a. The Diels-Alder dimerization of trans-penta- 1, 3 -diene-trans-J -d (4 S, Scheme XIV) in both the exo and endo orientations gives exclusively the product of reaction cis-on-the-diene,cis-on-the-dienophile. This is consistent with a concerted [4 s + 2 s]cycloaddition and rules out common intermediates in the formation of product tT- 13 and cT- 12 from the two alternative pathways of Diels-Alder dimerization of <b>piperylene</b> and 1, 3 -sigmatropic rearrangement of tTT- 9...|$|E

PART I:	The photodimerization of cyclohexenone {{has been studied}} in the neat liquid and in solvents. Although four products can be detected, 1 and 2 predominate under all conditions. The reaction can be sensitized by benzophenone, thioxanthone, acetophenone, and naphthalene. The enone {{was used as a}} sensitizer for the cis- trans isomerization of three pairs of isomeric olefins and the response was used to estimate the triplet excitation energy of the enone as 61 ± 1 kcal per mole. Dimerization can be quenched by addition of <b>piperylene.</b> Most evidence points to a triplet mechanism for the reaction. However, the ratio of 1 to 2 varies with reaction conditions and the quantum yield does not show the expected variation with enone concentration. These phenomena are attributed to solvent effects, rather than to a change of mechanism. [illustration] PART II: Gamma-irradiation of benzophenone in cyclohexene solution produced 3, 3 '-dicyclohexenyl and cyclohexenyldiphenylcarbinol as main products. The reaction was quenched by phenyl disulfide and to a less extent by chloroform. It was not significantly affected by 2 -propanol. Naphthalene also acted as a quencher. The reaction probably involved the cleavage of the allylic C-H bond of cyclohexene to a cyclohexenyl radical and a hydrogen atom. Benzophenone effectively took up the hydrogen atom to give a ketyl radical. The main cross product, cyclohexenyldiphenylcarbinol, resulted from a combination of the ketyl radical with the cyclohexenyl radical. Quenching by naphthalene was taken to be an indication that excited states of cyclohexene played an important role, probably as a precursor of cyclohexenyl radical. This was supported by the fact that gamma-irradiation or cis- or trans- 2, 3 -diphenylpropenes in cyclohexene solution resulted in isomerization. That benzophenone did not act as an energy sink in cyclohexene was probably due to inefficient energy transfer from an excited cyclohexene triplet to benzophenone...|$|E

The higher level of gating that occurs in 3 b is attributed to a shorter lifetime for the axial DPSO triplet, caused by an efficient through-space intraTTET from the axial DPSO group to the C 6 exocyclic olefin. ^ The compound 17 β-(dimethylphenylsilyloxy) - 3 -Z-ethylidene- 5 α-androstane- 6 -one (11), and its 17 α-dimethylphenylsilyloxy isomer (12) showed that the C 6 ketones act as singlet-triplet switches, providing a 5 x increase in the olefin isomerization yields vs. the non-ketonic models. In general, a 17 β-DPSO donor gives a lower quantum efficiency for both intraSSET and intraTTET vs. a 17 α-DPSO isomer. This is attributed to interaction with the C 18 methyl group for the β-orientation, reducing the number of favorable conformations available for energy transfer. ...|$|E
