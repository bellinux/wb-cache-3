Reynolds would then play the {{remainder}} of the game, with his responses being even dumber than Macdonald's. However, Macdonald was fired from SNL before that sketch could be written.|$|E

500|$|Vig started doubting {{it could}} be done fully analog once the tapes for the first song recorded, [...] "Miss the Misery", started falling apart, but Grohl {{reassured}} him [...] "no, Butch, I don't want any computer in this house at all." [...] The producer said that during recording he [...] "had to force my brain to fire different synapses" [...] to remember {{how to deal with the}} analog equipment and the lack of a digital display. One of the habits Vig had to call back was editing using a razor blade—"I used to be able to do 20 edits in half an hour if need be. It took me about 20 minutes to do the first edit!"—a technique he employed for the first songs recorded. Eventually he gave up and decided to punch in and <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> tapes instead, as the process was time-consuming and a more editable tape sent to Vig from Smart Studios was mostly ruined by one of Grohl's daughters. While many recordings had inserts and some parts rerecorded, the only song that had to be redone from scratch was [...] "I Should Have Known", as Grohl felt Vig was [...] "trying to make this into a radio single" [...] when the singer wanted it [...] "to sound really raw and primal".|$|E
500|$|... "The Don" [...] {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics, with Nas's lyrics drawing particular praise. Rico Barrino of Artistdirect praised Nas's rapping as {{being able to}} impress in different contexts, calling his lyrics [...] "both catchy and commanding" [...] and noted his [...] "precise, potent lyrical poetry honed by 20 years in the game". Writing for MTV News, Rob Markman called the production [...] "a sonic departure" [...] from Nas' previous work, but complimented his lyrics as [...] "vintage" [...] and pointed out {{the consistency of the}} lyrical quality throughout the song. In his review of [...] "The Don" [...] for About.com, Henry Adaso described the song as [...] "the type of lyrical exercise Nas only throws down once or twice per album", and that songs such as [...] "The Don" [...] gave a case for Nas' inclusion [...] "as one of hip-hop's all-time greats", also picking up on his [...] "assured" [...] boasts and the [...] "quiet confidence" [...] enveloped in his tone. Adaso also expressed a positive response towards the song's production, expressing his surprise that having three different producers working on the song had not led to a [...] "case of too many cooks in the kitchen", writing that [...] "instead, we get a cohesive, hard-hitting, face-melting, reggae-tinged beat". A reviewer of the song for DJBooth wrote of Nas' performance as [...] "at turns wistful, threatening and braggadocious", and praised the production's [...] "compulsively head-noddable groove". In their review of Life Is Good, Sputnikmusic recommended [...] "The Don" [...] to first-time listeners of Nas, stating to be an exhibition of Nas' [...] "incredible lyrical structures" [...] and [...] "how rapidly this guy can <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> the syllables". They also noted it as a [...] "change of pace" [...] from the more downtempo material on Life Is Good. In his review of Life Is Good for Prefix Magazine, Charlie Kaplan called [...] "The Don" [...] the album's [...] "clear highlight" [...] and felt it a fitting tribute to Heavy D's life and work, writing that it [...] "raises a glass to the recently departed overweight lover with a vivid tour of New York rap's classic soundscapes".

Sebastian wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on his albums Beautiful Life and Closer to the Sun, and all the tracks on his albums Like It Like That and Armageddon. In an article in The Daily Telegraph, Kathy McCabe said of his songwriting skills, [...] "Sebastian has matured into a genuine hitmaker, his gift with melody so finely-honed he can pretty much <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> a catchy number in his sleep." [...] Jamie Horne wrote in The Border Mail, [...] "The inaugural winner's longevity [...] {{can be attributed to the}} fact that he's an accomplished musician and songwriter" [...] and AllMusic reviewer Jon O'Brien said, [...] "it's a testament to his vocal abilities and songwriting skills that, unlike many of his fellow winners, he's remained popular enough to see out his rather ambitious Sony contract [...] a subtle and natural progression with each album, explains why he's managed to survive once the show's publicity machine died down." ...|$|E

6000|$|Elizabeth's {{work was}} of a more social sort. There was a fashion for {{covering}} the private apartments of the very wealthy with metal plates beautifully embossed with repeated patterns. The taste of the time demanded, however, that the repetition of the patterns should not be exact--not mechanical, but [...] "natural"--and {{it was found that}} the most pleasing arrangement of pattern irregularity was obtained by employing women of refinement and natural taste to <b>punch</b> <b>out</b> the patterns with small dies. So many square feet of plates was exacted from Elizabeth as a minimum, and for whatever square feet she did in excess she received a small payment. The room, like most rooms of women workers, was under a manageress: men had been found by the Labour Company not only less exacting but extremely liable to excuse favoured ladies from a proper share of their duties. The manageress was a not unkindly, taciturn person, with the hardened remains of beauty of the brunette type; and the other women workers, who of course hated her, associated her name scandalously with one of the metal-work directors in order to explain her position.|$|E
