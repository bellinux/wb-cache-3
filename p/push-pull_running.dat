25|$|In 1970, NIR {{purchased}} {{a fleet of}} eight new-build Mark 2B's to run with the 101 Class on the cross-border Enterprise service. These were painted in a maroon and blue livery and were fitted for <b>push-pull</b> <b>running.</b> Between 1981 and 1983, to compliment {{the arrival of the}} 111 Class and enhance the Enterprise service, NIR purchased 12 second-hand Mark 2's, of the B, C and F varieties, from British Rail. Some of the 1970-built coaches were refurbished for use in the new service. In the final years before the withdrawal of the 101's in 1989, they worked with Mark 2's to form suburban push-pull trains. Further Mark 2B's and F's were ordered in 1989 as part of a modernisation scheme by NIR. One notable vehicle was Mark 2F No. 904, which retained its British Rail livery in service with NIR. By 1997, all Mark 2's had been withdrawn following introduction of the DeDietrich rolling stock on the Enterprise. Today, five of these coaches survive - No.'s 300, 305 and buffet No. 547, all under the ownership of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland, No. 546, in use in England with West Coast Railways as No. 1800, and No. 911 (See below.) A sixth, No. 901, survived in Dalton, England until July 2012 when it was finally scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The DB {{converted}} several Class 78s for <b>push-pull</b> <b>running</b> e.g. between Frankfurt and Wiesbaden. Because {{the engine}} {{driver in the}} driving coach could only work the brake, operation of the regulator and reversing gear {{was carried out by}} specially trained stokers as signalled by the engine driver. The last locomotives were retired by the DB in the mid-1970s at Rottweil locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw). The farewell journey for this engine class and, at the same time for the Class 38s (Prussian P 8), took place on 31 December 1974. The event was organised by the Zollern Railway Friends. The trip was even reported on the German television channel, ARD.|$|E
