40|$|Low (2 %) oxygen {{conditions}} during <b>postcompaction</b> {{culture of}} bovine blastocysts improve embryo quality and {{are associated with}} small increases in the expression of glucose transporter 1 (SLC 2 A 1), anaphase promoting complex (ANAPC 1), and myo-trophin (MTPN), suggesting a role for oxygen in the regulation of embryo development, mediated through oxygen-sensitive gene expression. However, bovine embryos, to at least the blastocyst stage, lack detectable levels of the key regulator of oxygen-sensitive gene expression, hypoxia-inducible 1 alpha (HIF 1 A), while the less well-characterized HIF 2 alpha protein is readily detectable. Here we report that other key HIF 1 regulated genes are not significantly altered in their expression pattern in bovine blastocysts in response to reduced oxygen concentrations postcompaction—with the exception of lactate dehydrogenas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The accumulator-based {{compaction}} (ABC) technique uses an accumulator {{to generate}} a composite fault signature for a circuit under test. The error coverage for this method has been previously analyzed using Markov chains. We describe an alternative technique for calculating the error coverage of ABC using the asymmetric error model. This technique relies on the central limit theorem of statistics and {{can be applied to}} other count-based compaction schemes. Our analysis shows that ABC provides very high coverage of asymmetric errors. Experiments on the actual fault coverage for the ISCAS 85 benchmark circuits show that extremely high <b>postcompaction</b> fault coverage (close to 100 %) is obtained with ABC. They also indicate that the use of a rotate–carry adder does not always improve the fault coverage; in some cases, the fault coverage is actually reduced. I...|$|E
40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} is {{a useful}} route to forming particulate composite materials; however, the densification of hard and soft powder mixtures is usually inhibited by the more refractory phase. The Bi-W powder compacts were uniaxially pressed at room temperature and the compaction behavior and mechanical properties were evaluated. Pressing was performed in incremental steps from ~ 1 to 540  MPa. After each step, the pressure was relieved and the thickness and sound-wave transit time were measured in situ (in the die), {{in order to determine}} the density and sound-wave velocity in the compact. The data show that the unreinforced Bi powder compacts to ~ 98  pct density at 540  MPa. The W reinforcement inhibits the densification process, resulting in increased levels of residual porosity. The compaction behavior was evaluated using a modified Heckel equation, while the porosity dependence of the ultrasonically determined elastic modulus was described by a site percolation approach. <b>Postcompaction</b> sound-wave velocity and Vicker’s hardness measurements show < 5  pct anisotropy between the axial (pressing) and radial directions. The mechanical characterization illustrates the competing effects of the W reinforcement and the associated residual porosity...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{repeated}} load triaxial {{tests were conducted}} in this study to investigate the influences of compaction density and <b>postcompaction</b> moisture variation on the dynamic elastic modulus (Ed) and plastic permanent strain (PPS) of compacted lateritic soil. Specimens were compacted at optimum moisture content (OMC) and three degrees of compaction (90 %, 93 %, and 96 %). Then the specimens were dried or wetted to different moisture contents (OMC, OMC± 3 %, OMC± 6 %, and OMC+ 9 %) prior to testing for Ed and PPS. Results show that moisture content has greater influence on the Ed and PSS than compaction degree, {{and the increase in}} moisture content leads to a decrease of Ed and an increase of PPS. Furthermore, an empirical relationship between Ed and applied cyclic stress (σd) is developed that incorporates density and moisture variations. Three different evolution types of PPS with number of load cycles, plastic stable, plastic creep, and incremental collapse, are identified as the increase of moisture content. In addition, the critical dynamic stress (σdc) separating stable and unstable deformation is determined based on the shakedown concept. The envelope curves of σdc-moisture of lateritic soil with different degrees of compaction are also determined to provide reference for the pavement design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Modulo 2 n ÿ 1 adders {{as fast as}} n-bit 2 ’s {{complement}} adders {{have been}} recently proposed in the open literature. This makes a Residue Number System (RNS) adder with channels based on the moduli 2 n, 2 n ÿ 1, and any other of the form 2 k ÿ 1, with k < n, faster than RNS adders based on other moduli. In this paper, we formally derive a parametric, {{with respect to the}} adder size, test set, for parallel testing of the channels of an RNS adder based on moduli of the form 2 n; 2 n ÿ 1; 2 k ÿ 1; 2 l ÿ 1; [...] .; with l < k < n. The derived test set is reusable; it can be used for any value of n; k; l; [...] ., regardless of the implementation library used and is composed of n 2 2 test vectors. A test-per-clock BIST scheme is also proposed that applies the derived test vectors within n 2 2 n cycles. Static CMOS implementations reveal that the proposed BIST offers 100 percent <b>postcompaction</b> fault coverage and an attractive combination of test time and implementation area compared to ROM and FSM-based deterministic BIST or LFSR-based pseudorandom BIST.

40|$|Oxygen {{concentrations}} {{used during}} in vitro embryo culture can influence embryo development, cell numbers, and gene expression. Here we {{propose that the}} preimplantation bovine embryo possesses a molecular mechanism for the detection of, and response to, oxygen, mediated by a family of basic helix-loophelix transcription factors, the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Day 5 compacting bovine embryos were cultured under different oxygen tensions (2 %, 7 %, 20 %) and {{the effect on the}} expression of oxygen-regulated genes, development, and cell number allocation and HIFa protein localization were examined. Bovine in vitro-produced embryos responded to variations in oxygen concentration by altering gene expression. GLUT 1 expression was higher following 2 % oxygen culture compared with 7 % and 20 % cultured blastocysts. HIF mRNA expression (HIF 1 a, HIF 2 a) was unaltered by oxygen concentration. HIF 2 a protein was predominantly localized to the nucleus of blastocysts. In contrast, HIF 1 a protein was undetectable at any oxygen concentration or {{in the presence of the}} HIF protein stabilizer desferrioxamine (DFO), despite being detectable in cumulus cells following normal maturation conditions, acute anoxic culture, or in the presence of DFO. Oxygen concentration also significantly altered inner cell mass cell proportions at the blastocyst stage. These results suggest that oxygen can influence gene expression in the bovine embryo during <b>postcompaction</b> development and that these effects may be mediated by HIF 2 a. A. J. Harvey, K. L.

40|$|Oxygen is a {{powerful}} regulator of preimplantation embryo development, affecting gene expression, the proteome, and energy metabolism. Even a transient exposure to atmospheric oxygen can {{have a negative impact}} on embryo development, which is greatest prior to compaction, and subsequent post-compaction culture at low oxygen cannot alleviate this damage. In spite of this evidence, the majority of human in vitro fertilization is still performed at atmospheric oxygen. One of the physiological parameters shown to be affected by the relative oxygen concentration, carbohydrate metabolism, is linked to the ability of the mammalian embryo to develop in culture and remain viable after transfer. The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine the effect of oxygen concentration on the ability of mouse embryos to utilize both amino acids and carbohydrates both before and after compaction. Metabolomic and fluorometric analysis of embryo culture media revealed that when embryos were exposed to atmospheric oxygen during the cleavage stages, they exhibited significantly greater amino acid utilization and pyruvate uptake than when cultured under 5 % oxygen. In contrast, <b>postcompaction</b> embryos cultured in atmospheric oxygen showed significantly lower mean amino acid utilization and glucose uptake. These metabolic changes correlated with developmental compromise because embryos grown in atmospheric oxygen at all stages showed significantly lower blastocyst formation and proliferation. These findings confirm the need to consider both embryo development and metabolism in establishing optimal human embryo growth conditions and prognostic markers of viability, and further highlight the impact of oxygen on such vital parameters. blastocyst, culture, early development, embryo, glucose, in vitro fertilization, metabolism, viabilit...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of ammonium in culture medium has a detri-mental effect on embryo physiology and biochemistry; however, {{the stage at}} which the embryo is most sensitive to this effect is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the exact stage at which the embryo is most vulnerable to ammonium by exposing the preimplantation embryo to 300 lM ammonium either at the precompaction stage (between the zygote and two-cell or the two-cell to eight-cell) or at the <b>postcompaction</b> stage (between the eight-cell and blastocyst). This study determined that exposure of embryos to ammonium at the precompaction stage from either the zygote to two-cell stage or from the two-cell to the eight-cell stage did not affect the rate of development to the blastocyst stage; however, the resultant blastocysts had decreased cell numbers and inner cell mass cells. Furthermore, these blastocysts had increased levels of cellular apoptosis and perturbed levels of Slc 2 a 3 expression and glucose uptake. Transfer of these blastocysts revealed that, while implantation was not affected, the number of fetuses was reduced by culture with ammonium at the precompaction stage and fetal de-velopment was delayed, as observed by reduced crown-rump length and maturity. In contrast, the later stage embryo was more resistant to the negative effects of ammonium, with only Slc 2 a 3 expression and fetal maturity affected. This raises the possibility that the later stage embryo is more able to protect itself from in vitro-derived stress and that the majority of in vitro-induced damage to mouse embryos is inflicted at the early stages of development. assisted reproductive technology, early development, embryo, gene regulation, in vitro fertilizatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} strength of pharmaceutical tablets {{is an important}} quality factor that is tested during tablet production to ensure that tablets endure <b>postcompaction</b> loading. Diametrical compression test {{is the most common}} method to measure the breaking force of the tablet. Converting the breaking load into a value of tensile strength is analytically done for flat cylindrical tablets by Hertz solution. However, stress analysis is not simple for more complicated geometries of tablets. There have been various empirical solutions presented to calculate the tensile strength of doubly convex tablets based on experimental data. This study aims to find the optimum relationship between the breaking force of a doubly convex tablet to the material tensile strength subject to diametrical compression. Here we assume that tensile strength is a material property which solely depends on the relative density of the tablet. By testing a small number of flat faced tablets, we can easily find the relationship between the tensile strength and relative density of the tablets. Utilizing this relationship enables us to construct our optimization problem by relating the tensile strength of a flat faced tablet to a doubly convex one having the same relative density. However, we should restrict attention to the failure pattern which corresponds to crack formation and propagation under pure tensile stress as the case seen in a flat tablet. The proposed model is reducible to the Hertz solution and thus can be applied for flat-faced tablets as well. It is observed that a small number of accurate measurements of flat tablets are sufficient for obtaining a representative calibration when the equation is forced to reduce to the Hertz solution. We made a rigorous comparison between all the proposed models by applying three equivalent optimization problems and calculating the corresponding two norms. Because we cannot eliminate experimental errors, we tried to minimize the norm to provide more stability. At the end, we have determined the most stable optimization problem and conclude that our model shows a better fit compared with the earlier models...|$|E
