25|$|Power is {{transferred}} from the engine to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential transaxle with an integrated spool differential. The individual gear ratios and the final drive ratio are fixed with drop gears {{at the front of}} the transaxle allowing the teams to alter the overall transmission ratio for different circuits. The cars use a triple <b>plate</b> <b>clutch.</b> The cars run on E85 fuel with a fuel tank capacity of 112 litres.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequential}} shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted, but clutchless, {{without the}} need for a clutch lever control, using instead a centrifugal clutch along with a <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> slaved to the footchange lever to engage and disengage the gearbox from the engine. While not intuitive to learn, once the rider got used to it, the semi-automatic transmission, [...] "took the terror out of motorcycling" [...] for novice riders. Unlike many scooter CVTs, the centrifugal clutch made it possible to push start the Super Cub, a useful advantage if the need arose.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a mechanical clutch which limits transmission of torque to a desired, predetermined maximum torque from a first <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> to a second <b>clutch</b> <b>plate.</b> More specifically, the mechanical clutch includes at least one stepper member, preferably three or more evenly spaced stepper members, which transmit the torque from a first <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> to a second <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> providing a desired maximum torque is not exceeded. However, if the desired maximum torque is exceeded, the stepper member will rotate and move between the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> so that the torque to the second <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> does not exceed the desired maximum torque. The desired maximum torque is set by the axial force compressing the stepper member between the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> and when the applied torque to the first <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> exceeds the desired torque, the stepper member will rotate between the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> rather than transmit that torque to the second <b>clutch</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

40|$|A <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> is a {{significant}} component used in all motor vehicles nowadays, {{which is used to}} transmit power produced by the engine to the gear box. A pressure plate which is used for engaging and disengaging the clutch applies pressure on the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate,</b> which results in small deformation and stress concentration in the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate.</b> The aim of this work was to design a single disk frictio n <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> made of Kevlar 29 and optimize the design, based on static analysis performed on the clutch using Ansys workbench software.

50|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> {{was blocked}} with the engine. Power was {{transmitted}} {{by a long}} shaft with universal joints to the three-speed sliding-gear manual gearbox with reverse. This was located in a housing at the rear axle which also contained the differential. The car used shaft drive from the beginning, although many other high-powered cars at this time relied on double-chain drive.|$|E
50|$|In 1923 a {{new model}} was {{announced}} with the engine enlarged to 1944 cc and the name changed to Gwynne-Albert. A <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> replaced the previous cone one and the suspension changed to semi-elliptic leaf springs. From 1925 front wheel brakes were fitted. About 200 of the larger-engined cars were built, with the last ones being sold possibly as late as 1929.|$|E
50|$|This type {{is similar}} to a {{friction}} <b>plate</b> <b>clutch.</b> Over-torque will cause the plates to slip. A simple example is found in a fixed-spool fishing reel, where the slipping torque is set by means of a large hand nut in order that the reel will turn and allow more line to unwind before the line breaks under the pull of a fish.|$|E
50|$|The {{slipper clutch}} {{consists}} of two bases, one with dog clutches and ramps with ball bearings, a splined hub, and <b>clutch</b> <b>plates.</b> In normal operation, the dog clutches mate, driving the transmission. When a back torque comes from the transmission, the splined hub slides up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{clutches}} damp torsional vibrations. Both running-wheels, {{pump and}} turbine, correspond to two masses, which are coupled by fluid. The masses replace the double-mass-flywheel of passenger-cars. In {{the case of}} fuel cut-off in the overturn, hydrodynamic clutches {{can be used as}} a retarder. Compared to single dry <b>plate</b> <b>clutches,</b> hydrodynamic clutches transfer the power without wear. The present doctoral dissertation describes construction and experimental testing of two hydrodynamic clutches. The blades of one of the two running-wheels swing round radial axes. The angle of attack variates. The tests fhow higher efficiency compared to hydrodynamic clutches with axial movable blades. The designed hydrodynamic clutches offer substantial lower switching times than clutches with volumetric control. The diagram of a 100 kW-engine, lines of resistance of the belonging passenger-car and characteristic curves of the clutches show their stationary operating performance. (orig.)
