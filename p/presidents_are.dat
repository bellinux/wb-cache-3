5|$|The {{rights of}} the former <b>presidents</b> <b>are</b> defined by a {{parliamentary}} Act enacted in 2004, during the first term of Stjepan Mesić. Before that act was enacted, the constitution provided that the former presidents shall become members of the Chambers of Counties of the Parliament of Croatia for life, unless otherwise requested by the president. This was never exercised in practice, since Franjo Tuđman died in office and the Chamber of Counties was abolished {{before the end of}} the first term of Stjepan Mesić.|$|E
5|$|In {{surveys of}} U.S. {{scholars}} ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently {{ranked in the}} top three, often as number one.

In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls.

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, <b>presidents</b> <b>are</b> the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E

5|$|The President of Croatia {{is elected}} for a five-year term by a direct vote of all {{citizens}} in a majority system, requiring runoff elections if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of {{votes in the}} first round. Members of Parliament are elected for a four-year term in ten multi-seat constituencies, with additional members elected in special constituencies reserved for the Croatian diaspora and national minorities.

Out of 31 political parties which won seats in Croatian parliamentary elections held since 1990, only six have won ten seats or more in any one parliamentary election. Those were the Croatian Democratic Union, the Croatian Peasant Party, the Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats, the Croatian Social Liberal Party, Social Democratic Party of Croatia and the Bridge of Independent Lists.
