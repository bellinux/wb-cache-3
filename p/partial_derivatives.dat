5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its <b>partial</b> <b>derivatives</b> all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the <b>partial</b> <b>derivatives</b> called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|The same {{experimental}} data shows that time {{as measured by}} clocks in a gravitational field—proper time, to give the technical term—does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The metric tensor that defines the geometry—in particular, how lengths and angles are measured—is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first <b>partial</b> <b>derivatives</b> and the connection coefficients vanish).|$|E
