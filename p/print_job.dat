50|$|The HP ePrint Enterprise server accepts print jobs {{using two}} primary protocols: http/https and SMTP. Once the HP ePrint Enterprise private cloud {{printing}} service accepts a <b>print</b> <b>job</b> message, it converts the <b>print</b> <b>job</b> into an appropriate printer language (PCL or Postscript) via an internal rendering process and submits {{it to the}} printer or MFP via TCP port 9100. HP ePrint Enterprise server is capable of processing multiple print jobs simultaneously by using a message queue service {{with the ability to}} track the progress of each individual <b>print</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an Internet {{protocol}} for communication between computers and printers (or print server). It allows programs to send {{one or more}} <b>print</b> <b>jobs</b> to the printer or print server and perform administration such as querying {{the status of a}} printer, obtaining the status of <b>print</b> <b>jobs,</b> or cancelling individual <b>print</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Printer Spooling - Later {{versions}} of the Econet printer server software used printer spooling to locally cache <b>print</b> <b>jobs</b> before sending to the remote printer. This ensured whole <b>print</b> <b>jobs</b> {{were sent to the}} printer in one go.|$|R

50|$|Not {{including}} {{resources in}} a <b>print</b> <b>job</b> {{leads to the}} potential problem of version control. PPML solves this problem by allowing the producer of the <b>print</b> <b>job</b> to specify a checksum for each resource that is referenced. A checksum is a large number that is calculated from {{the contents of a}} resource. By comparing a given checksum against the checksum of the resource in the cache the printer can check that it has the correct version of the resource.|$|E
50|$|Among {{traditional}} publishers, POD {{services can}} be used to make sure that books remain available when one <b>print</b> <b>job</b> has sold out, but another has not yet become available. This maintains the availability of older titles the estimated future sales of which may not be great enough to justify a further conventional <b>print</b> <b>job.</b> This can be useful for publishers with large backlists, such that sales for individual titles may be few but cumulative sales may be significant.|$|E
50|$|Separating the ink storage {{from the}} {{printhead}} may also allow the tank to be refilled or replaced while a <b>print</b> <b>job</b> is in progress. With ink tanks {{located on the}} printhead, replacement typically requires repriming and alignment checks that necessarily require aborting any current <b>print</b> <b>job.</b> Separated ink tanks can be refilled or reprimed without disrupting a very large or expensive printing task, such as printing a 2 meter wide by 10 meter long outdoor banner.|$|E

50|$|The design {{problem was}} that a single Job class was used by {{almost all of the}} tasks. Whenever a <b>print</b> <b>job</b> or a {{stapling}} job needed to be performed, a call was made to the Job class. This resulted in a 'fat' class with multitudes of methods specific to a variety of different clients. Because of this design, a staple job would know about all the methods of the <b>print</b> <b>job,</b> even though there was no use for them.|$|E

50|$|Xerox's {{printing}} language, Interpress, was a binary-formatted {{standard for}} controlling laser printers. The designers of this language, John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, later left Xerox PARC to start Adobe Systems. Before leaving, they realized {{the difficulty of}} specifying a binary print language, where functions to serialize the <b>print</b> <b>job</b> were cumbersome and which {{made it difficult to}} debug errant printing jobs. To realize the value of specifying both a programmable and easily debug-able <b>print</b> <b>job</b> in ASCII, Warnock and Geschke created the Postscript language as one of their first products at Adobe.|$|E
