The [...] EPBT is defined as [...] " [...] {{the time needed to}} compensate for the total renewable- and non-renewable- primary energy required during the life cycle of a PV system". A 2015 review of EPBT from first and second generation PV suggested that there was greater variation in embedded energy than in efficiency of the cells implying that it was mainly the embedded energy that needs to reduce to have a greater reduction in EPBT. One difficulty in determining impacts due to PV is to determine if the wastes are released to the air, water, or soil during the manufacturing phase. Research is underway to try to understand emissions and releases during the lifetime of PV systems.|$|E

The three basic methods of energy accounting are currently input/output table analysis, statistical analysis and process analysis. In turn, these are briefly described and then illustrated by some recent examples of their application. The use of input/output table analysis to explore the effect of rising energy costs on industrial prices is described; this was an important input to the 1974 National Economic Development Office report on energy. This {{is followed by a}} discussion of how and when a knowledge of the energy intensity of capital goods can be used to assess energy <b>pay-back</b> <b>times</b> and energy gain ratios in considering possible new sources of energy. The statistical method is illustrated first by referring to the estimation of energy overheads for the various fuel industries and, secondly, by showing the very detailed energy inputs which have to be accounted in determining the average energy requirement of a typical industrial commodity, viz. iron castings. Finally, the method of process energy analysis, as advocated by the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study (IFIAS), is briefly described and its application to a study of the iron casting industry by ETSU referred to. ...|$|R

Sixteen different, grid-connected photovoltaic systems were studied for the situation in Switzerland in the year 2005. They are manufactured as panels or laminates, from silicon or thin-films, installed on façades, slanted or flat roofs, and have 3 kWp capacity. Furthermore average photovoltaic production mix data have been investigated for more than 20 countries. The process data include the full process chain for panel and laminate production, mounting structure, 30 years operation and dismantling. The ecoinvent data v 1. 0 have been updated with information from new research projects and manufacturer data. The LCI for photovoltaic electricity shows that each production stage is important for certain elementary flows.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the energy requirements of PV modules and systems and calculate the Energy <b>Pay-Back</b> <b>Time</b> for three major PV applications. Based on {{a review of}} past energy analysis studies we explain the main sources of differences and establish a "best estimate" for key system components. For present-day c-Si modules {{the main source of}} uncertainty is the preparation of silicon feedstock from semiconductor industry scrap. Therefore a low and a high estimate are presented for energy requirement of c-Si. The low estimates of 4200 respectively 6000 MJ (primary energy) per m 2 module area are probably most representative for near-future, frameless mc-Si and sc-Si modules. For a-Si thin film modules we estimate energy requirements at 1200 MJ/m 2 for present technology. Present-day and future energy requirements have also been estimated for the BOS in array field systems, rooftop systems and Solar Home Systems.

In the study presented in this paper, an analytic model was built for examining the environmental and economic benefits of integrated EER systems. Then the improvement on the total powertrain efficiency and net reduction of CO emissions were investigated, {{in terms of the}} average vehicle used in the UK. Results show that, for light duty vehicles fitted with thermal cycle EER system, the cost increase could be paid back in 10. 1 years and CO emission could be paid back in just 1. 9 years, compared to Hybrid Electric Vehicle's (HEV's) 11. 9 years and 1. 4 years for cost and CO emission, respectively. When the annual fuel price increase is considered, the cost pay-back is reduced to 8. 1 years for EER vehicles and 8. 9 years for HEVs.

40|$|An energy {{accounting}} {{study has}} been made of the five alternative energy resource systems [...] solar, geothermal, wind, wave and tidal power. Owing to a lack of suitable data, a consistent methodology could not be pursued and a detailed comparison of these five systems with regard to likely energy ratios is not possible at the present time. (The energy ratio is here defined as being the total amount of energy obtained from a given system over its lifetime, divided by the total inputs of energy to that system in order to establish and maintain it in operation throughout its life.) There is a spread of possible energy ratios for each system studied, depending upon the assumptions made but, in each case, a value of about 10 : 1 is seen as a reasonable possibility for the future. The significance of this 10 : 1 energy ratio is that it could mean that our primary fossil fuel resources, when used to generate electricity through wind, wave or tidal power systems, would go about 33 times as far as they would if used in the conventional way. In the case of solar and geothermal energy, the savings factor would be somewhat less than 33; it could be somewhere between 6 and 30, depending upon system design, local conditions, etc. Energy <b>pay-back</b> <b>times</b> appear to be short for all the systems studied, the longest being about four-and-a-half years.

We start with a short introduction into methodological issues related to energy analysis (of PV systems) such as system boundary definition, treatment of different (secondary) energy types and the choice of functional unit. Subsequently we review results from 6 studies on a-Si modules and 3 studies on CdTe modules. The aim is to present results in a unified format, compare them and try to clarify observed differences. Although significant differences were found, many of these differences {{could be explained by}} the choice of materials for the module encapsulation. For categories with large observed differences, like indirect process energy and capital equipment energy, we performed additional analyses in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of these aspects. Finally we present best estimates of the energy requirement for present-day a-Si and CdTe thin film modules which are between 600 and 1500 MJ (primary energy) per mfn 3 module area, depending on cell and encapsulation type.

However the viability of these sources is critically dependent on environmental, economic and technological considerations. This paper focuses on the environmental aspect of future photovoltaic (PV) systems which are assessed through life cycle analysis (LCA). Previous LCA studies on commercially available PV systems are reviewed. The sustainable evaluation methods used in these studies are also discussed. These methods are applied to the hybrid quantum dot (QD) -based solar cells currently under development within a project between the University of Manchester and Imperial College London. The aim of this project is to develop affordable solar cells with efficiencies up to 10 % for micro-generation applications. Presently hybrid QD-based solar cells are not commercially fabricated; therefore the study is mostly based on very small laboratory-scale production. For easy comparability 10 % conversion efficiency and 25 years lifetime are initially assumed. Lower conversion efficiencies and shorter lifetimes likely to initially characterise emerging PV technologies such as the hybrid QD-based solar cells are discussed.

To reach this goal actions {{need to be taken}} throughout the energy sector which includes residential and commercial buildings. This thesis considers the possibility to reduce the energy usage in a building located close to Uppsala. The analyzed building is a combined office, cafeteria and entrance and was completed about half a year before this project started. Therefore the measures presented for a more energy efficient building are presented as measures for future constructions. Simulations have been made in VIP-Energy, a dynamic energy calculation program. The measures that have been evaluated are added insulation to roof and walls and change of windows to those with a better U-value. The results showed that the added insulation is not recommended because of the small savings compared to the investments. The use of better windows, on the other hand, would be economically viable according to the results. The better windows reduced the energy consumption by 4 MWh/year which gave a <b>pay-back</b> <b>time</b> of 16 years. Alternative energy supply systems for the studied building are also presented.

40|$|Since 2015, ships {{operating}} in waters around Sweden {{are not allowed}} to use fuel for propulsion and power supply on board with a sulphur content of 0. 1 percent or more. The stricter rules resulted in ships exchanging their fuels. The change of fuel could be to a more fluid fuel. A more fluid fuel does not require the same amount of heating as the previously used fuels. The reduced heating requirement can result in a ship's steam production plant, which is dimensioned to a greater need, now having to cool down steam to condensate. This thesis explains how a ship can recover this energy source by allowing steam to expand through a power plant instead of cooling it. A qualitative case study has been carried out on the vessel Stena Saga. Data has been collected primarily through own observations. During the observations, field notes have been taken. Some information has also been obtained by reading manuals for the vessel's machine components. In order to confirm the perception of observations, machine personnel have answered questions. The study gives a result that shows how much energy that is available to use in the steam that otherwise has to be cooled down. A comparison of two different power plants is made.

This paper compares the impact of the current Lebanese electricity system with production of electricity from PV. This is the first paper to look at how the addition of PV to this system, and explores the potential impact. As many electricity networks in the region suffer from similar issues and have similar climates this research will not only inform the Lebanese system, but can be used to influence and inform impacts of other systems. It evaluates the environmental impact, and therefore the actual sustainability, of a 1. 8 kWp monocrystalline Photovoltaic (PV) system with and without Lead-Acid batteries (PbA) compared to the existing centralised electricity production mix and decentralised diesel neighbourhood gensets. The analysis is rigorous as it is conducted using the methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA), using the SimaPro software (Ecoinvent 2. 2 database) and ReCiPe 2008 method for impact assessment. The environmental impacts of the PV technology are compared to that of the existing fossil fuel electricity generation mix. Results, using the functional unit of 1 kW h, indicate that the PV system, even when equipped with PbA batteries, has a lower environmental burden per delivered output compared to the Lebanese electricity mix, and even more so when decentralised diesel neighbourhood gensets are taken into account.

The kinetic parameters of the FT reaction have been determined by using a non-liner regression performed with the experimenta data obtained with a bench-scale FT-rig. The model developed for the Fischer-Tropsch reactor takes into account the catalytic pellet's effectiveness factor and the eventual formation of a liquid phase in each point along reactor’s axial coordinate. The whole BTL plant is simulated connecting MATLAB and HYSYS. Moreover, the staging of the Fischer-Tropsch reactor is studied performing a techno-economic analysis of three different plant configurations and evaluating the corresponding <b>pay-back</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{recovery}} the {{alkaline solvent}} from of a residual stream after {{the extraction of}} hemicelluloses in wheat bran was investigated. The solution was withdrawn from an ultrafiltration (UF) process in which hemicelluloses were recovered. The UF permeate, containing mainly NaOH, lignin and mono- and oligosaccharides, was treated by nanofiltration (NF). Seven NF membranes were tested in a parametric study, and the two membranes showing the best performance were further evaluated in a concentration study. The mean flux of a Koch SelRO MPF 36 and a Microdyn-Nadir NP 010 membrane was about 200 l/m 2 h during concentration to a volume reduction of 0. 75. The retention of NaOH was 95 %, respectively. Cost estimates for a NaOH recovery process indicated that an NF plant would have a <b>pay-back</b> <b>time</b> of less than 2 months if the plant was run continuously, and 7 months if it was used 25 % of the time...|$|E
