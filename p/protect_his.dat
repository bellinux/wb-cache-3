5|$|During {{the period}} of Cromwell's rule and the {{subsequent}} Restoration, Smith manoeuvred to <b>protect</b> <b>his</b> position and to further his essentially Puritan religious stance, which he modified to suit the religious sensibilities of the new Royalist regime. He achieved this in part by creating an eponymous trust whereby some of his Irish property {{was used for the}} purpose of financing the education of children and provided scholarships for the most promising of those to continue their studies at Trinity College, Dublin. However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily to <b>protect</b> <b>his</b> interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to <b>protect</b> <b>his</b> people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town's defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|Although the Third Crusade, in the end, {{failed to}} retake Jerusalem, a three-year truce was {{eventually}} negotiated with Saladin.

Saladin also recognised the Crusaders' control of the Levantine coast {{as far south as}} Jaffa. Both sides had become exhausted by the struggle, Richard needed to return to Europe in order to <b>protect</b> <b>his</b> patrimony from the aggression of Philip of France, and Palestine was in a ruinous state.|$|E
