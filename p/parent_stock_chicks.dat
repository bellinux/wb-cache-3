The ND vaccination {{history and the}} age (s) of the breeders were found out from the hatcheries. Haemmagglutination inhibition (HI) test {{was used for the}} detection and quantification of antibodies (AB) to ND in the <b>parent</b> <b>stock,</b> yolk and in the day old chicks. The HI titre of each bird, yolk and chick was determined and expressed in log 2 and the mean titres for the <b>parent</b> <b>stock,</b> yolk and <b>chicks</b> were calculated. The ages of the <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> ranged from 30 weeks for hatchery A to 95 weeks for hatchery B, all the hatcheries used to administer ND vaccine Hitchner B 1 (intra ocular) at day old, La Sota at 3 - 5 weeks, Komorov at 6 - 8 weeks and another dose of komorov at 16 - 18 weeks. There after the birds were given booster ND vaccination using ND La Sota vaccine or killed oil emulsion Komorov vaccine The HI. AB titre for the <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> ranged from 5. 8 1. 6 to 7. 6 1. 6 log 2 and the titre for the egg also ranged from 5. 1 0. 9 to 6. 2 1. 7 log 2. The HI titre for the chick ranged from 3. 4 1. 4 to 5. 3 1. 1 log 2 at 1 day (d) old and it declines to a lowest value of 1. 1 1. 2 log 2 at 28 d. The study shows that all the <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> had protective AB titre (5. 8 1. 6 to 7. 6 1. 6) and there is a correlation between the AB titre in the serum of the <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> and that of the yolk. The AB titre in the chicks declines to non-protective level (1. 5 1. 1 log 2) at 14 d. It was concluded that although the titres of the <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> is within protective level, it is still low and that the yolk of fertile eggs can be used to determine the AB titre of the <b>parent</b> <b>stock...</b>|$|R
50|$|Goat farming {{also contributed}} to local consumption. By the late 1980s, the poultry {{industry}} was growing rapidly, relying in part on imported baby chicks from Britain and Zambia. Several private companies operated feed mills and incubators. The major constraint to expanding poultry production {{was the lack of}} quality feeds, and the government hoped that competition among privately owned feedmills would eventually overcome this problem. In 1987 the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the International Development Bank, and the Ugandan government funded a poultry rehabilitation and development project worth US$17.2 million to establish hatchery units and feed mills and to import <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> and baby <b>chicks.</b>|$|R
