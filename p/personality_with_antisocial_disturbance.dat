40|$|Several {{studies have}} related <b>personality</b> {{variables}} <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> behavior. Among antisocial behaviors, {{driving under the}} influence (DUI) has received growing attention in recent years, particularly in relation to the role of personality. However, {{it has been shown that}} personality alone is not sufficient to accurately predict DUI. As a result, there is growing interest in identifying other types of individual differences that might predict this behavior better, such as attitudinal variables. The aim of this study was to examine differences in personality dimensions and attitudes between a group of DUI offenders and a comparison group. Ninety-eight subjects were assessed: 51 subjects who had been convicted of a DUI offense following a diversion program, and 47 drivers without criminal records. <b>Personality</b> was measured <b>with</b> the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) and antisocial attitudes were assessed with the Jesness Inventory-Revised. Results indicated that offenders were more prone to show antisocial attitudes (p <. 001) than comparisons. In terms of personality, there were no significant differences between the two groups. These findings suggest that attitudes may be useful predictors of DUI and should be taken into account in interventions designed to avoid recidivism...|$|R

40|$|Within a {{psychotherapy}} development research project, thirty male (50 %) {{and female}} (50 %) personality disordered outpatients receiving methadone maintenance {{were randomly assigned}} to receive one of two 6 -month manual-guided individual psychotherapies, Dual Focus Schema Therapy (DFST) or 12 Step Facilitation Therapy (12 FT). All par-ticipants met diagnostic criteria for at least one <b>personality</b> disorder <b>with</b> <b>antisocial,</b> borderline, avoidant, and dependent being the most common. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two thera-pies for retention, utilization, or reductions in psychiatric symptoms or psychosocial impairment. Both therapy conditions demonstrated sig-nificant reductions in various severity indicators. Participants demon-strated more rapid decreases in the frequency of their substance use over six months of DFST in comparison to 12 FT. DFST also was associ-ated with a stronger therapeutic alliance between therapists and partic-ipants. Contrary to predictions, 12 FT demonstrated better reduction of dysphoric affect than did DFST. DFST shows initial promise as the first time-limited manual-guided psychotherapeutic approach for the full range of personality disorders encountered in substance abuse patients. The most common form of dual diagnosis is personality disorder and sub-stance abuse (Skodol, Oldham, & Gallaher, 1999; Verheul, van den Bosch, & Ball, 2005). The DSM-IV cluster B disorders (especially Antisocial and Borderline) are most common in substance abuse patients, followed in prevalence by cluster C (especially Avoidant) and cluster A (especially Par-anoid) (Rounsaville et al., 1998).

40|$|Background Men <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> {{disorder}} show lifelong abnormalities in adaptive {{decision making}} {{guided by the}} weighing up of reward and punishment information. Among men <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder, modifi cation of the behaviour of those with additional diagnoses of psychopathy seems particularly resistant to punishment. Methods We did a case-control functional MRI (fMRI) study in 50 men, of whom 12 were violent off enders <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder and psychopathy, 20 were violent off enders <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder but not psychopathy, and 18 were healthy non-off enders. We used fMRI to measure brain activation associated with the representation of punishment or reward information during an event-related probabilistic response-reversal task, assessed with standard general linear-model-based analysis. Findings Offenders <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder and psychopathy displayed discrete regions of increased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula in response to punished errors during the task reversal phase, and decreased activation to all correct rewarded responses in the superior temporal cortex. This finding was in contrast to results for off enders without psychopathy and healthy non-off enders. Interpretation Punishment prediction error signalling in off enders <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder and psychopathy was highly atypical. This finding challenges the widely held view that such men are simply characterised by diminished neural sensitivity to punishment. Instead, this fi nding indicates altered organisation of the information processing system responsible for reinforcement learning and appropriate decision making. This difference between violent offenders <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder <b>with</b> and without psychopathy has implications for the causes of these disorders and for treatment approaches...|$|R

The current {{study examined the}} influence of social learning factors (i. e., level of clinical contact and history of criminal victimization) on mental health professionals' attitudes toward clients <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder. The population of study was Medicaid-approved providers. The purposive sample included 98 Medicaid-approved mental health providers in North Carolina. The study used an online survey design, and participants completed an author-developed Demographic Questionnaire and the Adapted-Attitudes toward Personality Disorders Questionnaire. Three research questions examined the main effects of level of clinical contact, history of criminal victimization, and interaction effects on mental health professionals' attitudes toward clients <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder.

40|$|Individuals <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> {{behavior}} place a great {{physical and}} economic burden on society. Deficits in emotional processing {{have been recognized}} as a fundamental cause of antisocial behavior. Emerging evidence also highlights a significant contribution of attention allocation deficits to such behavior. A comprehensive literature search identified 12 studies that were eligible {{for inclusion in the}} meta-analysis, which compared 291 individuals <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> problems and 247 controls. Signed Differential Mapping revealed that compared with controls, gray matter volume (GMV) in subjects <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> behavior was reduced in the right lentiform nucleus (P < 0. 0001), left insula (P 0. 0002) and left frontopolar cortex (FPC) (P 0. 0006), and was increased in the right fusiform gyrus (P < 0. 0001), right inferior parietal lobule (P 0. 0003), right superior parietal lobule (P 0. 0004), right cingulate gyrus (P 0. 0004) and the right postcentral gyrus (P 0. 0004). Given the well-known contributions of limbic and paralimbic areas to emo-tional processing, the observed reductions in GMV in these regions might represent neural correlates of disturbance in emotional processing underlying antisocial behavior. Previous studies have suggested an FPC role in attention allocation during emotional processing. Therefore, GMV deviations in this area may constitute a neural basis of deficits in attention allocation linked <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> behavior...|$|R

Structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the whole brain. cerebellum, temporal lobe, lateral ventricles, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and the prefrontal, pre-motor, sensorimotor, occipito-parietal regions in 13 men <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder, 13 men with schizophrenia {{and a history of}} violence, 15 men with schizophrenia without violent history and 15 healthy non-violent men. Compared to controls, the antisocial personality disorder group displayed reductions in whole brain volume and temporal lobe as well as increases in putamen volume. Both schizophrenia groups regardless of violence history exhibited increased lateral ventricle volume, while the schizophrenia group with violent history showed further abnormalities including reduced whole brain and hippocampal volumes and increased putamen size. The findings suggest that individuals <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder as well as those with schizophrenia and a history of violence have common neural abnormalities, but also show neuro-anatomical differences. The processes by which they came to apparently common ground may, however, differ. The finding of temporal lobe reductions prevalent among those <b>with</b> <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder and hippocampal reduction in the violent men with schizophrenia contributes support for the importance of this region in mediating violent behaviour.
