5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain pedal, a swell pedal for organ, a footswitch to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of screw-in legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled drawbars for the Nord Stage, for users who prefer to use real drawbars instead of the buttons provided as standard.|$|E
5|$|Band Hero also {{introduced}} an updated {{revision of the}} drum kit that shipped with Guitar Hero World Tour. Many changes were made to address weight and size concerns that made assembly difficult, and the stand's crossbar {{was moved to the}} bottom to improve leg room and allow the bass <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> be supported by it. The cymbals were changed to a circular shape from the previous triangular design, and the sensitivity of the drums themselves were adjusted. An in-game sensitivity adjustment feature is also supported. In the United States, the new controller was, for a limited time, exclusive to the game and instrument bundles of Band Hero on Wii. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the controller were released at a later date; Band Hero bundles for these platforms in the U.S. included the World Tour drum controller.|$|E

5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E

25|$|The ratchet {{clutch system}} uses a {{ratchet and pawl}} to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first {{disengage}} the clutch before using the <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch. Because the ratchet engages in only a fixed set of positions, the timpanist must fine-tune the drum {{by means of a}} fine-tuning handle.|$|E
25|$|NTSB investigators' post-accident {{investigation}} {{showed that}} because of the positioning of the fuel selector valves, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to yaw (Nose right) and pitch up.|$|E
25|$|Butler plays harmonica, didgeridoo, drums, lap-steel, banjo and amplified {{acoustic}} {{guitars and}} his custom-made, 11-string Maton guitar. Butler prefers the Maton custom 11-string guitar and often uses a Seymour Duncan SA-6 Mag Mic pick-up with a Marshall Amplification JMP Super Lead Head and a Marshall 4×12 cabinet. He uses {{a variety of}} electronic effects including distortion, reverb / delay and wah-wah <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> achieve his unique sound. Butler uses long, pointed fiberglass fingernails for finger picking.|$|E
50|$|The special pedal cranks allowed both <b>pedals</b> <b>to</b> {{be rotated}} forward {{so that the}} pedals would form motorcycle-style {{footrests}} in normal operation. <b>To</b> engage the <b>pedals,</b> the left-hand pedal crank could be rotated forward and locked and a drive gear engaged allowing the user <b>to</b> <b>pedal.</b> A short chain connected the <b>pedal</b> drive <b>to</b> the main engine-chain drive system. Pedalling was hard work for the rider: there was no freewheel and the pedal gearing was very low. The engine could be started with pedal drive engaged, causing the <b>pedals</b> <b>to</b> rotate under engine power when the bike was in gear. In practice, the cam and shaft arrangement <b>to</b> engage the <b>pedals</b> frequently seized (in normal operation, a rider would very rarely engage pedal-drive as it was less tiring to push than <b>to</b> <b>pedal).</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s accelerator pedal is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> the engine’s throttle body. In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s throttle body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.|$|E
25|$|The COW gun {{mounting}} in {{the nose}} was of Westland design, and allowed the gun to be trained over a wide arc. It supported the gun on the apex of a pyramidal structure, that was asymmetric to allow the gunner to {{have easy access to}} the weapon. This structure was fixed on a rotating base, which also provided the gunner with a rotating platform to stand on. The gunner could train the mount by turning a hand gear, or push on a <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> engage a brake that locked the mount in its position. The elevation and depression of the gun were accomplished by the muscle power of the gunner. As the large ammunition clip of the COW gun prevented sighting over the barrel, a sight was installed to its left. The gun is reported to have been successfully fired in the air, also when trained to the side.|$|E
25|$|Green Day: Rock Band allows {{players to}} perform {{simulated}} rock music by providing {{up to four}} players {{with the ability to}} play three different controllers modeled after music instruments: a guitar controller for lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay, a drum controller and a microphone for vocals. Players simulate the performance of rock music by using their controllers to play scrolling on-screen notes. For lead and bass guitar, this is accomplished by holding down colored buttons mimicking guitar frets and pushing the controller's strum bar. For drums, this requires striking the matching colored drumhead, or stepping on the <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> simulate playing bass drum notes. When singing vocals, the player must sing in relative pitch to the original vocals. A pitch indicator displays the singer's accuracy relative to the original pitch. The game supports harmonies as introduced in , allowing multiple singers to perform the vocal portion. Harmonies will be added to the six songs already available as downloadable content for the game when played in Green Day: Rock Band.|$|E

25|$|Parasympathetic {{stimulation}} originates {{from the}} cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches {{to both the}} SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization, which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less than this, it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving a car with {{one foot on the}} brake <b>pedal.</b> <b>To</b> speed up, one need merely remove one’s foot from the brake and let the engine increase speed. In the case of the heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation.|$|E

500|$|Hendrix also {{utilized}} the Uni-Vibe, {{which was designed}} to simulate the modulation effects of a rotating Leslie speaker by providing a rich phasing sound that could be manipulated with a speed control pedal. He can be heard using the effect during his performance at Woodstock and on the Band of Gypsys track [...] "Machine Gun", which prominently features the Uni-vibe along with an Octavia and a Fuzz Face. His signal flow for live performance involved first plugging his guitar into a wah-wah pedal, then connecting the wah-wah <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> a Fuzz Face, which was then linked to a Uni-Vibe, before connecting to a Marshall amplifier.|$|E
500|$|According to Sammon, [...] "one of the {{greatest}} special effects in the film [...] Thulsa Doom's onscreen transformation into a giant snake". It involved footage of fake body parts, live and dummy snakes, miniatures, and other camera tricks combined into a flowing sequence with lap dissolve. After Jones was filmed in position, he {{was replaced by a}} hollow framework with a rubber mask that was pushed from behind by a snake head-shaped puppet to give the illusion of Doom's facial bones changing. [...] The head was then replaced with a [...] mechanical snake; as it moved outwards, a crew member pressed a foot <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> collapse the framework. For the final part of the sequence, a real snake was filmed on a miniature set.|$|E
500|$|Townshend {{played a}} 1959 Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins hollow body guitar fed through an Edwards volume <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> a Fender Bandmaster amp, {{all of which}} he had been given by Joe Walsh while in New York. This {{combination}} became his main electric guitar recording setup for subsequent albums. Although intended as a demo recording, the end result sounded so good to the band and Johns, they decided to use it as the final take. Overdubs, including an acoustic guitar part played by Townshend, were recorded at Olympic Studios at the end of April. The track was mixed at Island Studios by Johns on 28 May. After Lifehouse was abandoned as a project, Johns felt [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", along with other songs, were so good that they could simply be released as a standalone single album, which became Who's Next.|$|E
