50|$|Sicamous was a steam-driven sternwheeler, {{consuming}} {{an average}} of fifteen to seventeen tons of coal each day, depending upon weather conditions {{and the number of}} stops made along the lake. Today Sicamous remains the largest steam-powered, steel-hulled sternwheeler in Canada.Twenty-three feet long and made of Carnegie flange steel, the boiler was designed to burn 1720 kilograms of coal each hour. It was important to maintain a large and very hot fire burning within the boiler. Surrounding the fire was a steel chamber containing water pulled from the lake as well as 320 hollow pipes. These pipes would heat rapidly, quickly turning the water to steam. Pressure would build and the temperature would rise. The steam pressure was constantly monitored and maintained at 160 psi by a fireman or an engineer who was responsible for manually releasing steam as needed. This steam would travel from the boiler to the engines via the bulkhead, a large pipe attached to the ceiling of the bilge. Sicamous had two engines, each with a low- and high-pressure cylinder. Steam would travel from cylinder to cylinder, moving pistons which were attached to the ships <b>pitman</b> <b>arms.</b> These <b>pitman</b> <b>arms</b> were connected to the wooden stern wheel and moved completely out of phase with one another, distributing power equally to both sides of the stern wheel.|$|R

5000|$|The 'modern' sawmill {{was invented}} or perfected by the Dutchman Cornelis Corneliszoon (1550-1607) who applied a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> onto a wind mill, which {{converted}} a turning motion into an up-an-down sawing motion. Cornelis {{took out a}} patent on his sawmill on December 15, 1593, and on the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> device on December 6, 1597. Early sawmills adapted the [...] to mechanical power, generally driven by a water wheel. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> or rod. A pitman {{is similar to a}} crankshaft, but in reverse (a crankshaft converts back-and-forth motion to circular motion).|$|E
50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four tie rods, one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the tie rods), an idler arm on the passenger side, and a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> on the driver side. The <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. The inner tie rods are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the steering arms and outer tie rods. All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|E
50|$|The {{recirculating}} ball steering mechanism contains {{a worm gear}} inside a block with a threaded hole in it; this block has gear teeth cut into the outside to engage the sector shaft (also called a sector gear) which moves the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm.</b> The steering wheel connects to a shaft, which rotates the worm gear inside of the block. Instead of twisting further into the block, the worm gear is fixed so that when it spins, it moves the block, which transmits the motion through the gear to the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm,</b> causing the roadwheels to turn.|$|E
5000|$|The ladder-type frame used semielliptical {{leaf springs}} front and rear. Steering {{included}} now ball bearings instead of roller types, and featured a <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> {{in front of}} the front axle.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{one end of}} {{the drag}} link is {{connected}} via the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and steering gearbox to the steering wheel (providing the connection between the driver and the steering system); the other end is attached to the steering linkage, by the steering arm.|$|E
50|$|Early sawmills simply {{adapted the}} whipsaw to {{mechanical}} power, generally {{driven by a}} water wheel {{to speed up the}} process. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by a connecting rod known as a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> (thus introducing a term used in many mechanical applications).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> is a {{steering}} {{component in}} an automobile or truck. As a linkage attached to the steering box (see recirculating ball) sector shaft, it converts the angular motion of the sector shaft into the linear motion needed to steer the wheels. The arm {{is supported by the}} sector shaft and supports the drag link or center link with a ball joint. It transmits the motion it receives from the steering box into the drag (or center) link, causing it to move left or right to turn the wheels in the appropriate direction. The idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and the vehicle's frame to hold the center or drag link at the proper height. A worn ball joint can cause play in the steering, and may get worse over time.|$|E
5000|$|Each engine had {{a single}} piston which {{measured}} 12 inches on the inside bore, and drove a piston rod with a stroke of 48 inches. [...] Each piston rod in turn drove a 16-foot-long iron rod called a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> which turned a crank pin on the sternwheel. [...] The sternwheel itself was 15 feet in diameter.|$|E
5000|$|The term is {{commonly}} used in automotive technology for the link in steering linkage that converts rotation of a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> to a steering arm and eventually to tie rod links which pivot the wheels to be steered. The drag link converts the sweeping arc of the steering arm to linear motion in {{the plane of the}} other steering links.|$|E
5000|$|Welcome {{was built}} at Coquille, Oregon in 1900 by S.H. McAdams [...] The steamer was 56 ft long, with {{a beam of}} 13.5 ft and depth of hold of 2.8 ft.

[...] Power was furnished by twin steam engines, each driving a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> connected to a crankpin on the sternwheel.|$|E
50|$|Other {{systems for}} {{steering}} exist, but are uncommon on road vehicles. Children's toys and go-karts often use a very direct linkage {{in the form}} of a bellcrank (also commonly known as a <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm)</b> attached directly between the steering column and the steering arms, and the use of cable-operated steering linkages (e.g. the capstan and bowstring mechanism) is also found on some home-built vehicles such as soapbox cars and recumbent tricycles.|$|E
50|$|Most punch presses {{today are}} {{hydraulically}} powered. Older machines, however, have mechanically driven rams, meaning {{the power to}} the ram is provided by a heavy, constantly rotating flywheel. The flywheel drives the ram using a <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm.</b> In the 19th century, the flywheels were powered by leather drive belts attached to line shafting, which in turn ran to a steam plant. In the modern workplace, the flywheel is powered by an electric motor.|$|E
5000|$|The rigid arm {{scroll saw}} was popular until the 1970s but {{is no longer}} made. It has a single-piece cast iron frame. The blade is {{attached}} to a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> on the bottom, which pulls the blade down. A spring in the upper arm pulls the blade back up again. This design has a significant weakness in that the tension on the blade changes with every stroke; modern scroll saws are all [...] "constant tension" [...] designs.|$|E
50|$|The {{idler arm}} {{supports}} {{the end of}} the center link on the passenger's side of the vehicle. The idler arm bolts to the vehicle's frame or subframe. Generally, an idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and the vehicle's frame to hold the center link at the proper height. Idler arms are generally more vulnerable to wear than Pitman arms because of the pivot function built into them. If the idler arm is fitted with grease fittings, these should be lubricated with a grease gun at each oil change.|$|E
50|$|After the sawmill's {{abandonment}} in 1839, {{the original}} sawmill complex buildings rotted and disappeared. However, timbers {{cut by the}} original mill survived in buildings on Mackinac Island (Mission Church and Mission House, built in the 1820s and still there today). Saw marks on these timbers {{could be used to}} reconstruct the mill machinery so as to closely resemble the original. The marks gave restoration experts information on the rake of the saw's teeth and the saw's operating speed. The wood is fed into the blade at 1/3 of an inch per stroke, and the infeed motion is powered by the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> that powers the saw's vertical movement.|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{drag link}} connects the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> to the {{steering}} arm, {{or in some}} applications it connects to the tie rod assembly. Unlike a center link, the drag link does not connect to an idler arm, and has no inner tie rod ends attached to it. On some applications the drag link swings from the front {{to the rear of}} the vehicle. On these applications the drag link connects to the steering arm located at the wheel. In some Jeep applications, the drag link will swing from right to left on the vehicle and will connect to the steering arm at the wheel.

5000|$|The {{original}} milestone 1941 Clipper {{rode the}} senior wheelbase of 127 in {{and used the}} One Twenty's [...] straight eight, but produced 125 bhp (five more than the One Twenty). Despite the familiar engine, few Clipper parts were interchangeable with other models. The chassis was entirely new: a double-drop frame allowed a lower floor without reducing road clearance. The engine was mounted well forward and the rear shocks were angled to assist the traditional Packard fifth shock in controlling side-sway. The front suspension was entirely new, since the lower frame eliminated the need for Packard's traditional long torque arms. A double-link connection between the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and steering brackets, with a cross bar and idler arm and two cross tubes, controlled wheel movement.|$|E
50|$|Bump steer can be {{adjusted}} by moving any of the front suspension components pickup points Up, down, in or out. For example: Say the inner tie rod mounting point is moved up either by moving the rack or modifying the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> mounting point or arm drop. The result is the tie rod's arc will change. It will then require {{a change in the}} tie rod length to be in proper alignment so the radius of the arc will change as well. If the radius arc of the tie rod is longer than stock on a front steer setup then the car will have more toe understeer. If the same scenario was applied to a rear steering design, then the car would exhibit less toe understeer. This is because the effective length of the tie rods is affected by its static length/arc radius, its pickup points and the angle of its arc during each phase of suspension travel in relation to the control arms.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface unit}} {{transfers}} energy for pumping the well from the prime-mover to the sucker rod string. In doing this, it must change the rotary {{motion of the}} prime-mover to reciprocating motion for the sucker rod. And it must reduce {{the speed of the}} prime-mover to a suitable pumping speed. Speed reduction is accomplished by using a gear reducer, and rotary motion of thencrank shaft is converted to oscillatory motion by means of a walking beam. The crank arm is connected to the walking beam by means of a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm.</b> The walking beam is supported by a Samson post and saddle bearing. The horse head and bridle are used to ensure that the pull on the sucker rod string is vertical all times so that no bearing movement is applied to that part of sucker rod string above stuffing box. The polished rod and stuffing box combination is used to maintain a good liquid seal at the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Older designs use {{two main}} principles: the worm and sector {{design and the}} screw and nut. Both types were {{enhanced}} by reducing the friction; for screw and nut it is the recirculating ball mechanism, which is still found on trucks and utility vehicles. The steering column turns a large screw which meshes with nut by recirculating balls. The nut moves a sector of a gear, causing it to rotate about its axis as the screw is turned; an arm attached to the axis of the sector moves the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm,</b> which {{is connected to the}} steering linkage and thus steers the wheels. The recirculating ball version of this apparatus reduces the considerable friction by placing large ball bearings between the screw and the nut; {{at either end of the}} apparatus the balls exit from between the two pieces into a channel internal to the box which connects them with the other end of the apparatus, thus they are [...] "recirculated".|$|E
40|$|In this study, 2 DOF {{mathematical}} {{models of}} <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering system are derived using Newton’s law of motion and modeled in MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The developed steering model is included with a DC motor model which is directly {{attached to the}} steering column. The <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering model is then validated with actual <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering test rig using various lateral inputs such as double lane change, step steer, and slalom test.

The similar method has been used to test the actual <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering mechanism using hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) technique. Additional friction compensation is added in the HILS technique in order to minimize the frictional effects that occur in the mechanical configuration of the DC motor and <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering. The performance of the electronically actuated <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering system can be used to develop a firing-on-the-move actuator (FOMA) for an armored vehicle.

40|$|Abstract. The {{main purpose}} of the paper is using multi-functional sensors to detect the vehicle {{attitude}} (the tilt angle of vehicle), and many other vehicle information. Combining all the information, the adaptive front-lighting system can achieve the real-time control of the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and yaw angle for automobile headlight system. The feasible control methodology could highly enhance the safety of driving and electronic additional value in automobile industry. In the paper, various conditions of HID (High Intensive Discharge) headlight system could be controlled, such as the control of <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and yaw angle, are widely discussed. In the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> angle control, we use G-sensor to detect the unbalanced vehicle caused by load, rugged road, uphill and downhill. Finally, combining the velocity obtained from the ECM (Engine Control Module), the leveling motor control for headlight <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> angle real time and adjust will be realized. On the other hand, we use the potentiometer and micro switch to sense the direction and quantity of steering wheel angle, the swivel motor control for headlight yaw angle real-time adjustment is completed...|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents the}} development of an armored vehicle model in lateral and longitudinal directions. A Nine Degree of Freedom (9 -DOF) armored vehicle model was derived mathematically and integrated with an analytical tire dynamics known as Pacejka Magic Tire model. The armored vehicle model is developed using three main inputs of a vehicle system which are <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering system, Powertrain system and also hydraulic assisted brake system. Several testings in lateral and longitudinal direction are performed such as double lane change, slalom, step steer and sudden acceleration and sudden braking to verify the vehicle model. The armored vehicle model is verified using validated software, CarSim, using HMMWV vehicle model as a benchmark. The verification responses show that the developed armored vehicle model can be used for both lateral and longitudinal direction analysis...|$|E
40|$|An {{armoured}} vehicle tends {{to lose its}} dynamic mobility when firing on the move. This {{is due to the}} effect of the firing force that reacts at the centre of the weapon platform, which creates an unwanted yaw moment at the vehicle's centre of gravity. In order to enhance the mobility performance of the {{armoured vehicle}}, a control strategy, i. e. yaw rejection control, is designed and test on an armoured vehicle model. The purpose of the control strategy is to maintain the directional mobility of the armoured vehicle by providing a steering correction angle to the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering system. The control strategy proposed in this study consists of two main structures: yaw rate feedback control using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and Lateral Force Rejection Control (LFRC) using an adaptive Fuzzy-Proportional-Integral (adaptive Fuzzy-PI) controller. The simulation results in terms of yaw and lateral motions were observed, and the proposed control strategy was shown to successfully improve the directional mobility of the armoured vehicle after firing. The benefit of the proposed control strategy with adaptive fuzzy-PI control is evaluated by comparing its performance to fuzzy-PI and proportional-integral (PI) control strategies...|$|E

The flow of fluid flowing in the circuit of the power steering pressure losses that would cause the difference in pressure at the pump and the hydraulic cylinder. Given the pressure loss, the power used to reduce the burden of steering the less, this led to a reduction in force on the gear and <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> that will affect the steering wheel...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} a {{suitable}} suspension system for passenger comfort and vehicle steering is an obvious order and direct impact on the safety of passengers must be considered, to do so different kinds of tests must be exerted, {{one of these is}} fatigue testing {{which is one of the}} most significant ones. Another issue is the high cost in practical ways, and to cope with this issue various ways must be assessed and analyzed, one of the best and the most efficient ways is modelling and testing in virtual software environments. In the present paper, predict fatigue life of suspension component and package of automotive suspension are the main purposes. First, using MATLAB software, road roughness according to the intercity roads for constant vehicle velocity (100 Km/h) has been studied. After that frequency response of components has been analysed, its critical points determined to calculate the fatigue life of the part, and the amount of critical stress obtained based on Von Misses, Tresca and Max Principle criterion for a quarter car model (passive suspension System in 206 Peugeot). Fatigue life of the vehicle components are calculated in terms of kilo-Meters in specialized fatigue software such as 116944, 92638. 9, 46388. 9 and 191388. 9 Km respectively wheel hub, <b>pitman</b> <b>arm,</b> suspension arm and package of suspension.
