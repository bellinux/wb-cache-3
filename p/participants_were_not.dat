5|$|The revolt in Palestine was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} revolts that sprung up elsewhere in the Egyptian-ruled Levant, such as the 1838 Druze revolt and those {{that occurred in the}} Nusayriyya Mountains and Mount Lebanon. Unlike the other Levantine revolts, the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> an ethnoreligiously or socially homogeneous group, but rather an assortment of societal groups from different classes, subcultures, geographical areas and religions. This also significantly distinguished it from previous popular uprisings against Ottoman rule that had occurred in Jerusalem and its vicinity, namely the Naqib al-Ashraf Revolt in 1703–1705 and the revolt of 1825–1826, which failed to attract support from the people of Nablus, Hebron, Galilee and Gaza.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} concert, the pieces {{that were to}} carry a 17Hz {{undertone}} were swapped so that test results would not focus on any specific musical piece. The <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> told which pieces included the low-level 17Hz near-infrasonic tone. The presence of the tone resulted in a significant number (22%) of respondents reporting feeling uneasy or sorrowful, getting chills down the spine or nervous feelings of revulsion or fear.|$|E

25|$|The <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> only {{selected}} for their mountaineering abilities; {{the status of}} their families and any military experience or university degrees were also factors in the selection procedures. Military experience was of the highest importance in the public image and communication to the newspapers. Quaker-educated Richard B. Graham, b. 1893 (Bootham School, York, 1906-10) was also chosen, but resigned on being told that {{some members of the}} party objected to climbing with a man who had refused to fight in the war.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} {{between these two}} possibilities, Trueswell et al. {{conducted a series of}} experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were asked to indicate their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects). Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that participants did not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.|$|E

500|$|... 1882 saw {{the first}} signs of insubordination among the army corps when a group of {{officers}} assassinated a journalist in broad daylight. He had published an article which they considered an offence to their honor. However, the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> subjected to punishment for this act. Records from 1884 show that, out of a peacetime army of 13,500 men, more than 7,526 had been jailed for insubordination. The military were badly paid, inadequately equipped, ill-instructed, and thinly spread across the vast empire, often in small [...] "garrisons of 20, 10, 5 and even 2 men." [...] Most of the non-officer corps consisted of men recruited from the poor sertão (hinterland) in the northeast, and later from former slaves. These were volunteers seeking some means of subsistence, as there was no conscription. They were completely unprepared for the military life, had little education or concept of civic responsibility and government. A poor Brazilian from the northeast viewed his military commanders in the same light as he viewed the henchmen of the political bosses at home. An ex-slave would see his harsh superior officer as differing little from his former owner and taskmasters. They had no means of understanding that they were being used to effect a coup, that their orders put them in rebellion against the emperor, or that their actions would lead to a dictatorship. The average recruit blindly followed orders and hoped to avoid punishment by his superiors for any mistake.|$|E
2500|$|Raymond A. Vonderlehr was {{appointed}} on-site {{director of the}} research program and developed the policies that shaped the long-term follow-up section of the project. His method of gaining the [...] "consent" [...] of the subjects for spinal taps (to look for signs of neurosyphilis) was by portraying this diagnostic test as a [...] "special free treatment". <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> told their diagnosis. Vonderlehr retired {{as head of the}} venereal disease section in 1943, shortly after the antibiotic penicillin had first been shown to be a cure for syphilis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organizers}} had {{two primary}} concerns {{when considering the}} testimony they would use. [...] They wanted testimony that would not allow the scapegoating of individuals when they were attempting to show what was being done in Vietnam was due to policy, not decisions by individual GIs. They also wanted the testimony to be accurate, and double and sometimes triple confirmed by others in the same units. [...] Specific sets of questions were drafted by experienced combat vets to help verify that <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> fabricating their stories or faking their knowledge, and that only the strongest testimony was used.|$|E
30|$|The {{cost-benefit}} analysis <b>is</b> <b>not</b> precise because the earnings data used to capture benefits for <b>participants</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> precise, a fact noted by Meyer (1995) {{and in the}} Corson et al. (1985) evaluation.|$|R

2500|$|The Marshall Plan <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{surprised}} when the Czechoslovakian and Polish delegations were prevented from attending the Paris meeting. The other Eastern Bloc states immediately rejected the offer. Finland also declined {{in order to avoid}} antagonizing the Soviets (see also Finlandization). The Soviet Union's [...] "alternative" [...] to the Marshall plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with western Europe, became known as the Molotov Plan, and later, the Comecon. In a 1947 speech to the United Nations, Soviet deputy foreign minister Andrei Vyshinsky said that the Marshall Plan violated the principles of the United Nations. He accused the United States of attempting to impose its will on other independent states, {{while at the same time}} using economic resources distributed as relief to needy nations as an instrument of political pressure.|$|E
2500|$|This {{study is}} similar to Libet's in some ways: volunteers were again asked to perform finger {{extensions}} in short, self-paced intervals. In {{this version of the}} experiment, researchers introduced randomly timed [...] "stop tones" [...] during the self paced movements. If <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> conscious of any intention to move, they simply ignored the tone. On the other hand, if they were aware of their intention to move {{at the time of the}} tone, they had to try to veto the action, then relax for a bit before continuing self-paced movements. This experimental design allowed Matsuhashi and Hallet to see when, once the subject moved his finger, any tones occurred. The goal was to identify their own equivalent of Libet's W, their own estimation of the timing of the conscious intention to move, which they would call [...] "T"(time) ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{directly}} {{asked to}} compete—organizer McGee instead communicated only through (white) agents. According to Parezo, contests were {{modeled on the}} Olympic protocol of amateurism, so <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> remunerated, which resulted in several people refusing to take part. Basic instructions were provided immediately before each event, without language interpretation, and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{given the opportunity to}} practice. Many of the participants wanted to try the contests again once they understood the rules but this was not permitted as organizers believed it would have [...] "'violated' the research design...and invalidated the racial comparisons" [...] to white athletes (who underwent extensive training and practice).|$|E
