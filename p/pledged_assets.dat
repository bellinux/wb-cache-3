40|$|Posting {{collateral}} encourages credit provision {{under the}} assumption that lenders can appropriate the <b>pledged</b> <b>assets</b> in case of default. When institutions work imperfectly, though, banks discount the value of effective collateral, thereby reducing lending volume. This process has been described in US states with difficult foreclosure procedures, but here we show that it also matters for poor countries after a violent conflict, when collateralizable assets have a heightened probability of being destroyed. We use firm-level data on loans in Sub-Saharan Africa to show that to get a loan, firms in countries with recent conflict need to pledge additional collateral. While some OLS offer supporting evidence, the effect is larger and more precisely estimated when we use quantile regressions to focus on the subgroup of firms that face tougher collateral requirements, which suggests that this effect is heterogeneous within countries. This mechanism is a novel channel that relates peace to economic growth and convergence through financial markets. Artículo de publicación SCOPU...|$|E

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of real estate prices on {{corporate}} investment? In the presence of financing frictions, firms use pledgeable assets as collateral to finance new projects. Through this collateral channel, shocks to the value of real estate can have a large impact on aggre-gate investment. To compute the sensitivity of investment to collateral value, we use local variations in real estate prices as shocks to the collateral value of firms that own real estate. Over the 1993 – 2007 period, the representative US corporation invests $ 0. 06 out of each $ 1 of collateral. (JEL D 22, G 31, R 30) In the presence of contract incompleteness, Barro (1976), Stiglitz and Weiss (1981), and Hart and Moore (1994) point out that collateral pledging enhances a firm’s financial capacity. Providing outside investors with the option to liquidate <b>pledged</b> <b>assets</b> ex post acts as a strong disciplining device on borrowers. This, in turn, eases financing ex ante. Asset liquidation values thus {{play a key role in}} the determination of a firm’s debt capacity. This simple observation has important mac...|$|E

40|$|Extension {{of loans}} is being {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important and useful functions of the universal commercial banks in the economy. Russian banking has been gradually restoring after the financial crises, when the default on the government debt has showed that only those banks that are more concerned with the non-financial sector can survive external shocks. However, the fact that banks become more and more willing to extend loans to the corporate sector, due to the absence of other profitable financial instruments, exposes them more to risks of particular borrowers. Unpredictable macroeconomic conditions and inefficient contract enforcement mechanism are overlapped with risks of borrowers’ performance and value of their guaranties. To ensure themselves from risks on the micro level banks need to undertake costly and time-consuming process of assessment of their potential clients. In the situation when interacting parties possess different information or some data is not verifiable, credit relations demand not only a sound banking system and high management qualification, but also stability of financial records of the firms. Economic theory addresses different questions on this matter, and even we abstract from the commitment and moral hazard problem on the banks side, there exist a plenty of informational issues concerning borrowers. Even general financial situation is improving; small and medium size enterprises in Russia are constrained in resources. Most of them cannot undertake cumbersome and expensive procedure of issuing public debt. Newly emerged enterprises do not have credit history and performance records, and even those that have been working quite efficiently during a certain period cannot provide reliable financial documentation due to the presence of underground activities. High credit risks and costs due to the difficulties in assessing and choosing potential borrowers in the situation of informational imperfections are reflected in the interest rate on loans. As a result, enterprises with stable but not very high profitability, that is usual for non-financial sector, are constraint in their access to credit resources. While the situation in Russian banking is generally improving, risk of bad debts may affect the future of their financial stability. So both sides require recommendations in developing their strategies and possibility to rely on adapted theories of credit relations. In this respect, we illustrate bank-borrower relationships and bank decisions on the credit market in the context of the two game-theoretic models. We consider factors that influence the interest rate on loans and especially particular conditions of the Russian credit market i. e. costs and uncertainty related to the <b>pledged</b> <b>assets,</b> wide tax evasion and non-payments in the economy along with an absence of the standardise financial records of the borrowers. In the first model, banks, as Cournot oligopolists, extend loans to finance production of the firms on the security of collateral. Firms have two types of technology available, and a choice between them depends on the level of prudence in the society and cost of loans, through such specific factor as firm’s collateral valuation. Collateral requirements, set by the bank, are quite high and cover the principle with all interest and costs. But if the firms are able to provide falsified documentation and use illegally <b>pledged</b> <b>assets,</b> they will put a low value on their collateral in a loan agreement with a bank. Thus, particular conditions may lead to the choice of a risky investment, while improvement in the legal enforcement and relatively low interest rates will make a stable one more profitable. The second model is based on the theory of signalling and provides a more detailed analysis of the interest rate decisions of a representative bank that provides loans to the non-financial sector. In the present state of the Russian economy, enterprises are engaged in the tax evasion and maintain arrears no matter their actual profitability and investment possibilities. Due to financial uncertainty banks are not able to distinguish potentially creditworthy borrowers, and therefore insure themselves with high interest rates on loans. Enterprises can try to build more transparent relationships with banks and provide them with information indicating their performance and ability to repay loans. A bank’s decision at a fist stage of the game depends on whether it can distinguish between the two types of borrowers: with high and low investment risks. In order to obtain cheaper loans, the high quality (i. e. low risk) firms need to distinguish themselves from a homogeneous mass. We obtain a possibility for the latter firms to provide a credible signal to the bank through the improvement in their financial performance. The model’s results suggest that high quality firms can adjust their behaviour by refraining from chronicle non-payments in return for better credit conditions. This will serve as an indication of their efficient performance and ability to repay loans. The bank then conducts a particular credit policy separating high-risk borrowers from the low-risk ones and adjusts its interest rate on loans accordingly. L-type firms will continue to borrow at a high rate, as due to the limited liability and high upper values of their return distribution they benefit more from investing than from forgoing the project...|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} {{characteristic that}} yields imperfection is that exchange {{does not happen}} simultaneously in capital markets. The borrower gets his/her funds, but the lender must rely on the promises of the borrower. One of the conditions for imperfect capital markets is default risk. The borrower may declare bankruptcy, and thus, may not pay the debt back. Hence, the borrower's promises, {{as well as the}} structure of the promises, are very important for the transaction to be realized. One of the options in dealing with the limited commitment problem is providing collateral. The contract is formed such that in case of default, the lender has all/some rights to seize the collateral. This is called a secured loan in finance. However, it does not fully solve the problem because there are costs associated with seizing the <b>pledged</b> <b>asset.</b> One source of these costs is the money and time spent enforcing the contract.|$|R

40|$|PROJECT FINANCING OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINES A STUDY ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT FINANCING UNDER FINANCIAL LAW AND LAW OF SECURITY INTERESTS. 1 Object {{and methods}} of the study Currently, Russia is the only {{supplier}} of natural gas to Finland. This study investigates how can the natural gas markets in Finland be opened by constructing a natural gas pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland {{in a manner that}} would be beneficial under financing laws and the law of security interests. Answers have been sought applying traditional analytical doctrine, utilizing as far as possible the questions enabled by the doctrine. In places where the answers have not been found applying traditional analytical doctrine, Juha Karhu s contemporary approach to the law of security interests has been applied. This study discusses various issues under financial law and law related to security interests related to property located in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether a project company, as the borrower under a project loan, or the shareholders of a project company, could provide sufficient collateral for loan for a natural gas pipeline project. The legal literature used and discussed in this study includes a large variety of Nordic monographs and general property law books. In addition, Nordic case law concerning certain legal questions about which no literature is available has been studied in detail. 2 Structure of the study The study is divided into sections based on the type of collateral for the project loan. In addition, the study includes a short financing section in which the elements of a natural gas pipeline feasibility study are described, studied and applied to a hypothetical natural gas pipeline project. The discussion of the collateral for the project loan is divided into sections: (i) the property law-related issues concerning the construction of the pipeline and the possibility of pledging real estate owned, leased or expropriated by the project company as collateral for the project loan; (ii) the nature of the intercreditor agreements entered into among the members of the banking syndicate under Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian law; (iii) how the so-called earnings principle would affect the structure of the construction agreement for the natural gas pipeline and the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries; (iv) how the pledgee could use the control factor related to a share pledge when the shareholders of the project company pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. 2. 1 Real property required to construct the natural gas pipeline Due to its length, the natural gas pipeline would be built on real property owned by other parties than the project company. The project company would receive the right to use this property through an expropriation procedure. One of the most valuable assets of the project company has is the turbines that are located at the compressor stations. In order to ensure that the natural gas flowing through the pipeline remains pressurized, it must periodically be compressed along the pipeline at the compressor stations. This section examines the land codes of Finland, Sweden and Norway and discusses the possibilities for the project company to delineate which machine or facility is, or is not, part of a real estate through registration. This registration has proven useful in determining the scope of the real estate mortgage vis-à-vis the scope of a business mortgage established to the project company s assets. The registration should be used to designate that the turbines, for example, are part of the project company s real estate, and therefore, pledged under the real estate mortgage. If this registration is not carried out, there is a risk that the turbines will be considered to be pledged as a part of the business mortgage established to the project company s assets. In Finland, a business mortgage lender may only recover 50 percent of the enforcement proceeds and the remainder is divided among all creditors. 2. 2 Intercreditor agreements t is customary for the members of the banking syndicate that finance a project loan to enter into an intercreditor agreement. This agreement regulates, among other things, the relationship between the senior and junior creditors regarding the terms of loan repayment and the payment order regarding the payment received from the enforcement of the project collateral. In Finland, the Act on Creditors Payment Order (1578 / 1992, as amended) regulates the payment order in a debtor s bankruptcy or foreclosure. Similar acts are in force in Sweden and Norway. However, it is possible for the parties to agree on an alternative payment order and these agreements are binding inter partes. In Finland, in order for the obligations of an intercreditor agreement to bind third parties, the agreement must be construed as a pledge or transfer of receivables with the intention of securing payment to the senior creditor. It may also be construed as a new financing form to which the Finnish Promissory Notes Act (487 / 1987, as amended) would be applied by analogy. 2. 3 The effects of the so-called earnings principle on the collateral securing the repayment of the project loan and on the construction agreement Due to the scale and complexity of natural gas pipeline projects, the construction of a natural gas pipelines usually takes years to complete. The so-called earnings principle affects the structure of the construction agreement. The question discussed in this section is whether it is advisable for the project company to allow the constructor to build the pipeline on its own account or whether the project company would benefit from an agreement under which the pipeline would be constructed in parts and the ownership of individual segments of the pipeline would be transferred to the project company upon their completion. If the constructor files for bankruptcy, this above-mentioned framework could serve as a basis for concluding which parts of the unfinished pipeline would be part of the project company s or the constructor s bankruptcy estate and which part will be covered by a business mortgage established to the project company s or the construction company s assets. In addition, the earnings principle affects the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries. If the pledged receivable is not divisible, and the pledgor was unable to earn the receivable before the pledgor s bankruptcy, the pledgor s bankruptcy estate has the right to terminate the underlying pledge agreement, rendering the pledge null and void. If the bankruptcy estate continues the pledgor s business, it is entitled to the <b>pledged</b> <b>assets</b> because no part of the pledge was earned by the pledgor prior to its bankruptcy. If (a) the pledged agreement is divisible, (b) the estate continues the pledgor s business and (c) the estate is unable to terminate the portions of the pledge already earned, the earnings principle divides the pledge into two parts: the pledgee will receive the part of the pledge earned prior to the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the part earned after bankruptcy. This study raises arguments against the contemporary view accepted in legal literature in relation to the pledging of future receivables. The contemporary view is to consider that the earnings principle is taken into account when the pledge is established. The view presented in this study is that the earnings principle does not come into effect prior to the execution phase of the pledge agreement. 2. 4 Pledging of the project company s shares The shareholders of a project company usually pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. The study analyses in detail the problems related to the control function and the collateral function of a share pledge. The control function related to a share pledge affects the possession of the shares from the establishment of the share pledge to the enforcement of the pledge. The thorough examination of the parties risk positions serves as an interesting starting point. The section discusses how the composition of a project company s board of directors may affect the decisions the project company makes and the claw back of the company s pledge/mortgage agreements to the project company s bankruptcy estate. There are jurisdictions in which a project company s sponsors are unable to pledge the project company s shares to the banking syndicate as collateral for the project loan. In such jurisdictions, a floating charge as found in English law may prove a useful tool due to the fact that it covers all of a company s assets (including real property). In such cases, the floating charge would de facto have the same characteristics as a share pledge in terms of controlling the project. Tutkimuksesta yleensä Tutkimuksessa on pyritty hakemaan vastausta siiten, miten Suomeen voitaisiin luoda maakaasumarkkinat rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeudellisesti kannattavalla tavalla rakentamalla putki Norjasta Ruotsin läpi Suomeen. Tarkastelun kohteena ovat erityisesti projektiyhtiön maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien rakentamista varten ottaman projektilainan vakuudet ja pankkikonsortion vakuusoikeudellinen asema. Tämä pääkysymys huomioiden tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan, miten rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeuden yleisiä oppeja ja sen mahdollistamia oikeudellisia instrumentteja voitaisiin hyödyntää siten, että projektin rahoittava pankkikonsortio saisi lainalleen kattavat vakuudet. Maakaasuputken vaatimat kiinteisöt Tutkimuksen viitekehys muodostuu kiinteistöjen osalta tarkasteltavien maiden kiinteistöjärjestelmien erojen ja yhtäläisyyksien sekä kiinteistön ulottuvuuden selvittämisestä. Kiinteistön ulottuvuudella on merkitystä sen suhteen, mitä omaisuutta kuuluu kiinteistö- tai laitoskiinnityksen piiriin ja mikä osuus on vakuutena yhtiön varoihin vahvistetun yrityskiinnityksen nojalla. Maakaasuputken rahoittajien asema Maakaasuputken rakentaminen toteutetaan projektilainalla/(-lainoilla), jonka myöntää yleensä pankkikonsortio. Senioriluotonantaja, jonka saatavalle junioriluotonantajan saatava on alistettu, on kohdeyhtiön varoja jaettaessa maksunsaantijärjestyksessä muita rahoittajia edellä, joten huonommassa asemassa olevien juniorilainojen pääoma ja korot voidaan maksaa pääsääntöisesti silloin, kun senioriluoton pääoma ja korot on maksettu. Mezzanine-instrumentit ovat sopimuksellisesti tai rakenteellisesti alisteisia suhteessa seniorilainoihin. Mezzanine-velkojat luetaan junioriluotonantajiin. Ne tulevat velkojien keskenään sopimassa maksunsaantijärjestyksessä senioriluotonantajien jälkeen, mutta ennen muita junioriluotonantajia. Tutkimuksessa tullaan perustellusti siihen tulokseen, että tarkoituksenmukaisinta olisi mieltää velkojien välinen alistamissopimus saatavan panttaukseksi tai siirroksi (vaikka sitä kansainvälisessä luotonannossa ei näin jäsennetäkään), taikka vaihtoehtoisesti omaksi vakuusmuodokseen, johon voitaisiin analogisesti soveltaa velkakirjalain määräyksiä. Urakkasopimuksen rakenteen vaikutus ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuuteen sekä ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuus maakaasuputken tuottaman kassavirran panttaukseen Ansaintaperiaatteella tarkoitetaan panttioikeudellisessa mielessä, ettei saamista koskeva panttaus sido pantinantajan ulosmittausvelkojia ja konkurssivelkojia, ennen kuin pantatun saamisen perusteena olevan pantinantajan suoritusvelvollisuus on täytetty. Ansaintaperiaatteen vaikutusta projektirahoituksessa tarkastellaan tässä tutkimuksessa silmällä pitäen urakoitsijan mahdollisia taloudellisia vaikeuksia ja näiden vaikutusta projektilainan vakuuksiin. Sillä, toimiiko urakoitsija rakennuttajana omaan lukuunsa niin, että maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien omistusoikeus luovutetaan projektiyhtiölle vasta niiden valmistuttua vai rakennetaanko putki suoraan projektiyhtiön lukuun niin, että omistusoikeus maakaasuputkeen ja kompressoriasemiin siirtyy sitä mukaa kuin ne valmistuvat, on ratkaiseva merkitys. Ansaintaperiaatetta on perinteisesti tutkittu ja oikeuskäytännössä sovellettu kassavirran panttaamisen yhteydessä. Maakaasun siirtomaksuista kertyvä kassavirta on projektiyhtiön tärkein omaisuuserä. Maakaasua siirtävän projektiyhtiön kassavirran panttaamiseen ansaintaperiaate soveltuu hyvin alalla noudatetun käytännön vuoksi. Tässä tutkimuksessa ansaintaperiaatteen sovellettavuutta tutkitaan kuitenkin myös rakennutettavien esineiden omistusoikeuden siirtymisen kohdalla. Projektiyhtiön pankkitilien panttaus Pankkitilien panttausta koskeva sääntely on tässä tutkimuksessa soveltuvilta osiltaan Pohjoismaissa hyvin samankaltaista. Sillä sijaitsevatko projektiyhtiön pankkitilit pankkikonsortiopankeissa vai jossain näiden ulkopuolisissa pankeissa on kuitenkin merkitystä Ruotsissa. Ruotsin konkurssilaissa ei nimittäin ole erityistä kieltoa pankille kuitata saatavansa pankkitilillä olevia saatavia vastaan, vaikka kuittaus konkurssin ulkopuolella olisikin sopimuksen nojalla kielletty. Ruotsissa tilipankissa olevien varojen on katsottu olevan pankin omaisuutta ja sen käytettävissä kuittaukseen panttauksesta huolimatta. Velkoja voi kuitata velallisen konkurssissa sekä siinä tapauksessa, että hänen oma velkansa on erääntymätön tai ehdollinen että siinä tapauksessa, että velallisen velka on erääntymätön tai ehdollinen. Suomessa pankkien eriarvoisuudesta johtuvat ongelmat on huomioitu konkurssilaissa. Ongelma esiintyy ainoastaan tilanteessa, jossa projektilainanvakuudet täytyy jakaa pankkikonsortion jäsenten kesken. Käytännössä kuitenkin projektilainan vakuuksia hallinnoi aina vakuusagentti kaikkien pankkikonsortion jäsenten lukuun ja pankkikonsortion jäsenten kuittausoikeus on sopimusoikeudellisesti estetty velkojien välisen alistamissopimuksen (intercreditor agreement) kuittauskielloilla. Tutkimuksessa päädytään perustellusti siihen tulokseen, että vakuusagentin käyttö ja velkojien välisen alistamissopimuksen määräykset ovat välttämättömiä erityisesti Ruotsissa, jotta vältetään tilipankin kuittausoikeuden aiheuttama ongelma. Osakekantapantti ja kontrollifunktio Osakekantapantti on projektirahoituksessa takauslain mukainen vierasvelkapanttaus. Pankkikonsortio kontrolloi projektiyhtiön hallintoa tälle annetun valtakirjan ja hallituksen tarkkailijajäsenten avulla. Osakekantapanttiin liittyvä kontrollioikeuden käyttäminen ei merkitse ainoastaan vaikuttamista osakekantapantin kohteena olevaan yhtiöön, vaan kontrollioikeudella säädellään myös osakekantapantin realisointiajankohtaa. Mahdollinen maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaus Kansainvälisiä sijoittajia voisi houkutella sijoittamaan suomalaisiin/Pohjoismaalaisiin hankkeisiin mahdollistamalla maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuuskäytön. Esimerkkiä lupien vakuuskäytölle löytyy muun muassa kaivosluvan vakuuskäytöstä sekä Norjasta, missä putken operoimiseen ja rakentamiseen myönnettyä lupaa voidaan käyttää vakuutena operointia ja rakentamista varten otetulle lainalle. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisen mahdollistaminen ei aiheuttaisi suurta hallinnollista taakkaa maakaasumarkkinaviranomaisena toimivalle Energiamarkkinavirastolle sen vuoksi, ettei Suomeen tule useita maakaasuputkihankkeita. Kyse olisi todennäköisesti muutamasta luvasta. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisella olisi ehkä enemmänkin merkitystä maakaasuputkihankkeen vakuuskokonaisuuden kannalta. Olisi varmasti oikeuspoliittisesti tarkoituksenmukaista, mikäli maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuuskäyttö sallittaisiin, samassa yhteydessä muuttaa lakia/maanmittauslaitosten kirjaamisohjeita mahdollistaen pakkolunastetun käyttöoikeuden luokitteleminen rasitteeksi. Näiden kahden vakuusoikeuteen liittyvän muutoksen avulla pantin kohteena olisi projektiyhtiön harjoittama maakaasuverkkotoiminta sekä toiminnan edellyttämä kiinteistöomaisuus kokonaisuutena. ...|$|E
