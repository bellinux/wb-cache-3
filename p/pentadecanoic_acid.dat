The organism used the acids as precursors for the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and fatty aldehydes, which in turn were employed in the synthesis of phospholipid, mainly ethanolamine plasmalogen. Isobutyric acid was incorporated primarily into branched-chain C 14 and C 16 acids (tentatively identified as 12 -methyl tridecanoic and 14 -methyl <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> respectively), and into fatty aldehydes.

The cell equipped with two concentric guarded electrodes {{is able to}} eliminate the error due to dimensional change of specimen in the permittivity measurement and to measure the specimen thickness simultaneously. The accuracy of permittivity depends mainly on the flatness of the four concentric electrodes, which are consisted of those two guarded electrodes and their guard electrodes. The temperature range, in which the flatness of surface of the four concen-tric electrodes was ensured, was widely extended by an improved design of the cell. The cell is usable to measure a very low dielectric loss owing to the three-terminal configuration for each guard-ed electrode. The performance of the cell was tested by measuring the dielectric and dilatometric properties of undecanoic, tridecanoic, and <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acids.</b> These acids show a cosiderable change of their lattice spacings at the transition temperature and show an extremely low dielectric loss near 200 K.

In {{the present study}} {{we set out to}} identify and compare the products and possible intermediates of alpha-oxidation formed in rat hepatocytes and by rat liver microsomes. In the presence of NADPH, Fe 3 + and phosphate, microsomes decarboxylated not only 3 -methyl fatty acids but also 2 -methyl fatty acids and even straight chain fatty acids. The decarboxylation products of 3 -methylheptadecanoic and palmitic acids were purified by highperformance liquid chromatography and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as 2 -methylhexadecanoic and <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> respectively. Inclusion in the incubation mixtures of glutathione plus glutathione peroxidase inhibited decarboxylation by more than 90 %, suggesting that a 2 -hydroperoxy fatty acid is formed as a possible intermediate. However, we have not yet been able to unequivocally identify this intermediate. Instead, several possible rearrangement metabolites were identified. In isolated rat hepatocytes incubated with 3 -methylheptadecanoic acid, the formation of the decarboxylation product, 2 -methylhexadecanoic acid, was demonstrated, but no accumulation of putative intermediates or rearrangement products was observed. Our data do not allow us to draw conclusions on whether the reconstituted microsomal system is representative of the cellular alpha-oxidation system.

We compared the pattern of change over time in the fatty acid composition of plasma, erythrocyte, buccal cell, and adipose tissue lipids when changing between diets high in SFA or n- 6 PUFA. Twenty-four (n = 7 male) healthy participants were instructed to consume either an SFA-rich (18 % energy) or n- 6 PUFA-rich (10 % energy) diet for 8 wk before crossing over, without washout, to the alternate diet. The FA composition of plasma triacylglycerol (TG), nonesterified FAs, cholesterol ester, total phospholipids, erythrocyte total phospholipids, erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine, and buccal cell total phospholipids was measured every 2 wk and adipose tissue TG every 4 wk during the 16 -wk intervention.

Depending on the temperature T, the LE phase transforms through first order phase transitions into two different condensed phases called LC 1 and LC 2. The LE-LC 1 transition is observed below a well-defined temperature T* of 24. 0 ± 0. 5 ^∘C for MYA and 35. 6 ± 0. 5 ^∘C for PDA.

These results are in good agreement with previous measurements by Bibo and Peterson (Adv. Mater. 2 (1990) 309). Fluorescence microscopy observations in the coexistence region show that the LC 1 domains are circular and easily deformable, whereas the LC 2 domains are highly ramified and evolve very slowly towards their equilibrium circular shape.

Crude extracts from fruits of Capsicum chinense, C. frutescens, C. baccatum, and C. annuum, were prepared and tested under laboratory conditions for their insecticidal and acaricidal performance. Mortality was greatest (94 %) when fruit extract of accession PI- 593566 (C. annuum) was sprayed on larvae of the cabbage looper, while crude extracts of accessions PI- 241675 (C. frutescens) and PI- 310488 (C. annuum) were repellent to the spider mite.

40|$|Background: There {{is a lack}} {{of studies}} {{comparing}} dietary assessment methods with the biomarkers of fatty acids in children. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the suitability of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to rank young children according to their intake of dairy and fish products by comparing food frequency estimates to the plasma phospholipid fatty acids <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Design: Cross-sectional data for the present study were derived from the prospective cohort ‘Environmental Triggers of Type 1 Diabetes Study’. Infants were recruited from the Norwegian general population during 2001 – 2007. One hundred and ten (age 3 – 10 years) children had sufficient volumes of plasma and FFQ filled in within 2 months from blood sampling and were included in this evaluation study. The quantitative determination of plasma phospholipid fatty acids was done by fatty acid methyl ester analysis. The association between the frequency of dairy and fish product intake and the plasma phospholipid fatty acids was assessed by a Spearman correlation analysis and by investigating whether participants were classified into the same quartiles of distribution. Results: Significant correlations were found between <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and the intake frequency of total dairy products (r= 0. 29), total fat dairy products (r= 0. 39), and cheese products (r= 0. 36).

Conclusions: The present study suggests that, when using the plasma phospholipid fatty acids <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> EPA, and DHA as biomarkers, the FFQ used in young children showed a moderate capability to rank the intake frequency of dairy products with a high-fat content and cod liver/fish oil supplements...|$|E

The different apple juices {{were obtained from}} three consecutive harvests (1997, 1998, and 1999). The fatty acids concentration in apple juice together with chemometric techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), allowed us to differentiate apple juices {{on the basis of}} the sweet or sharp category to which the cider apple variety belongs. Fatty acids such as the unsaturated oleic and linoleic acids, and saturated caprylic, capric, stearic, and palmitic acids were related to the sweet cider apple category, while <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> is related to the sharp class...|$|E

Algae production was studied in ten-liter, open-air, aerated bioreactors and sampling was done daily to monitor the cell growth. At {{the end of each}} fermentation, the dry mass, lipid amount and fatty acid profiles were determined. The algae were grown according to designed experiments (central composite design (CCD)) at 15, 22. 5 and 30 °C medium and aerated with air containing 5, 10 and 15 % v/v CO 2. It was observed that in 15 °C experiments, the fatty acid profile was formed mainly by unsaturated fatty acid (both mono and poly unsaturated) and the amount of saturated fatty acids increased by increased CO 2 levels. The saturated fatty acid content increased with increasing growth temperature. Dominantly observed fatty acids are <b>Pentadecanoic</b> <b>Acid</b> (C 15 : 0), <b>Pentadecanoic</b> <b>Acid</b> (C 15 : 0), Palmitic Acid (C 16 : 0), Linolenic Acid (C 18 : 3), Oleic Acid (C 18 : 1). In the algal productions performed at 22. 5 °C and 30 °C medium conditions, the fatty acid content was mainly formed by saturated fatty acids. However, the amount of lipid produced increased with increasing temperatures. The highest cell growth was seen at 15 °C experiments. The lowest growth rate was observed at 30 ° C experiments. It was observed that the medium temperature had the largest effect for the production of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The carbon dioxide was found effective linearly on the fatty acid production...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of whole cells containing cytochrome P- 450 BM- 3 monooxygenase [EC 1. 14. 14. 1] for the bioconversion of long-chain {{saturated fatty acids}} to omega- 1, omega- 2, and omega- 3 hydroxy fatty acids was investigated. We utilized <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and studied its conversion to a mixture of 12 -, 13 -, and 14 -hydroxypentadecanoic acids by this monooxygenase. For this purpose, Escherichia coli recombinants containing plasmid pCYP 102 producing the fatty acid monooxygenase cytochrome P- 450 BM- 3 were used. To overcome inefficient uptake of <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> by intact E. coli cells, we made use of a cloned fatty acid uptake system from Pseudomonas oleovorans which, {{in contrast to the}} common FadL fatty acid uptake system of E. coli, does not require coupling by FadD (acyl-coenzyme A synthetase) of the imported fatty acid to coenzyme A. This system from P. oleovorans is encoded by a gene carried by plasmid pGEc 47, which has been shown to effect facilitated uptake of oleic acid in E. coli W 3110 (M. Nieboer, Ph. D. thesis, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands, 1996). By using a double recombinant of E. coli K 27, which is a fadD mutant and therefore unable to consume substrates or products via the beta-oxidation cycle, a twofold increase in productivity was achieved. Applying cytochrome P- 450 BM- 3 monooxygenase as a biocatalyst in whole cells does not require the exogenous addition of the costly cofactor NADPH. In combination with the coenzyme A-independent fatty acid uptake system from P. oleovorans, cytochrome P- 450 BM- 3 recombinants appear to be useful alternatives to the enzymatic approach for the bioconversion of long-chain fatty acids to subterminal hydroxylated fatty acids...|$|E

Within 4 days after angina attack, BMIPP and Tl- 201 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) were performed during a pain-free period within 2 days of one another. BMIPP uptake was decreased compared to Tl- 201 uptake (discordant) in all patients (100 %) and in 11 / 54 (20 %) of myocardial segments. The discordant BMIPP uptake was seen {{more often in}} segments exhibiting wall motion abnormalities (hypokinesis) in comparison to segments showing normal wall motion (77 % vs 5 %, p< 0. 005). Thus, BMIPP imaging may provide a novel means of identifying patients with metabolically disturbed myocardium, particularly among patients with unstable angin...|$|E
40|$|Sporulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae G 2 - 2 was {{inhibited}} by {{the antibiotic}} cerulenin {{which is known}} to be a specific inhibitor of fatty acid and sterol synthesis. This inhibition was reversed by various fatty acids, especially by oleic acid (C 18 : 1) and <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 15 : 0). Ergosterol showed only slight reversibility of this inhibition. When cerulenin was added to the sporulation medium later than 12 h after the start of incubation, the marked inhibition disappeared. When the fatty acid fraction extracted from the sporulated yeasts was added to the cells pretreated with cerulenin for more than 6 h, sporulation became evident 6 h after the fatty acid fraction addition. Therefore, sufficient synthesis of fatty acids required for sporulation was assumed to occur during the first 6 h in phase I of yeast sporulation...|$|E
30|$|Hair {{growth is}} a highly {{regulated}} cyclical process. Three distinct phases have been defined for the mammalian cycle: anagen (growing phase), catagen (regression phase), and telogen (resting phase). Although {{little is known about}} the mechanism that regulates the hair cycle, it is believed that dermal papillae (DP) derived from mesenchymal cells play an essential role in controlling the established hair follicle and hair cycle. The purpose of this investigation was to find the components of woods and fungi that exert a proliferative activity on DP cells. Results show that the fungus YL 161 (ethyl acetate extract, 1 ppm),Agaricus blazei (ethyl acetate extract, 0.1 ppm), and the bark ofCamptotheca cuminata (methanol extract of bark, 0.1 ppm) exhibit higher growth-promoting activity than <b>pentadecanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> These components that have a proliferative effect on DP cells may be useful hair growth-stimulating materials and can be used to understand the mechanism of hair growth.|$|E
