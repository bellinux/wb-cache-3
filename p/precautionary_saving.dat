40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{existence}} of <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> using subjective or self-reported measures of income uncertainty drawn from Japanese household data (primarily from those in their 30 s). Two subjective measures are tested: one concerning labor earnings and the other concerning public pension benefits. The results show that, among either nuclear family households or households that do not receive income transfers from parents, there exist <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> due to uncertainty concerning public pension benefits. As the respondents are primarily in their 30 s, we find that those households start to save based on precautionary motives early in their lives. The finding {{that the effect of}} public pension uncertainty concerning savings is manifested in nuclear family households suggests that intergenerational risk-sharing reduces risk and therefore wealth accumulation. <b>Precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> are found to take the form of relatively low-risk assets; no <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> are found in securities. No evidence has been found for <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> being motivated by uncertainty over labor earnings when economic prospects are utilized as the measure of labor income uncertainty. ...|$|R
40|$|A common {{assumption}} {{in standard}} economic models is that agents are risk-averse and prudent, {{and it is}} often argued that prudence is necessary to generate <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings.</b> This paper shows that prudence {{is not necessary to}} generate <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> in small open economy models with more than two periods. A new class of preferences, which enables the isolation of the effect of risk aversion on <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings,</b> is introduced. The effects of changes in risk aversion, interest rates, and persistence and volatility of shocks on average asset holdings are qualitatively identical to the ones observed for standard constant-elasticity-of-substitution preferences. These results show that the almost universal assertion in the literature - that only prudent consumers can generate positive levels of <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> - is simply incorrect.

50|$|The first {{explanation}} is that the retired individuals are cautious about unpredictable expenses. The additional saving that arises due to this behaviour is called <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving.</b> <b>Precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> may be made for the probable event of living longer than expected and hence having to provide for a longer than the planned span of retirement. Another rational reason is possibility of ill-health and huge medical expenses. These probable events make the elderly save more.|$|E
50|$|Empirical {{work has}} mostly {{focused on the}} {{representative}} individualâ€™s determinants of <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving.</b> More recent work focused {{on the importance of}} the time dimension. Under this notion, uncertainty about households' anticipated future income, due to expected unemployment, strengthens the precautionary motive for saving and hence holds down consumption spending (cetrus paribus). This in turn justifies the notion that <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> may be part of the explanation of why large consumption falls anticipate large increases in unemployment in response to exogenous shocks to the economy.|$|E
40|$|While the "risk amelioration" {{literature}} suggests that risk sharing channels savings into risky but productive technologies and hence favours growth, models focused on <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> reverse this conclusion. We solve, by means of numerical techniques, a model based on human capital accumulation through education, and {{we find that the}} increase in <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> makes labour more productive in the goods sector and draws resources from education, which is the "growth leading" activity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of {{financial}} intermediation on <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> and incentives to invest in a setting where the credit market is subject to informational asymmetry due to moral hazard. We show that <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> are the outcome of financial contracts that offer incomplete insurance. However, such a provision of incomplete insurance generates incentives to invest. The magnitude of investment and <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> depend on risk bearing and insurance effects accompanied by financial contracts. The first effect enhances the incentive to invest and the second one has a dampening effect on investment. We also find that in a richer economy the former effect dominates so that incentive to invest is greater and the <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> is smaller. We also make comparison in between three different financial regimes. (a) Financial autarky (b) Full information and (c) informationally constrained financial markets.

In other words, the heterogeneity of consumption/saving behavior of individuals in the economy makes it difficult to precisely quantify the precautionary motive for saving.|$|E

We find that risk strongly affects savings, although this effect is limited to those households whose head holds only one job.

50|$|<b>Precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> is {{different}} from precautionary savings. Saving is a flow variable quantity, measured in units of currency per unit of time (such as dollars per year).

50|$|The {{strength}} of the <b>precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> motive can be measured by absolute prudence, which is defined as. Similarly, relative prudence is defined as absolute prudence, multiplied by the level of consumption.

5000|$|Defining this concept, {{individuals}} save out {{of their}} current income to smooth the expected consumption stream over time.

40|$|The aim of {{this note}} is to suggest that prudence, i. e. {{convexity}} of marginal utility, can only explain a small share of <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings,</b> which we may define as savings generated by variance in income.

This is a calibrated GE model with incomplete markets and uninsurable income risk, designed to quantify the size of <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> {{and the degree of}} wealth inequality. The results of this global robustness analysis are broadly consistent with Aiyagari's findings. Even when considering priors for the parameters uncertainty which are highly dispersed, the size of the <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> is modest: at most, they account for an 11 % increase in the saving rate. However, the results show that the parameter representing the exogenous borrowing limit seems to lead to relatively large changes in measures of wealth inequality. The Gini index increases by 15 points when considering values of the borrowing limits that lead to empirically plausible shares of households with a negative net worth. The parameters that quantitatively have the largest effects on determining the wealth Gini index are the capital share, the borrowing limit, and the depreciation rate.

50|$|<b>Precautionary</b> <b>saving</b> {{is saving}} (non-expenditure of {{a portion of}} income) that occurs in {{response}} to uncertainty regarding future income.

Accordingly, individuals will not be able to insure against some bad state of the economy in the future. They anticipate that if this bad state is realized, they will earn lower income. To avoid adverse effects of future income fluctuations and retain a smooth path of consumption, they set aside a precautionary reserve, called precautionary savings, by consuming less in the current period, and resort to it in case the bad state is realized in the future.|$|E

40|$|In {{incomplete}} market models, agents with homothetic preferences {{over one}} non-durable consumption good and exposed to idiosyncratic income shocks use <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> {{as an instrument}} to smooth consumption across different contingencies. The magnitude and role of <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> is therefore essential {{in the understanding of}} savings behavior of agents in such an economy. In this dissertation, I study the effects of consumption commitments on aggregate savings behavior within an otherwise standard incomplete market framework. In the first chapter, I explore the impact of a consumption commitment good like housing in an incomplete market framework (Aiyagari(1994), Huggett(1997)). Conceptually, I concentrate on the argument whether consumption of housing is associated with changes in risk aversion and therefore reflected in <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> behavior of agents. I study an analytical framework that captures key elements in the data like (i) heterogeneity in earnings through fixed effects and uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks, (ii) fraction of income spent on housing, (iii) magnitude of moving costs. In the second chapter, I present a dynamic incomplete market model with a key feature: a commitment good (housing) with positive transaction (moving) costs. I focus on a stationary recursive equilibrium for agents in the benchmark economy. I calibrate the benchmark model to the US economy. I find that the benchmark economy replicates (i) the fraction of income spent on housing services, (ii) the fraction of people moving in each period. In the third chapter, I quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of <b>precautionary</b> <b>savings</b> in the presence of housing consumption in the benchmark economy and compare it to the standard incomplete market model.
