40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is an optimization technique for applications like control or scheduling problems. It {{is used in}} learning situations, where success and failure of the system are the only training information. Unfortunately, {{we have to pay}} a price for this powerful ability: long training times and the instability of the learning process are not tolerable for industrial applications with large continuous state spaces. From our point of view, the integration of prior knowledge is a key mechanism for making autonomous learning practicable for industrial applications. The learning control architecture Fynesse provides a uni ed view onto the integration of <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> knowledge in the reinforcement learning framework. In this way, other approaches in this area can be interpreted as special cases of Fynesse. The key features of Fynesse are (1) the integration of <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> knowledge like linear controllers, control characteristics or fuzzy controllers, (2) autonomous learning of control strategies and (3) the interpretation of learned strategies in terms of fuzzy control rules.

They confirmed the conclusions (Milhaud et at., 1960) in the rat that cortisone slowed the rates of calcium fixation in bone, diminished intestinal absorption and in-creased secretion. In previous studies (Garrett et at., 1963) the analog computer was used to fit a basic model to the Ca 47 blood level data.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess safety and {{efficacy}} of thrombolysis in the setting of aggressive blood pressure (BP) control as it compares to standard BP control or no BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) between 2004 - 2011. We compared the outcomes of patients treated with tPA for AIS who required aggressive BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis to those requiring standard or no BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis. The primary outcome of interest was safety, defined by all grades of hemorrhagic transformation and neurologic deterioration. The secondary outcome was efficacy, determined by functional status at discharge, and in-hospital deaths. Results: Of 427 patients included in the analysis, 89 received aggressive BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis, 65 received standard BP control, and 273 required no BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis. Patients requiring BP control had more severe strokes, with median arrival National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 10 (IQR [6 - 17]) in patients not requiring BP control versus 11 (IQR [5 - 16]) and 13 (IQR [7 - 20]) in patients requiring standard and aggressive BP lowering therapies, respectively (p= 0. 048). In a multiple logistic regression model adjusting for baseline differences, there were no statistically significant differences in adverse events between the three groups (P> 0. 10). Conclusion: We observed no association between BP control and adverse outcomes in ischemic stroke patients undergoing thrombolysis. However, additional study is necessary to confirm or refute the safety of aggressive BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis...|$|R

Mean calf filtration, however was significantly reduced from 0. 15 to 0. 08 ml/ 100 ml/min with ANP. Heart rate increased 20 percent with ANP infusion, wheras blood pressure was unchanged. Calf conductance (blood flow/arterial pressure) and venous compliance were unaffected by ANP infusion. Placebo infusion had no effect relative to prior baseline control measurements.

Samples were obtained from 21 patients, and the blood was collected in two occasions: Twenty-four hours <b>prior</b> (<b>control)</b> and after administration of the radionuclide (test). Cells were placed in 1640 RPMI medium with bovine calf serum and incubated with phytohaemagglutinin for 48 and 72 hr at 37 degrees C.

40|$|Seed of six {{commercial}} Brachiaria {{species is}} extensively produced for pasture sowing. Production is restricted geographically and seasonally by photoperiodic flowering reactions. It also requires a <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> of vegetative tiller production, {{and therefore a}} reliable dry season. The necessary conditions are most readily found at high tropical latitudes. Seed crop management is mostly conventional. Vigorous synchronized tillering is stimulated by decapitation and use of nitrogenous fertilizer at times when rainfall, temperature, and sunshine are expected to favor unrestricted development. Ripe seed sheds readily and, coupled with imperfect synchronization of crop ripening, tends to make conventional direct harvesting inefficient and its timing critical- Where possible, seeds are let to fall and accumulate, and then recovered. Seed yields range from more than 1, 000 kg/ha of pure seed to less than 100 kg/ha. Seed quality is heavily influenced by vitality and dormancy Vitality depends mostly on maturity of seed at harvest, being higher in accumulated fallen seed and much lower in directly severed seed. Dormancy is strongly developed in the genus and persists in most taxa at least into the season after harvest. This creates problems for germination testing and in the field use of fresh seed. Breaching the husk, most commonly by sulfuric acid, provides a partial solution. Suggestions are offered for improving seed production when developing new cultivars, particularly for selecting flowering control mechanisms compatible with production at low latitudes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{much has}} been learned {{recently}} of the mechanisms that regulate osteoclastic differentiation, much less is known of the means through which their resorptive activity is controlled. This is especially so for human osteoclasts. We have developed an assay {{that allows us to}} measure resorptive activity while minimizing confounding effects on differentiation, by optimizing osteoclastogenesis, so that measurable resorption occurs over a short period, and by relating resorption in each culture during the test period to the resorption that had occurred in the same culture in a <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> period. We found that RANKL strongly stimulated release of the collagen degradation fragment CTX-I by osteoclasts over a similar range to that over which it induces osteoclastic differentiation, consistent with a distinct action on osteoclastic function. CT dose-dependently inhibited bone resorption, while PTH, IL- 1, TNF-{alpha}, IL- 6, IL- 8, VEGF, MCP- 1, MIP- 1 {gamma}, IFN-{gamma} and dibutyryl cyclic GMP showed no significant effect. Calcium ions, cyclosporin A, IFN-{beta} and dibutyryl cyclic AMP all strongly suppressed resorption. Bone resorption was also strongly suppressed by alendronate, the cysteine protease inhibitor E 64, and the cathepsin K inhibitor MV 061194. We found that inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) had no effect on CTX-I release. Moreover, release of the MMP-derived collagen fragment ICTP represented less that 0. 01 % of the quantity of CTX-II released in our cultures. This suggests that MMPs make at most a very small contribution to the bone-resorptive activity of osteoclasts...|$|E
40|$|Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) {{systems have}} been in {{existence}} for over 2 decades yet businesses are still losing billions of dollars annually {{in the implementation of}} software designed to reduce costs and increase profitability. The inability to manage risks is an area that contributes to these losses, specifically due to uncertain outcomes when dealing with an interconnected construct such as risk, and a research gap at the tactical and operational levels between risks and controls. A comparative case study approach, encompassing 12 different organisations was adopted to explore emerging patterns at the project implementation level, and from this three contributions emerged. After observing risks behaving in a hierarchical fashion with predictable results, Hierarchy of Risk models representing different implementation stages were constructed. Although these models are still in their formative stages, it may prove useful in furthering our understanding of the close inter-relationship between different risks, where they occur in ERP implementations and the implications of managerial choice when determining risk prioritisation. A second finding is that no direct linear relationship appears to exist between risks and controls. Rather, this counter-intuitive finding suggests that it is additional factors including risk categories, implementation stages, <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> decision making and the hierarchical flow-on effect of impacts as a consequence of identified risks. Finally, by combining the Hierarchy of Risk models and the risk-to-impact-to-control relationship, a method of reverse engineering portfolios of control was discovered. This potentially offers an explanation as to how portfolios of control can be constructed, and why they are essential in ERP implementations...|$|E
