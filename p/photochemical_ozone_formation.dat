A conceptual model of O 3 air pollution is developed based on the analysis of data obtained at Tung Chung (TC) in Hong Kong. By comparing meteorological parameters between O 3 and non-O 3 episode days, {{it was found that}} high temperatures, strong solar radiation, low wind speeds and relative humidity, northeasterly and/or northwesterly prevailing winds were favorable for the O 3 formation, while tropical cyclones were most conducive to the occurrence of O 3 episodes. Backward trajectories simulation and graphical illustration of O 3 pollution suggested that super-regional (i. e. central and eastern China) and regional (i. e. Pearl River Delta, southern China) transport was another factor that contributed to high O 3 levels in Hong Kong. The photochemical O 3 formation, generally VOC-limited in Hong Kong, was controlled by a small number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Furthermore, the positive matrix factorization (PMF) simulation suggested that solvent usage and vehicular emissions are the major contributors to ambient VOCs in Hong Kong.

40|$|The main {{sources of}} {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) in the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP) are vehicular emissions. The addition of ethanol to gasoline results in increased emissions of some carbonyl compounds inducing a problem in photochemical smog formation in urban areas. At the same time, tropospheric ozone {{represents one of the}} main atmospheric pollutants in MASP. The megacities {{play an important role in}} atmospheric chemistry and climate that not only affects local populations but also in regional and global scale. In São Paulo state, controlling ozone levels is a priority, not only in the urban area but also in the neighboring cities and agricultural areas affected by the <b>photochemical</b> precursors and <b>ozone</b> coming from the megacity. Since this pollutant is formed in the atmosphere by photochemical reactions that depend on VOCs concentrations, NOx and UV radiation (l≤ 394 nm), the current study presents data from continuous sampling and analysis of their precursors in SP city. Hourly ozone and NOx were measured during the sampling campaign. Automatic hydrocarbons measurements were carried out 24 hours a day during 2012 and analyzed on a CG-FID coupled to thermal desorption unit. Meanwhile carbonyl compounds were collected every 2 -hour between 8 a. m. to 6 p. m. and analyzed by HPLC. During the sampling period were obtained 110 samples of carbonyls compounds and more than 800 samples of hydrocarbons. The results indicated that most abundant hydrocarbons were toluene, ethane, propylene, propane, ethylene, 2 -methylpentane, trans- 2 -butene, cis- 2 - butene and 1 -butene which are related with a greater <b>photochemical</b> <b>ozone</b> potential <b>formation</b> following the MIR reactivity scale of Carter. The average mixing ratios of carbonyls were 9. 8 and 5. 8 ppbv for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde respectively. Statistical analyses were applied.

40|$|AbstractEnzymatic {{processes}} {{have been}} implemented in {{a broad range of}} industries in recent decades because they are specific, fast in action and often save raw materials, energy, chemicals and/or water compared to conventional processes. A number of comparative environmental assessment studies have been conducted in the past 15 years to investigate whether these properties of enzymatic processes lead to environmental improvements and assess whether they could play a role in moving toward cleaner industrial production. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss the findings of these studies and to recommend further developments regarding environmental assessment and implementation of the technology. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been widely used as an assessment tool, while use of the ‘carbon footprint’ concept and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is limited to a few studies. Many studies have addressed global warming as an indicator and several studies have furthermore addressed other impact categories (acidification, eutrophication, <b>photochemical</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>formation,</b> energy and land use). The results show that implementing enzymatic processes in place of conventional processes generally results in a reduced contribution to global warming and also a reduced contribution to acidification, eutrophication, <b>photochemical</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>formation</b> and energy use to the extent that this has been investigated. Agricultural land has been addressed in few studies and land use savings appear to occur in industries where enzymatic processes save agricultural raw materials, whereas it becomes a trade-off in processes where only fossil fuels and/or inorganic chemicals are saved. Agricultural land use appears to be justified by other considerable environmental improvements in the latter cases, and the results of this review support the hypothesis that enzyme technology is a promising means of moving toward cleaner industrial production. LCA gives a more complete picture of the environmental properties of the processes considered than EIA and carbon footprint studies, and it is recommended that researchers move toward LCA in future studies. Tradition, lack of knowledge and bureaucracy are barriers to implementation of enzymatic processes in industry. Education and streamlining of public approval processes etc. are means of overcoming the barriers and accelerating the harvesting of the environmental benefits...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was developed to}} investigate the potential environmental impacts of poor air quality in Perth. This involved improving existing vegetation maps (through satellite image analysis techniques) for biogenic or forest emissions as a precursor to smog in Perth. Further, to visualise potential environmental impacts associated with poor air quality, a four- dimensional (volumetric over time) animation was created which clearly shows the path and extent of smog in Perth throughout an entire day. Computer mapping of vegetation using Landsat TM data was performed to create an updated inventory of forest types in Perth as input into a photochemical smog model. By improving the inventory of forest cover, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in Perth can calculate up to date biogenic emission estimates for the photochemical smog model. Outputs from the DEP's photochemical smog model were integrated into a Geographical Information System (GIS) and subsequently visualised to show plume movement and potential environmental impact. Two datasets (nitrogen oxides and ozone) were provided to investigate the volumetric and dynamic temporal movement of photochemical smog in Perth on one day, March 16, 1994. Nitrogen oxide sources can range from industry and petroleum refining to motor vehicle exhaust emissions, and are a major precursor to <b>photochemical</b> smog (<b>ozone)</b> <b>formation</b> in Perth. Natural emission sources (forest or biogenic emissions) can also be an important contributing factor to the photochemical smog mix in Perth. Biogenic emissions are comprised of Reactive Organic Chemicals (ROC) or Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) which act as a catalyst to aid the nitrogen oxide conversion to ozone. Three-dimensional and four-dimensional GIS techniques were used to highlight both plume movement and environmental impact. These two sets of visualisations have differing ++chemical levels (higher and lower, respectively) to show movement and interaction effectively. Visualisation of the chemicals allows for {{a greater understanding of}} the mostly invisible chemical movement {{over the course of a}} day and its potential impact to humans and vegetation. The spatial and temporal interaction of the plumes was investigated by creating a series of animations that can be viewed over the Internet.

Weighting although is not the mandatory element of LCIA is the element in which local data becomes important. Potential environmental impacts {{and the importance of}} particular impacts can be quite significant among the countries or regions. Determination of the importance degree is possible by weighting of the selected environmental impact categories. Therefore, this study aimed to develop local weighting factors (WFs) by taking the environmental issues into consideration for the building materials produced in Turkey.

The simulated diurnal variations and mixing ratios of ozone were in good agreement with observed data (R 2 = 0. 80, P< 0. 05), indicating that the photochemical trajectory model - an integration of boundary layer trajectories, precursor emissions and chemical processing - provides a reasonable description of <b>ozone</b> <b>formation</b> in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. Calculated <b>photochemical</b> <b>ozone</b> creation potential (POCP) indices for the region indicated that alkanes and oxygenated organic compounds had relatively low reactivity, while alkenes and aromatics presented high reactivity, as seen in other airsheds in Europe. Analysis of the emission inventory found that the sum of 60 of the 139 VOC species accounted for 92 % of the total POCP-weighted emission. The 60 VOC species include C 2 -C 6 alkenes, C 6 -C 8 aromatics, biogenic VOCs, and so on. The results indicated that regional scale <b>ozone</b> <b>formation</b> in the PRD region can be mainly attributed to a relatively small number of VOC species, namely isoprene, ethene, m-xylene, and toluene, etc. A further investigation of the relative contribution of the main emission source categories to <b>ozone</b> <b>formation</b> suggested that mobile sources were the largest contributor to regional O 3 formation (40 %), followed by biogenic sources (29 %), VOC product-related sources (23 %), industry (6 %), biomass burning (1 %), and power plants (1 %).

This paper {{provides an overview of}} the measurements conducted for this study. In addition to the measurements, a regional chemical/dynamical model (version 3 of Weather Research and Forecasting Chemical model – WRF-Chemv 3) is applied for this study. The model results are intensively compared with the measurements to evaluate the model capability for calculating air pollutants in the Shanghai region, especially the chemical species related to <b>ozone</b> <b>formation.</b> The results show that the model is able to calculate the general distributions (the level and the variability) of air pollutants in the Shanghai region, and the difference between the model calculation and the measurement are mostly smaller than 30 %, except the calculations of HONO at PD (Pudong) and CO at DT (Dongtan). The main scientific focus is the study of <b>ozone</b> chemical <b>formation</b> not only in the urban area, but also on a regional scale of the surrounding area of Shanghai. The results show that during the experiment period, the <b>ozone</b> <b>photochemical</b> <b>formation</b> was strongly under the VOC-limited condition in the urban area of Shanghai. Moreover, the VOC-limited condition occurred not only in the city, but also in the larger regional area. There was a continuous enhancement of ozone concentrations in the downwind of the megacity of Shanghai, resulting in a significant enhancement of ozone concentrations in a very large regional area in the surrounding region of Shanghai. The sensitivity study of the model suggests that there is a threshold value for switching from VOC-limited condition to NOx-limited condition. The threshold value is strongly dependent on the emission ratio of NOx/VOCs. When the ratio is about 0. 4, the Shanghai region is under a strong VOC-limited condition over the regional scale. In contrast, when the ratio is reduced to about 0. 1, the Shanghai region is under a strong NOx-limited condition. The estimated threshold value (on the regional scale) for switching from VOC-limited to NOx-limited condition ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 2. This result has important implications for ozone production in this region and will facilitate the development of effective O 3 control strategies in the Shanghai region...|$|R

Currently, the management processes include temporary storage, collection, transport and landfilling, but separate collection, sorting, recycling and composting of solid waste, which should be addressed according to the National Strategy and European policy for waste. Four different scenarios were elaborated as alternatives to the existing waste management system in Iasi, which include both previously applied and current waste management alternatives, {{as well as some}} advanced practices. The effectiveness of the scenarios was evaluated in terms of environmental impacts based on Life Cycle Analysis, supported by GaBi software. Some environmental impact categories (acidification, eutrophication, global warming, human toxicity, and photochemical ozone generation potentials, carcinogenic substances, heavy metals, winter smog, <b>photochemical</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>formation)</b> were estimated based on several impact assessment methods associated to GaBi software (CML 2001, CML 96, EDIP 2003, EI 95). The study emphasises the importance of system boundaries for the life cycle impact assessment process and consequently – for the optimal waste management alternativ...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for palm oil worldwide. In Thailand, oil palm is being promoted by the government but this expansion is associated with several environmental impacts. We identified 26 options for reducing {{the environmental impact of}} palm oil production in Thailand, and assessed their cost-effectiveness. Our analysis includes measures that can be taken in plantations as well as in palm oil mills. We analysed the effects of the options in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, acidification, eutrophication, <b>photochemical</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>formation,</b> human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity. Our analysis shows that empty fruit bunch (EFB) combustion, wet scrubbers and pre-heating fiber are the most effective in reducing multiple impacts. Among these, EFB combustion results in the largest environmental improvement, but at relatively high costs. Several options are found to be not only effective, but also generate a positive net return. These include cover crops, harvesting ripe fruits, mulching EFB, EFB composting, EFB pellets production, oil loss recovery from decanter cake and pre-heating fiber. The most paying options are mulching EFB, harvesting ripe fruits and cover crops. Our results are relevant for the promotion of more environmental friendly oil palm production in Thailand...|$|E
25|$|Air pollution: {{the release}} of {{chemicals}} and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. <b>Photochemical</b> <b>ozone</b> and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometre size PM10 to PM2.5.|$|R
40|$|Solberg et al. discuss {{various reasons}} for the {{elevated}} O 3 during Europe’s hot summer of 2003, {{all of which are}} plausible. There is one important additional factor: the impact of temperature-dependent chemistry on <b>ozone</b> <b>formation</b> rates. Cardelino and Chameides (1990) and Sillman and Samson (1995) both found that <b>ozone</b> <b>formation</b> is affected by temperature-dependent photochemical reaction rates. Specifically, the temperature-dependent decomposition PAN and other organic nitrates affects <b>ozone</b> <b>formation.</b> Formation of PAN during pollution episodes can be a signifi-cant sink for both NOx and the family of odd hydrogen radicals (OH, HO 2 and RO 2). At low temperatures this removal of NOx and Hx slows the rate of <b>ozone</b> <b>formation.</b> At risk of being self-promoting I want to refer to my earlier results (Sillman and Sam...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISITropospheric ozone is a {{secondary}} pollutant whose primary sources are {{volatile organic compounds}} and nitrogen oxides. The national standard is exceeded on a third of summer days {{in some areas of}} the Chilean Metropolitan Region (MR). This study reports normalized springtime experimental emissions factors (EF) for biogenic volatile organic compounds from tree species corresponding to approximately 31 % of urban trees in the MR. A <b>Photochemical</b> <b>Ozone</b> Creation Index (POCI) was calculated using <b>Photochemical</b> <b>Ozone</b> Creation Potential of quantified terpenes. Ten species, natives and exotics, were analysed using static enclosure technique. Terpene quantification was performed using GC-FID, thermal desorption, cryogenic concentration and automatic injection. Observed EF and POCI values for terpenes from exotic species were 78 times greater than native values; within the same family, exotic EF and POCI values were 28 and 26 times greater than natives. These results support reforestation with native species for improved urban pollution management...|$|R
