Lanthanide borosilicate glasses (LaBS) {{designed in the}} U. S. A. {{are known to be}} one of the prospective vitreous matrices for actinides waste immobilization. In this study results of current study on composition and structure of remelted lanthanide borosilicate glasses have been focused on. The samples were prepared by repeated melting of initial LaBS-glass precursor. Both conventional high-temperature resistive furnace and inductively heated melter with cold crucible were employed for fabrication of the glasses. Five samples were produced and researched in detail. Three of them were obtained in high-temperature furnace (remelted LaBS-glass, LaBS+ 10 %Ce 02, and LaBS+ 20 %Ce 02). The other two samples produced with inductive melting in cold crucible were remelted initial LaBS-glass differed on material (SiC or metallic Al) initiated heating and melting of the initial batches. The specimens were studied by optical microscopy, XRD, and SEM/EDS methods. All specimens produced in resistance furnace even with the highest cerium content are homogeneous glasses. The samples fabricated by inductive melting among with glass contain some crystallin...|$|E
