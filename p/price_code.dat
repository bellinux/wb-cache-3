ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) The interaction of parallel waves, propagating in a water-filled cylindrical wave-guide, {{with a plate}} perpendicular to its axis {{is determined by the}} plate's speci-fic acoustic impedance, the product of density and wave speed. By means of an attached piezoelectric disk-shaped double transducer, (sensor and actuator), the apparent surface impedance of the plate is modified to equal the impddance of the medium, thus establishing a no-reflection situation. The actuator voltage is regulated by a feedback loop, based on an algorithm for complex-root finding. 14. SUBJECT TERMS 1 S.

This may include defense-related remote sensing applying technologies to civil applications and environmental functions and ecological information needs; using DOD sensors for civil applications; and expanding the role of the Environmental Task Force (ETF). 14.

Load-deflection data bases are generated from analysis and testing of the 16 -ft diameter, dish-shaped reflector, and natural frequencies and mode shapes are obtained from vibrational analysis. Experimental and analytical results show similar trends; however, future test hardware modifications and finite-element model refinement {{would be necessary to}} obtain better correlation. The two nonlinear analysis approaches are both adequate techniques for the analysis of prestressed structures with complex geometry. 14. SUBJECT TERMS 15.

40|$|The {{modelling}} {{of financial}} markets as continuous stochastic processes provides {{the means to}} analyse the implications of models and to compute prices {{for a host of}} financial instruments. We code as a symbolic computing program the analysis, initiated by Black, Scholes and Merton, of the formation of a partial differential equation whose solution is the value of a derivative security, from the specification of an undelying security’s process. The Pseudospectral method is a high order solution method for partial differential equations that approximates the solution by global basis funcations. We apply symbolic transformations and approximating rewrite rules to extract essential information for the Pseudospectral Chebyshev solution. We write these programs in Mathematica. Our C++ template implementing general solver code is parameterised with this information to create instrument and model specific <b>pricing</b> <b>code.</b> The Black-Scholes model and the Cox Ingersoll Ross term structure model are used as examples. ...|$|R

40|$|We derive a new {{high-order}} compact finite difference {{scheme for}} option pricing in stochastic volatility jump models, e. g. in Bates model. In such models the option price is determined {{as the solution}} of a partial integro-differential equation. The scheme is fourth order accurate in space and second order accurate in time. Numerical experiments for the European option pricing problem are presented. We validate {{the stability of the}} scheme numerically and compare its efficiency and hedging performance to standard finite difference methods. The new scheme outperforms a standard discretisation based on a second-order central finite difference approximation in all our experiments. At the same time, it is very efficient, requiring only one initial $LU$-factorisation of a sparse matrix to perform the option price valuation. It can also be useful to upgrade existing implementations based on standard finite differences in a straightforward manner to obtain a highly efficient option <b>pricing</b> <b>code.</b> Comment: 21 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
