25|$|English Earls are an Anglo-Saxon institution. Around 1014, England {{was divided}} into shires or counties, largely to defend against the Danes; each shire was led by a local great man, called an earl; the same man could be earl of several shires. When the Normans conquered England, they {{continued}} to appoint earls, but not for all counties; the administrative head of the county became the sheriff. Earldoms began as offices, with a <b>perquisite</b> of {{a share of the}} legal fees in the county; they gradually became honours, with a stipend of £20 a year; like most feudal offices, they were inherited, but the kings frequently asked earls to resign or exchange earldoms. Usually there were few Earls in England, and they were men of great wealth in the shire from which they held title, or an adjacent one, but it depended on circumstances: during the civil war between Stephen and the Empress Matilda, nine Earls were created in three years.|$|E
25|$|An Ayrshire story {{tells of}} how an Ayrshire baron once strung up an {{innocent}} man, just because his visitor {{had never seen}} a man hanged before. Hopefully this was an isolated example, however the system suffered from many faults due to bias, lack of legal training, etc., etc. As stated, a right of appeal to Regalities and sheriffdoms courts did exist. Details of the sometimes shocking excesses of baron bailies can make painful reading. As their power was great and generally abused, so many of them enriched themselves. They had many ways of making money for themselves, such as (1) the bailie's darak, as it was called, or a day's labour in the year from every tenant on the estate; (2) confiscations, as they generally seized on all the goods and effects of such as suffered capitally; (3) all fines for killing game, blackfish, or cutting green wood were laid on by themselves, and went into their own pockets. These fines amounted to what they pleased almost. (4) Another very lucrative <b>perquisite</b> they had was what was called the Herial Horse, which was the best horse, cow, ox, or other article which any tenant on the estate possessed {{at the time of his}} death. This was taken from the widow and children for the bailie, at the time they had most need of assistance. This amounted to a great deal of extra income for the baillie of a large barony.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{comprehensive description}} {{of the practice of}} corporate executive <b>perquisites</b> (perks) in China, a leading emerging economy. We find that expenses and cash payment related to corporate executive <b>perquisites</b> far exceed the monetary payment to top executives, consistent with the notion that <b>perquisites</b> are used more extensively in emerging markets to motivate and reward corporate executives. In addition to common factors known to influence the level of executive perks, we find a significantly positive link between bank ownership of company shares and executive <b>perquisites.</b> Further analyses suggest that higher level of executive <b>perquisites</b> hurt company operating efficiency and may result from the conflict of interests that banks face as both lenders and shareholders in the emerging markets: banks may choose to influence corporate executives and play less effective monitoring if they are concerned with the security of their loans or aim to obtain better arrangement for their loans...|$|R

40|$|Direct bank {{ownership}} {{is a common}} practice in emerging markets. The current paper studies how bank ownership affects firm performance through corporate executive <b>perquisites</b> (perks) in China, a leading emerging economy. In addition to common factors known to influence the level of executive perks, we find a significantly positive link between bank ownership of company shares and executive <b>perquisites.</b> Further analyses suggest that higher level of executive <b>perquisites</b> hurt firm operating efficiency. Specifically, perks are positively associated with interest rate paid by the firms. We find some evidence consistent {{with the notion that}} the conflict of interests that banks face as both lenders and shareholders in the emerging markets induces banks to play less effective monitoring if they are concerned with the security of their loans or aim to obtain better arrangement for their loans. Our results reveal a particular mechanism through which bank ownership influences firm decisions and performance. <b>Perquisites</b> Bank ownership Conflict of interest...|$|R

He continues: [...] "There were no state initiatives to provide its own system until 1912.

[...] God spoke to Aaron {{and said that he}} and his dynasty would be responsible for the Tent of Meeting and the priesthood and accountable for anything which went wrong in the performance of their priestly duties. God assigned the Levites to Aaron to aid in the performance of these duties. God prohibited any outsider from intruding on the priests as they discharged the duties connected with the Shrine, on pain of death. And God gave Aaron and the priests all the sacred donations and first fruits as a <b>perquisite</b> for all time for them and their families to eat. And God gave them the oil, wine, grain. God's covenant with the Aaronic priesthood was described as a 'covenant of salt', but God also told Aaron that the priests would have no territorial share among the Israelites, as God was their portion and their share.|$|E

Congress granted her a monthly <b>perquisite</b> of 150,000 Pesetas (approximately 1,715 of 1987 Canadian dollars). On September 13, 1989, she was hospitalized, gravely ill with pneumonia. She recovered and left the hospital on October 15, but she experienced a relapse on November 7 and died at 7:15 PM on November 12 at age 93. On November 14, thousands of people paid homage as her body lay on a catafalque.

On November 16, a short cortege carried her body from PCE headquarters to the Plaza of Columbus where Rafael Alberti and secretary-general Julio Anguita delivered a brief eulogy.

However, the optimal sharing rule between corporate claimants cannot be supported solely by standard securities like bonds, stock, options, and their hybrids.
