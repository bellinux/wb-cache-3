40|$|Pasteurella multocida {{infection}} in cattle causes serious epidemic diseases {{and leads to}} great economic losses in livestock industry; however, {{little is known about}} the interaction between host and P. multocida in the lungs. To explore a fully insight into the host responses in the lungs during P. multocida infection, a mouse model of Pasteurella pneumonia was established by intraperitoneal infection, and then transcriptomic analysis of infected lungs was performed. P. multocida localized and grew in murine lungs, and induced inflammation in the lungs, as well as mice death. With transcriptomic analysis, approximately 107 clean reads were acquired. 4236 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were detected during P. multocida infection, of which 1924 DEGs were up-regulated. By gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichments, 5, 303 GO enrichments and 116 KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the context of P. multocida infection. Interestingly, genes related to immune responses, such as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), chemokines and inflammatory cytokines, were significantly up-regulated, suggesting the key roles of these genes in P. multocida infection.

A graph of log PE type C dose used for pretreatment versus log 50 % lethal dose of endotoxin gave a straight line with a slope of approximately - 1. Rabbits that received PE type C alone showed fevers only, but those given both PE ty pe C and endotoxin showed initial fever followed by hypothermia, labored breathing, diarrhea, evidence of vascular collapse, and finally death. When a PE type C dose of 3 micrograms/kg was used, pretreatment of the animals with PE for 2 h before giving the endotoxin was required to obtain maximal susceptibility. However, when 15 micrograms of PE type C per kg was utilized, the endotoxin could be given before, concurrently, or after PE type C. The capacity of PE type C to prepare rabbits for enhanced susceptibility to endotoxin was lost after 24 to 48 h. Animals could be protected from enhanced susceptibility to endotoxin by prior immunization with either PE type C or endotoxin.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{attempted}} to describe the manner of spread of an endemic, native, respiratory infection and a method for its control. The essential factor determining the prevalence of such an endemic disease is, we believe, host susceptibility, which is controlled by hereditary and environmental influences. Furthermore, it seems probable {{that the amount of}} this population susceptibility determines the dosage of specific microbes available to the population. An increase in dosage in the herd is followed by an increase in the spread and severity of the infection, and a decrease by a corresponding alleviation. Hence, two methods for the prevention of epidemics are available: (1) an enhancement of population resistance, and (2) the reduction to a minimum of available dosage. These procedures have proved successful for 3 years in maintaining a population of breeding rabbits, {{in the midst of a}} badly infected community, entirely free from Bact. lepisepticum infection. Confirmation of the above conclusions has been gained from other studies in the field of experimental epidemiology. Dr. D. T. Smith (2), at Saranac, New York, found that changes in population susceptibility were responsible for a severe outbreak of Bact. lepisepticum infection and septicemia. Freund (3), at Berlin, has just published an interesting account of respiratory epidemics of rabbits and guinea pigs, apparently brought about by sudden changes in temperature and housing conditions. Pneumonia and <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>infection,</b> endemic in the population, increased suddenly in extent and severity. Nevertheless, neither endemic nor epidemic strains of the microorganisms were found to be especially virulent. Dr. Theobald Smith (4), in a study of paratyphoid epidemics of guinea pigs, has made similar observations. He noted that pregnant females acted as the foci of infection, and that from these individuals, presumably of lessened resistance, the bacteria were given off and infection was spread. The studies in experimental epidemiology are rapidly reaching a stage where they may be applied to the problems of human disease. Indeed, more recent observations of the mode of spread of pneumonia (5 â 7), scarlet fever (8), typhoid (9, 10), plague (11), diphtheria (12 â 14), measles (15), and tuberculosis (16 â 18) increasingly show a tendency to discard the theory of fluctuating microbic virulence and to emphasize the importance of the host factors...|$|E
40|$|Three {{studies are}} {{described}} in this report. In the first study, the effects of danofloxacin and tilmicosin on neutrophil function were examined in healthy mixed-breed weaned beef heifers. Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood samples pre- and post-treatment. The neutrophil function assays performed were: random migration under agarose, Cytochrome C reduction, iodination, Staphylococcus aureus ingestion, chemotaxis under agarose, and antibody-independent and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The results suggest that at therapeutic drug concentrations, danofloxacin and tilmicosin have little clinically significant effect on bovine neutrophil function. In the second study, a model was developed for the induction of pneumonic pasteurellosis (using 6 x 109 CFU of a log-phase culture of Pasteurella haemolytica intrabronchially) in weaned, pre-conditioned beef calves that consistently produced rectal temperatures of at least 40 Â°C 24 hours after bacterial challenge, a clinical score of â¥ 1, and measurable lung consolidation. In the third study, Pasteurella pneumonia was induced in weaned beef heifer calves using the model from the second study, and calves were treated with danofloxacin or tilmicosin. Neutrophils were collected at 3, 24 and 48 hours after treatment. Neutrophil function assays were as performed in study 1, and apoptosis was determined using a cell death detection kit. The results suggest that danofloxacin and tilmicosin have no clinically significant effects on neutrophil function or apoptosis. There were also {{no significant differences in}} percent lung consolidation among treatments. Significant differences were found between non-challenged calves and the challenged non-treated calves in several neutrophil assays, which were attributed to an effect of the <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>infection.</b> Body temperature was also examined in this study via intravaginally implanted radiotransmitters.

40|$|Introduction: Pets are {{not always}} the humanâs best friends, {{particularly}} {{in the presence of}} comorbidities such as wounds. The following case report describes a <b>Pasteurella</b> multocida <b>infection</b> of a reconstructive breast implant due to a close contact between a cat and its owner. Presentation of case: A 33 -year-old woman developed a breast implant infection 13 days after an immediate breast reconstruction following a mastectomy for a multifocal ductal carcinoma. The wound was explored surgically and the implant removed. Culture extracted from fluid around the prosthesis evidenced the presence of P. multocida, a Gram-negative coccobacillus which is present in the oral commensal flora of cats and dogs. Conclusion: In the case of breast infection, surgical revision â with or without removal of the implant â is required in order to carry out a meticulous intraoperative cleaning. Antibiotherapy is always necessary in such cases. Particularly when patients presenting comorbidities are concerned, the focus must be put on avoiding close contact of the wound with pets...|$|R
