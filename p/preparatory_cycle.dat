50|$|General {{education}} {{in secondary schools}} encompassed six years of instruction divided into two three-year cycles. The first, or basic, cycle was compulsory; the second cycle was geared to university preparation. In addition to the academic track, public technical education schools provided secondary school education that was technical and vocational in nature. The two systems were parallel in structure, and there was little provision for transfer between the two. All sectors of society traditionally tended to prefer the academic course of study, which was regarded as more prestigious. As a result, academic secondary education had expanded more rapidly than technical {{education in}} the second half of the twentieth century. In 1987 there were 276 general secondary schools in Uruguay, including 118 private schools. However, the public high schools were much larger, so that in 1987 they actually contained 145,083 of the country's 175,710 secondary school students enrolled in both day classes and night classes. In addition, ninety-four technical education schools had a total enrollment of 52,766 students in 1987. Male and female enrollment at the secondary level was roughly equal, but females slightly outnumbered males overall (constituting, for example, 53 percent of the secondary school student body in 1982). It appeared that females were in the majority in the basic cycle but were very slightly outnumbered by males in the university <b>preparatory</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
40|$|The current {{investigation}} {{aimed to develop}} a valid specific field test to evaluate anaerobic physical performance in Aerobic Gymnastics athletes. We first designed the Specific Aerobic Gymnast Anaerobic Test (SAGAT), which included gymnastics-specific elements performed in maximal repeated sprint fashion, with a total duration of 80 - 90 s. In order to validate the SAGAT, three independent sub-studies were performed to evaluate the concurrent validity (Study I, n= 8), the reliability (Study II, n= 10) and the sensitivity (Study III, n= 30) of the test in elite female athletes. In Study I, a positive correlation was shown between lower-body Wingate test and SAGAT performance (Mean power: p = 0. 03, r = - 0. 69, CI: - 0. 94 to 0. 03 and Peak power: p = 0. 02, r = - 0. 72, CI: - 0. 95 to - 0. 04) and between upper-body Wingate test and SAGAT performance (Mean power: p = 0. 03, r = - 0. 67, CI: - 0. 94 to 0. 02 and Peak power: p = 0. 03, r = - 0. 69, CI: - 0. 94 to 0. 03). Additionally, plasma lactate was similarly increased in response to SAGAT (p = 0. 002), lower-body Wingate Test (p = 0. 021) and a simulated competition (p = 0. 007). In Study II, {{no differences were found}} between the time to complete the SAGAT in repeated trials (p = 0. 84; Cohen's d effect size = 0. 09; ICC = 0. 97, CI: 0. 89 to 0. 99; MDC 95 = 0. 12 s). Finally, in Study III the time to complete the SAGAT was significantly lower during the competition cycle when compared to the period before the <b>preparatory</b> <b>cycle</b> (p < 0. 001), showing an improvement in SAGAT performance after a specific Aerobic Gymnastics training period. Taken together, these data have demonstrated that SAGAT is a specific, reliable and sensitive measurement of specific anaerobic performance in elite female Aerobic Gymnastics, presenting great potential to be largely applied in training settings...|$|E
40|$|For {{several years}} the skill level of {{students}} leaving secondary {{education in the}} Netherlands has been discussed. Lecturers in higher education –for example– complain about their freshmen’s apparent lack of algebraic skills. Another development {{in recent years is}} the advent of the use of technology in mathematics education. Combining algebraic expertise and ICT use, the aim {{of this study is to}} design an online environment for learning supported by formative assessment of both procedural skills and conceptual understanding in algebra, to investigate the effects of the environment, and to identify decisive factors that influence the outcome. The central research question, therefore, is: in what way can the use of ICT support acquiring, practicing and assessing algebraic expertise? This general question leads to several sub-questions, each related to an appropriate cycle in the study. The theoretical framework is based on the three key perspectives n ICT tool use, algebraic expertise, assessment and feedback. As we aim to design an intervention in several iterations, the research method is based on the principles of design research. Research takes place in one <b>preparatory</b> <b>cycle</b> and three subsequent cycles. The preliminary cycle concerns the design of criteria for an evaluation instrument for digital algebra tools. The instrument was used to choose an appropriate algebra tool for the remainder of the study, and design prototypical digital activities. In the first research cycle one-to-one think-aloud sessions were conducted with five 12 th grade students. The results were used to examine the interplay between ICT and the acquisition of algebra, and determine what feedback could be added to the intervention. Based on the initial characteristics, the digital activities and feedback, the intervention was redesigned in an iterative fashion. The revised intervention was field tested in a second cycle for two classes (12 th grade, wiskunde B, N= 31), after which we made the final improvements based on three design principles all focusing on feedback. The final intervention was field tested in the third and last cycle in nine different schools (N= 324). The use of the intervention for an average of five hours has a large effect on improving algebraic expertise, as post-test score is significantly higher than the pretest score. Furthermore, previous knowledge, time spent in self-test and summative test mode, and general attitude towards mathematics are the largest predictors for a high posttest outcome. The fact that these variables have nothing to do with ICT may indicate that indeed conventional pen-and-paper techniques and ICT techniques are reconciled. In line with this, the variables overall quality of the school (operationalized by trend exam grades), total practice time and the home work – school work ratio did not significantly predict the outcome. Discussion points for the study concern the interplay between acquiring skills and understanding, the extrapolation of the findings for a small sub-domain of algebraic knowledge to algebra as a whole and the methodology of the study...|$|E
40|$|The offered {{project of}} storage {{facility}} {{allows us to}} simplify and unitise the ground-based infrastructure objects. The storage facility implements a full <b>preparatory</b> <b>cycle</b> of the propellant components (PC) in all parameters. Another problem the developers of complexes of groundbased equipment face now is bulk receipt of PC from manufacturer. The tanks of launch complexes cannot accept such volumes of propellant. It proves {{that there is a}} need to create a storage facility. The facility solves problems concerning the components receipt, temperature preparation, moisture content (drying), gas content, and supply to consumers. For preparation the perspective technologies with low power consumption are used. Receiving the propellant from the dispensing platform is carried out via filters of rough cleaning. Transfer from transport tankage goes using a pump. The received product passes through a gas separator to clean technological gas impurity. To prepare propellant temperature, a technology of cryogenic bubbling by boiling nitrogen is chosen. To improve efficiency of cryogenic bubbling it is advised to use the specialized capacities. Railway dimensions, admissible for the trainload goods across the railroads of Siberia and the Far East, define their sizes. As a drying technology and a gas content preparation the preliminary propellant filtration using vertical electro-separators is chosen to save a space. The chamber vertical electroseparators allow 2 — 3 times increase of dehydration capacity. The article presents calculations to prove that using the chosen cooling and drying technologies is efficient. Prepared PC can be supplied: • to transport-fueling containers (TFC) with the subsequent transportation to the launch complexes either by the railway or by road; • to mobile fuelling tanks, which feed rocket-carrier tanks on arrival at the blast-off; • to transport capacities for transportation to the object outside the cosmodrome (spaceport); • directly to tanks of the rocket-carriers through the pipeline. A direct supply of the prepared component to the rocket-carrier tanks allows a significantly decreasing equipment demand at the launch complex (LC) owing to almost full abandonment of the near-launch storehouses and propellant-feed systems. The pipeline fuel remnants are discharged through the branch in the sump from which fuel can be directed to the storage capacities to have its future preparation again. Existing LC versus LC with the storage facility: - Each LC has a separate near-launch storehouse; - Each near-launch storehouse contains several charges to feed fuel tanks of rocket-carrier; - Each LC has the unique systems of propellant preparation. Application of storage facility: - storage facility allows bulk receipt and storage of high-boiling propellant to meet needs of all LC of the spaceport; - there are all means at the storage facility to prepare high-boiling propellant in all required parameters; - high-boiling propellant can be supplied from the storage facility using both transport capacities, and pipelines directly to the rocket-carrier tanks. Advantages: + possibility to receive and store the bulk high-boiling propellant + decreasing total demand of technological systems + simplified spaceport infrastructure Disadvantages: - decreasing reliability rates caused by a lack of reservation of technological systems</p...|$|E
