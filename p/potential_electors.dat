5|$|Clement IX had {{primarily}} named Italian cardinals to the college, only appointing one French and one Spanish cardinal when {{he needed}} their assistance to fight back an invasion by the Ottoman Empire in Crete. He created his friends cardinals, with seven of the twelve that he created coming from his native Tuscany. Clement did not feel obligated to appoint a German cardinal because the Holy Roman Emperor had requested his assistance in Hungary. Within days of his death Clement IX had created seven additional cardinals, which brought the number of <b>potential</b> <b>electors</b> to its maximum number of seventy.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the {{departmental}} assembly for 15 years, Pedro Gallardo Forbes, of the Regional Integration Movement (MIR), won the governor election at the October 28, 2007 election, {{with support from the}} Colombian Conservative Party and the Radical Change party.

500|$|Westerners {{expressed}} dissent over Clinton's nomination {{instead of}} their preferred candidate. The June 29, 1804, edition of Philadelphia's Independent Gazetteer carried an editorial, signed [...] "True American", that denounced the VirginiaNew York coalition, attacked Clinton as too old, and called for electors to vote for Breckinridge for vice president. <b>Potential</b> <b>electors</b> in western states pledged to carry out [...] "True American"'s proposal. Allan B. Magruder attempted to warn Breckinridge {{in advance of the}} editorial's publication, but his letter [...] dated June 23, 1804 [...] did not reach Breckinridge until July 1. On July 5, Breckinridge published a response in the Kentucky Palladium denouncing the proposal and encouraging electors to vote for the Democratic-Republican slate as nominated. He requested that all newspapers that had printed the [...] "True American" [...] editorial also print his response.|$|E

50|$|A primary {{election}} {{was held for}} the first time among the members of Costa Rica’s Citizens’ Action Party (PAC), known as the Citizens' National Convention (Convención Nacional Ciudadana) for the selection of the party's candidate in the 2010 general election.

50|$|Further, the Court {{determined}} that a state is within its rights to exclude, or to allow parties to exclude, <b>potential</b> <b>electors</b> {{on the basis of}} refusing to pledge to support the party's nominees. This is acceptable because it is a method of ensuring that party candidates in the general election are committed to the leadership and philosophy of the party.|$|E
5000|$|In 1857, Clark {{was elected}} to the Iowa House of Representatives, and played an {{important}} role in adapting the laws to the new Iowa Constitution. In the 1860 presidential election, he participated in the Iowa state Democratic convention (declining to follow the breakaway faction supporting the John C. Breckinridge candidacy), where he was elected as a <b>potential</b> presidential <b>elector</b> for U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas. During the Civil War, he sided with his party's [...] "War Democrat" [...] faction, in opposition to the pro-secession [...] "Mahoneyite" [...] faction of followers of jailed newspaper editor D.A. Mahoney.|$|R
50|$|Upon his election, Barberini {{took the}} name of Urban VIII. Barberini had {{previously}} served as the papal nuncio to France under Paul V, and had been created a cardinal because of his service there, and his election pleased Louis XIII of France. During Paul V's papacy Urban was noted {{in a series of}} biographies on <b>potential</b> cardinal <b>electors</b> for being a writer and poet. The symbol of his family was the bee, and his election was afterwards said by Romans to have been foretold by a swarm of bees entering the conclave. Following the election, eight cardinals died within two weeks, but the new pope survived despite catching malaria during the conclave.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1923 Hogbin {{secured the}} {{nomination}} of the now re-united Liberal Party but his candidacy was also endorsed by the local Conservatives in order to oppose Saklatvala, who they regarded as a revolutionary and unconstitutional candidate. At {{one point in the}} campaign Hogbin discontinued holding indoor election meetings claiming this was as a result of Labour intimidation and disruption. It was also feared he would be prevented from canvassing and he had to seek the protection of the police. In the end, Hogbin’s pact with the Conservatives was just enough to ensure his victory by the narrow margin of 186 votes in a straight fight with Saklatvala. [...] During his time in Parliament Hogbin often voted with the Conservatives against the Labour government, perhaps aware of his reliance on Tory support and votes in North Battersea. However he held his seat for just one year. In the 1924 general election Hogbin stood this time as a Constitutionalist (i.e. a Liberal with Conservative support). Again the campaign was marred by disruption [...] and violence. On one occasion a stone was thrown through Hogbin’s car window hitting him near the eye. Hogbin’s election day organisation was disrupted and it was surmised that some <b>potential</b> Constitutionalist <b>electors</b> were discouraged from going out to vote by the prospect of rowdyism near polling stations. When the result was declared Hogbin trailed Saklatvala by 542 votes.|$|R

50|$|Before 1832, {{the only}} form of voter {{registration}} in the United Kingdom {{was in the}} Scottish counties. This consisted of a meeting of <b>potential</b> <b>electors</b> called to determine who was eligible to vote. As the electorate for these seats was extremely small—in 1788, it ranged between 16 electors for Clackmannanshire and 187 for Fife—meetings were {{an important part of}} the political process; often, elections were determined by registering or disqualifying electors. In the rest of Britain and Ireland, people who claimed to be qualified voters simply presented themselves at the hustings to vote. If a candidate who lost thought his defeat was due to ineligible voters, he could ask for a scrutiny, which would turn out to be an expensive and lengthy process in large constituencies.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} {{elections}} in 1856 and 1858 were contested under the franchise arrangements that had {{applied for the}} old Legislative Council. The right of electoral enrolment was granted to any person holding freehold property {{to the value of}} £100, leasehold property to the annual value of £10, possessing a pastoral licence, having a salary of £100 per year, paying board or lodgings to the value of £40 per year, or just lodging to £10 per year. <b>Potential</b> <b>electors</b> had to have met these requirements for six months prior to their name being placed on the electoral roll. Rolls were compiled once a year by an officer appointed by the local Magistrate’s Court. Special hearings were held after each compilation at which objections to a name appearing or being rejected from the roll could be lodged.|$|E
40|$|This report {{recommends}} that the Commonwealth adopts {{a system of}} automatic enrolment of voters similar to the proposed New South Wales system. Declining electoral enrolment continues to present a significant challenge not only for Australia, but for many countries and jurisdictions. Existing paper-based enrolment requirements under Commonwealth legislation are a deterrent to {{the current generation of}} Australians who are accustomed to conducting business with government agencies through electronic transactions. The introduction of flexible approaches which modernise electoral enrolment processes is a vital component for addressing the challenge of declining enrolment. The New South Wales Parliament has taken legislative action to address concerns over declining enrolment levels by introducing a new automatic enrolment system for state and local government elections. NSW will no longer rely on the Australian Electoral Commission to prepare and maintain rolls for NSW elections. Under the NSW legislation, the NSW Electoral Commissioner will assume responsibility for preparing and maintaining a roll for each NSW electoral district using enrolment data supplied by the Commonwealth and data held by various NSW government agencies. The NSW legislation could have significant implications for the conduct of federal elections if Commonwealth legislation is not amended to allow for similar provisions. Having two different enrolment regimes operating at the Commonwealth and State level creates the <b>potential</b> for <b>elector</b> confusion. Of particular concern is the scenario whereby voters in NSW are enrolled automatically for that state’s elections and mistakenly believe that they have also been enrolled for the purpose of federal elections. If granted the power to implement similar automatic enrolment measures, the AEC has acknowledged that it would proceed with caution and conservatism, and would apply carefully designed business rules to ensure the integrity of the electoral roll is maintained. The committee supports Commonwealth legislation being amended to allow the AEC to automatically enrol electors on the basis of data provided by trusted agencies.  To ensure that automatic enrolment does not inadvertently limit the ability for eligible electors to exercise the franchise, election day enrolment is proposed as a safety net to capture those electors who have not been picked up through automatic enrolment processes, {{as well as those who}} have been removed from the electoral roll in error or enrolled at the wrong address.

5000|$|The {{constitutionality}} of state pledge laws {{was confirmed by}} the Supreme Court in 1952 in Ray v. Blair in a 5-2 vote. The court ruled states {{have the right to}} require electors to pledge to vote for the candidate whom their party supports, and the right to remove <b>potential</b> <b>electors</b> who refuse to pledge prior to the election. The court also wrote: However, even if such promises of candidates for the electoral college are legally unenforceable because violative of an assumed constitutional freedom of the elector under the Constitution, Art. II, § 1, to vote as he may choose in the electoral college, it would not follow that the requirement of a pledge in the primary is unconstitutional (emphasis added).The ruling only held that requiring a pledge, not a vote, was constitutional and Justice Jackson, joined by Justice Douglas, wrote in his dissent, [...] "no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text - that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices." [...] More recent legal scholars believe [...] "a state law that would thwart a federal elector’s discretion at an extraordinary time when it reasonably must be exercised would clearly violate Article II and the Twelfth Amendment." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{political}} persuasion, the persuader, besides bearing logical {{arguments and}} triggering emotions, must present one’s own image (one’s ethos) of a credible and reliable person, by enhancing three dimensions of it: competence, benevolence, and dominance. In a parallel way, she/he may cast discredit on the opponent by criti- cizing, accusing or insulting, {{on the same}} three dimensions. The work provides a description and a typology of multi- modal discrediting moves focusing on the discrediter’s multimodal behavior. Based on an Italian corpus of polit- ical debates, the analysis points out which facial expres- sions, gaze behavior, gestures, postures, and prosodic features are used to convey discredit concerning the three target features of competence, benevolence, and domi- nance. Finally, an experimental study is presented assess- ing {{the effects of the}} different types of discrediting moves on <b>potential</b> <b>electors.</b> Results show that casting discredit on the other’s competence while also performing gestures, and casting discredit on the other’s dominance without ges- turing, makes arguments more shareable and convincing...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{political}} communication had channelled a fundamen-tally unidirectional message as {{the communication}} procedures and instruments {{did not allow}} for immediate interaction, {{the reason why the}} message often remained untouchable until election day. The candidate talked and <b>potential</b> <b>electors</b> lis-tened. In this respect, various studies of electoral behaviour high-light that this passivity or, in other words, the impossibility of the electorate to make its voice heard in order to affect the political programme, {{is one of the most}} powerful reasons for the high level of abstention. The empirical studies carried out by Norris (1999), 1 Bimber (2001), Owen and Davis (1998) and Hill and Hughes (1998) allow us to generalise the accuracy of the following statement: access to ICTs does not impact the political participation of cit-izens. In other terms, the individual political behaviour of peo-ple with access to the Internet is not significantly different from that of people offline. Given this view of political communication, the Internet and particularly the new features associated with the concept o...|$|E
