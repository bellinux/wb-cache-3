5|$|Among {{the other}} {{missions}} that Connecticut Wing currently performs is the Long Island Sound Patrol (LISP) program. LISP flies patrol missions across Long Island Sound {{during the summer}} months in coordination with the United States Coast Guard to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> immediate assistance to vessels in distress. The Wing was credited with numerous finds and saves in the year following its inception in summer 2007, and plans are in effect to continue the program.|$|E
5|$|Diving may be {{performed}} for various reasons, {{both personal and}} professional. Recreational diving is purely for enjoyment and has several specialisations and technical disciplines to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> scope for varied activities for which specialist training can be offered, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and deep diving.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War the {{basement}} was converted into an air-raid shelter and an extension {{built in the}} yard to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> space in the control room. The fire services were nationalised in 1941, and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters' efforts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942.|$|E

5|$|In February, Rivers {{submitted}} {{a bill to}} <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> funding for food banks and other charitable causes. The bill authorized public utilities to solicit and collect donations from customers to be put towards food programs for the poor. It also made the donations received by utilities separate from gross income, allowing {{for it to be}} tax-free. The bill passed in the State House in Feb. 2011 but failed {{to make it to the}} Senate floor.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium-256, the {{chemically}} {{most important}} isotope of mendelevium, decays through electron capture 90.7% {{of the time}} and alpha decay 9.9% of the time. It is most easily detected through the spontaneous fission of its electron-capture daughter fermium-256, but in the presence of other nuclides that undergo spontaneous fission, alpha decays at the characteristic energies for mendelevium-256 (7.205 and 7.139MeV) can <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> useful identification.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, mine owners {{met again}} with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado City. The owners agreed to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> funding {{to allow the}} sheriff to raise 1,200 {{additional}} deputies.

5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|Recently, a {{saturated}} medium-chain {{fatty acid}} called decanoic acid (C10) has shown promise {{in both the}} control of seizures and of neurodegeneration. Decanoic acid is a major constituent of the MCT ketogenic diet, and the authors suggest its action may be through inducing mitochondrial biogenesis and helping <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> ATP to maintain the resting membrane potential of the neuron.|$|E
5|$|Such {{recycling}} of revenue from permit auctions could offset {{a significant proportion}} of the economy-wide social costs of a cap and trade scheme. As well as reducing tax distortions, Kerr and Cramton (1998) note that auctions of units are more flexible in distributing costs, they <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> incentives for innovation, and they lessen the political arguments over the allocation of economic rents.|$|E

5|$|The Marlins and Rockies {{used the}} {{expansion}} draft {{to build their}} teams using different strategies. As the Rockies had a smaller operating budget than the Marlins, the Rockies targeted prospects with low salaries, while the Marlins selected older players intended to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> immediate impact.

5|$|The first notable {{musician}} {{to use the}} Mellotron was variety pianist Geoff Unwin, who {{was specifically}} hired by Robinson in 1962 to promote {{the use of the}} instrument. He toured with a Mk II Mellotron and made numerous appearances on television and radio. Unwin claimed that the automatic backing tracks on the Mk II's left hand keyboard allowed him to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> accomplished performances than his own basic skills on the piano could provide.|$|E

After a year of studies and design, it commenced operations on July 1, 1982 with an annual appropriation of $825 million.|$|E

Jack shares with Desmond how he failed Sarah, and Desmond advises him about his need to feel and <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> hope.

5|$|Also to this end, and to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> {{professional}} military leadership, Diocletian separated military {{from civil}} command at the lowest, provincial level. Governors of provinces on the frontiers were stripped of {{command of the}} troops stationed there in favour of purely military officers called duces limitis ("border commanders"). Some 20 duces may have been created under Diocletian. Most duces were given command of forces in a single province, but a few controlled more than one province e.g. the dux Pannoniae I et Norici. However, at higher echelons, military and administrative command remained united in the vicarii and praefecti praetorio. In addition, Diocletian completed {{the exclusion of the}} senatorial class, still dominated by the Italian aristocracy, from all senior military commands and from all top administrative posts except in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she was a}} {{previously}} published novelist and had a successful Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for The Fountainhead. Macmillan Publishing, which had published We the Living, rejected the book after Rand insisted they <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> publicity for her new novel than they had done for the first one. Rand's agent began submitting the book to other publishers; in 1938, Knopf signed a contract to publish the book. When Rand was only a quarter done with the manuscript by October 1940, Knopf canceled her contract. Several other publishers rejected the book. When Rand's agent began to criticize the novel, Rand fired the agent and decided to handle submissions herself. Twelve publishers (including Macmillan and Knopf) rejected the book.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's February 2011 {{announcement}} of the Gateway Project includes a proposal to extend the 7 service three blocks east of Eleventh Avenue to New York Penn Station, instead of five miles west to Secaucus. Gateway, under auspices of Amtrak, would include a high-speed rail right-of way from Newark Penn to New York Penn and <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> capacity on New Jersey Transit rail operations. Congress allocated $15 million for studies for the project in November 2011, with {{the likelihood that the}} two projects, Gateway and the subway extension, will be in competition for funding.|$|E
