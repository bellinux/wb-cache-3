5000|$|From 1901, Hauptmann {{lived with}} Margarete Marschalk in Agnetendorf (today Jagniątków in Poland). He called it [...] "the mystical <b>protective</b> <b>sheathing</b> of my soul." [...] In the {{preceding}} year, Margarete had born him a son, Benvenuto. In September, 1904, they were married; this second marriage lasted until his death, {{though it was}} thrown into a serious crisis in 1905 and 1906 by his affair with a 16-year-old actress, Ida Orloff.|$|E
50|$|Optical fiber {{consists}} of a core and a cladding layer, selected for total internal reflection due to {{the difference in the}} refractive index between the two. In practical fibers, the cladding is usually coated with a layer of acrylate polymer or polyimide. This coating protects the fiber from damage but does not contribute to its optical waveguide properties. Individual coated fibers (or fibers formed into ribbons or bundles) then have a tough resin buffer layer and/or core tube(s) extruded around them to form the cable core. Several layers of <b>protective</b> <b>sheathing,</b> depending on the application, are added to form the cable. Rigid fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing ("dark") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another. This reduces cross-talk between the fibers, or reduces flare in fiber bundle imaging applications.|$|E
50|$|On August 17, 2004 {{the ornate}} cornice atop the {{building}} was seen leaning perilously over State Street and emergency workers had to remove it. Instead of demolition the city decided to wrap {{the rest of the}} building in <b>protective</b> <b>sheathing.</b> The city took Sebba Rockaway to court for 17 code violations. City court in December 2004 fined the company $480,000 for a dozen code violations and dismissed five. The city in 2005 sued Sebba Rockaway for $25 million in punitive damages and tacked $513,000 onto the property tax bill for the Wellington Hotel. Sebba Rockaway then put all its property on Wellington Row including the Wellington, Berkshire, Elks Lodge and adjoining buildings for sale for $5 million. The entire site was sold in 2006 to Columbia Development, a locally owned company, for $925,000, which originally wanting to destroy most of the buildings and save only a few facades. After meeting some opposition Columbia revised their proposal with saving more of the original streetscape though most will still be new construction. The proposal received praises for the inclusion of apartments along with office space as this has been a goal of the city of Albany for quite some time. The two buildings east of the Wellington Hotel along with the Berkshire Hotel and Elks Lodge west of the Wellington will be saved as retail and residential uses, but the Wellington Hotel itself will be demolished and rebuilt with just its facade as the entrance to a new 14-story 405000 sq ft office building that will span behind the entire row, which was renamed Wellington Place.|$|E

5000|$|An {{eyewitness}} {{account of the}} last voyage of Cinque Ports was published by William Funnell, an officer on board St George, {{who went on to}} circumnavigate the globe after abandoning Dampier in January 1705. The owners of Cinque Ports subsequently took legal action against Dampier over the loss of their ship. According to a deposition given by Selkirk on 18 July 1712, Dampier's failure to advise the owners to have Cinque Ports and St George covered in <b>protective</b> wood <b>sheathing</b> had resulted in [...] "the loss of both ships, for they perished by being worm eaten." [...] Other witnesses supported this allegation. The shipowners would be disappointed, however, as Dampier died in 1715, leaving nothing but debts.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the wide}} spread use of {{pharmaceuticals}} in both human and animal populations, the contamination of surface waters resulting from the outflow of waste water treatment facilities is of growing concern. Conventional methods used for the determination of these compounds often require extensive sample preparation {{in order to achieve}} appropriate limits of detection and quantitation. As a result, analytical methods which utilize these procedures are limited in their throughput capacity, while also generating large volumes of solvent waste. Coated blade spray (CBS) is a solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique which enables the direct to mass spectrometry analysis of extracted compounds with the application of limited organic solvent in order to desorb analyte and perform electrospray ionization. Demonstrated herein is the application of CBS for the concomitant MS/MS analysis of 12 pharmaceuticals in environmental waters which was able to demonstrate LODs for all compounds at concentrations of less than 50 ng/L while employing a 30 second analysis time. As select pharmaceuticals are susceptible to bioaccumulation, the analysis of fish tissue as a marker of environmental pollution is also an area of interest. For this reason a device was developed, the SPME needle, which is able to perform rapid tissue analysis without the need for a <b>protective</b> <b>sheathing</b> needle or house, simplifying the sampling process. The device was further validated to be reproducible and not effected by puncture through protective tissue. Finally, the device was incorporated into a projectile which was validated to enable rapid one handed SPME sampler administration {{in a matter of seconds}} in an on-site proof of concept...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films are}} a major field in the {{electrical}} and packaging industries today. They are used in applications ranging from <b>protective</b> <b>sheathing</b> to microelectronic heat sinks. One of the most under researched fields of thin films is composite thermal interfacing. Previous composite thin film research focuses on embedding vertically aligned materials into a polymer matrix to improve thermal conductivity. In this research, we focus on adding a randomly oriented aggregate, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT), to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Randomly oriented CNTs are easier and more cost effective to manufacture than vertically aligned CNTs but should improve thermal conductivity as much as vertically aligned CNTS. Randomly oriented CNTs create comparable bridges that are {{as effective as the}} direct pathways of vertically aligned CNTs. The thin films were tested in a stepped bar apparatus that provides a constant temperature gradient across the film and stepped bars. We then easily extracted the thermal resistance and conductivity from the collected temperature data. Variables such as film thickness and CNT: PDMS weight ratio were individually varied to optimize thermal transport through the films. Ranges of CNT density and film thickness ranged between 0. 7 to 3 % and 5 to 50 µm, respectively. We found that even though randomly oriented CNTs do not provide a direct pathway for thermal energy transfer, the thermal conductivity of these films are comparable to the vertically aligned films in the full range of film thicknesses. Future research will focus on using other polymer matrices, using single-walled CNTs, and combining randomly oriented and vertically aligned CNTs...|$|E
40|$|Definition: Although other abused {{drugs can}} be inhaled, the term inhalants is {{reserved}} for {{the wide variety of}} substances—including solvents, aerosols, gases, and nitrites—that are rarely, if ever, taken via any other route of administration. (See below for a list of examples.) Many products readily found in the home or workplace—such as spray paints, markers, glues, and cleaning fluids—contain volatile substances that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when inhaled. People do not typically think of these products as drugs because they were never intended for that purpose. However, these products are sometimes abused in that way. They are especially (but not exclusively) abused by young children and adolescents, and are the only class of substance abused more by younger than by older teens. How Are Inhalants Abused? Abusers of inhalants breathe them in through the nose or mouth {{in a variety of ways}} (known as “huffing”). They may sniff or snort fumes from a container or dispenser (such as a glue bottle or a marking pen), spray aerosols (such as computer cleaning dusters) directly into their nose or mouth, or place a chemical-soaked rag in their mouth. Abusers may also inhale fumes from a balloon or a plastic or paper bag. Although the high produced by inhalants usually lasts just a few minutes, abusers often try to prolong it by continuing to inhale repeatedly over several hours. People tend to abuse different inhalant products at different ages. New users ages 12 – 15 most commonly abuse glue, shoe polish, spray paints, gasoline, and lighter fluid. New users ages 16 – 17 most commonly abuse nitrous oxide or “whippets. ” Adults most commonly abuse a class of inhalants known as nitrites (such as amyl nitrites or “poppers”). How Do Inhalants Affect the Brain? Most abused inhalants other than nitrites depress the central nervous system in a manner not unlike alcohol. The effects are similar—including slurred speech, lack of coordination, euphoria, and dizziness. Inhalant abusers may also experience light-headedness, hallucinations, and delu-sions. With repeated inhalations, many users feel less inhibited and less in control. Some may feel drowsy for several hours and experience a lingering headache. Unlike other types of inhalants, nitrites enhance sexual pleasure by dilating and relaxing blood vessels. Although it is not very common, addiction to inhalants can occur with repeated abuse What Are the Other Health Effects of Inhalants Chemicals found in different types of inhaled products may produce a vari-ety of other short-term effects, such as nausea or vomiting, as well as more serious long-term consequences. These may include liver and kidney damage, hearing loss, or bone marrow damage. Effects may also include loss of coordination and limb spasms due to damage to myelin—a <b>protective</b> <b>sheathing</b> around nerve fibers that helps nerves transmit messages in the brain and peripheral nervous system. Inhalants can also cause brain damage by cutting off oxygen flow to the brain. Inhalants can even be lethal. Sniffing highly concentrated amounts of the chemicals in solvents or aerosol sprays can directly cause heart failure within minutes. This syndrome, known as “sudden sniffing death,” can result from a single session of inhalant use by an otherwise healthy young person. High concentrations of inhal-ants may also cause death from suffocation, especially when inhaled from a paper or plastic bag or in a closed area. Even when using aerosols or volatile products for their legitimate purposes like painting or cleaning, it is wise to do so in a well-ventilated room or outdoors. Nitrites are a special class of inhalants that are abused to enhance sexual pleasure and performance. They can be associated with unsafe sexual practices that increase the risk of contracting and spreading infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Products Abused as Inhalants Volatile solvents—liquids that vaporize at room temperature •	Industrial or household products, including paint thinners or removers, degreasers, dry-cleaning fluids, gasoline, and lighter fluid •	Art or office supply solvents, including correction fluids, felt-tip marker fluid, electronic contact cleaners, and glue Aerosols—sprays that contain propellants and solvents •	Household aerosol propellants in items such as spray paints, hair or deodorant sprays, fabric protector sprays, aerosol computer cleaning products, and vegetable oil sprays Gases—found in household or commercial products and used as medical anesthetics •	Household or commercial products, including butane lighters and propane tanks, whipped cream aerosols or dispensers (whippets), and refrigerant gases •	Medical anesthetics, such as ether, chloroform, halothane, and nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) Nitrites—used primarily as sexual enhancers •	Organic nitrites are volatiles that include cyclohexyl, butyl, and amyl nitrites, commonly known as “poppers. ” Amyl nitrite is still used in certain diagnostic medical procedures. When marketed for illicit use, organic nitrites are often sold in small brown bottles labeled as “video head cleaner,” “room odorizer,” “leather cleaner,” or “liquid aroma. ...|$|E
5000|$|After the world's first {{testing in}} November 8, 1972 {{it was decided}} to order and deploy short-take-off-and-vertical-landing (STOVL) AV-8S Matadors (AV-8A Harrier) when Dédalo was overhauled. Since the Harriers' {{downdraft}} on vertical landing would have damaged the wooden deck, <b>protective</b> metal <b>sheathing</b> was installed on the rear area of the flight deck. [...] The first batch of six AV-8S single seat and two TAV-8S two seat aircraft were delivered to the Armada Española throughout 1976. A second batch of four AV-8S aircraft was delivered in 1980. Unlike some carriers used for Harrier operations, a ski-jump to assist STOVL takeoff was never installed on Dédalo, limiting the maximum takeoff weight of the Harriers.|$|R
