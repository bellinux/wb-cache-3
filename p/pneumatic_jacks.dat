5000|$|As {{soon as the}} car {{comes to}} a halt, the first step, taken while the fourth tire changer assumes his position, is for a {{mechanic}} to activate the car's built-in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>jacks.</b> A pressurized air hose is inserted into a receiving nozzle {{at the rear of}} the car, under the rear wing. Previously, this device was inserted on the side of the car, but for safety reasons, the location was moved in the 2000s. At the same instant, another crew member begins the refueling process. A fueling hose is inserted into a socket (called the [...] "buckeye"), allowing a gravity-fed hose to refill the car's fuel tank.

5000|$|At {{a central}} {{location}} near the areas being riveted, a furnace was set up. Rivets {{were placed in}} the furnace and heated to glowing hot (often to white hot) so that they were more plastic and easily deformed. The rivet warmer or [...] "cook" [...] used tongs to remove individual rivets and throw them to a catcher stationed near the joints to be riveted. The catcher (usually) caught the rivet in a leather or wooden bucket with an ash-lined bottom. He placed the rivet into the hole to be riveted, then quickly turned to catch the next rivet. The [...] "holder up or holder on" [...] would hold a heavy rivet set or dolly or another (larger) <b>pneumatic</b> <b>jack</b> against the round head of the rivet, while the riveter (sometimes two riveters) applied a hammer or pneumatic rivet hammer to the unformed head, making it mushroom tightly against the joint in its final domed shape. Alternatively the buck is hammered more or less flush with the structure in a counter sunk hole. Before the use of pneumatic hammers, e.g. in the construction of RMS Titanic, the man who hammered the rivet was known as the [...] "basher". Upon cooling, the rivet contracted and exerted further force, tightening the joint.|$|R

50|$|The {{rough and}} bumpy {{concrete}} pit lane was also paved over in asphalt and a guardrail was installed {{to protect the}} crew members in the sign board area. The newly paved pit area made egress and ingress to the pits smoother and safer, but also sharply increased entrance and exit speeds, potentially putting crew members at risk. Within a few years, {{after a series of}} incidents on the Indy car circuit, as well as in NASCAR, pit road speed limits would be implemented to curtail speeding through the pit lane. In addition the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>jacks</b> on the cars were embedding themselves into the soft asphalt of the pit lane. This necessitated crews to affix steel plates on the pit lane to accommodate the jacks (a practice that was also later deemed unsafe). In 1994, this would be finally be solved when the individual pit boxes were resurfaced in concrete.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} robot able to climb Columns. This robot is not {{dependent}} on the diameter and material of the columns. Some climbing robots have been designed up to now but Koala robot was designed and fabricated for climbing columns exclusively. Simple kinematics of climbing in the nature inspired us to design this robot. We used two linear mechanisms to grip the column. The gripper consists of a DC motor and a power screw mechanism with a linear bushing as a guide. This mechanism provides enough force to grip the column. In addition we needed an actuator for climbing the column; hence, two <b>pneumatic</b> <b>jacks</b> were used. All the mechanical parts were designed according to the exerted forces and operational condition. The prototype can be simply installed and controlled on the column by an inexperienced operator. This robot is intended for inspection and surveillance of pipes in oil industries and power poles in electric industries. Keywords—Robot, Column-climber, Gripping mechanism, Koala...|$|E
5000|$|The Diablo SV-R {{featured}} a stripped-down interior with a rollcage, racing seat, and removable steering wheel; the power glass side windows were replaced with fixed Plexiglass with traditional race-style sliding sections. On the exterior, the electric pop-up headlamps were replaced either with fixed units (similar to those which appeared {{later on the}} road cars in 1999) or with open ducting for the front brakes. A larger, deeper front spoiler was fitted, while the rear bumper was replaced with a diffuser assembly and the traditional Diablo [...] "wing" [...] was replaced with a true adjustable carbon fiber spoiler. Side skirts were added for aerodynamics, but this left so little ground clearance that <b>pneumatic</b> air <b>jacks</b> also had to be installed to raise the car for service in the pit lane; similar jacks {{can be seen in}} use on the more recent Ferrari F430 Challenge. [...] Lightweight, hollow center-lock OZ wheels were used, although these were later switched to stronger Speedline units. Linear-rate springs were used with Koni shock absorbers and were adjusted to about twice the stiffness of stock Diablo SV suspension.With all modifications, the SV-R weighed 1385 kg, 191 kg less than the factory SV.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Olive (Oleo europaea) {{includes}} about 20 {{species of}} small trees from Oleaceae family. This point {{should be considered}} that Iran has allocated only a small universal market to its olive products in spite of having high production potentials; so that about 23 provinces of this country can produce olive products. Therefore mechanizing of olive production and encouraging to develop olive trade are among the effective methods for development of this market. On the basis of IOOC report, the production of olive oil in 2008 - 2009 in Iran {{and all over the}} world has been 3 and 2866. 5 thousand tons, respectively. Currently, harvesting olive product is done by hand in Iran. The expensiveness of work force and providing the needed workers are considered as the biggest problem in olive harvesting. While harvesting the tall trees, the workers use beating method by wood sticks which causes the fruits to be damaged and their quality to be decreased. The harvesting method which {{the quality and quantity of}} the olive final products is under its effect and also high expenses of harvesting by hand are considered as the two important factors in developing the mechanical harvesting of olive. For this purpose, the mechanized harvesting of olive should be considered for producing olive conserve and olive oil and decreasing expenses of harvesting. Considering the conducted studies on one hand and shortage of informational resources in the country on the other hand, a research was designed and performed with the following purposes: Designing and fabricating of a portable pneumatic branch shaking system. Determining the best frequency and oscillation duration for harvesting olive by the constructed system. Materials and Methods The branch shaking system is made of two general parts: (a) The set of branch shaker driving unit. (b) The portable vibration arm. For constructing the set of vibrating arm, two experiments “elasticity and inflectionˮ of tree branches were conducted and the maximum force of 362. 40 N was registered and it was considered as the base of computations. Then a double-action <b>pneumatic</b> <b>jack</b> with the internal diameter of 32 mm and the rod diameter of 12 mm with the stroke length of 200 mm was selected. An electronic circuit was designed and developed for ordering the solenoid valve to control the flow. The system was transferred to one of the olive garden’s located in kilometer 5 of Sarvestan – Fasa road in Fars province in order to be evaluated. The effects of three oscillation frequencies of 12, 16 and 20 Hz and three oscillation durations of 5, 10 and 15 seconds at constant amplitude of 5 cm on detachment percentage of olive fruit was investigated through a factorial 3 × 3 experiment based on completely randomized design with four replications. Then the most suitable frequency and vibration duration was selected for harvesting olive by this system. For measuring the static detachment force of the fruits, a tensile force dynamometer system model FG- 5100 made by Lutron Company was used with the accuracy of 0. 1 N and a maximum capacity of 980 N. Results and Discussion The variance analysis of the investigated features on the basis of the factorial experiment based on completely randomized designs was conducted through using SPSS software. The results showed that both frequency of vibration and oscillation duration had significant effect on the shaker performance; with no significant interaction effects which implies the independence of the debated variables.
