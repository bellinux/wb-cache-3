In addition or alternatively, photolytic capability is exhibited towards organic materials. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an arrangement, in which the titanium-oxide containing layer has catalytically-active and -inactive areas. USE - To induce photo-hydrophilicity or <b>photolytic</b> <b>effect</b> in a layer including titanium dioxide, used to exploit photo-induced anti-bacterial effect in the layer; in a spotting procedure (all claimed), and also for use in various biotechnological procedures. ADVANTAGE - Catalytic activity results from exposure to light of appropriate wavelength. The layer is preferably porous, and associated with a substrate. Known processes {{may be used to}} produce the layer, e. g. vacuum coating. Magnetron sputtering at 100 - 250 deg. C can also conveniently cause the modification.

40|$|Background: Cell-penetrating {{peptides}} (CPPs) can transport macromolecular cargos into live cells. However, {{the cellular}} delivery efficiency of these reagents is often suboptimal because CPP-cargo conjugates typically remain trapped inside endosomes. Interestingly, irradiation of fluorescently labeled CPPs with light increases {{the release of}} the peptide and its cargos into the cytosol. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon is not clear. Here we investigate the molecular basis of the photo-induced endosomolytic activity of the prototypical CPPs TAT labeled to the fluorophore 5 (6) carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TMR). Methodology/Principal Findings: We report that TMR-TAT acts as a photosensitizer that can destroy membranes. TMR-TAT escapes from endosomes after exposure to moderate light doses. However, this is also accompanied by loss of plasma membrane integrity, membrane blebbing, and cell-death. In addition, the peptide causes the destruction of cells when applied extracellularly and also triggers the photohemolysis of red blood cells. These <b>photolytic</b> and photocytotoxic <b>effects</b> were inhibited by hydrophobic singlet oxygen quenchers but not by hydrophilic quenchers. Conclusions/Significance: Together, these results suggest that TAT can convert an innocuous fluorophore such as TMR into a potent <b>photolytic</b> agent. This <b>effect</b> involves the targeting of the fluorophore to cellular membranes and the production of singlet oxygen within the hydrophobic environment of the membranes. Our findings may be relevant for the design o...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{mechanistic studies}} into a ruthenium-mediated cycloaromatization of dienynes. The results of deuterium labeling experiments {{are consistent with}} a mechanism that proceeds via a 6 -electrocyclization to form an  4 -isobenzene adduct followed by a metal-mediated [1, 5]-hydride shift. The cycloaromatization of dienynes with substituents in the E-position of the distal alkene is proposed to give arene product via a process involving two sequential [1, 2]-hydride shifts. Dienynes bearing phenyl substituents in either the E or Z-position of the distal alkene or acetylenic position were shown to cycloaromatize. 	The ruthenium-mediated cycloaromatization of acyclic trienes was accomplished in excellent yields. Observation and characterization of an  6 -triene ruthenium complex were accomplished. Deuterium labeling experiments led to a mechanistic proposal involving  6 -complexation of ruthenium to the triene followed by disrotatory electrocyclic ring closure. The deprotonation of the  4 - 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene intermediate is proposed to generate a cyclohexadienyl ligand, which aromatizes via a ruthenium-assisted protolytic cleavage of a C-H or C-C bond. 	In continuation of catalytic metal-triggered cyclization of enediynes under <b>photolytic</b> conditions, the <b>effects</b> of sterics and electronics in Cp-ligated iron and ruthenium were investigated with the 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetramethyl- 5 -trifluoromethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp‡) ligand. A series of Cp‡-ligated iron and ruthenium complexes were prepared. Attempts to generate [Cp‡Fe( 6 -benzene) ]PF 6 led to activation of all three C-F bonds {{and the formation of}} a new (diphenylmethyl) tetramethylcyclopentadienyl ligand. The cyclization of an enediyne bearing a propargylic stereocenter was shown to have similar stereoselectivity for Cp- and Cp‡-ligated ruthenium (1 : 1), as compared to Cp* (8 : 2). The photochemical release of naphthalene from ruthenium in the presence of enediynes or dienynes was observed to give cycloaromatized products in excellent yields. 	Finally, a recently discovered thermal cyclization of enediynes was extended to include incorporation of chloride or bromide from chloroform or bromoform, respectively. The haloform was demonstrated to react with 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene to generate hydrogen halide in situ, which then added across an alkyne to produce a cis, cis-dienyne. The chloro and bromo dienyne intermediates were independently prepared and shown to undergo the cyclization. The cyclization is proposed to involve a cascade of pericyclic reactions initiated by either a [1, 7]-hydride shift or 6 -electrocyclization leading to arene products with different substitution patterns. When iodoform was used, the iodo dienyne was observed at lower temperatures, but the product of a formal Bergman cyclization was the only product observed at higher temperatures. Fluoroform was observed to have no effect on the rate or product of the enediyne cyclization, presumably due to high bond strengths in fluoroform...|$|R
