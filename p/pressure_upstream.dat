40|$|While {{pressure}} balance can predict {{how far the}} magnetopause will move {{in response to an}} upstream pressure change, it cannot determine how fast the transient reponse will be. Using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), we present multipoint observations revealing, for the first time, strong (thermal + magnetic) pressure gradients in the magnetosheath due to a foreshock transient, most likely a Hot Flow Anomaly (HFA), which decreased the total <b>pressure</b> <b>upstream</b> of the bow shock. By converting the spacecraft time series into a spatial picture, we quantitatively show that these pressure gradients caused the observed acceleration of the plasma, resulting in fast sunward magnetosheath flows ahead of a localised outward distortion of the magnetopause. The acceleratation of the magnetosheath plasma was fast enough to keep the peak of the magnetopause bulge at approximately the equilibrium position i. e. in {{pressure balance}}. Therefore, we show that pressure gradients in the magnetosheath due to transient changes in the total <b>pressure</b> <b>upstream</b> can directly drive anomalous flows and in turn are important in transmitting information from the bow shock to the magnetopause...|$|E

50|$|Choked flow is a fluid dynamic {{condition}} {{associated with the}} Venturi effect. When a flowing fluid at a given pressure and temperature passes through a restriction (such as the throat of a convergent-divergent nozzle or a valve in a pipe) into a lower pressure environment the fluid velocity increases. At initially subsonic upstream conditions, the conservation of mass principle requires the fluid velocity to increase as it flows through the smaller cross-sectional area of the restriction. At the same time, the Venturi effect causes the static pressure, and therefore the density, to decrease downstream beyond the restriction. Choked flow is a limiting condition where the mass flow will not increase with a further decrease in the downstream <b>pressure</b> environment while <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure</b> is fixed. Note that the limited parameter is velocity, and thus mass flow can be increased with increased <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure</b> (increased fluid density).|$|R

Experiments using a specially designed igniter, with a prechamber to build up and control the stagnation <b>pressure</b> <b>upstream</b> of the orifice, were conducted to investigate the formation processes of turbulent jets of combustion products.
