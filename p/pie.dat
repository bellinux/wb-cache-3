5|$|Stargazy <b>pie</b> (sometimes called starrey gazey <b>pie,</b> stargazey <b>pie</b> {{and other}} variants) is a Cornish dish made of baked pilchards (or sardines), along with eggs and potatoes, {{covered with a}} pastry crust. Although {{there are a few}} {{variations}} with different fish being used, the unique feature of stargazy <b>pie</b> is fish heads (and sometimes tails) protruding through the crust, so that they appear to be gazing skyward. This allows the oils released during cooking to flow back into the <b>pie.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stargazy <b>pie</b> is a pastry-based fish <b>pie</b> which, by tradition, {{is filled}} with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} to gaze at the stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the <b>pie,</b> adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the <b>pie</b> is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the <b>pie</b> crust to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E
5|$|Home Made Mince <b>Pie</b> is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the humor is in a mince <b>pie</b> that brandy is added to {{in an attempt to}} make it more appreciable, but three people each add brandy to the <b>pie.</b> Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the <b>pie,</b> including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one <b>pie</b> split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|An older feast, {{held by the}} {{fishermen}} {{towards the end of}} December, included a <b>pie</b> cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year.
