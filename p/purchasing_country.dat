50|$|In weapons trade, defense {{contractors}} are {{fully aware that}} offsets are powerful marketing tools to motivate the purchase, by showing and giving additional advantages for the <b>purchasing</b> <b>country</b> besides investing in military equipment. The U.S. defense industry position {{seems to be more}} practical, and somewhat quietly nonaligned with U.S. government economic or political assessment of defense offsets. Generally speaking, one can understand offsets as a widespread sales technique. As such, they are not restricted to weapons sale, they belong to commerce itself, {{in the same way that}} rebates, price-pack deals, or loyalty rewards programs do. Understanding “defense offsets” to be part of a sales technique helps to curb the justified yet excessive emphasis on their mandatory nature.|$|E
50|$|Offsets can {{be defined}} as {{provisions}} to an import agreement, between an exporting foreign company, or possibly a government acting as intermediary, and an importing public entity, that oblige the exporter to undertake activities in order to satisfy a second objective of the importing entity, distinct from the acquisition of the goods and/or services that form the core transaction. The incentive for the exporter results from the conditioning of the core transaction to the acceptance of the offset obligation. Offset agreements often involve trade in military goods and services and are alternatively called: industrial compensations, industrial cooperation, offsets, industrial and regional benefits, balances, juste retour or equilibrium, to define mechanisms more complex than counter-trade.Counter-trade can also be considered one of the many forms of defense offset, to compensate a <b>purchasing</b> <b>country.</b> The main difference between a generic offset and counter-trade, both common practices in the international defense trade, is the involvement of money. In counter-trade, goods are paid through barters or other mechanisms without the exchange of money, while in other defense offsets money is the measure and the medium of exchange.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Poster SessionsSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopOffset or industrial participation is a practice that is part of many large international transactions. In the event of a large international transaction involving the purchase of a product (e. g. : equipment or services), the company selling the product, is typically required to compensate the <b>purchasing</b> <b>country</b> for a perceived loss to the economy of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>country.</b> This compensation is called offset. Other terms for offset include industrial participation or industrial cooperation, and there are others. Offset is a legal or formal requirement for many large sales by companies to most foreign governments. Exceptions include the United States and Japan which have other methods of getting the compensation for perceived loss to their economies. Over the past 25 years, the number of countries practicing offset in international sales have increased tenfold to over 150 countries. As estimated by offset associations (i. e. : GOCA, DMA, etc.) offset accounts for 10 % to 15 % of world trade, which translates to about 1 trillion dollars in world trade per year. Offset has great potential to be used for interplanetary probe applications. Help fund joint interplanetary probe missions between countries. Provide launch services. Stimulate research and development of sensors within universities. Increased international collaboration between seller and buyer countries. Build stronger bonds within the international scientific community. This is a student project. Our objective is to promote the use of international offset to further the development of interplanetary probe missions.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} important {{facet of the}} international arms trade are so-called offsets, arrangements that obligate the arms seller to reinvest (“offset”) arms sales proceeds in the <b>purchasing</b> <b>country.</b> In justifying arms expenditure and in promoting local industrial activity, offsets are claimed to offer significant benefits to developing countries, yet until recently {{there has been little}} research on how well offsets work in practise. This paper considers some of the issues and current empirical evidence. We find virtually no case where offset arrangements have yielded unambiguous net benefits for a country’s economic development. As a general rule arms trade offset deals are more costly than ‘off-the-shelf ’ arms purchases, create little by way of new or sustainable employment, do not appear to contribute in any substantive way to general economic development, and with very few exceptions do not result in significant technology transfers, not even within the military sector...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} global {{mechanism}} to finance sustainable development (SD) {{that offers a}} number of advantages over the current Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The mechanism would be multinational, provide incentives for rich and poor countries to promote SD, incorporate the principle of common, but differentiated, responsibilities and link incentives and funding for SD to structural benchmarks and performance targets. It would operate as a large fund into which rich countries would pay based on their level of population, per capita income and change in a measure of environmental sustainability. Receipts from the funds, called Country Undertakings and Rights for Environmental Sustainability (CURES), would be made to poor countries based on their population, per capita income and absolute level of environmental sustainability. This approach differentiates payments and receipts {{on the basis of}} income, while rewarding improvements in environmental performance in rich countries, and making greater payments to countries with greater environmental problems. To promote flexibility, recipient countries would be able to trade, bank or borrow their assigned CURES, provided that the trade resulted in a verifiable improvement in environmental sustainability in the <b>purchasing</b> <b>country.</b> A reformed GEF that adopted the desirable features of CURES, if widely adopted and funded at a sufficiently high level, would offer a significant boost to global SD and would greatly assist poor countries to address the twin challenges of poverty and environmental degradation. sustainable development, intergovernmental financial transfers, adjusted net savings, GEF...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Background: Since 1999 WHO has {{tracked the}} {{procurement}} of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for common infections, such as HIV, and has reported {{a significant increase}} in usage. In 1999 less than 40 % of all HIV diagnoses around the world were performed with rapid tests whereas the remaining 60 % were conducted with laboratory-based tests such as ELISAs. By 2009 over 80 % of HIV diagnoses had transitioned to using RDTs. Many of these tests abide by the ASSURED criteria, which outline standards for the evaluation of point-of-care diagnostics. Although these criteria endorse important characteristics such as low cost and rapid time-to-results, they do not provide quantitative measures to compare similar tests or guide RDT developers. In this analysis we aim to determine how different countries select HIV RDT(s), and to parse out which characteristics are responsible for their decisions. Understanding what drives the purchase and use of current HIV RDTs can help inform future designs and specifications for test developers. Methods: We analyzed data from The Global Fund's Price and Quality Reporting (PQR) database from January 2010 to January 2014. The sample consisted of 945 purchase records of HIV rapid diagnostic tests, including order date, <b>purchasing</b> <b>country,</b> and the number of tests purchased per order. The main independent variable was unit cost per test (in USD). Linear regression with random effects on country was used {{to examine the relationship between}} test purchase, a proxy for test usage, and test cost. Models were adjusted for country random effects and country and test-level covariates. Findings: This study included 945 purchase records of 38 different HIV RDTs from 93 countries. Our exploratory analysis showed that the characteristics that drive test purchase differ across a variety of settings. As cost is increased by just one $ 1. 00 overall purchase across all settings falls by 18. 7 % (95 % CI: − 25. 4 to − 16. 0 %). Other important driving characteristics were test time, maximum test storage temperature, and whether or not the test required additional equipment to run. When observations are stratified by country income level, the major driving factor is test cost and the degree of influence changes across strata. For low-income countries, every $ 1. 00 increase in test cost decreases test purchases by 62. 1 % (95 % CI: − 155 to − 39. 4 %). For high-income countries this decrease is only 10. 4 % (95 % CI: − 24. 7 to − 2. 7 %). Stratification by country HIV prevalence, high vs. low, again showed cost was a major driving factor, while test time, maximum test storage temperature, and whether or not the test required additional equipment to run were also significant indicators. For all of the analyses, test accuracy — sensitivity and specificity — was not found to significantly influence test purchase within this dataset. Findings: The ASSURED criteria are a good first step toward evaluating diagnostics for a variety of settings but this work presents the first quantitative assessment of which characteristics influence the purchase and usage of HIV RDTs. Overall, cost was a major driving factor, but the degree of its influence, and whether or not other factors were also important, varies between settings. This exploratory analysis can serve as a step toward better understanding what drives HIV RDT usage and help researchers and test developers design future tests that focus on these important characteristics...|$|E
