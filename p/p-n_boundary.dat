50|$|Detector {{and power}} {{rectifiers}} could not amplify a signal. Many {{efforts were made}} to develop a solid-state amplifier, but these were unsuccessful because of limited theoretical understanding of semiconductor materials. In 1922 Oleg Losev developed two-terminal, negative resistance amplifiers for radio; however, he perished in the Siege of Leningrad. In 1926 Julius Edgar Lilienfeld patented a device resembling a modern field-effect transistor, but it was not practical. R. Hilsch and R. W. Pohl in 1938 demonstrated a solid-state amplifier using a structure resembling the control grid of a vacuum tube; although the device displayed power gain, it had a cut-off frequency of one cycle per second, too low for any practical applications, but an effective application of the available theory. At Bell Labs, William Shockley and A. Holden started investigating solid-state amplifiers in 1938. The first p-n junction in silicon was observed by Russell Ohl about 1941, when a specimen was found to be light-sensitive, with a sharp boundary between p-type impurity at one end and n-type at the other. A slice cut from the specimen at the <b>p-n</b> <b>boundary</b> developed a voltage when exposed to light.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} work on locally gated graphene layers resulting in p-n junctions have revealed quantum Hall effect in their transport behavior. We explain the observed conductance quantization which is fractional in the bipolar regime and integer in the unipolar regime {{in terms of}} quantum Hall edge modes propagating along and across the p-n interface. In the bipolar regime the electron and hole modes can mix at the <b>p-n</b> <b>boundary,</b> leading to current partition and quantized shot noise plateaus {{similar to those of}} conductance, while in the unipolar regime transport is noiseless. These quantum Hall phenomena reflect the massless Dirac character of charge carriers in graphene, with particle-hole interplay manifest in mode mixing and noise in the bipolar regime.

40|$|Electrostatic {{confinement}} {{of charge}} carriers in graphene {{is governed by}} Klein tunnelling, a relativistic quantum process in which particle–hole transmutation leads to unusual anisotropic transmission at <b>p–n</b> junction <b>boundaries.</b> Reflection and transmission at these boundaries affect the quantum interference of electronic waves, enabling the formation of novel quasi-bound states. Here we report the use of scanning tunnelling microscopy to map the electronic structure of Dirac fermions confined in quantum dots defined by circular graphene p–n junctions. The quantum dots were fabricated using a technique involving local manipulation of defect charge within the insulating substrate beneath a graphene monolayer 13. Inside such graphene quantum dots we observe resonances due to quasi-bound states and directly visualize the quantum interference patterns arising from these states. Outside the quantum dots Dirac fermions exhibit Friedel oscillation-like behaviour. Bolstered by a theoretical model describing relativistic particles in a harmonic oscillator potential, our findings yield insights into the spatial behaviour of electrostatically confined Dirac fermions.

40|$|Only {{for the use}} as a {{gate oxide}} was it {{necessary}} to anneal the TPS oxidized films. Such an annealing process has reduced the defects and caused a reduction of the flatband voltage. The bias temperature stability of the C-V curves of the MOS structures grown by the oxidized TPS are {{comparable to those of}} the thermally oxidized films. The lower temperature of deposition of the TPS oxidized films offers a clear advantage over the thermally oxidized films since in the former case the lower temperature of deposition avoids any shift of the <b>p-n</b> junction <b>boundaries,</b> through diffusion. Conclusion It has been proved that the TPS oxidized SiO 2 films deposited at about 750 ~ even in an unannealed state {{can be used as a}}n efficient mask against boron diffusion and if annealed at about 850 ~ can be used as a gate oxide in MOS devices. The quality of the TPS oxidized SiO 2 films is superior to that of oxidized silane or de-composed TEOS and almost comparable to that of the thermally oxidized films. The fact that they are grown at a much lower temperature than the thermally oxi-dized films makes the TPS oxidized films attractive for potential use in MOS devices...|$|R
