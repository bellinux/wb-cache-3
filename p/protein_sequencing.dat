5|$|By the 1980s, <b>protein</b> <b>sequencing</b> {{had already}} {{transformed}} methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists {{soon began to}} use RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded the significance of molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular systematics could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology. Following the pioneering ideas of Lynn Margulis on endosymbiotic theory, which holds {{that some of the}} organelles of eukaryotic cells originated from free living prokaryotic organisms through symbiotic relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's pioneering molecular systematics work with 16S rRNA sequencing.|$|E

Ambler later returned to England to attend boarding school at Haileybury , before heading to Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1954 to study natural sciences. He remained at Cambridge to complete his PhD on bacterial proteins, under the tutelage of the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Fred Sanger. In 1963, Ambler published the first amino acid sequence of a bacterial protein, developing new methods of <b>protein</b> <b>sequencing</b> to determine the structure of the mitochondrial cytochrome c protein.

Subsequently, he pursued his Ph.D. work in bio{{chemistry and}} molecular {{biology at the}} Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin Dahlem in which Heinz-Günter Wittmann was department head. While determining the primary structures of several E. coli ribosomal proteins, he developed manual micro-methods for isolating peptides using two-dimensional separation on cellulose thin layer plates (instead of using a series of chromatography columns) followed by dansyl-Edman degradation. This reduced the required protein material by one to two orders of magnitude towards the 100 nMol range. This method was shortly thereafter superseded by automated <b>protein</b> <b>sequencing</b> operating in the low picoMol range.|$|E

The issue became even more critical after 1968; Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution suggested that natural selection was not the ubiquitous cause of evolution, at least at the molecular level, and that molecular evolution might be a fundamentally different process from morphological evolution.

The seven collagen types obtained from the bone fragments, compared to collagen data from living birds (specifically, a chicken), suggest that older theropods and birds are closely related.The soft tissue allowed a molecular comparison of cellular anatomy and <b>protein</b> <b>sequencing</b> of collagen tissue published in 2007, both of which indicated that T. rex and birds are {{more closely related to}} each other than either is to Alligator. A second molecular study robustly supported the relationship of birds to dinosaurs, though it did not place birds within Theropoda, as expected. This study utilized eight additional collagen sequences extracted from a femur of the [...] "mummified" [...] Brachylophosaurus canadensis specimen MOR 2598, a hadrosaur. However, these results have been very controversial. No other peptides of a Mesozoic age have been reported. In 2008, it was suggested that the presumed soft tissue was in fact a bacterial microfilm. In response, it was argued that these very microfilms protected the soft tissue. Another objection was that the results could have been caused by contamination. In 2015, under more controlled conditions safeguarding against contamination, the peptides were still identified. In 2017, a study found that a peptide was present in the bone of the modern ostrich that was identical to that found in the Tyrannosaurus and Brachylophosaurus specimens, highlighting the danger of a cross-contamination.|$|E
