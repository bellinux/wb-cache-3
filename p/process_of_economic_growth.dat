The lack of statistical significance that has been observed by estimating this link between endogeneous GDP growth rates and exogeneous population rate of expansion for years before 1975 might then be the result of the contradiction between opposite temporal or regional patterns of this relationship, more than the indefectible proof of the absence of any relationship at all. Two dimensions of those oppositions are then explored, dealing successively with the heterogeneity of national and regional experiences <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and <b>of</b> fertility transition.

5000|$|One of Gordons most {{important}} {{contributions to the}} collaborative research he carried out on labor economics and macroeconomic trends was his historical and institutional understanding of the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and development.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s he sought to use statistical methodology to conduct a rigorous test of this historical-institutional approach. His project involved the specification of four distinct but comparable econometric models of the U.S. economy, based respectively on the neoclassical, the (classical) Marxian, the post-Keynesian, and his own Neo-Marxian [...] "left-structuralist" [...] perspective—the latter representing a formalization of the SSA approach.

50|$|In {{addition}} to increasing private incomes, economic growth also generate additional {{resources that can}} be used to improve social services (such as healthcare, safe drinking water, etc.). By generating additional resources for social services, unequal income distribution will be mitigated as such social services are distributed equally across each community, thereby benefiting each individual.Concisely, the relationship between human development and economic development can be explained in three ways. First, increase in average income leads to improvement in health and nutrition (known as Capability Expansion through Economic Growth). Second, it is believed that social outcomes can only be improved by reducing income poverty (known as Capability Expansion through Poverty Reduction). Lastly, social outcomes can also be improved with essential services such as education, healthcare, and clean drinking water (known as Capability Expansion through Social Services).John Joseph Puthenkalam's research aims at the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> theories that lead to economic development. After analyzing the existing capitalistic growth-development theoretical apparatus, he introduces the new model which integrates the variables of freedom, democracy and human rights into the existing models and argue that any future economic growth-development of any nation depends on this emerging model as we witness the third wave of unfolding demand for democracy in the Middle East. He develops the knowledge sector in growth theories with two new concepts of 'micro knowledge' and 'macro knowledge'. Micro knowledge is what an individual learns from school or from various existing knowledge and macro knowledge is the core philosophical thinking of a nation that all individuals inherently receive. How to combine both these knowledge would determine further growth that leads to economic development of developing nations.|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis {{holds that}} <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> leads {{to increases in}} pollution in early stages of development, but is a significant driver of environmental improvements as income levels increase. Most empirical applications have focused on estimating a reduced form equation in which the measure of environmental degradation is posited as a non-linear function of income. In this paper we develop a structural production model based on an output distance function to investigate the EKC hypothesis for CO 2 in a panel of industrialized countries from 1971 to 2000. This structural approach allows for the decomposition of the observed emission changes into the scale, composition, and productivity effects, thus providing additional insight into the interlinked <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and environmental change. The findings from our preferred model indicate that for most countries, the CO 2 -saving productivity effect is not large enough to offset the CO 2 -producing scale effect. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{we cannot}} {{conceive}} <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> {{that do not}} involve institutional change, in this essay we outline some reasons why one should be cautious about grounding a theory of growth on institutions. We emphasize how very different institutional structures have often {{been found to be}} reasonable substitutes for each other, both in dissimilar as well as similar contexts. The historical record, therefore, does not seem to support the notion that any particular institution, narrowly defined, is indispensable for growth. Moreover, we discuss how the evidence that there are systematic patterns to the ways institutions evolve undercuts the idea that exogenous change in institutions is what powers growth. Institutions matter, but our thinking of how they matter should recognize that they are profoundly influenced by the political and economic environment, and that if any aspect of institutions is crucial for growth, it is that institutions change over time as circumstances change. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores intersections of community, tribal identity, and language.

My research uncovered how these processes are intertwined with <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> that have dramatically reshaped the social realities within the tribe during the past decade: Most notably, this economic expansion has allowed the tribe to use some of its income to fund various language learning forums. The result has been the creation of well-paid and socially significant roles for Chickasaw speakers, old and new, as a newly appreciated skill set. Equally important is the resultant dediasporization effect, which draws tribal citizens to relocate (geographically and occupationally) to the Nation in diverse arenas. This process has dramatically shifted who participates in the semiotic trends of language revitalization, as well as the motivations behind such participation...|$|R
