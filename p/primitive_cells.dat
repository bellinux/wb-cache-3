25|$|Self-assembled vesicles are {{essential}} components of <b>primitive</b> <b>cells.</b> The second law of thermodynamics {{requires that the}} Universe move in a direction in which entropy increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization. Therefore, a boundary is needed to separate life processes from non-living matter. Researchers Irene A. Chen and Jack W. Szostak amongst others, suggest that simple physicochemical properties of elementary protocells can give rise to essential cellular behaviours, including primitive forms of differential reproduction competition and energy storage. Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and its encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from simple replicating molecules to true cells. Furthermore, competition for membrane molecules would favour stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage {{for the evolution of}} cross-linked fatty acids and even the phospholipids of today. Such micro-encapsulation would allow for metabolism within the membrane, the exchange of small molecules but the prevention of passage of large substances across it. The main advantages of encapsulation include the increased solubility of the contained cargo within the capsule and the storage of energy {{in the form of a}} electrochemical gradient.|$|E
2500|$|Hematopoiesis {{is defined}} as the {{formation}} and development of blood cells, all of which are derived from hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). [...] HSPCs are <b>primitive</b> <b>cells</b> capable of self-renewal and initially differentiate into common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells. [...] CMPs represent the cellular population that has become myeloid lineage and it is the point that myelopoeisis begins. [...] During myelopoeisis further cellular differentiation takes place including thrombopoiesis, erythropoeisis, granulopoeisis, and [...] monocytopoeisis. [...] CLPs subsequently differentiate into B-cells and T-cells in a process designated lymphopoiesis. [...] Given that miR-155-5p is expressed in hematopoietic cells it was hypothesized that this miRNA plays a critical role in these cellular differentiation processes. [...] In support of this premise, miR-155-5p was found to be expressed in CD34(+) human HSPCs, and it was speculated that this miRNA may hold these cells at an early stem-progenitor stage, inhibiting their differentiation into a more mature cell (i.e. megakaryocytic/erythroid/granulocytic/monocytic/B-lymphoid/T-lymphoid). [...] This hypothesis was substantiated when pre-mir-155 transduced HSPCs generated 5-fold fewer myeloid and 3-fold fewer erythroid colonies. [...] Additionally, Hu et al. demonstrated that the homeobox protein, HOXA9, regulated MIR155HG expression in myeloid cells and that this miRNA played a functional role in hematopoiesis. [...] These investigators found that forced expression of miR-155-5p in bone marrow cells resulted in a ~50% decrease in SPI1 (i.e. PU.1), a transcription factor and a regulator of myelopoiesis, and a validated target of this miRNA. [...] It was also established that in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in a progressive decrease of miR-155-5p expression in mature red cells. [...] Additionally, mice deficient in pre-mir-155 showed clear defects in lymphocyte development and generation of B- and T-cell responses in vivo. [...] Finally, it was established that regulatory T-cell (Tregs) development required miR-155-5p and this miRNA was shown {{to play a role in}} Treg homeostasis and overall survival by directly targeting SOCS1, a negative regulator for IL-2 signaling. [...] Taken together, these results strongly suggest that miR-155-5p is an essential molecule in the control of several aspects of hematopoiesis including myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and lymphopoiesis.|$|E

Although the origin of life is largely still a mystery, in the currently prevailing theory, known as the RNA world hypothesis, early RNA molecules would have been the basis for catalyzing organic chemical reactions and self-replication. The RNA world hypothesis assumes that RNA molecules could form in abiotic conditions, which would require nucleic acids and ribose to be present. Theoretical and experimental findings show that nucleic acids and sugars could have been synthesized in early prebiotic conditions.|$|E

50|$|Another group {{suggests}} that <b>primitive</b> <b>cells</b> might have formed inside inorganic clay microcompartments, which {{can provide an}} ideal container for the synthesis and compartmentalization of complex organic molecules. Clay-armored bubbles form naturally when particles of montmorillonite clay collect on the outer surface of air bubbles under water. This creates a semi permeable vesicle from materials that are readily available in the environment. The authors remark that montmorillonite is known {{to serve as a}} chemical catalyst, encouraging lipids to form membranes and single nucleotides to join into strands of RNA. Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the clay bubbles burst, releasing the lipid membrane-bound product into the surrounding medium.|$|E

It was first synthesised by Krishna Bahadur (20 January 1926 — 5 August 1994), an Indian chemist and his team in 1963. Using photochemical reaction, they produced coacervates, microscopic cell-like spheres from a mixture of simple organic and inorganic compounds. Bahadur named these particles 'Jeewanu' because they exhibited {{some of the basic}} properties of a cell, such as the presence of semipermeable membrane, amino acids, phospholipids and carbohydrates. Further, like living cells, they had several catalytic activities. Jeewanu are cited as models of protocells for the origin of life, and as artificial cells.|$|E
50|$|HOXA6 was {{examined}} to be preferentially expressed in <b>primitive</b> <b>cells</b> (e.g. hematopoietic progenitor cells), under {{the regulation of}} growth factors and cell cycles. Interleukin 3 and all-trans retinoic acid {{were found to be}} the inducing factors that can stimulate the expression of HOXA6. In mitotic process, HOXA6 was mainly expressed in S-phase and G2M phase cells. Overexpression of HoxA6 increased proliferation but inhibited differentiation of multipotential stem cells in the process of hemopoiesis, even had the capacity to transform primary hematopoietic cells into immortal cell lines. Transplantation of these cell lines may cause acute myeloid leukemia in recipient animals.Also in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, HOXA6 expression was upregulated. The comethylation of HOX genes, including HOXA6, leads to the dysfunction of tumor suppression genes by reducing gene expression. The methylation processes can be identified in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemia and childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia.|$|E
5000|$|Doolittle {{suggested}} that the universal common ancestor cannot have been one particular organism, but {{must have been a}} loose, diverse conglomeration of <b>primitive</b> <b>cells</b> that evolved together. These early cells, each with relatively few genes, differed in many ways, and swapped their genes freely. Eventually, from these eclectic cells came the three domains of life as we know them today: bacteria, archaea and eukaryote. These domains are now recognizably distinct because much of the gene transfer that still occurs is within these domains, rather than between them. Biologist Peter Gogarten reinforced these arguments, and {{suggested that}} the metaphor of a tree does not fit the data from recent genome research, and that biologists should instead use [...] "the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use the metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes." ...|$|E
