The right single-lane exit ramp is the most common style of the freeway exit ramp which can be divided into two types: taper-type single-lane exit ramp and <b>parallel-type</b> single-lane exit ramp. The main objective of the paper was to elaborate recommendations about the best single-lane exit ramp layout according to different parameters by evaluating safety and capacity. 6 taper-type and 4 <b>parallel-type</b> exit ramps were selected in Jiangsu Province and the space mean speeds (SMS) of the 200 vehicles on the deceleration lane of each sample were observed. The average SMS standard deviation of taper-type was 8. 0 kmph comparing with 4. 6 kmph of <b>parallel-type,</b> which indirectly indicated that <b>parallel-type</b> single-lane exit ramp was safer than the other one.

40|$|Abstract: Hybrid {{powertrain}} {{systems have}} been developed to improve the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines. In the case of a parallel hybrid powertrain system, an engine and a motor are directly coupled. Because of the hardware configuration of the parallel hybrid system, friction and the pumping losses of internal combustion engines always exists. Such losses are the primary factors that result in the deterioration of fuel efficiency in the <b>parallel-type</b> hybrid powertrain system. In particular, the engine operates as a power consumption device during the fuel-cut condition. In order to improve the fuel efficiency for the <b>parallel-type</b> hybrid system, cylinder deactivation (CDA) technology was developed. Cylinder deactivation technology can improve fuel efficiency by reducing pumping losses during the fuel-cut driving condition. In a CDA engine, there are two operating modes: a CDA mode and an SI mode according to the vehicle operating condition. However, during the mode change from CDA to SI, a serious fluctuation of the air-fuel ratio can occur without adequate control. In this study, an air-fuel ratio control algorithm during the mode transition from CDA to SI was proposed. The control algorithm was developed based on the mean value CDA engine model.

40|$|The Mid Niigata Prefecture Earthquake (Chuetsu Earthquake) on October 23, 2004 caused {{multiple}} landslides and slope {{failures in}} the Chuetsu region of Niigata Prefecture, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} the Imo River and its tributaries. The Chuetsu region is located in a heavy snowfall area, and shortly after the earthquake there were heavy snowfalls, which raised concerns of landslides and slope failures when the snow subsequently melted. The aim of this study was to investigate sediment yield by slope failures (excluding landslides and minor surface exfoliation) associated with the Chuetsu Earthquake and subsequent rainfall and snow melt in the Imo River basin region. The characteristics of slope failure by the earthquake and melting of snow were subject to quantitative analysis by comparing aerial photographs with laser profiler data in each unit basin area.

One of the concepts playing a central role in this theory is “order” which expresses a certain kind of complexity of a <b>parallel-type</b> machine. Thus, the main theme of the theory is to establish the methodology for determining the order of a given Perceptron.

Thus, in the present paper, new methods applicable to the wider range of Perceptrons will be given. In those methods, a given Perceptron is first decomposed in additive and/or multiplicative form, and next the order of the Perceptron is determined from the orders of decomposed Perceptrons.

Knowledge about folding intermediates formed subsequently is essential {{to get a grip}} on pathological aggregation phenomena. During folding of apoflavodoxin, which adopts the widely prevalent ¿¿ß parallel topology, most molecules fold via an off-pathway folding intermediate with helical properties. To better understand why this species is formed, guanidine hydrochloride-unfolded apoflavodoxin is characterized at the residue level using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. In 6. 0 M denaturant, the protein behaves as a random coil. In contrast, at 3. 4 M denaturant, secondary shifts and 1 H¿ 15 N relaxation rates report four transiently ordered regions in unfolded apoflavodoxin. These regions have restricted flexibility on the (sub) nanosecond time scale. Secondary shifts show that three of these regions form ¿-helices, which are populated about 10 % of the time, as confirmed by far-UV CD data. One region of unfolded apoflavodoxin adopts non-native structure. Of the ¿-helices observed, two are present in native apoflavodoxin as well. A substantial part of the third helix becomes ß-strand while forming native protein. Chemical shift changes due to amino acid residue replacement show that the latter ¿-helix has hydrophobic interactions with all other ordered regions in unfolded apoflavodoxin. Remarkably, these ordered segments dock non-natively, which causes strong competition with on-pathway folding. Thus, rather than directing productive folding, conformational preorganization in the unfolded state of an ¿¿ß <b>parallel-type</b> protein promotes off-pathway species formation...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, various {{flexural}} plate-wave (FPW) -based biosensors with low phase velocity, low operation frequency, high sensitivity, and short response time, have been developed. However, conventional FPW transducers have low fabrication yield because controlling the thickness of silicon/isolation/metal/piezoelectric multilayer floating thin-plate is difficult. Additionally, conventional FPW devices usually have high insertion loss because of wave energy dissipation to the silicon substrate or outside area of the output interdigital transducers (IDTs). These two disadvantages hinder the application of FPW devices. To reduce the high insertion loss of FPW devices, we designed two focus-type IDTs (fan-shaped and circular, respectively) that can effectively confine the launched wave energy, and adopted a focus-type silicon-grooved reflective grating structure (RGS) that can reduce the wave propagation loss. To accurately control {{the thickness of the}} silicon thin-plate and substantially improve the fabrication yield of FPW transducers, a 60 °C/ 27 °C two-step anisotropic wet etching process was developed.

In the analysis of the zero-voltage switch (ZVS) Class-D converter, both steady-state and dynamic analysis methods are presented. The analysis is based on the Class-D converter with a variable capacitance switch (VCS) for voltage regulation at constant frequency.
