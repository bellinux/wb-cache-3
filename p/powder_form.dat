40|$|Most of {{industrial}} materials are made originally from powder as a raw material and are shaped into a desired shape, {{which is called}} <b>powder</b> <b>forming</b> process. The <b>powder</b> <b>forming</b> {{is a series of}} operations that transform particulate materials into a bulk body having a certain external shape and internal structure, and is related to unit operations such as size reduction, classification, mixing, kneading, de-foaming and granulation. The <b>powder</b> <b>forming</b> processes are very important since properties of greed body such as packing structure and density distribution of particles in the body dominate qualities of final products after sintering process. In this paper, we will review representative methods of ceramics <b>powder</b> <b>forming</b> such as pressing, extrusion molding, injection molding, slip casting and tape casting with a special focus on tasks in each method to be overcome for a better processing in the ceramics <b>powder</b> <b>forming</b> in the future...|$|R

The study was conducted to investigate the effects of <b>powdered</b> <b>form</b> of Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) leaves on blood glucose concentration and body weight in Streptozotocin induced diabetic rats and for its efficacy study with a patent drug, Glimepiride. The effects of <b>powdered</b> <b>form</b> of Stevia leaves was evaluated in the Streptozotocin (STZ; 55 mg/kg body weight as single intraperitoneal injection) induced diabetic rats and for this, <b>powdered</b> <b>form</b> of Stevia leaves was orally administered at three different dose rates of 150 mg/kg, 200 mg/Kg and 250 mg/Kg body weight, respectively once a day for 3 weeks.

The <b>powdered</b> <b>form</b> of Stevia leaves produced significant (p< 0. 01 or p< 0. 05) hypoglycemic effects on Streptozotocin induced diabetic rats in comparison with that of the standard drug, Glimepiride. <b>Powdered</b> <b>form</b> of Stevia leaves at a dose rate of 250 mg/Kg decreased body weight significantly (p< 0. 01 or p< 0. 05) in STZ-induced diabetic rats.

Traces of the drug have also been found in other recreational drugs including cocaine, MDMA, and heroin. The drug has been implicated in multiple deaths from the homeless to young professionals, including multiple teens and young parents.

25|$|Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is {{traditionally}} prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) {{is added to}} a pot of boiling water, the water is then reduced to a simmer, and the pot is covered; the lingzhi is then simmered for two hours. The resulting liquid is fairly bitter in taste and dark, with the more active red lingzhi more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated for additional concentration. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} as an ingredient in a formula decoction or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or <b>powder</b> <b>form).</b> The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.|$|E
25|$|The broth for beef pho is {{generally}} made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones {{may still have}} beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.|$|E

The rise to popularity of this flavor was largely result of Michael Jordan, who, {{at the height of his}} NBA career in the early 1990s, stated that it was his favorite flavor. This claim appeared on the packaging beginning in 1991, as part of a 10-year endorsement deal. The Citrus Cooler flavor was reportedly discontinued at some point in the 1990s; however as of 2011 it is listed as being a current product in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Several large {{quantities}} of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In June 2006, 945 grams (2.08 lbs) of 83 %-pure fentanyl powder was seized by Border Patrol agents in California from a vehicle that had entered from Mexico. Mexico {{is the source of}} much of the illicit fentanyl for sale in the U.S. However, in April 2006, there was one domestic fentanyl lab discovered by law enforcement in Azusa, California. The lab was a source of counterfeit 80mg OxyContin tablets containing fentanyl instead of oxycodone, as well as bulk fentanyl and other drugs. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a pill press and ordered fentanyl in <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> from China.|$|E
25|$|How {{the sample}} and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of the sample probe needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. The matrix and sample solution are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on the sample probe surface and allowed to dry, thus crystallizing. The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of the sample followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing the sample directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} the sample probe in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. The sample solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating the sample into the top layer of matrix as the sample solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing the sample {{on the surface of the}} probe is the solubility of the sample in the matrix. If the sample is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid sample and solid matrix crystals. Once blended well, this powder can be deposited on the surface of the sample probe in free <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> or as a pill. Another possible method is placing the sample on the surface of the probe and applying vaporized matrix to the sample probe to allow the matrix to condense around the sample.|$|E

500|$|The South station {{had five}} {{generating}} sets and the North station had four. Each generating set had a bunker for 1,250 tonnes of coal, fed by a conveyor from the coal store.

The boilers were forged in Sheffield, {{the first of the}} nine arriving at Stella South in 1953. At 62tonnes, the boilers were at the time the largest ever made in the UK. The boilers were of the radiant-heat type, comprising a water-cooled combustion chamber, controlled-type superheater and an economiser. Each of the boilers had an evaporation rating of 550 kL/h, a steam pressure of 950 psi and a steam temperature of 925°F.
