According to a report in the Tamworth Herald the <b>pit</b> <b>head</b> working were almost entirely destroyed.|$|R

40|$|We {{used the}} {{combined}} subtemporal presigmoid and suboccipital retrosigmoid multidirectional approach {{with the aid}} of a rotatable <b>head</b> <b>frame</b> (periauricular three-quarter twist-rotation approach) in 20 cases of petroclival meningiomas. Patients were placed in the lateral decubitus (park-bench) position. The head is twisted, rotated, and positioned 30 degrees face down in the Sugita rotatable <b>head</b> <b>frame.</b> By rotating this <b>head</b> <b>frame,</b> a 30 - to 60 -degree face-down position can be obtained when the suboccipital retrosigmoid route is used. Alternatively, the straight lateral or slightly brow-up position is obtained when the subtemporal presigmoid route is used. This twist-rotation approach provides multiple trajectories through the petroclival region with minimal drilling of the petrous bone, fatigue of the surgeon, and retraction of the brain...|$|R
50|$|At Nationalisation in 1947 Manchester Collieries {{employed}} 14,868 {{workers on}} the Lancashire Coalfield. Some of the surface workers were women, known as pit brow lasses, who sorted coal on the screens at the <b>pit</b> <b>head.</b> As coal reserves were exhausted, the older collieries closed.|$|R
50|$|A {{memorial}} {{to all the}} men {{who worked in the}} mines, {{in the form of a}} <b>pit</b> <b>head</b> winding wheel was erected on the common on the site of the old Maypole pit. Since the closure of the mine the village is now mainly residential.|$|R
50|$|Monk Bretton Colliery {{opened in}} 1870, extracting coal from the Barnsley Seam. The {{colliery}} was modernised on nationalisation and <b>pit</b> <b>head</b> baths, which still stand today, were opened. A village Miners' Welfare Hall was opened in Cross Street. The colliery was closed in 1968.|$|R

50|$|A winding {{engine is}} a {{stationary}} engine {{used to control}} a cable, for example to power a mining hoist at a <b>pit</b> <b>head.</b> Electric hoist controllers have replaced proper winding engines in modern mining, but use electric motors that are also traditionally referred to as winding engines.|$|R
50|$|Entering the {{pumping chamber}} {{next to the}} <b>pit</b> <b>head,</b> the water turned a 23 ft {{diameter}} overshot waterwheel that powered a nodding donkey or pumpjack. The water pumped out of the mine then exited along with the tail race through another tunnel back into the Irwell.|$|R

50|$|By the 1930s, {{when most}} of the complex was within the {{ownership}} of Powell Duffryn, the accessible coal reserves had been exhausted from the shallower shafts. Resultantly, their <b>pit</b> <b>head</b> workings were closed on economic grounds, although the workable underground coal faces were consolidated into the remaining shafts.|$|R

50|$|In {{common with}} many collieries on the Lancashire Coalfield, women, known as Pit brow lasses were {{employed}} {{on the surface}} to sort coal on the screens at the <b>pit</b> <b>head.</b> The first pit-head baths in the country were built at Gibfield in 1913. Gibfield closed in 1963 and the site was cleared.|$|R

50|$|NLC India {{at present}} has four open cast lignite mines namely Mine I, Mine II, Mine IA and Barsingsar Mine. The lignite mined out {{is used as}} fuel to the linked <b>Pit</b> <b>head</b> power stations. Also raw lignite is being sold to small scale {{industries}} {{to use it as}} fuel in their production activities.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} cleared from 1993 onwards, but the {{associated}} coal washery stayed open for another nine months, {{so that a}} stockpile of 370,000 tonnes could be prepared for market. In 1995 it took a week, working 12 hours a day, to fill the three shafts with rubble from the demolished <b>pit</b> <b>head</b> buildings.|$|R

50|$|Penallta Colliery was a coal mine, located {{close to}} Hengoed in the Rhymney Valley in the South Wales Valleys. A coal mine which in 1935 held the European record for coal wound in a 24-hour period, {{it is now}} the site of an {{original}} redevelopment project which will make use of the former <b>pit</b> <b>head</b> buildings.|$|R
50|$|The former {{colliery}} site {{now has the}} Canolfan sheltered housing complex, and the Ysticlau Park playing field. Some {{history of}} the village still remains, with the <b>pit</b> <b>head</b> winding gear sunk in the ground next {{to the site of}} the old colliery, and five pairs of preserved sections of railway line indicating the size of the enterprise.|$|R
50|$|Chandrapur {{district}} has large deposits of coal and lime stone. The resulting mammoth coal- and limestone mines {{in the district}} {{also contribute to the}} heavy industrialization of the city. Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), a subsidiary of Coal India, has many mines here. Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station, run by Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited, is its biggest <b>pit</b> <b>head</b> thermal power station.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the railway}} still {{runs through the}} village, the station was removed and the line is at present freight only. Access to Neath is via the First Cymru 907 {{services}} to/from Coelbren; while the 158/X58 services run to Swansea's Quadrant Bus Station to/from Banwen. The former <b>pit</b> <b>head</b> baths were converted to an indoor swimming pool which was later converted into a multi-purpose Community Hall.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{buildings}} were subsequently given protected status at the site. The Powder House, Saw mill Office Electrical Workshop, <b>Pit</b> <b>Head</b> Building, Headframe and Tram Circuit, and Miners' Bathhouse were each given Grade II Listed Building status on 2 September 1995. The Powder House building {{was used to}} store explosives needed for mine work during the time Big Pit was an active mine.|$|R
