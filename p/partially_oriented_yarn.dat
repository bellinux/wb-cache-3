40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new paradigm}} {{from the perspective of}} pervasive on-body computing through an innovative polymerized textile, which exhibits sensing and radiation properties. A radical, first of its kind, sensor fabricated from unsaturated polymer resin textile, establishes a dynamic link connecting human thermodynamics to electrical ambiance. A dynamic fabrication process of esterification and Î·-polymerization is developed, which is articulately arrested using an innovatively formulated retardant, yielding a permanent thermally unstable <b>partially</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>yarn</b> (tuPOY). A prudently established nontrivial interchange phenomenon is founded, presenting an inimitable calibration mechanism of the sensors and charting a novel relationship of exuberated energy to lattice kinetics of tuPOY. This meticulously researched conducting medium of tuPOY, fabricated from aromatic polyamides, also {{presents a}}n avant-garde architecture for proliferation of electrical and thermal signals concomitantly between the sensors and its transmission circuit. A power generating unit (PGU) delineates the power mining from thermal energy dissipated from the body, presenting a new dimension in operational power dynamics. A textile composite antenna is premeditated exclusively from radiating tuPOY-based patch and substrate, an archetype reporting in published literature. The judiciously designed antenna, with tuPOY coupled as its patch, and substrate operate as shields against the radiations directed towards the body leading to a self-sustained sculpt. The back-end hardware of the test setup conceptualizes an automated physician machine (APM) presenting a standalone architecture. The artificial intelligence core of APM is modeled on weighted multiclass support vector machines (wmSVMs). The capturing of signal variations, devoid of any metallic components, presents a singular facet of research and amalgamates various interdisciplinary fields, while providing a robust architecture with minimum tradeoffs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a detailed study concerning {{the effects of}} chemicals like sodium hydroxide and environmental conditions such as temperature and time {{on the degradation of}} Poly lactic acid (PLA) as compared to Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The aim is to study the effects of chemical and environmental conditions on the degradation of Poly lactic acids. In view of this, samples of PLA flat filament <b>yarns</b> and <b>partially</b> <b>oriented</b> PET <b>yarns</b> were hydrolysed with two different pH media i. e. neutral pH 7, and alkali pH 12. 0 - 13. 5 to study the physical changes that occurred in the yarn structure. Both the hydrolysed and non-hydrolysed yarns subjected to tensile test, DSC scans and FTIR analysis and the changes and the effects that took place before and after hydrolytic degradation at varied temperatures and times were analysed. The study showed that, at 60 o C and 90 o C hydrolysis yielded significant change in the physical appearance of the sample yarns as well as the structure. It could therefore be concluded that degradation highly occurred in the alkali medium than in the neutral medium when the time and temperatures were increased. This was also testified by the fact that elevated time and temperature aided in degrading the PLA flat filament yarns significantly than that of the <b>partially</b> <b>oriented</b> PET <b>yarns...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of false-twist {{texturing}} parameters (texturing speed, heater temperature, draw ratio and disc-to-yarn speed ratio (D/Y ratio)) on the structure and crimp properties of polyester yarn has been studied using a high temperature heater and high texturing speeds. Textured yarn was analyzed and characterized {{in terms of the}} degree of crystallinity, degree of orientation and crimp properties (crimp contraction, crimp module and crimp stability). The most important parameters, significantly affecting yarn temperature and its uniformity and thus textured yarn structure and crimp properties, are texturing speed and heater temperature. Depending on these texturing parameters, the degree of crystallinity and orientation varied in the range of 24. 48 to 36. 66 % and 0. 371 to 0. 595, respectively. The crimp characteristics increase with the increase in heater temperature, and decrease with the increase in texturing speed. The effect of draw ratio and D/Y ratio on the textured yarn structure and properties is less pronounced. Obtained results show that <b>partially</b> <b>oriented</b> polyester <b>yarn</b> used in this study can be textured at significantly higher texturing speed (up to 1100 m/min) than the standard texturing speed (up to 700 m/min) used for the yarn count examined.

40|$|Two {{different}} Malmquist productivity indexes {{have been}} proposed. One I call <b>partially</b> <b>oriented</b> {{because it is}} either output- or input-oriented, {{and the other is}} simultaneously output- and input-oriented. The <b>partially</b> <b>oriented</b> Malmquist index owes some of its popularity {{to the fact that it}} has been decomposed to isolate various sources of productivity change. Conversely, the simultaneously oriented Malmquist index has not achieved popularity in part because it has not been decomposed. In this paper I evaluate alternative decompositions of the <b>partially</b> <b>oriented</b> Malmquist index, and I obtain a new decomposition of the simultaneously oriented Malmquist index.

The 1 H NMR lines of H 2 and H 2 O display a doublet splitting due to residual dipole–dipole coupling. The dipolar splitting depends on {{temperature in the}} nematic phase and vanishes above the nematic–isotropic phase transition. The 19 F spectrum of HF@C 60 dissolved in MBBA displays a doublet splitting in the nematic phase, with contributions from the 1 H– 19 F dipole–dipole coupling and J-coupling. The phenomena are analyzed using a model in which the fullerene cages acquire a geometrical distortion, either through interaction with the liquid crystal environment, or through their interaction with the endohedral molecules.

Sterically stabilized dumbbell shaped microgels are used as hard dumbbell model systems which consist of dumbbell shaped polystyrene PS cores and thermosensitive poly N isopropylacrylamide PNIPAM shells. Under increasing shear strain, a discontinuous transition is found from a twinned fcc like crystal to a <b>partially</b> <b>oriented</b> sliding layer phase with a shear molten state in between. In the novel <b>partially</b> <b>oriented</b> sliding layer phase, the hard dumbbells exhibit a small but finite orientational order in the shear direction. We find that this weak correlation is sufficient to perturb the nature of the nonequilibrium phase transition as known for hard sphere systems. The discontinuous transition for hard dumbbells is observed to be accompanied by a novel yielding process with two yielding events in its viscoelastic shear response, while only a single yielding event is observed for sheared hard spheres.
