40|$|High {{viscosity}} surfactant pastes {{have recently}} gained {{popularity in the}} production of high efficiency laundry detergents due to their ability to increase surfactant loading in granules. When using high viscosity semi-solid binders a unique challenge is presented because it forces granules to be formed primarily by mechanical dispersion; a relatively poorly understood process. Developing mechanistic models of this process will enhance knowledge of mechanical dispersion processes and improve <b>process</b> development <b>for</b> <b>granules</b> <b>produced</b> using this method. Experiments to determine the effect of three process parameters; paste temperature, impeller RPM, and time were carried out in a lab-scale granulator. Binder temperature was varied between 40 - 60 degrees Celsius to cover paste temperatures from solidification to decomposition. Impeller RPM was varied between 600 - 1200 RPM to capture the full range of potential industrial impeller velocities. Mixing time was varied from zero to ten seconds; the time scale of the industrial process. The particle size distribution <b>for</b> the <b>process</b> was determined to rely primarily on mixing time especially at impeller speeds above 900 RPM where fully developed annular flow occurs in the mixer. The Sauter mean diameter of particles was determined to be linearly related to mixing RPM, while temperature was shown to have little effect on the Sauter mean diameter. Experimental data was in relatively good agreement with values predicted by an existing breakage simulation, but could be improved upon. These conclusions will be used in developing a breakage kernel <b>for</b> the <b>process</b> based on material properties...|$|R
40|$|Roller {{compaction}} is {{a continuous}} dry granulation <b>process</b> <b>for</b> <b>producing</b> free flowing <b>granules</b> {{in order to}} increase the bulk density and uniformity of pharmaceutical formulations. It is a complicated process due to the diversity of powder blends and processing parameters involved. The properties of the produced ribbon are dominated by a number of factors, such as the powder properties. friction, roll speed, roll gap, feeding mechanisms and feeding speed, which consequently determine the properties of the granules (size distribution, density and flow behaviour). It is hence important to understand the influence of these factors on the ribbon properties. in this study, an instrumented roller press developed at the University of Birmingham is used to investigate the effect of lubrication on the density distribution of the ribbons. Three different cases are considered: (1) no lubrication, (2) lubricated press. in which the side cheek plates of the roller press are lubricated, and (3) lubricated powder, for which a lubricant is mixed into the powder. In addition, how the powders are fed into the entry region of the roller press and its influence on ribbon properties are also investigated. It is found that the method of feeding the powder into the roller press plays a crucial role in determining the homogeneity of the ribbon density. For the roller press used in this Study, a drag angle (i. e., the angle formed when the powder is dragged into the roller press) is introduced to characterise the powder flow pattern in the feeding hopper. It is shown that a sharper drag angle results in a more heterogeneous ribbon. In addition, the average ribbon density depends upon the peak pressure and nip angle. The higher the peak pressure and nip angle are, the higher the average ribbon density is. Furthermore, the densification behaviour of the powder during roller compaction is compared to that during die compaction. It has been shown that the densification behaviour during these two processes is similar if the ribbons and the tablets have the same thickness. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to <b>produce</b> spherical {{micron-sized}} <b>granules</b> by spray-drying. This technique requires stable and well-dispersed suspensions. The targeted application for such granules {{is the development of}} wear resistant Cr 2 O 3 nanostructured coatings by plasma projection. The work reported in this paper was performed to develop and to optimize Cr 2 O 3 nanopowders dispersion by a ball milling method <b>for</b> <b>producing</b> <b>granules.</b> Physical, structural and microstructural properties of Cr 2 O 3 nanopowders were followed by XRD analysis, helium pycnometer density, gas adsorption (BET), SEM and TEM observations. The choice of suitable dispersant was determined by zeta potential measurements. The dispersant amount has been optimized from the rheological behavior of slurries containing 30 wt. % nanopowders. Slip stabilization was investigated by sedimentation tests and zeta potential measurements. The influences of milling time, milling balls diameter and milling balls to powder ratio were studied by granulometric measurements. A well-dispersed and stable aqueous Cr 2 O 3 slip, suitable for spray-drying, was achieved...|$|R
