Secondly, this proposal suggested the development (or at least, a consideration of the potentials) of a <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> system in <b>data</b> and medical records linkage.

40|$|Walking is now {{promoted}} {{as an alternative}} transport mode to polluting cars and as a successful means to improve health and longevity. Intelligent transport systems navigation ser- vices are now directly targeting travelers due to smartphones and their embedded sensors. However, {{after a decade of}} research, no universal personal navigation system has been successfully introduced and adopted to improve personalmobility. An analysis of the underlying reasons is conducted, looking at the engineering, human, ethical, and legal challenges. First, contrary to adopting classical mechanization equations linked to solid state physics, location technologies must address complex personal dynamics using connected objects. Second, human factors are often not suf- ficiently considered while designing new technologies. The needs and abilities of travelers are not systematically addressed from a user-centered perspective. Finally, people want to benefit from location-based services without sharing personal location data to uncontrolled third bodies. Europe is a pioneer in the protection of individuals from <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> through <b>data</b> processing since location data has been recognized as personal data, but the challenges to enforce the regulation are numerous.

40|$|Background and aim. Fatigue {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} reported symptoms by cancer patients. In recent years, much effort has been directed to designing fatigue measures which are psychometrically appropriate as well as easily administered. Among these, the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS-R) is widely used in assessing fa-tigue in cancer patients and other populations. Despite its large utilization in different national contexts and with different populations, its structure appears to vary across cultures, suggesting the need for its validation before use. Themain aim of the present work was to verify the validity (i. e., dimensional structure and construct validity) and reliability (i. e., internal consistency) of an Italian translation of the PFS-R to reassure Italian oncology practitioners about its appropriate usage in practice and research.

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown that the use of {{pulmonary}} medication is widespread and often initiated without initial spirometry. Early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by spirometry in General Practice is essential for an early and correct implementation of medical treatment. Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of regular therapy following diagnostic spirometry for COPD in General Practice from February 2008 to February 2009. Method: Spirometry data and results were linked through Statistics Denmark with information from the Register of Medicinal Product Statistics using the unique <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> code. <b>Data</b> were analysed to evaluate the impact of screening on use of regular COPD therapy. Primary outcome was initiation of regular therapy following COPD diagnosis with spirometry. Results: In a population of 3, 376 individuals at risk, 1, 458 underwent spirometric assessment with 631 being diagnosed with COPD; 110 of those received regular therapy before assessment with this figure increasing to 161 after spirometry. Of 827 participants not receiving a COPD diagnosis, 36 received regular therapy prior to assessment and 42 received regular therapy after spirometry despite no established COPD diagnosis. Conclusion: There is a significant chance of receiving regular therapy after being diagnosed with COPD. However, a large proportion of subjects diagnosed with COPD did not receive regular therapy following diagnosis. Efforts should be made to ensure correct diagnosis and correct medical treatment according to guidelines in individuals with COPD...|$|R

Using a nationwide sample, the empirical analysis yields the importance of improvements in the security infrastructure and identifies areas of concern with regard to privacy and liberty controlling for travel related factors.

Our research is based on the blind signature schemes which are based on two hard problems – Integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems.

Since biological information is <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>data,</b> it should be positioned as a personal secret key for a system. In this schemes an attacker intends to reveal the private key knowing the public key, has to solve both the hard problems i. e. for the private key which is a part of the cryptographic key and the biological information incorporated in it. We have to generate a cryptographic key using biometric data which is called biometric cryptographic key and also using that key to put signature on a document. Then using the signature we have to verify the authenticity and integrity of the original message.
