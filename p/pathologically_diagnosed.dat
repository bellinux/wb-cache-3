40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} localization needles under mammographic, ultrasound or fiberoptic ductoscopy guidance for non-palpable breast lesions. Patients and Methods: Eighty-three patients undergoing needle localization and biopsy of non-palpable breast lesions under mammographic, ultrasound or fiberoptic ductoscopy guidance from June 2013 to December 2014 in Beijing Friendship Hospital {{were included in the}} study. The preoperative imaging assessment, application of localization needles, surgical operation and pathological examination were recorded and analyzed retrospectively. Results: A total of 83 localization and biopsies were carried out, of which 27 were performed under mammographic guidance, 32 under ultrasound guidance and 24 under fiberoptic ductoscopy guidance. Twenty-seven cases of breast microcalcifications were localized under mammographic guidance and surgically removed, of which eight cases were <b>pathologically</b> <b>diagnosed</b> as malignant. Thirty-two cases of non-palpable breast lesions were localized under ultrasound guidance and 30 <b>pathologically</b> <b>diagnosed,</b> of these, four cases were <b>pathologically</b> <b>diagnosed</b> as malignant. Twenty-four cases of intraductal space–occupying lesions were localized under ductoscopy guidance and surgically removed, of which five cases were <b>pathologically</b> <b>diagnosed</b> as malignant. Conclusion: Utilization of localization needles under mammographic, ultrasound or fiberoptic ductoscopy guidance for non-palpable breast lesions is a safe and effective procedure, and is helpful in the diagnosis of breast cancer. With the help of this procedure, more malignant lesions can be localized and surgically removed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Diagnosis of ductal {{carcinoma}} in situ (DCIS) {{in breast}} cancer cases is challenging for pathologist due {{to a variety of}} in situ patterns and artefacts, which could be misinterpreted as stromal invasion. Microinvasion is detected by the presence of cytologically malignant cells outside the confines of the basement membrane and myoepithelium. When malignant cells invade the stroma, there is tissue remodeling induced by perturbed stromal-epithelial interactions. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are main cells in the microenvironment of the remodeled tumor-host interface. They are characterized by the expression of the specific fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP-α), and differ from that of normal fibroblasts exhibiting an immunophenotype of CD 34. We hypothesized that staining for FAP-α may be helpful in determining whether DCIS has microinvasion. Methods 349 excised breast specimens were immunostained for smooth muscle actin SMA, CD 34, FAP-α, and Calponin. Study material was divided into 5 groups: group 1 : normal mammary tissues of healthy women after plastic surgery; group 2 : usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH); group 3 : DCIS without microinvasion on H & E stain; group 4 : DCIS with microinvasion on H & E stain (DCIS-MI), and group 5 : invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). A comparative evaluation of the four immunostains was conducted. Results Our results demonstrated that using FAP-α and Calponin adjunctively improved the sensitivity of pathological diagnosis of DCIS-MI by 11. 29 %, whereas the adjunctive use of FAP-α and Calponin improved the sensitivity of pathological diagnosis of DCIS by 13. 6 %.
