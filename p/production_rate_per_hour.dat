50|$|Stockpiles provide surge {{capacity}} to {{various parts of}} the CPP. ROM coal is delivered with large variations in <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> of tonnes <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (tph). A ROM stockpile is used to allow the washplant to be fed coal at lower, constant rate. A simple stockpile is formed by machinery dumping coal into a pile, either from dump trucks, pushed into heaps with bulldozers or from conveyor booms. More controlled stockpiles are formed using stackers to form piles along the length of a conveyor, and reclaimers to retrieve the coal when required for product loading, etc. Taller and wider stockpiles reduce the land area required to store a set tonnage of coal. Larger coal stockpiles have a reduced rate of heat loss, leading to a higher risk of spontaneous combustion.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{particle}} size and mill type used to grind corn were determined with 128 pigs (122 lb average initial body wt). Treatments were corn {{ground in a}} hammermill and a roller mill to 800 and 400 μm. The roller mill was more efficient than the hammermill when grinding the corn, with less energy consumption and greater <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> horsepower <b>hour.</b> For the 800 μm treatments, greater uniformity of particle size was achieved with the roller mill than the hammermill; however, at the 400 μm treatments, corn ground with the hammermill was slightly more uniform. Pigs fed corn ground to 400 μm had 7 % greater efficiency of gain, and had greater digestibilities of dry matter, nitrogen, and energy than pigs fed corn ground to 800 μm. Mill type did not affect growth performance, but pigs fed corn ground in the roller mill had greater digestibilities of dry matter, nitrogen, and energy and excreted 18 % less dry matter and 13 % less nitrogen as feces than pigs fed corn ground in a hammermill. There were interactions among mill type and particle size, with digestibilities much greater for the diet with corn ground to 800 μm in the roller mill compared to the hammermill, but only small advantages in nutrient digestibility for diets with corn ground to 400 μm in the roller mill. Mill type did not affect rate or efficiency of gain, but pigs fed diets with roller-milled corn had greater digestibilities of nutrients and, thus, lower excretions of nutrients in feces...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of the mechanical ventilation system in large spaces is proposed to be evaluated by macroscopic numbers describing the air flow. This includes the air changes <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> the air change <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> floor area, the momentum jet number, and the nominal time constants. To determine which number is the best choice, experimental studies in nine big waiting halls were performed. The indoor environment in the mechanical ventilated spaces can be assessed by the measured local mean air velocity, carbon dioxide level, and local age of air. Correlations of the measured mean values of local air velocity, carbon dioxide level, and local age of air with those macroscopic flow number are investigated. It is found that the relationships of the air change <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> the air change <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> floor area and the nominal time constants with the mean air speed, the mean carbon dioxide concentration, and the mean local age of air were not clear.
