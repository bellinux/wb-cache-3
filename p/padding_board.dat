40|$|The muon {{spectrometer}} of the ATLAS experiment {{makes use}} of the Resistive Plate Chambers detectors for particle tracking in the barrel region. The level- 1 muon trigger system has to measure and discriminate muon transverse momentum, perform a fast and coarse tracking of the muon candidates, associate them to the bunch crossing corresponding to the event of interest, measure the second coordinate in the non-bending projection. The on-detector electronics first collects front-end signals coming from the two inner RPC stations on the low-pT <b>PAD</b> <b>boards,</b> each one covering a region of ∆η×∆φ= 0. 2 × 0. 2, and hosting four Coincidence Matrix ASICs. Each CMA performs the low-pT trigger algorithm and data readout on a region of ∆η×∆φ= 0. 2 × 0. 1. Data coming from the four CMAs are assembled by the low-pT PAD logic. Each low-pT <b>PAD</b> <b>board</b> sends data to the corresponding high-pT <b>PAD</b> <b>boards,</b> located on the outer RPC station. Four CMA on each board {{make use of the}} low-pT trigger result and of the front-end signals coming from the outer RPC stations to perform the high-pT algorithm. The overall results are assembled by the high-pT PAD logic and sent via optical fibre to the off-detector electronics. Each optical receiver board collects data from six or seven fibres, covering a region of ∆η×∆φ= 1. 0 × 0. 1. Trigger data are sent to the local Sector Logic, which elaborates trigger data and sends them to the Muon Central Trigger Processor Interface via dedicated copper links. Readout data are sent to the Read-Out Driver...|$|R

50|$|In churches with a {{tradition}} of public kneeling prayer, pews are often equipped with kneelers {{in front of the}} seating bench so members of the congregation can kneel on them instead of the floor. These kneelers essentially have long, usually <b>padded</b> <b>boards</b> which run lengthwise parallel to the seating bench of the pew. These kneeler boards may be 15 cm or so wide and elevated perhaps 10-15 cm above the floor, but dimensions can vary widely. Permanently attached kneelers are often made so they can be rotated or otherwise moved up out of the way when the congregation members are not kneeling.|$|R
50|$|Cranial {{modification}} was {{a procedure}} that occurred when an individual was still young, usually during infancy because the cranial bones are still soft at this stage and capable of morphing. An infant would be bound between <b>padded</b> <b>boards</b> to make cause a tabular effect {{in the growth of}} the skull. Another method was to wind a band tightly around the head for an annular effect. Both of these methods produced an elongated shape of the head. This practice was seen as a desirable trait and often practiced in the upper classes; however it could be common on women in working positions because they would often carry children on their back for elongated periods of time.|$|R

40|$|A triple-gas {{electron}} multiplier (GEM) detector, operated with the gas mixture Ar/CO 2 /CF 4 (45 / 15 / 40), {{is going to}} equip station M 1, region RI of the LHCb muon system. A Module- 0 of this detector, with full area (20 cm x 24 cm) GEM foils, was recently built and tested. In this paper, new measurements of efficiency and pad multiplicity are presented. These new measurements were very important to select of the final <b>pad</b> <b>board</b> configuration. The sensitivity to discharges {{is a very important}} issue in this type of detector; we discuss here new measurements of the maximum number of discharges that a triple-GEM detector can stand before breakdown, and we show that detector operation in LHCb is safe from this point of view. We also discuss new measurements of the time performance of the detector in the presence of background radiation, indicating that no significant deterioration of the performances is expected in the LHCb environment...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{controversy}} concerning the role of serotonin (5 -hydroxy-tryptamine) in renal hemodynamics. Erspamer et at. (1952) postulated this naturally occurring substance to be a true hormone, serving to regulate renal blood flow by producing afferent arteriolar constriction of the glomerular vas-cular bed. They suggested this as the mechanism of its antidiuretic effect when large doses were employed in the rat. Sala and Castegnaro (1953) confirmed the antidiuretic action of 5 -hydroxytryptamine in dogs, but suggested that this effect was based upon its action to facilitate renal tubular reabsorption of water. Both of these hypotheses have been disputed by Corcoran et at. (1954) and Nizet et at. (1953). Since most of the renal studies with this agent have been carried out following a single parenteral dose, it seemed worthwhile to evaluate its renal hemodynamic effects making use of the more physiological method of constant intravenous infusion at various dose levels.

40|$|The {{results from}} a step-stress random {{vibration}} tests are {{used to assess the}} interconnect reliability of various solder, component terminal and printed wiring <b>board</b> <b>pad</b> finishes. The durability assessment of leadless chip resistors attached with tin-lead and tin-silver-copper is examined. Component terminal finish, tin and tin-lead, in tin-lead soldered assemblies are examined. The <b>board</b> <b>pad</b> finishes used in the assemblies tested included immersion tin, immersion silver, electroless or electrolytic nickel immersed in gold, and organic solderability preservative, while tin-lead hot air solder leveling pad finish assembled with tin-lead solder served as a baseline. Destructive failure analysis is used to assess failure locations. Although the results obtained from the test indicate that under the vibration regimen studied no significant difference was found between the durability of tin-lead and tin-silver-copper assemblies, the lead-free components did outperform the tin-lead assemblies. Pad finish is found to have a greater influence on tin-lead as compared to tin-silver-copper soldered assemblies. Immersion silver and electroless or electrolytic nickel immersed in gold showed the best durability results...|$|R

40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} {{expert panel}} {{of medical and}} surgical specialists involved {{in the management of}} patients with potential spinal cord injuries (SCI) was assembled. Four key questions were created that were of significant interest. These were: (1) what is the optimal type and duration of pre-hospital spinal immobilization in patients with acute SCI?; (2) during airway manipulation in the pre-hospital setting, what is the ideal method of spinal immobilization?; (3) what is the impact of pre-hospital transport time to definitive care on the outcomes of patients with acute spinal cord injury?; and (4) {{what is the role of}} pre-hospital care providers in cervical spine clearance and immobilization? A systematic review utilizing multiple databases was performed to determine the current evidence about the specific questions, and each article was independently reviewed and assessed by two reviewers based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

50|$|As stated earlier, {{the most}} common size of mobile {{computing}} device is pocket-sized that can be hand-held, but other sizes for mobile devices exist too. Mark Weiser, known {{as the father of}} ubiquitous computing, computing everywhere, referred to device sizes that are tab-sized, <b>pad</b> and <b>board</b> sized, where tabs are defined as accompanied or wearable centimetre-sized devices, e.g. smartphones and smart cards, and pads are defined as hand-held decimetre-sized devices, e.g., laptops and tablet computers. If one changes the form of the mobile devices in terms of being non-planar, one can also have skin devices and tiny dust-sized devices. Dust refers to miniaturised devices without direct HCI interfaces, e.g., micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), ranging from nanometres through micrometers to millimetres. See also Smart dust. Skin: fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers and organic computer devices.
