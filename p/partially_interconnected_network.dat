40|$|By {{events of}} fusion and fission {{mitochondria}} generate a <b>partially</b> <b>interconnected,</b> irregular <b>network</b> of poorly specified architecture. Here, its organization is examined theoretically by {{taking into account}} the physical association of mitochondria with microtubules. Parameters of the cytoskeleton mesh are derived from the mechanics of single fibers. The model of the mitochondrial reticulum is formulated in terms of a dynamic spatial graph. The graph dynamics is modulated by the density of microtubules and their crossings. The model reproduces the full spectrum of experimentally found mitochondrial configurations. In centrosome-organized cells, the chondriome is predicted to develop strong structural inhomogeneity between the cell center and the periphery. An integrated analysis of the cytoskeletal and the mitochondrial components reveals that the structure of the reticulum depends on the balance between anterograde and retrograde motility of mitochondria on microtubules, in addition to fission and fusion. We propose that it is the combination of the two processes that defines synergistically the mitochondrial structure, providing the cell with ample capabilities for its regulative adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{networks}} {{have been applied}} within manufacturing domains, in particular electronics industries, to address the inherent complexity, {{the large number of}} interacting process features and the lack of robust analytical models of real industrial processes. The ability of neural systems to provide nonlinear mappings between process features and desired outputs has been the major driving force behind implementations. One of the major issues limiting the widespread industrial uptake of neural systems is the lack of detailed understanding of their design, implementation and operation. In many cases, network topologies and training parameters are systematically varied until satisfactory convergence is achieved. There is little discussion of the rationale behind the adopted training methods. A review of research into the functions that can be readily represented by neural networks are presented in this paper. The application focus is the control and monitoring of a discrete manufacturing process {{that is part of the}} manufacturing cycle of mixed technology surface mount printed circuit boards. Detailed knowledge of the process operation and functionality that can be represented by simple network topologies have been combined to develop a structured, <b>partially</b> <b>interconnected</b> neural <b>network</b> that provides optimised convergence performance. A comparison of the designed solution with standard approaches to neural network implementation is given. It has been demonstrated that if there is sufficient confidence in the operation of the process, input feature interaction within the network can be constrained to produce a robust control and monitoring system...|$|R

Specific material, process, circuit, packaging, and architecture solutions to enhance these four types of <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> are proposed and quantitatively evaluated. A microchannel-cooled 3 D integrated circuit technology is developed to deal with thermal interconnect problems inherent to stacked dice. The benefits of carbon nanotube technology, improved repeater insertion techniques and parallel processing architectures for signal <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> are evaluated. A circuit technique to periodically reverse current direction in power <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> is proposed.

Methods to control power supply noise and reduce its impact on clock <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> are investigated.

SoCs have undergone rapid evolution and are still progressing at a swift pace. Due to explosive evolution of semiconductor industry, the devices are scaling down at a rapid rate and hence, the SoCs today have become communication-centric and shared bus system and crossbar system were fail to performed communication in side SoC.

A NoC based <b>interconnect</b> <b>network</b> is a well-organized and efficiently use of limited communication channel while maintaining low packet latency, high saturation throughput, high communication bandwidth amongst different IPs core with a minimum area and low power-dissipation.

In particular, in an <b>interconnected</b> homogenous <b>network,</b> detailed theoretical analysis is presented, which allows quick and accurate calculations of the global epidemic threshold. Moreover, in an <b>interconnected</b> heterogeneous <b>network</b> with inter-layer correlation between node degrees, it is found that the inter-layer correlation coefficient has little impact on the epidemic threshold, but has significant impact on the total prevalence. Simulations further verify the analytical results, showing that cooperative epidemic processes promote the spreading of diseases. Comment: 12 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
