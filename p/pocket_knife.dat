25|$|A feather duster is an {{implement}} used for cleaning. It consists typically of a wooden-dowel handle and feathers that are wound onto the handle by a wrapped wire.

Using a short broom stick and splitting the feathers with a <b>pocket</b> <b>knife,</b> the duster was found to be too stiff for use. In 1874, the Hoag Duster Company was founded, which became a pioneer of feather dusters in the U.S. state of Iowa.|$|E
25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding <b>pocket</b> <b>knife.</b> This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, Bill Shear {{and colleagues}} carried out an {{important}} study on well preserved Mid Devonian trigonotarbids from Gilboa, New York. They questioned {{whether it was}} appropriate to define a group of animals on a variable character state and carried out the first cladistic analysis of fossil and living arachnids. They showed that trigonotarbids {{are closely related to}} a group of arachnids which have gone under various names (Caulogastra, Arachnidea, etc.), but for which the name Tetrapulmonata has become most widespread. Members of the Tetrapulmonata include spiders, whip spiders, whip scorpions and Schizomida and, together with trigonotarbids, share characters like two pairs of book lungs and similar mouthparts with fangs operating rather like a <b>pocket</b> <b>knife.</b> In a 2007 study of arachnid relationships, the Shear et al. hypothesis was largely supported and a group Pantetrapulmonata was proposed which comprises Trigonotarbida + Tetrapulmonata. This has since been corroborated in more recent cladistic analyses.|$|E
