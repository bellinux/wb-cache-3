50|$|In 1991, Marks {{experimented with}} {{decorative}} <b>paint</b> <b>rollers</b> {{in conjunction with}} sculptural reliefs. The patterns created by the rollers enriched the relief′s backgrounds, adding an additional element of visual complexity. Combined with her renewed commitment to drawing, Marks executed a series of fantastical figures drawn with a brush in acrylic paint on paper, working in black at first, and then expanding into other colors. The figures were drawn on patterned backgrounds created by the decorative <b>paint</b> <b>rollers,</b> and later, on printed backgrounds created by Marks from her older printed or drawn work, or from found imagery.|$|R

50|$|Taylor {{was born}} in St. John's Wood, London. His father, Edward Ingram Taylor, was an artist, and his mother, Margaret Boole, came {{from a family of}} mathematicians (his aunt was Alicia Boole Stott and his {{grandfather}} was George Boole). As a child he was fascinated by science after attending the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, and performed experiments using <b>paint</b> <b>rollers</b> and sticky-tape. Taylor read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge.|$|R
50|$|The Rollers emblem {{has had a}} few {{alterations}} over time. Their emblem {{features a}} football boot, a football and <b>painting</b> <b>rollers,</b> {{as well as a}} mapping of early Gaborone internal roads, a reference to the team's name and its working class roots. On the bottom of the crest is their motto and nickname 'Popa Popa ea Ipopa'. The latter was added in 2010 {{on the eve of the}} team's 50-year anniversary. The crest features the blue and gold colours of the team.|$|R

50|$|RemovalThe {{most common}} and most {{effective}} method of removing the thorns from ones garden is by burning (find out about the relevant laws regarding burning of lawns in your area).

50|$|In early December 2010 Italian street artist Blu {{was painted}} a mural {{on the side}} of the museum's Geffen Contemporary Wing to {{coincide}} with the exhibition. Because the work's antiwar theme might be deemed offensive, the museum had it painted over within a day, and anonymous fellow artists avenged themselves by putting up posters of Deitch as an ayatollah holding a <b>paint</b> <b>roller.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Rauschenberg (b. 1925, Port Arthur, Texas, USA; d. 2008) became known for white, then black, and {{eventually}} red monochrome canvases. In the [...] (1951) series, Rauschenberg applied everyday house <b>paint</b> with <b>paint</b> <b>rollers</b> to achieve smooth [...] "blank" [...] surfaces. White panels were exhibited {{alone or in}} modular groupings. The Black Paintings (1951–53) incorporated texture under the painted surface by way of collaged newspaper that sometimes indicates a grid-like structure. The Red Paintings (1953–54) incorporate still more materials such as wood and fabric under the heavily worked painted surface, and seem to foreshadow Rauschenberg's development of assemblage in his [...] "Combine Paintings" [...] {{as well as his}} stated intention to act in [...] "the gap" [...] between [...] "Art" [...] and [...] "Life." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{two were}} notorious for {{painting}} their tags in sprawling block {{letters on the}} broadsides of buildings or any other surface deemed optimal. The scope of these works was remarkable: a finished COST REVS tag, done in white or yellow paint, often stretched an average of 15 feet in length and 6 in height. The act required a <b>paint</b> <b>roller,</b> the kind usually used for painting houses, and one full bucket of paint.|$|E
5000|$|However {{there are}} also various earlier {{references}} to paint rollers being used for decorating. For example in 1925 in The New Yorker [...] "After the phenomenal success of the <b>paint</b> <b>roller</b> for interiors, which {{in the last few}} years has made every man - or nearly every man - his own painter..." [...] The Oxford English Dictionary cites [...] "paint roller" [...] being used in the magazine Popular Mechanics in July 1935.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>paint</b> <b>roller</b> [...] {{typically}} {{consists of}} two parts: a [...] "roller frame," [...] and a [...] "roller cover." [...] The roller cover absorbs the paint and transfers it to the painted surface, the roller frame attaches to the roller cover. A painter holds the roller by the handle section. The roller frame is reusable. It is possible to clean and reuse a roller cover, {{but it is also}} typically disposed of after use.|$|E
50|$|Another form is the throw-up, {{also known}} as a bombing, which is {{normally}} painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A piece is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This is more time-consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. A blockbuster or roller is a large piece, almost always done in a block-shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colors, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended <b>paint</b> <b>rollers</b> and gallons of cheap exterior paint.|$|R
50|$|Pagac {{is known}} for his large scale {{rotating}} concert murals which he paints live during public events. Using house <b>paint,</b> <b>paint</b> <b>rollers</b> and large brushes, Pagac paints finished works that are as large as 60 feet wide and 14 feet tall in as little as 8 hours. The murals generally advertise upcoming shows for touring bands but the artwork is designed by Pagac. The rotating murals have depicted a wide range of musical artists including, The Avett Brothers, Sonic Youth, George Thorogood and Cypress Hill. Because the murals advertise bands and are in highly visible locations, bands and graffiti artists began using some of the rotating murals to voice their concern over SB1070 after the law was passed in 2010. Pagac won Best Mural of 2010 awards in both Tucson and Phoenix.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} each world {{except for}} world seven, Kirby must face a boss. In worlds one through six, the first time he completes them, he must face one of each boss - <b>Paint</b> <b>Roller,</b> Kracko, or King Dedede (all of whom must be battled twice). With the {{exception}} of the final boss, all bosses are mini-game based. The boss of world eight is the main villain of Kirby: Canvas Curse, Drawcia Sorceress. Drawcia starts out in her standard form. Upon defeat, she will transform into a large ball of paint with five eyes and a mouth called Drawcia Soul.|$|E
5000|$|As in Pac-Man, {{the player}} is opposed by enemies who kill on contact. The enemies {{gradually}} increase in number as the player advances from one {{level to the}} next, and their speed also increases.On odd-numbered levels, the player controls an ape (in some versions labeled [...] "Copier"), and must collect coconuts while avoiding headhunters (labeled [...] "Police" [...] and [...] "Thief"). On even-numbered levels, the player controls a <b>paint</b> <b>roller</b> (labeled [...] "Rustler"), and must paint over each spot of the board while avoiding pigs (labeled [...] "Cattle" [...] and [...] "Thief").

5000|$|Much of this {{impression}} was created in-camera, {{thanks to the}} production design for the film. Zeman's crew made and used hard rubber <b>paint</b> <b>rollers</b> to add engraving-like hatching to scenery and costumes. (In {{a review of the}} film, Pauline Kael noted that [...] "there are more stripes, more patterns on the clothing, the decor, and on the image itself than a sane person can easily imagine.") To complete the effect, Zeman and his crew composited the film with various forms of animation, including traditional, cut-out, and stop-motion varieties, along with miniature effects and matte paintings, all designed to keep the engraving style seamlessly consistent. Even stock footage clips—birds, sea waves, and other details—were adapted for the effect by printing the film with lined filters and matted-in sky backgrounds.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{evaluation}} of financial situation in the company IPC plast, s. r. o., the producer of <b>paint</b> <b>rollers</b> and its parts. The evaluation uses the methods of financial analysis {{and is based on}} the dates between the years 2010 - 2014. The theoretical part introduces the financial analysis, its users, sources of information and the methods and indicators that are applied in the practical part. The practical part consists of the company introduction and the application of methods and indicators described in theoretical part. The author of this thesis implemented horizontal and vertical analysis of the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, measure ratios and models of bankruptcy and solvency. The result approved the financial stability of the company and its ability to pay liabilities. The author of the thesis assumes that this trend will not change in future...|$|R
5000|$|These {{cleaners}} {{are independent}} from the pool's main filter and pump system and are {{powered by a}} separate electricity source, usually {{in the form of}} a set-down transformer that is kept at least 10 ft from the water in the pool, often on the pool deck. They have two internal motors: one to suck in water through a self-contained filter bag and then return the filtered water at a high rate of speed back into the pool water. The second is a drive motor that is connected to tractor-like rubber or synthetic tracks and [...] "brushes" [...] connected by rubber or plastic bands via a metal shaft. The brushes, resembling <b>paint</b> <b>rollers,</b> are located on the front and back of the machine and help remove contaminating particles from the pool's floor, walls (and in some designs even the pool steps) depending on size and configuration. They also direct the particles into the internal filter bag.|$|R
50|$|Various sources - {{many from}} Canada - {{state that the}} basic device was invented in 1940 by the Canadian Norman Breakey (born 1891- died 1965). They report that Breakey {{was never able to}} produce his {{invention}} in large enough numbers to profit from it before others made small changes to the paint roller's design and were able to market it as their own invention. One of the others was Richard Croxton Adams who held the first U.S. patent on the <b>paint</b> <b>roller.</b> He claimed to have developed it in his basement workshop in 1940 while working for the Sherwin-Williams Paint Company.|$|E
50|$|One day, {{a strange}} portal {{appears in the}} sky, and out of it comes a witch named Drawcia. Drawcia casts a spell over Dream Land, {{turning it into a}} world of paint. Upon fleeing back into the portal she came through, Kirby gives chase, {{eventually}} finding himself in Drawcia's also paint-themed world. The witch curses Kirby, turning him into a limbless ball. After Drawcia escapes, the Magical Paintbrush (Power Paintbrush in the European version) turns to the player to help Kirby. The player and Kirby set off to find and defeat Drawcia to restore Dream Land to its normal state. Along the way, Drawcia creates replicas of Kirby's oldest foes to slow him down. These include <b>Paint</b> <b>Roller,</b> Kracko, Kracko Jr., and King Dedede.|$|E
50|$|One day, after {{waking up}} from his after-lunch nap without having any dreams, Kirby goes to the Fountain of Dreams to investigate. In doing so, he discovers that King Dedede has stolen the Star Rod, {{the source of the}} fountain's power, and broken it into seven pieces, giving six {{fragments}} to his strongest allies, Whispy Woods, <b>Paint</b> <b>Roller,</b> Mr. Shine and Mr. Bright, Kracko, Heavy Mole, and Meta Knight, keeping one of the pieces for himself. Without the Star Rod, all of the inhabitants of Dream Land are becoming restless as a result of being unable to dream. Kirby decides to track down the fragments of the Star Rod and bring them back to the Fountain of Dreams in order to restore everyone's dreams.|$|E
5000|$|Murky Dismal (voiced by Peter Cullen) - The primary {{antagonist}} {{throughout most}} of the series, he is at various times under the employ of the Dark Princess and the King of Shadows. He resides in the last, lone dark area of Rainbow Land called the Pits with his clumsy sidekick, Lurky. In one episode it is revealed that, as a toddler, Murky Dismal once colored the walls of his childhood home with crayons, markers, <b>paints,</b> <b>rollers,</b> and finally an industrial airbrush. Furious, his mother demanded he remove [...] "every bit of color, if it takes all day, if it takes the rest of your life," [...] leading Murky to his hatred of color as an adult (Mom). He often invents devices to create gloom clouds, which remove color and make people feel hopeless. He is constantly trying to foil Rainbow Brite's mission by capturing Color Crystals, the Sprites, the Color Kids or Rainbow Brite's Color Belt. His full name is Murkwell Dismal, and he is both clever and incompetent as a villain. Murky is over 700 years old (Mighty Monstromurk Menace Pt. 1).|$|R
50|$|A common {{tradition}} for stencils is in home decorating and arts & crafts. Home decor stencils {{are an important}} part of the DIY (Do It Yourself) industry. There are prefabricated stencil templates available for home decoration projects from hardware stores, arts & crafts stores and through the internet. Stencils are usually applied in the home with a <b>paint</b> or <b>roller</b> brush along wall borders and as trim. They can also be applied with a painted sponge for a textured effect.|$|R
5000|$|S-Bend Race: In the Broken Hearts challenge, a {{frustrated}} Jennifer {{had asked for}} {{instructions on how to}} move the car laterally - but nevertheless got herself stuck. In this challenge, the method to do so, known as the S-bend, will be given to everyone. The contestants must use the S-bend to maneuver their car sideways towards a concrete barrier, and then back towards their starting point. Contestants will be racing against each other, and each car has <b>paint</b> <b>rollers</b> mounted so as to clearly see contact with the barriers on the three closed-off sides. Jason has the privilege of being the odd-man out, driving as Andrew demonstrates the challenge. He is also the fastest to finish at 12 minutes, and is grateful for the show staff not allowing him to give up driving during the Cool Bus challenge. Shelby, racing against Jennifer is the slowest at the challenge, having taken 30 minutes to drive off of the starting position (because he turned forward and reversed the way he came, a move that had been done many times by Shelby before - and had affectionately been given the name [...] "sawing the bow"), and another 30 minutes to finish after doing this. He also had the most paint contacts with 12, a far cry from everyone else (Jason had none, while Jennifer had only one).|$|R
