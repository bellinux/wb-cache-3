Regression equations relating the logarithm of each biomass component to the logarithm of tree basal area were fitted for stem wood, stem bark, live branches, and live needles. Treatment effects were significant only for live-needle biomass, with unfertilised trees having greater needle biomass per unit of basal area than fertilised trees. The regression equations were solved for all trees and the biomass data converted to an area basis. Total above-ground biomass increased with increasing level of applied phosphate, up to 67 kg P/ha. Application of phosphorus resulted in significant increases in all above-ground components including stem wood, stem bark, live branches, and live needles. There was no additional response to nitrogen and potassium applied in combination with phosphorus at any level up to 800 kg N/ha. A large response to <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> occurred in diameter growth, with only a minor response in height growth. This caused {{a significant increase in}} the average taper of the fertilised trees. The pronounced response in growth did not result in any significant change in wood density. The partitioning of the above-ground biomass components between crown and stem did not differ substantially between fertilised and unfertilised trees, and this appeared to be related to the lack of a response in height growth. Stem wood biomass in P. radiata stands can be determined from simple measurements of height and basal area...|$|R
40|$|This report {{marks the}} end of the first phase of a long term systems trial on phosphorus. The {{objective}} of the work was to define the minimum soil P necessary to ensure optimum production in terms of milk. If phosphorus applications are minimised, the potential damage to the environment is minimised. Three herds (21 cows each) were managed on three separate farmlets. The objective was to have each herd graze on land with it’s own soil P level. The target soil P levels required for herds 1, 2 and 3, were Indices 1, 2 and 3, respectively. At {{the end of}} this phase of the work these soil P targets were achieved. These were achieved by using no P fertiliser on treatment 1, application of maintenance P on treatment 2 (14 kg p/ha) and 28 kg P/ha on treatment 3. In the course of the four years, grass growth, silage yields, milk yields and composition, cow weights and body scores were recorded. Soil phosphorus levels changed slowly. It took between 20 and 40 kg P/ha to move Morgan’s P by one unit. Silage yields and grazing sward yields were not affected by <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatments. The P status in silage was significantly reduced in the low P treatments in three out of the four years. This resulted in lower P levels in the slurry in the low P treatments. In the fourth year P status in the grazing swards was consistently reduced in the low P treatment. Milk yields and composition were not influenced by P treatment. There was some evidence that cow weight and body score of cows were adversely effected in the low P treatments towards the end of the trial. In the next phase of the work, phosphorus will be applied to all three treatments at similar rates, i. e. maintenance dressings of P will be applied to cows grazing on soils with Indices 1, 2 and 3, respectively. It is concluded at the end of this phase that there may be some scope for modifications to the index system as is currently recommended by Teagasc. It will be in 2001 before the extent of changes that can be made will be quantified and implemented. End of Project ReportEuropean Union Structural Funding (EAGGF...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with some economic aspects {{of the use of}} artificial nitrogen fertilisers in New Zealand agriculture. With the prospect of much cheaper nitrogen fertiliser in the future (and possibly more expensive <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser),</b> some agriculturalists looking well to the future have suggested that New Zealand should and will move progressively towards systems of farming which are much more dependent than at present on nitrogenous fertilisers. The most comprehensively argued approach comes from Dr K. J. Mitchell, Director of the Plant Physiology Division of the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In a number of recent papers [14, 15] he has argued that fertiliser nitrogen should be progressively substituted for clover as a source of nitrogen in New Zealand agriculture. Also, this should be coupled with a change in farming systems away from conventional clover based pasture towards continuous cropping and storage of maize and annual winter ryegrass. Though we propose in the paper to touch on some of the wider aspects of nitrogen use, our attention will be concentrated mainly on Dr Mitchell's suggested system which is important enough to justify a preliminary economic appraisal. In subjecting Dr Mitchell's proposals to a critical economic appraisal, we are not indulging in the negative criticism that is so often implied when criteria of profit and loss are applied to a new and important idea. Indeed, we started out with the contrary hope, namely that we would find increased profits or reduction in costs in the suggested new approach. At the least we felt that an economic appraisal of this sort would lay bare just where the economic advantages and disadvantages of the nitrogen storage system lay by comparison with conventional systems of producing livestock fodder. Also, in what directions further technical research should proceed if the maximum cost reductions or profit increases were to be achieved. In tackling this subject we have laboured under two major disadvantages. The first concerns the fact that there does not exist a great volume of research data relating to the agronomy of nitrogen fertiliser in New Zealand, especially in relation to grassland. Thus we have had to fall back in many cases on the opinions and guesses of agricultural scientists with whom we have discussed the matter. The second problem is that there is very little data available on costs of production of conventional pasture and, imperfect as our methods are, we found it necessary to tackle this question first, in order to provide a bench mark against which to compare the production costs of the new technology. We proceed as follows: In Section II we discuss the economics of conventional clover based pasture production. This is followed in Section III by a brief description and case study of a Mitchell type farm, and in Section IV by an economic appraisal of both this and other types of farms. In Section V the original budgets are recalculated to give return to land rather than the conventional return to capital. Some general criticisms are given in Section VI, followed in Section VII with a discussion of costs of feed conservation and storage of alternatives. Some alternative nitrogen using approaches are canvassed in. Section VIII before the whole matter is summed up in the concluding Section IX...|$|R
40|$|Samples of Porites coral {{were removed}} from seven {{different}} reefs (No Name, Hastings, Upolu, Thetford, Batt, Green Island and Brook Islands Reefs), including two from the same reef (Green Island Reef), within Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Chemical and morphological data retrieved from these samples were used to investigate historical change in water quality surrounding the growing corals, particularly as this related to {{the increased use of}} <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> on the nearby mainland. The study focused on a narrow section of the continental shelf adjacent to the mouth of the Barron River. In this area coral reefs are close to a mainland significantly altered for anthropogenic purposes. No Name Reef (approximately 300 km north of the study area and reasonably distant from known anthropogenic input) was included as a control. The Brook Islands Reef (approximately 300 km south of the study area) was added for geographic variability. Support data was gained by a two year nutrient monitoring programme of the Barron and Mossman River catchments, and marine waters adjacent to these two river systems. Additional information was acquired by the experimental supplementation of Acropora formosa corals with 2. 0 μM, 4. 0 μM and 8. 0 μM PO₄. Stream phosphate levels responded rapidly to rainfall. During the April 1989 flood period between 710 and 2, 850 tonnes of Superphosphate were delivered into the ocean. Estimates vary according to the presumed ratio of soluble to particulate phosphate in the flood plume (e. g. see Cosser 1987 and Brodie & Mitchell 1992). The lower figure is nearly half the total industry estimated fertiliser usage (1810 tonnes) for the Far Northern Statistical Division during 1988. The greater figure is more than a third higher than Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for the same period (Pulsford 1990). The marine monitoring program suggested that nutrient monitoring was an insufficient method of estimating water quality. The phosphate supplementation experiment showed that elevated levels of phosphate hindered calcium carbonate production with considerable alteration to the internal and external morphology of the coral skeleton. Chemical analysis of the Porites samples suggested that intra-reefal variation in the coral skeleton was minor, but with sufficient inconsistencies in the annual record to suggest that localised, micro-environmental conditions exist and should be recognised when attempting to reconstruct environmental records from the coral skeleton. Statistically, the inner- and inner/mid-shelf sample sets were significantly different from each other and from all other sample sets. No significant statistical difference could be distinguished in the mid- to outer-shelf sample sets, but the relative contribution of each element differed for each of these sample sets. The difference between the samples from nearer to shore and those from the outershelf was also apparent in the reconstructed coral inferred environmental record. Strontium-based sea-surface temperature estimates provided an adequate record of historical sea surface temperatures from the mid- to outer-shelf samples (No Name, Hastings, Upolu and Thetford Reefs), but were unreliable for the closer to shore samples (Batt, Green Island and Brook Island Reefs). Similar inconsistencies were noted in associations with climatic variables. Data from the outer-shelf No Name Reef sample correlated with climatic data associated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) while data from the Green Island Reef sample correlated with Mean Sea Level Pressure read at Darwin. These inconsistencies were inherent in the coral-inferred record and were not associated with anthropogenic influence. However, ambiguities in the chemical composition and morphological structure of the Green Island sample were noted post- 1950. These inconsistencies were statistically correlated to the use of fertiliser on the nearby mainland. Changes to the internal porosity of the coral skeleton were similar to those noted in the experimental phosphate supplementation programme. The study concludes that chemical and morphological variations in the skeleton of the massive Porites coral are suitable for hindcasting paleoenvironmental conditions laid down in the skeleton at the time of precipitation. The study further concludes that there is significant evidence of anthropogenic influence in the Green Island sample, and that this influence is related to the use of fertilisers on the nearby mainland...|$|R
40|$|Pakistan has {{a history}} of subsidising {{agricultural}} inputs. Although none of the agricultural inputs were subsidised during the early 1950 s, the process was initiated {{in the second half of}} the decade by subsidising chemical fertilisers in order to popularise their use [Niaz (1984) ]. The list of subsidised inputs and the rate structure of the subsidies were expanded considerably throughout the Sixties. Towards the end of the Sixties, it was noted that almost all the agricultural inputs including fertilisers, insecticides, seeds, irrigation water, tubewell installations, and the operation and purchase of tractors and tractor-related equipment were subsidised in one form or another [Aresvik (1967) and Kuhnen (1989) ]. In the 1970 s, some curtailment of subsidies occurred as a result of input price increases which followed the worldwide recession, a major oil shock, the credit crunch, the war with India, and the consequent steep devaluation of Pakistani Rupee [Chaudhry (1982) ]. Although the subsidies had survived the onslaught of the Seventies and tended to persist on most inputs, the government became totally committed to their removal beginning with the 1980 s, under pressures from the IMF and the World Bank [Government of Pakistan (1980) ]. As a consequence, there was a total withdrawal of subsidy from seeds, insecticides, tubewells, and tractors. A phased-out withdrawal of fertiliser subsidy, culminating in 1984 - 85 in the case of nitrogenous fertilisers and in 1989 - 90 in the case of <b>phosphatic</b> and potash <b>fertilisers,</b> was also to be undertaken [World Bank (1986) ]. The purpose of the present paper is to highlight the progress of withdrawal of input subsidies in Pakistan, to study the nature of the input subsidies and possibly analyse the impact of the withdrawal of subsidies on the farm sector. Needless to add that the study is also intended to make policy recommendations on the various aspects of subsidy withdrawal. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Cadmium is a {{toxic metal}} for living organisms and an {{environmental}} contaminant. Agricultural soils {{in many parts}} of the world are slightly to moderately contaminated by Cd due to long term use of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> sewage sludge application as well as smelter dust spreading. Cd phytoextraction is a promising and environmentally friendly approach for soil decontamination. Plant potential for Cd extraction generally depends on shoot Cd concentration and shoot biomass yield. Some ecotypes of the metal hyperaccumulator species Thlaspi caerulescens J. & C. Presl possess an extraordinary Cd accumulation and tolerance, but have low biomass yield. Some fast growing trees (Salix, Populus) and high biomass producing crops (Brassica, Helianthus, Nicotiana) are also considered as suitable species for phytoextraction as they might compensate lower Cd accumulation with much higher biomass yields. Moreover, they deliver “production ” which eventually can be utilised, making the phytoextraction process more feasible from economical point of view. At present, plant potential for Cd phytoextraction is limited by: (1) low biomass yield and some undesirable characteristics of Thlaspi caerulescens, (2) low shoot Cd concentration and ability to withstand Cd of biomass plans, (3) economical factor. There are two general approaches for further development of Cd phytoextraction: genetic transformations to improve plant factor and agronomy-related optimisations in many different as...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2001 CSIROFluoride (F) is an {{impurity}} in <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> {{and significant}} amounts of F {{will be added to}} soils with long-term application of phosphatic fertiliser to soil. There is a risk that F concentrations in soil may increase to levels toxic to plants or grazing animals. If F added to soil remains in the upper soil profile, due to high reactivity with soil, grazing animals could increase their intake of F through inadvertent ingestion of F-enriched soil. This study determined the distribution of F in the soil profile of medium (> 8 years) and long-term permanent pastures (> 50 years) where F had been applied as an impurity in phosphatic fertiliser, and assessed the potential bioavailability of fertiliser F in soil. Long-term application of superphosphate was linked to increased concentrations of the more soluble fraction of F in soil. The more soluble F fraction in the soil surface led to increased F concentrations in herbage (from 11 to 22 mg F/kg). Fluoride concentrations in herbage were not high enough to be toxic to plants or grazing animals. Fluoride applied as an impurity in phosphatic fertiliser was generally found to accumulate in the upper soil profile (0 – 6 cm depth). Such increases could also increase F ingestion by ruminants through incidental soil ingestion while grazing. The risk of fluorosis to grazing animals is low at present, but with continued application of fertiliser to soil containing high concentrations of F, and depending on the bioavailability of fertiliser-derived F in soil, we estimate that fluorosis may become an issue in the next 25 – 50 years in highly fertilised pasture soils.

40|$|The {{drylands}} of semi-arid and arid {{areas of}} subtropical regions. {{contribute significantly to}} the world's food production, particularly of coarse grains, cereals, pulses, and oilseed. Although present yields of these crops are low, they have excellent production potential in dryland conditions. In the seventies, a number of concepts and techniques have been developed that can substantially improve the productivity {{of many of these}} drylands. But they have yet to be exploited extensively and intensively. There are good indications that the new farming practices can bring about a breakthrough in production in deep Vertisols, which occupy many million hectares in India. An analysis of constraints to productivity and production in drylands shows that, besides environmental and socio-economic constraints, technological constraints also seriously limit productivity in many of these areas. Water is a limiting factor in drylands and provision of water for only "lifesaving" irrigation (i. e [...] the minimum to prevent total crop loss) can stimulate a favourable chain reaction. However, even without irrigation, appropriate biological technology coupled with fertilisers can enhance productivity manifold. Fertiliser-responsive genotypes with higher yield potential and stability against yield reducers are becoming a catalyst of change in drylands. Such genotypes are available in the case of sorghum, millet, and maize, but not yet for pulses and oilseeds. Dryland farmers are becoming interested in the use of fertilisers' for dry-farm crops, but their first preference is for high-value, market-oriented crops, high-yielding cereals and for lands with better moisture-storage capacity capable of giving stable yields and assured returns. The unirrigated lands of the semi-arid tropics (SAT) in India are at present given less than 18 kg of NPK per hectare, while irrigated fields in the same area receive about 58 kg per hectare annually. It is concluded that the rate of growth of fertiliser use in both these situations is commensurate with the technology and the infrastructure but there is considerable scope for increase. This suggests a need for intensive research on the loss and efficiency of notrogenous and <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> under dryland conditions and the development of implements for seeding and fertiliser application at proper depth in relation to soil moisture. To avoid shortfalls in production of coarse grains, pulses, and oil seeds and to substantially increase their productivity, intensified support for research and development of dryland agriculture is needed. Investment in dryland agriculture should be considered a cast of social justice and equity to prevent an increasing gap between the disadvantaged populations of these poor areas {{and the rest of the}} world...|$|E
