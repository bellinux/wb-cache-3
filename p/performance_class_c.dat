40|$|<b>Class</b> <b>C</b> power {{amplifiers}} offer {{higher efficiency than}} class B {{power amplifiers}}, but suffer from poor linearity. A feedback based biasing system to improve the linearity of a <b>class</b> <b>C</b> power amplifier is designed. A class B amplifier with a gain of 20 dB and 20 MHz bandwidth at 900 MHz acts as the launching point for the design. The biasing and output network of the class B power amplifier is modified to produce a <b>class</b> <b>C</b> amplifier at conduction angles of 180 °, 162 °, 126 °, 90 °, and 54 °. A feedback based biasing system, which uses two matched and scaled down transistors, compares the DC current of a class B and a <b>class</b> <b>C</b> biased transistor. This comparison is used to control the biasing voltage of the amplifier. The <b>performance</b> for each <b>class</b> <b>C</b> amplifier is simulated with the proposed constant conduction angle biasing (CCAB) system. The conduction angle, transducer gain, operational gain, VSWR, and drain efficiency are measured from simulation {{for each of the}} 5 normally biased and 5 CCAB amplifiers. Dynamic ranges of over 8 dB are demonstrated for the CCAB amplifiers. The effects of loop gain, temperature, and operating frequency for the 126 ° amplifier are simulated. The 3 rd order intermodulation products of a 10 MHz AM modulated 900 MHz signal are compared for the 126 ° normally biased and CCAB biased amplifier as well as the class B amplifier. The difference between the fundamental and the 3 rd order intermodulation products is shown to improve from 9. 9 dB for the normal <b>class</b> <b>C</b> to 28. 7 dB for the CCAB amplifier...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} study was undertaken {{to investigate the}} <b>performance</b> of <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> fly ash-stabilized aggregate bases. Two commonly used aggregates in Oklahoma: (1) Meridian, a limestone aggregate, and (2) Hanson, a rhyolite aggregate, were utilized in this study. Cylindrical specimens were compacted and cured for 1 hour, 3, 28, and 90 days prior to unconfined compressive strength (UCS), X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy tests. Results show that the UCS of both stabilized aggregates increases with curing time. The Meridian specimens have higher UCS than the corresponding Hanson specimens. The reference intensity ratio (RIR) method was employed to identify and quantify the mass percent of minerals and cementitious compounds in the mixtures. Results show the formation of cementitious compounds such as ettringite, gismondine, straetlingite, and tobermorite, among others, which are responsible for increased UCS. In this study, {{the sum of all}} the cementitious compounds (SCC) showed the same qualitatively trend as the UCS trend with curing time. Finally, the UCS values correlate fairly well with the SCC, and, the SEM micrographs show the same trend as the XRD where the intensity of crystal formation is lower in the Hanson specimens than the Meridian...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{in civil}} engineering, high {{performance}} concrete i. e. concretes whose minimum compression strength is equal {{or more than}} 65 MPa are increasingly used. Side effect of it is need for determination of their construction strength. In particular, recently built high performance structures suffer from sampling of drill cores. Therefore, noninvasive impact hammers – to be specific Schmitt impact hammer – were used for determination of structural concrete strength. However, efficiency of calibration correlation using impact hammer volume indicated in standards (e. g. EN 137914, CSN 731373) or by impact hammer manufacturers is disputable since these correlations were developed at the time such concretes were uncommon. This paper indicated calibration correlations as elaborated for high <b>performance</b> concretes <b>class</b> <b>C</b> 55 / 67 to C 80 / 95; 2 to 60 days old, for Schmidt impact hammer type N & L. Calibration correlations generated feature high degree of correlation and practical utility. Moreover, these calibration correlations here are compared with correlations given for concrete strength calculation as stated by technical standards, and impact hammer manufacturer; this implies that these correlations indicated in EN 13791, CSN 731373 and declared by impact hammer manufacturer are inapplicable for determination of hig...|$|R
