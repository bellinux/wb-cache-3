40|$|Abstract The {{dissolution}} kinetics of <b>pandermite</b> and hydroboracite, {{present in}} an Iranian borate ore, in sulfuric acid has been comparatively studied. The effect of particle size, temperature, and acid concentration on their dissolution rate was investigated. Dissolution rates of both minerals increased {{by reducing the}} particle size and by raising the temperature. Although, {{an increase in the}} acid concentration from 0. 5 to 1 N accompanied an increase in the dissolution rate, the concentration beyond 1 N did not produce any significant change. The dissolution of hydroboracite occurred appreciably faster than <b>pandermite,</b> which was attributed to its lower calcium content. This could be due to the formation of a product layer namely, CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O, acting as a diffusion barrier, which in the case of hydroboracite was less effective. The rate data obtained was in agreement with a kinetic model proposed for diffusion- controlled heterogeneous reactions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Turkey has {{the largest}} borate {{reserves}} {{in the world and}} Argentina is in third place. Both countries have calcium and sodium borate deposits where colemanite, ulexite and borax are the principal minerals. We present here a comparison of the main borate deposits interlayered in continental Miocene volcaniclastic rocks of the Anatolian plateau (Turkey) and those of the Puna high plateau (Argentina). The main borate deposits of Turkey are at Emet, Bigadiç, Kestelek and K›rka. Emet is {{in the western part of}} the Kütahya province. In Emet, a sedimentary lacustrine sequence rich in tuffaceous materials hosts the colemanite section. There are limestones and marl layers at the base and top of the borate section. Arsenic minerals (realgar and orpiment) are very abundant and spatially related to the borates, indicating a common genetic origin. The principal borate mineral is colemanite with minor ulexite, hydroboracite, meyerhofferite, and rarer species such as veatchite-A, tunellite, teruggite and cahnite. Colemanite occurs as nodules of different sizes, agglomerated in thick beds. Bigadiç has borates interbedded with tuffs, clay and limestone layers. The borate minerals are formed in two distinct zones, lower and upper, separated by thick tuff beds. Colemanite and ulexite predominate in both borate zones. Other borates include howlite, probertite and hydroboracite in the lower zone, and inyoite, meyerhofferite, <b>pandermite</b> (priceite), terschite, hydroboracite, howlite, tunellite and rivadavite in the upper borate zone...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. - In the Bigadiç volcano-sedimentary basin, Palaeozoic-Mesozoic {{basement}} {{rocks are}} overlain unconformably by the Miocene rock units. The straligraphic sequence of Miocene units, {{from the bottom}} to the top in ascending order is, basement volcanic unit, basement limestone unit, lower tuff unit, lower borate bearing unit, upper tuff unit, upper borate bearing unit, and basalt unit. Miocene units are over-lain unconformably by the recent sediments, and alluvium rests unconformably on the recent sediments. In the region, Palaeozoic and Meso-zoic basement rocks were subjected to block faulting and dislocation during the pre-Miocene. As {{a result of these}} movements, large and small sized several playa lake type sedimentation basins were formed, and Miocene sediments were deposited in these basins. In the study area, the general strike of the fold axis is NE-SW. Beds generally dip towards MW or SE with 5 °- 35 °. Borate deposits occur as two different horizons in the upper and lower borate bearing units, which are separated from each other by the upper tuff unit. In the region, the lower and upper borate zones show thickness varying between 35 - 130 meters and 20 - 110 meters, respectively. Boron ores are alternated with clay-stone, mudstone, tuff and thin-bedded limestone, and generally exhibit lenticular structures. Colemanite and ulexite are the dominant ore minerals in both of the ore zones. In addition to these, other boron minerals such as <b>pandermite,</b> probertite, howlite, tunellite, meyerhoffente, hydroboracite and inyoite have also been determined in the basin. Colemanite in the lower and upper borate zones have possibly precipitated directly from the solutions contemporaneous with sedimentation, within the unconsolidated sediments under the sediment/water interface. Nodules continued to develop, parallel to the compaction of sediments. Formation of ulexite resembles that of colemanite and it reflects the period when Na-concentration of the solution has increased...|$|E
