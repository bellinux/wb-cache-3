2500|$|The {{formation}} of a bivalent occurs during the first division of meiosis (in the pachynema stage of meiotic prophase 1). In most organisms, each replicated chromosome (composed of two identical sister chromatids) elicits {{formation of}} DNA double-strand breaks during the leptotene phase. These breaks are repaired by homologous recombination, that uses the homologous chromosome as a template for repair. The search for the homologous target, helped by numerous proteins collectively referred as the synaptonemal complex, cause the two homologs to pair, between the leptotene and the <b>pachytene</b> phases of meiosis I. Resolution of the DNA recombination intermediate into a crossover exchanges DNA segments between the two homologous chromosomes at a site called a [...] This physical strand exchange and the cohesion between the sister chromatids along each chromosome ensure robust pairing of the homologs in diplotene phase.

[...] FANCD2 mutant mice exhibit chromosome mis-pairing during the <b>pachytene</b> stage of meiosis and germ cell loss.

The rachis is filled with cytoplasm.|$|E
50|$|Chromomeres are {{organized}} in a discontinuous linear pattern along the condensed chromosomes (<b>pachytene</b> chromosomes) during the prophase stage of meiosis. The linear pattern of chromomeres {{is linked to}} the arrangement of genes along the chromosome. Chromomeres contain genes and sometimes clusters of genes within their structure. Aggregates of chromomeres are known as chromonemata.|$|E
5000|$|The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) {{stage of}} meiosis {{actively}} repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair was not {{detected in the}} pre-dictyate (leptotene, zygotene and <b>pachytene)</b> stages of meiosis. [...] The long period of meiotic arrest at the four chromatid dictyate stage of meiosis may facilitate recombinational repair of DNA damages.|$|E
50|$|Chromosomal {{crossover}} involves recombination {{between the}} paired chromosomes inherited {{from each of}} one's parents, generally occurring during meiosis. During prophase I (<b>pachytene</b> stage) the four available chromatids are in tight formation with one another. While in this formation, homologous sites on two chromatids can closely pair with one another, and may exchange genetic information.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} that {{heterozygous}} chromosomal rearrangements lead to spermatogenic disturbance or failure; however the molecular mechanisms that cause this are not as well known. It is suggested that a passive mechanism involving asynaptic region clustering in spermatocytes is a possible cause. Asynaptic regions are associated with BRCA1, kinase ATR and γH2AX presence in <b>pachytene</b> spermatocytes.|$|E
5000|$|BRD7 {{protein is}} a {{transcription}} regulator that is normally highly {{expressed in the}} testis, particularly in meiotic <b>pachytene</b> and diplotene spermatocytes and in round spermatids. However, in the testes of patients exhibiting spermatogenesis arrest and azoospermia, BRD7 protein expression is observed to be absent or reduced. [...] Homozygous knockout mice BRD7(-/-) are infertile and have increased DNA damage and apoptosis in their germline.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, {{infertility}} {{is one of}} {{the characteristics}} of individuals with mutational defects in the FANC genes. [...] In mice, spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, and spermatocytes in the meiotic stages of leptotene, zygotene and early <b>pachytene</b> are enriched for FANC proteins. [...] This finding suggests that recombinational repair processes mediated by the FANC proteins are active during germ cell development, particularly during meiosis, and that defects in this activity can lead to infertility.|$|E
50|$|Chromosomal {{crossover}} (or crossing over) is {{the exchange}} of genetic material between homologous chromosomes that results in recombinant chromosomes during sexual reproduction. It {{is one of the}} final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs in the <b>pachytene</b> stage of prophase I of meiosis during a process called synapsis. Synapsis begins before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophase I. Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome.|$|E
5000|$|The him-14 gene of {{the worm}} Caenorhabditis elegans encodes an {{ortholog}} of MSH4. [...] Formation of crossovers during C. elegans meiosis requires the him-14(MSH4) gene. Loss of him-14(MSH-4) function severely reduces crossing over, resulting {{in lack of}} chiasmata between homologs and consequent missegregation. Thus, in C. elegans, segregation apparently does depend on crossovers between homologous pairs. Him-14(MSH4) functions during the <b>pachytene</b> stage of meiosis, indicating {{that it is not}} needed for establishing the preceding stages of pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Meiosis I of ootidogenesis begins during {{embryonic}} development, but halts in the {{diplotene stage}} of prophase I until puberty. The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) stage actively repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair is not detectable in the pre-dictyate (leptotene, zygotene and <b>pachytene)</b> stages of meiosis. For those primary oocytes {{that continue to}} develop in each menstrual cycle, however, synapsis occurs and tetrads form, enabling chromosomal crossover to occur. As a result of meiosis I, the primary oocyte has now developed into the secondary oocyte and the first polar body.|$|E
5000|$|Expression of this protein {{has been}} found in peritubular myoid cells, gonocytes, <b>pachytene</b> spermatocytes, spermatogonia, myoid cells, and Sertoli cells.Mouse brains have shown {{expression}} in various areas of the brain including the pituitary gland, the prefrontal coretx, the frontal lobe, the cerebellum, and the pariatal lobe. Highest expression levels have been found in the testes, the next highest levels being found in the trachea. A protein abundance histogram, which compares the abundance of a desired protein to other proteins, shows that SPATS1 is on the lower level of expression.|$|E
5000|$|In spermatocytes, the FANCA {{protein is}} ordinarily present {{at a high}} level during the <b>pachytene</b> stage of meiosis. [...] This is the stage when {{chromosomes}} are fully synapsed, and Holliday junctions are formed and then resolved into recombinants. FANCA mutant males exhibit an increased frequency of mispaired meiotic chromosomes, implying a role for FANCA in meiotic recombination. Also apoptosis is increased in the mutant germ cells. The Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway appears to {{play a key role in}} meiotic recombination and the maintenance of reproductive germ cells.|$|E
5000|$|When each tetrad, {{which is}} {{composed}} of two pairs of sister chromatids, begins to split, the only points of contact are at the chiasmata. The chiasmata become visible during the diplotene stage of prophase I of meiosis, but the actual [...] "crossing-overs" [...] of genetic material are thought to occur during the previous <b>pachytene</b> stage. Sister chromatids also form chiasmata between each other (also known as a chi structure), but because their genetic material is identical, it does not cause any noticeable change in the resulting daughter cells.|$|E
5000|$|Spermatocytes {{regularly}} overcome double-strand {{breaks and}} other DNA damages in the prophase stage of meiosis. These damages can arise by the programmed activity of Spo11, an enzyme employed in meiotic recombination, {{as well as}} by un-programmed breakages in DNA, such as those caused by oxidative free radicals produced as products of normal metabolism. These damages are repaired by homologous recombination pathways and utilize RAD1 and γH2AX, which recognize double strand breaks and modify chromatin, respectively. As a result, double strand breaks in meiotic cells, unlike mitotic cells, do not typically lead to apoptosis, or cell death.Homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of double-strand breaks occurs in mice during sequential stages of spermatogenesis but is most prominent in spermatocytes. [...] In spermatocytes, HRR events occur mainly in the <b>pachytene</b> stage of meiosis and the gene conversion type of HRR is predominant, whereas in other stages of spermatogenesis the reciprocal exchange type of HRR is more frequent. [...] During mouse spermatogenesis, the mutation frequencies of cells at the different stages, including <b>pachytene</b> spermatocytes, are 5 to 10-fold lower than the mutation frequencies in somatic cells. Because of their elevated DNA repair capability, spermatocytes likely {{play a central role in}} the maintenance of these lower mutation rates, and thus in the preservation of the genetic integrity of the male germ line.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to BRCA1, the MCM8-MCM9 protein complex {{also plays a}} crucial role in the recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks. [...] In humans, an MCM8 mutation can give rise to premature ovarian failure, as well as chromosomal instability. [...] MCM9, as well as MCM8, mutations are also associated with ovarian failure and chromosomal instability. [...] The MCM8-MCM9 complex is likely required for the homologous recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks that are present during the <b>pachytene</b> stage of meiosis I. In women homozygous for MCM8 or MCM9 mutations, failure to repair breaks apparently leads to oocyte death and small or absent ovaries.|$|E
50|$|Chromomeres display {{different}} {{properties and}} behaviours when associated with lampbrush chromosomes. Although found {{all across the}} lampbrush chromosome, they are not organized in a clear pattern along {{as they are in}} normal <b>pachytene</b> chromosomes of meiosis. The two sister chromatids of a lampbrush chromosome separate fully, forming lateral loops that extend from chromomeres, and act as transcription complexes. The lateral loops are areas where the chromosomes are transcriptionally active. The loops define where the chromomere will be positioned. The chromomere is an organization of regions of non-transcribed chromatin. These regions of chromatin that have not been transcribed are located at the ends of the loops that were formed by the sister chromatids of a lampbrush chromosome. Each chromomere can have up to several pairs of loops from lampbrush chromosomes originating from it, as well as micro-loops that cannot be detected with a light microscope.|$|E

Resolution of the DNA recombination intermediate into a crossover exchanges DNA segments between the two homologous chromosomes at a site called chiasma (or chiasmata). This physical strand exchange and the cohesion between the sister chromatids along each chromosome ensure robust pairing of the homologs in Diplotene phase. The structure, visible by microscopy, is called a bivalent.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pachytene</b> (pronounced [...] ) stage, {{also known}} as pachynema, from Greek words meaning [...] "thick threads",. At this point a tetrad of the {{chromosomes}} has formed known as a bivalent. This is the stage when homologous recombination, including chromosomal crossover (crossing over), occurs. Nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes may exchange segments over regions of homology. Sex chromosomes, however, are not wholly identical, and only exchange information over a small region of homology. At the sites where exchange happens, chiasmata form. The exchange of information between the non-sister chromatids results in a recombination of information; each chromosome has the complete set of information it had before, {{and there are no}} gaps formed {{as a result of the}} process. Because the chromosomes cannot be distinguished in the synaptonemal complex, the actual act of crossing over is not perceivable through the microscope, and chiasmata are not visible until the next stage.|$|E
50|$|In {{prophase}} I of meiosis I, each chromosome is {{aligned with}} its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome {{consists of two}} identical chromatids connected by a common centromere. During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other. This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths. Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase. Genetic crossing over occurs during the <b>pachytene</b> stage of prophase I. In this process, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes’ lengths. Structures called chiasmata are {{the site of the}} exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis. At the diplotene stage of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the homologous chromosomes to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.|$|E
5000|$|Much of {{the initial}} work came from Pointud et al. [...] They found that Taf7l has dual {{functionality}} during spermatogenesis. In early stage spermatocytes, for example in primary spermatocytes (still diploid at this point), TAF7l {{is located in the}} cytoplasm, while TATA-binding protein (TBP) complex is located in the nucleus. Then, TAF7l slowly transitions to the nucleus during the mid-stage <b>pachytene</b> cell, where there is also a dramatic increase in TBP protein expression in the nucleus as well. Additionally, there is a reciprocal relationship to that of TAF7 expression: Unlike TAF7l, TAF7 at early stages is expressed in the nucleus, and thus separated from TAF7l. Then, at later stages, when TAF7l transitions into the nucleus, which happens around the time when the somatic (diploid) to germ cell (haploid) transition occurs, TAF7 dramatically declines. This may indicate that TAF7l {{plays an important role in}} regulating the TFIID during development of the sperm. Pointud et al. (2003) speculate that TAF7l may [...] "bookmark" [...] certain genes for expression or repression in the haploid spermatocyte.|$|E
50|$|The biogenesis of piRNAs is not {{yet fully}} understood, {{although}} possible mechanisms have been proposed. piRNAs show a significant strand bias, that is, they are derived from one strand of DNA only, and this may indicate {{that they are the}} product of long single stranded precursor molecules. A primary processing pathway is suggested to be the only pathway used to produce <b>pachytene</b> piRNAs; in this mechanism, piRNA precursors are transcribed resulting in piRNAs with a tendency to target 5’ uridines. Also proposed is a ‘Ping Pong’ mechanism wherein primary piRNAs recognise their complementary targets and cause the recruitment of piwi proteins. This results in the cleavage of the transcript at a point ten nucleotides from the 5’ end of the primary piRNA, producing the secondary piRNA. These secondary piRNAs are targeted toward sequences that possess an adenine at the tenth position. Since the piRNA involved in the ping pong cycle directs its attacks on transposon transcripts, the ping pong cycle acts only at the level of transcription. One or both of these mechanisms may be acting in different species; C. elegans, for instance, does have piRNAs, but does not appear to use the ping pong mechanism at all.|$|E
5000|$|That mating in N. crassa {{can only}} occur between strains of {{different}} mating type {{suggests that some}} degree of outcrossing is favored by natural selection. In haploid multicellular fungi, such as N. crassa, meiosis occurring in the brief diploid stage {{is one of their}} most complex processes. The haploid multicellular vegetative stage, although physically much larger than the diploid stage, characteristically has a simple modular construction with little differentiation. In N. crassa, recessive mutations affecting the diploid stage of the life cycle are quite frequent in natural populations. [...] These mutations, when homozygous in the diploid stage, often cause spores to have maturation defects or to produce barren fruiting bodies with few ascospores (sexual spores). The majority of these homozygous mutations cause abnormal meiosis (e.g. disturbed chromosome pairing or disturbed <b>pachytene</b> or diplotene). [...] The number of genes affecting the diploid stage was estimated to be at least 435 (about 4% {{of the total number of}} 9,730 genes). Thus, outcrossing, promoted by the necessity for union of opposite mating types, likely provides the benefit of masking recessive mutations that would otherwise be deleterious to sexual spore formation (see Complementation (genetics)).|$|E

Among the histones of the <b>pachytene</b> nucleus, histone subtypes H 2 A, H 1 and H 3 were poly(ADP-ribosyl) ated. Based on the immunoaffinity fractionation procedure of Malik, Miwa, Sugimara & Smulson [(1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Approx. 2. 5 % of the <b>pachytene</b> chromatin represented the PAC domains. A significant amount of [alpha- 32 P]dATP-labelled <b>pachytene</b> chromatin (labelled in vitro) was bound to the affinity matrix. The DNA of <b>pachytene</b> PAC domains had internal strand breaks, significant length of gaps and ligatable ends, namely 5 '-phosphoryl and 3 '-hydroxyl termini. On the other hand, the PAC domains from 18 h regenerating liver had very few gaps, if any. The presence of gaps in the <b>pachytene</b> PAC DNA was also evident from thermal denaturation studies. Although many of the polypeptides were common to the PAC domains of both <b>pachytene</b> and regenerating liver, the DNA sequences associated with these domains were quite different.

The <b>pachytene</b> PAC domains also contained approx. 10 % of the messenger coding sequences present in the DNAase-II-solubilized chromatin.

40|$|Piwi-interacting RNAs are {{a diverse}} class of small non-coding RNAs {{implicated in the}} {{silencing}} of transposable elements and the safeguarding of genome integrity. In mammals, male germ cells express two genetically and developmentally distinct populations of piRNAs at the pre-pachytene and <b>pachytene</b> stages of meiosis, respectively. Pre-pachytene piRNAs are mostly derived from retrotransposons and required for their silencing. In contrast, <b>pachytene</b> piRNAs originate from ~ 3, 000 genomic clusters, and their biogenesis and function remain enigmatic. Here, we report that conditional inactivation of the putative RNA helicase MOV 10 L 1 in mouse spermatocytes produces a specific loss of <b>pachytene</b> piRNAs, significant accumulation of <b>pachytene</b> piRNA precursor transcripts, and unusual polar conglomeration of Piwi proteins with mitochondria. <b>Pachytene</b> piRNA-deficient spermatocytes progress through meiosis without derepression of LINE 1 retrotransposons, but become arrested at the post-meiotic round spermatid stage with massive DNA damage. Our results demonstrate that MOV 10 L 1 acts upstream of Piwi proteins in the primary processing of <b>pachytene</b> piRNAs and suggest that, distinct from pre-pachytene piRNAs, <b>pachytene</b> piRNAs fulfill a unique function in maintaining post-meiotic genome integrity...|$|E
40|$|The ovaries {{of newly}} metamorphosed Xenopus females contain oocytes in {{all stages of}} early meiotic prophase. In <b>pachytene</b> nuclei {{extrachromosomal}} nucleolar DNA appears {{in the form of}} a thin cap covering one side of the nucleus.

Microspectrophotometric comparison of the Feulgen dye contents of post-pachytene nuclei in which the DNA cap has dispersed, and similarly prepared mouse liver nuclei, show that the post-pachytene nuclei have about 30 fifig of extrachromosomal <b>pachytene</b> nucleolar DNA.

Activation of Mek 1 requires the initiation of meiotic recombination and certain DNA damage checkpoint proteins. Mek 1 kinase activity and checkpoint-induced <b>pachytene</b> arrest are counteracted by protein phosphatase type 1 (Glc 7). Glc 7 coimmunoprecipitates with Red 1, colocalizes with Red 1 on chromosomes, and dephosphorylates Red 1 in vitro.
