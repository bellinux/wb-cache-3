40|$|Until recently, sewage from Morecambe was macerated, but {{otherwise}} untreated, and discharged at high water via a short outfall <b>pipe</b> into Morecambe <b>Bay</b> {{adjacent to a}} recognized bathing water. In March 1997, a new {{biological sewage treatment plant}} came on-line and the effluent was discharged via a longer outfall <b>pipe</b> into the <b>Bay</b> south of Heysham. The effect of the new sewage treatment {{on the quality of the}} bathing waters was monitored by testing sea water collected from the three EU designated bathing waters on Morecambe Bay: Morecambe North, Morecambe South and Heysham. After sewage treatment came on-line, the numbers of faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci were lower at Morecambe North and Morecambe South but higher at Heysham. Although the changes in numbers were not always statistically significant, they were sufficient to affect compliance with the EU Bathing Water Directive Imperative (mandatory) standards. Compliance improved markedly at Morecambe North and South but declined at Heysham, the closest bathing site to the new outfall. Numbers of thermophilic campylobacters were similar in both years, which is suggestive of their sources being different from those of the indicator bacteria. Campylobacter lari and urease-positive thermophilic campylobacters (UPTC) were the only species of Campylobacter isolated from Morecambe's bathing waters. Very low numbers of Salmonella were found, with Salm. arizonae the only species isolated...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{relocation}} of a magnet power supply, the installation of a buss, and an installation of chokes. and their need for cooling water a redesign of the Low Conductivity Water (LCW) system has been undertaken. This new system required the determination of an optimal pipe diameter for the High <b>Bay</b> <b>pipe</b> {{as well as the}} determination of the pressure drop and temperature rise in the buss. Based on numerous calculations it has been determined that the High <b>Bay</b> <b>pipe</b> should be 1 1 / 2 inch (1. 90 O. D. x 1. 610 I. D- 40 S steel). While the pressure drop in the buss was calculated to be 7. 699 psi. Based on such a low pressure drop, no need for any additional pumps has presented itself. Finally, the temperature rise in the buss has been determined to be about 29. 39 F for the Assembly Hall (route No. 1). and 13. 93 F for the Collision Hall (route No. 2). The purpose of this engineering note is to explain the redesign of the low conductivity water system (LCW) at D-Zero. The areas to be covered include the sizing of the High Bay, the pressure drop and temperature rise in the buss. In addition, I will try to determine if any more pumps are needed to support this new system. Originally, the purpose of the LCW was to provide cooling for the EF, CF, SAMUS magnets and the magnet power supply. The water source is composed of two 1 1 / 2 BC, 20 hp, centrifugal pumps (see Table No. 2) which are located in room 604 of the D-Zero Assembly building...|$|R
40|$|In {{the world}} of {{autonomous}} underwater vehicles (AUV) the prominent form of sensing has been sonar due to cloudy water conditions and dispersion of light. Although underwater conditions are highly suitable for sonar, {{this does not mean}} that vision techniques should be completely ignored. There are situations where visibility is high, such is in calm waters, and where light dispersion is not an issue, such as shallow water or near the surface. In addition, even when visibility is low, once a certain proximity to an object exists, visibility can increase. The focus of this project is this gap in capability for AUVs, with an emphasis on computer-aided detection through machine learning and computer vision techniques. All experimentation utilizes the Stingray AUV, a small and unique vehicle designed by San Diego iBotics. The first experiment is detection of an anchored buoy, which mimics the real world application of mine detection for the Navy. The second experiment is detection of a pipe, which mimics <b>pipes</b> in <b>bays</b> and harbors. The current algorithm for this application uses boosting machine learning on hue, saturation, value (HSV) to create a classifier followed by post processing techniques to clean the resulting binary image. There are many further applications for computer- aided detection and classification of objects underwater, from environmental to militar...|$|R
50|$|Connolly became {{involved}} in local politics in the early 1980s in the campaign against plans for a raw-sewage pump plant at The Swamp (now called South Park), beside the Claddagh. He {{was elected to the}} Corporation in 1985 and was responsible for foothpaths, roads and seaside walks repaired. As Chairman of the Claddagh Residents Association, he and other members worked at laying <b>pipes</b> into Galway <b>Bay</b> to ease sewage problems. In July 1987 he became the first Claddagh native to be elected Mayor of Galway. On 21 December 1987 he officially opened Galway's Quincentennial Bridge. On a thirteen-day business-and-tourism trip to Seattle, he was awarded by the State of Washington the titles of Honorary Distinguished Citizen, Ambassador of Good Will, and Washington General. While in office he entertained eight foreign ambassadors. Among them was the British Ambassador, who expressed a wish to sail in Mayor Connolly's Gleoiteog, though this proved impossible for security reasons. Martin Connolly was related to Martha Connolly who is the youngest of the family.Also he was well respected by all of the town.|$|R
40|$|The {{discharge}} of domestic sewage {{into the ocean}} waters off Oahu is a common practice. Since infectious enteric human viruses have been determined {{to be present in}} all sewages, viruses are also being discharged into the ocean environment. This study was undertaken to determine the fate, dissemination, and public health significance of sewage-borne viruses after they enter the ocean environment. Using an experimental, portable virus concentrator, indicator bacteria as well as human enteric viruses were consistently recovered from water samples taken from the surface sewage plume, the result of sewage discharge from the original ocean outfall pipe extending 129. 8 m into Mamala Bay at a depth of 12. 2 m. Recovery of sewage-borne bacteria and viruses decreased as the distance from the plume increased. However, viruses were recovered from a station as far away as 3 218 m east of the plume and within the vicinity of Ala Moana Beach. Significantly, viruses were occasionally recovered in the absence or negligible concentrations of coliform bacteria, indicating that the standard coliform test for water quality may be inadequate as an assessment for the presence of viruses. When the old sewage outfall <b>pipe</b> into Mamala <b>Bay</b> was diverted to the new outfall pipe which extends approximately 2 743 m from shore (exclusive of a 914 m long, multi-porthole diffuser) at a depth of 73. 2 m, no surface plume was observed and viruses were only sporadically recovered from ocean waters above the discharge pipes (zone of mixing). Viruses were recovered from ocean waters near other ocean sewage outfalls, such as in Pearl Harbor, Kaneohe Bay, and Kailua Bay, as well as from boat marinas and a stream emptying into the ocean. Other studies showed that human enteric viruses can be expected to survive for 24 hr in the marine environment before they are actively destroyed. Moreover, evidence was obtained that microorganisms naturally present in all the marine waters off Oahu are responsible for the inactivation of human enteric viruses.
