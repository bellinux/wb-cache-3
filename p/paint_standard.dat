The C-46 {{was a large}} twin-engine aircraft capable of flying faster and higher than any previous medium-range cargo aircraft, and could carry heavier loads than either the C-47 or the C-87, albeit at two and one half times the unit cost for a C-47. With the C-46, airlift tonnage increased significantly, surpassing objectives with 12,594 tons in December 1943. Loads continued to increase throughout 1944 and 1945, reaching an all-time maximum tonnage in July 1945.

5000|$|At {{launch in}} April 1985, the TM series {{included}} the following models: the base GLX, the mid-range SE and the high-end Elite. August 1986 saw the range expanded with a better-than-GLX equipped model known as the [...] "Executive". Aimed at fleet buyers, this new variant added full plastic wheel coverings, standard power steering and manual or automatic transmission with air conditioning as the sole option. The luxury-oriented models—SE and Elite—featured higher equipment: seats were covered in velour trim with the driver's seat being seven-way adjustable (instead of four-way); lumbar support for driver and passenger; rear integrated headrests and folding centre armrest with boot access; map lights and remote boot release; power windows, central locking and alloy wheels (standard on Elite and optional on SE); metallic <b>paint</b> <b>standard</b> (two-tone standard on Elite and single-tone optional on Elite and SE); radio/cassette players (featuring a novel security system {{that would make the}} unit completely inoperable in the event that its power was disconnected) with the Elite also adding a rear quarter panel electric antenna, separate equaliser and steering wheel controls. In addition, instead of standard control steering stalks and ventilation panel on the centre console, both the SE and Elite had two steering side pods, thus bringing all major controls within a driver's fingertips and making them jointly height adjustable with the steering column. Elite also featured an LCD instrument panel, in line with the Japanese automotive trend in the late 1980s. Common to all models were a tilt adjustable steering and cable-operated fuel filler door release. Non-Elite models also had a roof mounted manual antenna above the right A-pillar and the following optional equipment: air conditioning (GLX, Executive and SE), power steering and automatic transmission (GLX and SE).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Black-pigmented leaves {{occur only}} rarely in nature, {{possibly}} because their efficiency of light capture for photosynthesis is low. Using near-isogenicmorphs of black- and green-leafedOphiopogon planiscapusNakai ‘Nigrescens’, {{we tested the}} possibility that black pigmentation restricts the transmission of PARwithin the leaf. Wemeasured chromaticity coordinates of black and green leaf phenotypes, quantified their pigments and optical properties, and followed the transmission profiles of red, blue and green light through lamina tissues. Chroma and lightness values for the black leaves were {{comparable to those of}} a black <b>paint</b> <b>standard,</b> and were lower than those for the green phenotype, or for green and anthocyanic leaves of three other species. The adaxial surface of black leaves absorbed 95 % incident quanta, and reflected 4 % across the entire 400 – 700 nm waveband. There were no obvious structural differences between black and green leaves. Black coloration correlatedwith luxuriant concentrations of both chlorophylls and anthocyanins in superficial mesophyll. Profiles of transmission of red and blue light were similar in green and black leaves. In contrast, green light was restricted to uppermost palisade mesophyll layers in black leaves, but was transmitted to more central mesophyll in green leaves...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of our work}} was to design a light source which should be capable to collect and illuminate light of LEDs at the smaller aperture of cone (9 mm) which could be either coupled with secondary optics of a microscope or utilized independently for hyperspectral studies. Optimized performance of cone was assessed for different substrates (diffused glass silica, Alumina, Zerodur glass, acrylic plastic) and coating surfaces (white diffused, flat white <b>paint,</b> <b>standard</b> mirror) using a simulation software. The parameters optimized for truncated cone include slanting length and Top Major R (Larger diameter of cone) which were also varied from 10 to 350 mm and 10 to 80 mm respectively. In order to see affect of LED positions on cone efficiency, the positions of LED were varied from central axis to off-axis. Similarly, interLED distance was varied from 2 mm to 6 mm to reckon {{its effect on the}} performance of cone. The optimized Slant length (80 mm) and Top Major R (50 mm) were determined for substrates (glass zerodur or acrylic plastic) and coating surface (standard mirror). The output profile of truncated source was found non uniform, which is a typical presentation of non imaging optics problem. The maximum efficiency of cone has been found for LED at the centre and it was found decreasing as LED moves away from the central axis. Moreover, shorter the interLED distance, better is the performance of cone. The primary optics of cone shaped light source is capable to lit visible and UV LEDs in practical design. The optimum parameters obtained through simulations could be implemented in the fabrication procedure if the reflectance of source would have been maintained upto finish level of a standard mirror. 1 page(s...|$|E
