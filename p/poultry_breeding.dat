25|$|Brittany, {{apart from}} some {{areas such as}} Lorient, Nantes and Saint-Nazaire, has never been heavily industrialised. Today, fishing and {{agriculture}} remain important activities. Brittany has more than 40,000 agricultural exploitations, mostly oriented towards cattle, pig and <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding,</b> and cereals and vegetables production. The number of exploitations tends to diminish, but as a result, they are merged into very large estates. Brittany is the first producer in France for vegetables (green beans, onions, artichokes, potatoes, tomatoes...). Cereals are mostly grown for cattle feeding. Wine, especially muscadet, is made in a small region south of Nantes. Brittany is the first region in France for fishing. The activity employs around 9,000 people, and more than 60 firms work in fish and seafood processing.|$|E

40|$|The EU-wide {{salmonella}} {{control programme}} provides for all Member States to submit an annual {{report on the}} percentage of salmonella-positive flocks of <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> (Gallus gal-lus), laying hens and broilers. To meet this requirement, all Länder (German federal states) submit their data to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) which then evaluates the data. The data reported for 2009 show that the established Community targets for <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> (1 %) and broilers (1 %) were either maintained or reached. In official sampling, salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes were found in 0. 8 % of <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> and in 0. 4 % of broilers. In laying hens, the detection rate for salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes was 4. 8 %, which was {{higher than in the}} previous year. Changes in detection rates are also possibly the result of improved reporting. This supports the relevance of harmonised reporting for the consistent implementation and assessment of control programmes. If only the results from official testing are taken into account, the detection rate of the five salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes in <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> were below the Community target established for salmonella control and thus complied with the target, as they have in previous years. If, however, test results reported by food business operators are also taken into account the result appears differently. Under these circumstances, the sal-monella findings in laying hens clearly exceeded the Community target. Compared with the relatively low detection rates of the previous year, salmonella detection was not reduced further...|$|R
500|$|Since their domestication, a {{large number}} of breeds of {{chickens}} have been established, but {{with the exception of the}} white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin. In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. <b>Poultry</b> <b>breeding</b> has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. [...] The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to characterize infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV) circulating in commercial and <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> farms in Ethiopia between 2009 and 2011.
