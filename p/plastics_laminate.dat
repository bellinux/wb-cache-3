40|$|Two-dimensional {{finite element}} {{simulations}} and experiments are presented {{to examine the}} ultrasonic wave propagation behavior in the corner section of CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced <b>plastics)</b> <b>laminate</b> structures. The numerical model consists of a right-angle corner section of CFRP laminate immersed in water and subjected to the ultrasonic wave incidence from its inner or outer side. The anisotropic stiffness constants of the unidirectional CFRP are identified experimentally and used to model the curved laminate structure. A commercial finite element analysis code is used to compute the reflection waveforms in the pulse-echo mode, {{and the effect of}} the laminate stacking sequence and the wave incidence direction is examined. It is shown that the reflection waveforms for the wave incidence from the outer side of the corner qualitatively resemble those for the plane laminate except that the echo signals of the former are substantially weaker. The numerical simulations are shown to well reproduce the qualitative features of experimental reflection measurements performed for the corner sections of 16 -ply CFRP laminate. Experimental results indicate that the porosity content of the corner section can be estimated by the amplitude ratio of the surface and the back-wall echoes when a curvature-dependent calibration relation is properly used...|$|E
40|$|Oleoresin of pine (Pinus merkusii) is a Non Wood Forest Products {{commodity}} from West Sumatra. This oleoresin {{was obtained}} by tapping pine trees with square system followed by light burning to stimulate more oleoresin exudate to bleed. This research was carried out to assess the effect of storage time and kind of <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> container for pine resin collected from the field with square tapped method, on rosin recovery rate and its physico­chemical properties. Prior to distillation, the pine oleoresin was kept in two kinds of containers, i. e. <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> steel and <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> aluminium. The distillation of pine oleoresin kept in <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> container produced about 58 ­ 63 % of rosin and 20 ­ 26 % of turpentine oil, respectively. Meanwhile, the distillation products of pine oleoresin previously kept in <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> aluminium amounted to 56 ­ 63 % of rosin recovery and 22 ­ 27 % of turpentine. Analysis of variance of the experimental results indicated that container and storage time caused significant effect on ash content of rosin. The ash content of rosin from pine oleoresin after being kept in <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> steel container was somewhat {{lower than that of}} the one being kept in <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> steel container. The storage time of pine oleoresin up to 6 weeks in aluminium container could produce the rosin still comply with its prime quality and equivalent to WW (Water White) quality of rosin. Meanwhile, the storage time of pine oleoresin in steel container could last only for 4 weeks to meet the requirement to produce at such quality. The prolonged storage time of pine oleoresin caused the decrease in rosin quality. It is concluded that a <b>plastic</b> <b>laminated</b> container can be used to keep pine oleoresin up to 6 weeks, and still rendering a prime quality rosin based on the Indonesian National Standard...|$|R

Multilayer devices were produced by laser machining of plastic polymethylmethacrylate and polyethyleneterapthalate laminates by ablation.

Laser machining of both the fluidic pathways in the <b>plastic</b> <b>laminates,</b> and the stencil masks used for thermal evaporation to form electrode regions on the <b>plastic</b> <b>laminates,</b> enabled rapid and inexpensive implementation of design changes.

Electrochemical detection of dsDNA was achieved by melting of dsDNA molecules in solution with the integrated heater, allowing detection of DNA sequences specific to breast and colorectal cancers with a non-specific binding control.
