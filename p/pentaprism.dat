25|$|During {{the first}} years of {{production}} (until the Zenit-E of 1967) Zenit camera development coincided with that of the Zorki cameras. The Zenit-S had PC-synchro for external flash units (almost like the Zorki-S) and the Zenit-3M also had an RF-sibling, the Zorki-6. For an SLR, the <b>Pentaprism</b> of all classical Zenits was undersize, with the viewfinder showing about two-thirds of the actual frame-size.|$|E
25|$|Like SLRs DSLRs {{typically}} use {{interchangeable lenses}} (1) with a proprietary lens mount. A movable mechanical mirror system (2) is switched down (exact 45-degree angle) to direct {{light from the}} lens over a matte focusing screen (5) via a condenser lens (6) and a pentaprism/pentamirror (7) to an optical viewfinder eyepiece (8). Most of the entry-level DSLRs use a pentamirror instead of the traditional <b>pentaprism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first attempt}} to make {{high-end}} professional camera by KMZ was the Start in 1958. This camera had {{a full set of}} shutter speeds (from 1 sec to 1/1000), a lens with an automatic diaphragm in a unique breech-lock mount, and even a knife for cutting-off part of the unexposed film. The photographer could choose between a <b>pentaprism</b> and waist-level finders. The grave disadvantage of the Start is blamed on lack of lenses; only one lens (the Helios-44 f2/58) was ever made for the proprietary Start mount directly.|$|E

5000|$|All their SLR cameras, {{except the}} dx-3, had {{interchangeable}} <b>pentaprisms</b> (released by moving a button or twisting {{the base of}} the film rewind knob), and a unique dual lens mount; an external bayonet mount or a 44mm thread mount within the mirror box.|$|R
25|$|However, {{since the}} {{introduction}} of the Micro Four Thirds system by Olympus and Panasonic in late 2008, mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are now widely available so the option to change lenses is no longer unique to DSLRs. Cameras for the micro four thirds system are designed with the option of a replaceable lens and accept lenses that conform to this proprietary specification. Cameras for this system have the same sensor size as the Four Thirds System but do not have the mirror and <b>pentaprism,</b> so as to reduce the distance between the lens and sensor.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{manufacturers}} responded {{and introduced}} their own behind-the-lens metering cameras. Nikon and Miranda, at first, simply upgraded their interchangeable <b>pentaprisms</b> to include behind-the-lens metering (for Nikon F, and Miranda D, F, Fv and G models) and these manufacturers also bought out other camera models with built-in behind-the-lens metering capability, {{such as the}} Nikkormat FT and the Miranda Sensorex (which used an external coupling diaphragm). Minolta introduced the SRT-101, which used Minolta's proprietary system they referred to as [...] "CLC", which was an acronym for [...] "contrast light compensation", which metered differently from an average metering behind-the-lens camera.|$|R

40|$|Triangulations of 3 -dimensional {{polyhedron}} are partitions of the polyhedron with tetrahedra in {{a face-to-face}} fashion without introducing new vertices. Schönhardt (Math. Ann. 89 : 309 – 312, 1927), Bagemihl (Amer. Math. Mon. 55 : 411 – 413, 1948), Kuperberg (Personal communication 2011) and others constructed special polyhedra {{in such a}} way that clever one line geometric reasons imply nontriangulability. Rambau (Comb. Comput. Geom. 52 : 501 – 516, 2005) proved that twisted prisms over n-gons are nontriangulable. Our approach for proving polyhedra are nontriangulable is to show that partitions with tetrahedra, which we call tilings, do not exist even if the face-to-face-restriction is relaxed. First we construct a polyhedron which is tileable but is not triangulable. Then we revisit Rambau type twisted prisms. In fact we consider a slightly different class of polyhedra, and prove that these new twisted prisms are nontileable, thus are nontriangulable. We also show that one can twist the regular dodecahedron so that it becomes nontileable, which is abstracted to a new family of nontileable polyhedra, called nonconvex twisted <b>pentaprisms.</b> © 2015, The Managing Editors...|$|R
50|$|Instead of the M42 {{screw mount}} used by Pentax and other camera manufacturers, Nikon had {{introduced}} the three-claw F-mount bayonet lens mount system, {{which is still}} current in a modified form today. The focal plane shutter, unlike other SLRs of the period which used a cloth material for the focal plane shutter design (NOTE: with this design, {{it was possible to}} burn a hole into the cloth of the shutter during mirror lock-up in bright sunlight) used titanium foil which was rated for 100,000 cycles of releases of the shutter (according to Nikon). The F was also a modular camera, in which various assemblies such as the <b>pentaprisms,</b> the focusing screens, the special 35mm roll film 250 exposure film back and the Speed Magny film backs (two models: one using the Polaroid 100 (now 600) type pack films; and another Speed Magny was designed for 4×5 film accessories, including Polaroid's own 4×5 instant film back). These could be fitted and removed, allowing the camera to adapt to almost any particular task. It was the first 35 mm camera offered with a successful motor drive system.|$|R
40|$|This {{system was}} one of the test methods {{considered}} for measuring the radius of curvature of {{one or more of the}} 18 segmented mirrors that form the 6. 5 m diameter primary mirror (PM) of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The assembled telescope will be tested at cryogenic temperatures in a 17 -m diameter by 27 -m high vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center. This system uses a Leica Absolute Distance Meter (ADM), at a wavelength of 780 nm, combined with beam-steering and beam-shaping optics to make a differential distance measurement between a ring mirror on the reflective null assembly and individual PM segments. The ADM is located inside the same Pressure-Tight Enclosure (PTE) that houses the test interferometer. The PTE maintains the ADM and interferometer at ambient temperature and pressure so that they are not directly exposed to the telescope s harsh cryogenic and vacuum environment. This system takes advantage of the existing achromatic objective and reflective null assembly used by the test interferometer to direct four ADM beamlets to four PM segments through an optical path that is coincident with the interferometer beam. A mask, positioned on a linear slide, contains an array of 1. 25 mm diameter circular subapertures that map to each of the 18 PM segments as well as six positions around the ring mirror. A down-collimated 4 mm ADM beam simultaneously covers 4 adjacent PM segment beamlets and one ring mirror beamlet. The radius, or spacing, of all 18 segments can be measured with the addition of two orthogonally-oriented scanning <b>pentaprisms</b> used to steer the ADM beam to any one of six different sub-aperture configurations at the plane of the ring mirror. The interferometer beam, at a wavelength of 687 nm, and the ADM beamlets, at a wavelength of 780 nm, pass through the objective and null so that the rays are normally incident on the parabolic PM surface. After reflecting off the PM, both the ADM and interferometer beams return to their respective instruments on nearly the same path. A fifth beamlet, acting as a differential reference, reflects off a ring mirror attached to the objective and null and returns to the ADM. The spacings between the ring mirror, objective, and null are known through manufacturing tolerances as well as through an in situ null wavefront alignment of the interferometer test beam with a reflective hologram located near the caustic of the null. Since total path length between the ring mirror and PM segments is highly deterministic, any ADM-measured departures from the predicted path length can be attributed to either spacing error or radius error in the PM. It is estimated that the path length measurement between the ring mirror and a PM segment is accurate to better than 100 m. The unique features of this invention include the differential distance measuring capability and its integration into an existing cryogenic and vacuum compatible interferometric optical test...|$|R

(The East German KW Praktica came out {{at about the}} same time.) With earlier [...] "waist level" [...] SLR {{viewfinder}} systems (in which the photographer looks downward at the reflex mirror's image on the focusing screen), moving subjects are seen to track across the field-of-view in reverse direction of their actual motion, making action shooting counter-intuitive. A <b>pentaprism</b> is an eight-sided (only five are of significance; the other three are cut off corners) chunk of glass silvered on three sides that collects, redirects and re-reverses the light from the mirror with minimal light loss. With a proper <b>pentaprism,</b> all a photographer needs to do is hold the camera up to eyelevel and everything is there. The <b>pentaprism</b> SLR had first been proposed in the 19th century and was used in non-35 mm SLRs in the 1930s. Similar systems (or, in the 1990s, its cheaper alternative, the pentamirror) became so common in 35 mm SLRs by the late 1950s that it is the characteristic <b>pentaprism</b> [...] "head" [...] atop the camera body that defines the type for most people.|$|E
