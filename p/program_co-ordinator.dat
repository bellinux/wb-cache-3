40|$|Modern day {{demands for}} {{educational}} accountability have placed increasing {{emphasis on the}} need for instructional improvement and in so doing have posited a renewed responsibility on those individuals charged with effecting such improvement, namely, instructional supervisors. Yet there is ample evidence in the literature to suggest that negative perceptions abound relative to current supervisory efforts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the perceptions held by <b>program</b> <b>co-ordinators,</b> principals, and teachers in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador toward characteristics of a comprehensive instructional supervisory process known as clinical supervision, and to determine what differences, if any, might exist among perceptions held by these groups. [...] A questionnaire, developed by the investigator from a comprehensive search of the literature, was distributed to 100 <b>program</b> <b>co-ordinators,</b> 100 principals and 100 teachers chosen through a simple random sampling process. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent of their agreement with each statement on a six-point scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. [...] The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Frequency distributions were obtained and mean scores were computed for each group on each item. One-way analysis of variance was used to measure differences in means and the Scheffe procedure utilized to establish more precisely where such differences lay. [...] The major finding of the study was that on the average all three groups of respondents [...] <b>program</b> <b>co-ordinators,</b> principals and teachers [...] agreed with clinical supervision, with an overall mean rating of "agree moderately". Of the 33 questionnaire items dealing with various aspect of clinical supervision, co-ordinators agreed with 32, principals with 30 and teachers with 31. [...] A noteworthy anomaly, however, appeared in the data, in that, contrary to the precepts of clinical supervision, teachers, principals and to a lesser extent co-ordinators agreed that supervision includes teacher evaluation. Respondents agreed with the concept seemingly antithetical to clinical supervision that the primary objective of a supervisory program should be to evaluate a teacher's competencies as they relate to his/her instructional program. Moreover, principals and teachers did not agree with a statement that supervision is more likely to be effective when performed by educational personnel who are not directly responsible for teacher evaluation. [...] Recommendations for action centered around the adoption of clinical supervision by school districts, and the need for extensive inservice training for all potential participants prior to initiation of the clinical supervisory process. Further research was suggested into the relationship between supervision and teacher evaluation, the acceptability of clinical supervision compared to other types of supervision, the school administrator's role within the clinical process and the effect of clinical supervision on student performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Innovative and {{sustainable}} programs {{are required to}} support the well-being of stroke survivors. Peer support is a potentially low cost way to enhance well-being of recent stroke survivors and the well-being and community reintegration of their peer supporters. This article describes the perceptions of stroke survivors, care partners, peer supporters, and professionals of an individual peer support program. Methods An instrumental case study design {{was used to examine}} a volunteer peer support program that provides acute care visits and telephone follow-up post-discharge. In particular, a) type of support provided, b) benefits for the stroke survivor and care partner, c) potential harms to the stroke survivor, d) impact of providing support on the peer supporter, and e) required processes were considered. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 16 new stroke survivors and 8 care partners immediately following hospital discharge and then 6  months later, and with 7 peer supporters, 3 <b>program</b> <b>co-ordinators</b> and 4 health professionals to gather feedback from multiple stakeholders. Results Emotional, affirmational and informational support were perceived as being offered by the peer supporters. Peer visits were perceived as providing encouragement, motivation, validation, and decreased feelings of being alone. However, the visits were not perceived as beneficial to all stroke survivors. The impact on the peer supporters included increased social connections, personal growth, enjoyment, and feelings of making a {{difference in the lives of}} others. Involvement of the healthcare team, peer supporter training and a skilled coordinator were crucial to the success this program. Conclusions Peer support can potentially enhance service to stroke survivors and promote community reintegration for peer volunteers.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{aim of this}} dissertation will be to outline and critique the factors which have delayed {{the establishment of the}} first independent ethnic/multicultural radio station in Perth. The Multicultural Radio and Television Association of Western Australia are due to commence broadcasting on 6 EBA FM on 1 December, 1990. While the Association has been broadcast·. ng through 6 NR Community Access Radio for the past fourteen years, the increasing demand for air-time led them to apply for a Special Purpose, category 2 ̆ 7 S 2 ̆ 7 licence through the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The application was made in 1987, and the licence was granted after a hearing in 1988. Since then, the inauguration of broadcasting has been delayed by several factors, namely; finances for the establishment of studio facilities, the search for an antenna site, and the construction of the antenna. Nonetheless, other factors attributed to the delay need to be investigated. Independent ethnic/multicultural radio stations have been operating in Sydney, Melbourne, their regional areas, Adelaide and Brisbane for over ten years. This disjunction in establishment, must, then, be examined on an official level. Chapter One outlines and identifies national ethnic policy and philosophy in the context of broadcast radio. The history of ethnic radio broadcasting is detailed to establish how philosophy and official policy are not always aligned. Chapter Two contextualises national pol icy and philosophy in the locality of Perth. The history of ethnic broadcasting in Perth is critiqued to determine why there was a need for an independent ethnic radio station. The needs of migrant/ethnic participants are also identified through a theoretical framework and interviews conducted with <b>program</b> <b>co-ordinators.</b> These two themes are brought together in Chapter Three, where the contradictions between official policy and philosophy, and, policy and migrant/ethnic needs are examined. The contradictions identified ascertain how the lack of appropriate provision, through official policy structure, has contributed to the delay in formation of 6 EBA. This lack is characterised by the contentions within the structure of policy formation, and the lack of acknowledgement of migrant/ethnic needs in the ethnic broadcasting sphere. The disparity between the language of official policy and the voice of migrant/ethnic groups denies the application of access and equality in the ethnic/multicultural broadcasting sphere, and consequently begs the question - 2 ̆ 2 Who 2 ̆ 7 s Speaking to Whom? 2 ̆...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} four research questions: (1) How are institutional programs for young offenders guided by recommendations made by Justice Review Committees who {{call for the}} inclusion of Traditional healing practices in the counselling of Aboriginal offenders? (2) How and to what extent are Traditional healing practices in a counselling program and Native Studies in the academic program implemented within Canadian young offender institutions in addressing the special needs of youth? (3) What are the "special needs" of youth as incarcerated youth define their needs and how are they addressed in institutional programming? and (4) What are the problems and successes experienced within a Traditional healing program in each young offenders' system as defined by the resource people and / or co-ordinators who provide these programs and as they interface with the individual bureaucratic systems? In keeping with the concept that all parts of the "tree" must be examined, this research was conducted in four phases. The first phase, the survey, was an examination of the Canadian perspective. A survey was sent to 43 facilities for young offenders in Canada. Sixty five percent of the institutions responded providing program information and anecdotal accounts of problems and successes of Traditional healing programs within the custody facilities. Phase two of the research included poetry and artwork written by incarcerated youth and compiled over a five year period. This book was entitled The Ways of Life and is included with this research. A committee of incarcerated youth discussed their needs and the institutional programs which best addressed these needs. Interviews with two Native <b>Program</b> <b>Co-ordinators,</b> one in a western young offenders facility and the other in an eastern facility for young offenders, formed the basis of data in phase three of this research. Teachers in the area of Native Studies and related subjects were also involved in the interviews. The common themes and factors which emerged were: funding and budget concerns, staff attitudes and racism, security concerns and program structure, and, healing principles, partnership and program definition. The fourth phase of this investigation was a summary of aspects and insights from the youth's poetry and artwork, as well as, common themes experienced throughout the survey information and the interviews. Components involved in the design of a cultural program were summarized. These include: the arts, creative expression and Traditional teachings, classroom instruction, lifestyles intensive programs, opportunity for community, Traditional ceremonies, and nature and health care programs. In light of the fact, from the survey response, that 40 % of the incarcerated youth in Canada are of Aboriginal ancestry in a backdrop of approximately 2 % Aboriginal people within the general population of Canada, emphasis on Traditional healing practices and further recommendations for programming conclude this investigation. Further recommendations are made in order to provide reflection on the programs for incarcerated youth and the Young Offenders Act in Canada...|$|R

40|$|Introduction - {{definition}} of tutor programs, reasons for starting tutor programs, aims {{of this report}} and sources of information used. An important focus of my teaching {{for the last three}} years has been volunteer tutor programs. These are programs in which community volunteers assist in schools by tutoring students who are not usually their own children. Generally these volunteers are given some sort of 'training' (although this varies), and they work within the school on a regular timetable. My first involvement with volunteer tutor programs was as a teacher/co-ordinator, initiating a tutor program at a country high school, Huonville High School, in 1992. Since mid 1993, I have worked for the Hartz Support School. This school was established in 1991 to assist all students with special needs who are enrolled in normal schools in the Hartz District -one of the seven school districts in Tasmania. This is in fact all students with special needs - there are no special schools in this district. The philosophy of inclusion is fundamental to the work of Hartz Support School (HSS) staff. An important part of our work in these first years, has been to help teachers set up and monitor tutor programs. In 1992, I thought the idea of using volunteers to tutor students was a new area. Yet, although I wasn't aware of it at the time, other teachers around Tasmania, and Australia, were also using volunteer tutor programs. It was a time of government cutbacks in educational expenditure, and yet it seemed to many teachers that some of our students had needs which were perhaps greater than ever. There were still students with learning problems, and a growing group of students whose ability to learn effectively was adversely influenced by social, economic, emotional or family problems. These students often needed more intensive work and attention, either individually or in small groups, and many teachers felt frustrated because the resources for this kind of teaching were not readily available. Many students had low literacy skills, and this meant that their work in all subject areas was at risk Most volunteer tutor programs, therefore, asked tutors to help students with reading and writing, but some schools, especially those in isolated areas, asked for volunteers to help in subjects as diverse as French, Art, Cooking and Tae Kwon Do! Many of these schools had only a small number of teachers, so needed to rely on community expertise to provide the varied curriculum possible in larger schools. Neither this report, nor the research preceding it, is the work of an objective outsider. As teachers initiating tutor programs we all made mistakes; we quickly found out what worked and what did not. You learn quickly when you are working with volunteers who do not have to keep turning up, and who are free to tell you exactly what they think and what they want, without fear of losing their jobs! For all of us it was action research in a real situation, and the end results had to be right. Many teachers used models taken from other parts of Australia as the starting point for their tutor programs. Finding out about these models was usually the first part of our research. Some schools continued to use a particular program (eg. LAP) with only minor modifications. Other schools developed tutor programs which combined ideas from the different models with new structures developed in response to the school's needs. This aim of this dissertation will be to provide a detailed description and commentary of aspects of volunteer tutor programs in all parts of Tasmania, although at times it may seem that the emphasis is on tutor programs in the Hartz District. As I have mentioned, there has been considerable sharing of ideas and resources from around the State. This means that although the tutor programs in Hartz have been heavily influenced by the HSS, the HSS staff in turn have collected materials and methods from all parts of Tasmania, from the rest of Australia and indeed the rest of the world. Through networks such as the Commonwealth Literacy and Learning Key Teacher Program, many teachers involved in tutor programs have been able to pool their knowledge and share their ideas. As ideas spread, and schools started experimenting, many of these co-ordinators and support teachers felt they were starting to obtain some useful information. There was, however, no co-ordinating person to start gathering this material and writing it down. In 1993, some schools, including the Hartz Support School, started surveying some of their co-ordinators and tutors. Some re-testing of students on the program was also carried out by HSS staff in 1993. Again, we did not have time to do more than glance at most of this information, although it was reassuring to note that most results/comments were positive. In 1994, Hugo McCann provided a useful overview of tutor programs in many Tasmanian schools as part of his Evaluation Report of the Commonwealth Literacy and Learning Program. This was the first acknowledgement of the proliferation of tutor programs throughout the State. Through surveys of teachers involved, McCann also made the first attempt to judge the effectiveness of the programs. By late 1994, it was obvious that many schools throughout Tasmania had established tutor <b>programs.</b> Some <b>co-ordinators</b> made an effort to inform DEA personnel about what was going on. Meetings of coordinators were held and some of the DEA 's top managers were invited. Generally they seemed impressed with what they were hearing, although they expressed the desire for further information. I hope this dissertation will meet the need for further information. I will attempt to accurately recount the views of many teachers, coordinators and tutors involved in these programs. I shall also provide a full description of the roles of people involved in tutor programs, and to make some evaluation of their effectiveness. It is hoped that this commentary will assist other schools wishing to set up or maintain their own tutor programs, and will also provide the DEA with suggestions on establishing state wide support structures for tutor programs. I have used a variety of sources. Appendix 1 gives information requested from schools by Graham Harrington, Deputy Secretary of the DEA. Schools were asked to indicate whether tutor programs operated in their schools, and to estimate the numbers of students involved. Some schools were obviously uncertain about what constituted a tutor program, and many did not answer the survey. (The returns for one entire district were not available.) Nevertheless, this DEA survey did demonstrate that a large number of schools used some type of volunteer tutor program. This dissertation is concerned with describing tutor programs which focus on teaching literacy skills. It should be recognised, however, that many schools have extended volunteer tutoring to include a range of subjects and a wealth of community knowledge. While many of the sections on literacy in this report may not be relevant to these schools, there should be much information about tutor programs in general which everyone connected with tutor programs could find of interest...|$|R

His seminal work, Land-Gold-Reform: The Territorial Restructuring of the Guatemalan Highlands (published in English, Spanish and Portuguese), {{links the}} {{struggle}} against extractive industries with the struggle for land in Latin America and {{is a product of}} this experience. In June 2006, he was hired as the executive director of Food First (the Institute for Food and Development Policy), a people's think tank started by Frances Moore Lappé in 1975. He specializes in environmental studies, area studies, development studies, agroecology and the political economy of hunger. He works closely with social movements in the U.S. and internationally and asserts that, [...] "Successful social movements are formed by integrating activism with livelihoods. These integrated movements create the deep sustained social pressure that produces political will—the key to changing the financial, governmental, and market structures that presently work against sustainability." [...] Walden Bello is a particular advocate of the importance of Gimenez’s work, referring to him as one of the world’s most [...] "prominent critics of the global food system".|$|E

She is {{also the}} <b>Program</b> <b>Co-ordinator</b> for Early Childhood. Her {{scholarly}} and professional interests lie {{in the use of}} innovative conceptual, theoretical, methodological, pedagogical, and collaborative approaches to address enduring challenges in education. This book details the phenomenographic and grounded theory investigation aimed at generating new knowledge of parental choice of early childhood education and care services. Given the complexity and range of choice of early childhood services, and the diversity of family situations, research eliciting parent conceptions of their choices of early childhood services is both necessary and timely. Understanding multiple perspectives in this way may inform early childhood professionals by expanding their awareness of the variation that exists in the way that parents conceptualise early childhood services and make choices for young children. ...|$|E

Former prime minister Kevin Rudd was a complex man and may well have been unelectable, but when it comes to homelessness, he did leave Australia with at least one great political achievement, and through it, Julia Gillard has inherited a social policy triumph. In May 2008, when Rudd put homelessness on the agenda, describing it as a "national obscenity", he demonstrated the sort of courage that defines true leadership.

Edward Hill, MD, started a cam-paign to raise awareness about state-funded insurance programs. In conjunction with the AMA's Medical Student Section, Cover-ing Kids & Families was launched to "set up enrollment programs at local schools, community centers, hospitals and free clinics to help more eligible children have access to healthcare, " Hill said. In Rochester, MN, <b>Program</b> <b>Co-ordinator</b> Joy Hardison-Grimes and other student volunteers saw a huge response. "We calculated that we could contact over 100 families per calling session but anticipated that only 25 % ofthem would even-tually have coverage renewed, " she explained. "After a single session, it appears that the students main-tained healthcare coverage for at least half the families who they were able to contact. " Grimes, representing the Mayo Clinic College ofMedicine, says the project will continue for the next six months. "Ourphone calls have been able to increase the lines ofcommu-nication between the Covering Kids & Families office in our county and the people whom they serve. "...|$|E
