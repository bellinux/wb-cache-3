5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to <b>purify</b> communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was <b>purified</b> {{from the}} {{extracellular}} fluid of HR- 1 and B 95 - 8 cell lines. The preparations of <b>purified</b> virus consisted of enveloped particles and had EBV-specific antigneic reactivity. Comparison {{of the amount}} of labeled protein in preparations of virus <b>purified</b> from cultures incubated in [35 S]methionine with the amount of labeled protein in preparations obtained following a mixture of unlabeled virus with [35 S]methionine-labeled cellular proteins indicated that less than 2 % of the labeled protein in the <b>purified</b> virus preparation could be attributed to contamination with labeled cellular proteins. No extraneous membranous material was seen in thin sections of the <b>purified</b> virus preparations. Analysis of the polypeptides of <b>purified</b> enveloped EBV indicated the following.

(ii) Thirty-three polypeptides could be resolved in fluorograms of labeled EBV <b>purified</b> from B 95 - 8 cultures and subjected to electrophoresis in acrylamide gels cross-linked with diallyltartardiamide. The molecular weight of the EBV polypeptides was estimated by co-electrophoresis with the polypeptides of <b>purified</b> herpes simplex virus and <b>purified</b> polypeptides of known molecular weight to range from 28 x 10 (3) to approximately 290 x 10 (3) (iii) The polypeptides of EBV could be grouped by their relative molar abundancy into three classes: VP 6, 7, and 27 present in high abundance; VP 1, 12, 20, 23, and 29 present in moderate abundance; and a third class of less abundant polypeptides, VP 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 21, and 22. The remainder of the polypeptides could not be precisely quantitated.
