2500|$|Seldin (2006) used over 5,000 {{autosomal}} SNPs. It showed [...] "a {{consistent and}} reproducible distinction between ‘northern’ and ‘southern’ European population groups". Most individual participants with southern European ancestry (Italians, Greeks, Portuguese, Spaniards), and Ashkenazi Jews have >85% {{membership in the}} southern population; and most northern, western, central, and eastern Europeans (Swedes, English, Irish, Germans, and Ukrainians) have >90% in the northern population group. However, many of the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> actually American citizens who self-identified with different European ethnicities based on self-reported familial pedigree.|$|E
50|$|The {{controversy}} {{arose from}} the fact that the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> incapable of giving their consent due to the nature of their injuries. The only way to opt out from the study was by wearing a special bracelet prior to needing emergency care (the bracelet can be requested by calling 717-531-5829). This practice is sanctioned by the FDA as necessary emergency research, but patients' rights groups protested the study.|$|E
50|$|In 1973 Newtson showed {{two groups}} of people an acted {{sequence}} and instructed them to break the sequence into parts.

Newtson concluded that <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> attending more closely and forming more detailed causal analyses when the actor's behavior deviated from expectation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{results of}} the study were hailed by the mobile phone industry, but some {{researchers}} criticized the study, with an editorial accompanying it arguing that its results were likely due to bias. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society noted that Interphone was the largest study of mobile phone use and tumor risk conducted to date, but also criticized it, saying in a statement that [...] "The majority of <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> not heavy cell phone users compared to today's practices." [...] John Niederhuber, the then-director of the National Cancer Institute, said that Interphone [...] "illustrates {{how difficult it is to}} identify and corroborate, or definitively rule out, any possible association between the two cell phones and cancer".|$|E
50|$|A {{study with}} the goal of {{recording}} the activity that occurs in the brain during an Aha! moment using fMRIs was conducted in 2003 by Jing Luo and Kazuhisa Niki. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> presented with a series of Japanese riddles, and asked to rate their impressions toward each question using the following scale: (1) I can understand this question very well and know the answer; (2) I can understand this question very well and feel it is interesting, but I do not know the answer; or (3) I cannot understand this question and do not know the answer.This scale allowed the researchers to only look at participants who would experience an Aha! moment upon viewing the answer to the riddle. In previous studies on insight, researchers have found that participants reported feelings of insight when they viewed the answer to an unsolved riddle or problem.Luo and Niki had the goal of recording these feelings of insight in their participants using fMRIs. This method allowed the researchers to directly observe the activity that was occurring in the participant's brains during an Aha! moment.|$|E

50|$|In {{their second}} study, Savitsky and Gilovich {{focused on the}} {{connection}} between the illusion of transparency and the exacerbation of speech anxiety. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> divided into three groups: control, reassured, and informed. All were given a topic and had five minutes to prepare a speech in front of a crowd, after which they rated themselves on anxiety, speech quality, and appearance, and observers also rated them on anxiety levels and speech quality. The control group were given no other advance instructions. The reassured and informed groups were both told in advance that it is normal to feel anxiety about giving a speech. The reassured group were told that research indicates they should not worry about this. The informed group were told about the illusion of transparency and that research indicates that emotions are usually not as evident to others as people believe they are. The informed group rated themselves higher in every respect and were also rated higher by the observers. The informed group, understanding that the audience {{would not be able to}} perceive their nervousness, had less stress and their speech tended to be better.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} this study {{demonstrate}} that self-perception is not an adequate measure of cultural competency.

30|$|Another {{probable}} {{explanation for}} this finding {{could be attributed to}} how <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> prompted during the recall sessions.
