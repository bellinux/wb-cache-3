40|$|The {{presence}} and replication of E. coli within Crohn’s Disease (CD) tissue {{has been confirmed}} by multiple authors and is hypothesised to be pivotal {{in the development of}} CD. In this thesis, quantification of E. coli bacteria within endoscopic biopsies has been achieved with high efficiency, sensitivity and reproducibility using PCR plasmid technology, and the technique’s utility demonstrated by quantifying E. coli within the biopsies of CD patients in clinical relapse and remission as well as within the first lesions present in CD relapse, aphthous ulcers. These studies showed some interesting correlations with clinical, macroscopic, and histological data, obtained during a clinical trial of soluble <b>plantain</b> <b>fibre</b> supplementation for prevention of relapse in CD. These included increased quantities of E. coli in tissues from the mucosa of patients in clinical relapse whose ileum was macroscopically normal yet histologically inflamed, and significant falls in the quantities of E. coli over time in the biopsy tissues of patients who were in clinical remission. The ability of a specific group of E. coli, the adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC), to replicate within macrophages, is increasingly perceived to be fundamental in CD pathogenesis. The replication of E. coli within the phagolysosomes of macrophages is implicated in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, granuloma formation, and the consequent mucosal injury seen in CD. The pharmacological inhibition of AIEC replication in this work within murine macrophage tissue in vitro by the immunosuppressive azathioprine and its active metabolite 6 -thioguanine {{as well as by the}} antibiotic ciprofloxacin at clinically relevant concentrations is supportive of this central hypothesis, and also suggests new treatment combinations that might be trialled in active CD. Interestingly and unexpectedly the steroid hydrocortisone also inhibited AIEC replication within macrophages, suggesting that sepsis-related complications seen with steroid use clinically may be related to its effects on neutrophil recruitment, rather than on phagocytic killing of bacteria. The diarrhoeal pathogens EPEC, ETEC, and C. difficile represent a large disease burden in terms of infantile, travellers’, and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea respectively with C. difficile also sometimes implicated in the exacerbation of CD. Plantain (banana) non starch polysaccharide (NSP) has previously been demonstrated to inhibit AIEC adhesion to mucosal tissues, and this work demonstrates the inhibition of the adherence of ETEC and C. difficile to intestinal cells in vitro with two different modalities, using concentrations of soluble <b>plantain</b> <b>fibre</b> that are readily achievable in the distal intestinal lumen. Previous work on AIEC inhibition with plantain was confirmed, whilst oat fibre and apple pectin did not significantly inhibit ETEC adherence. EPEC was not inhibited by <b>plantain</b> <b>fibre,</b> which may be due to its unique epithelial interaction. These foodstuffs, if prepared as suitable supplements, may offer new prophylactic therapeutic interventions for global and institutional diarrhoeal illness following appropriate clinical trials.

40|$|Soluble fibres (non-starch polysaccharides, NSP) from edible plants but {{particularly}} plantain banana (Musa spp.), {{have been shown}} in vitro and ex vivo to prevent various enteric pathogens from adhering to, or translocating across, the human intestinal epithelium, a property that we have termed contrabiotic. Here we report that dietary <b>plantain</b> <b>fibre</b> prevents invasion of the chicken intestinal mucosa by Salmonella. In vivo experiments were performed with chicks fed from hatch on a pellet diet containing soluble plantain NSP (0 to 200 mg/d) and orally infected with S. Typhimurium 4 / 74 at 8 d of age. Birds were sacrificed 3, 6 and 10 d post-infection. Bacteria were enumerated from liver, spleen and caecal contents. In vitro studies were performed using chicken caecal crypts and porcine intestinal epithelial cells infected with Salmonella enterica serovars following pre-treatment separately with soluble plantain NSP and acidic or neutral polysaccharide fractions of plantain NSP, each compared with saline vehicle. Bacterial adherence and invasion were assessed by gentamicin protection assay. In vivo dietary supplementation with plantain NSP 50 mg/d reduced invasion by S. Typhimurium, as reflected by viable bacterial counts from splenic tissue, by 98. 9 % (95 % CI, 98. 1 – 99. 7; P, 0. 0001). In vitro studies confirmed that plantai...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{proposed}} that a high intake of dietary fibre promotes good intestinal health. Work performed previously by our research group suggests that soluble dietary fibre might have a particularly beneficial impact on intestinal health via its ability to inhibit potentially harmful interactions between bacterial pathogens and the gut epithelium. The aims of this thesis were to evaluate soluble plantain NSP {{for its ability to}} disrupt the epithelial interactions of diarrhoeal pathogens C. difficile and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), as well as other bacterial components implicated in diarrhoeal disease. Work was also performed to characterise the specific inhibitory fraction of plantain NSP, and in addition, to establish the molecular mechanism underlying its inhibitory activity. A range of soluble dietary fibres were shown to significantly inhibit the in vitro epithelial adhesion of C. difficile and ETEC, but out of all the fibres tested, soluble plantain NSP exhibited the highest efficacy. Plantain NSP also significantly inhibited the epithelial adhesion of eleven C. difficile clinical isolates, irrespective of their toxin expression or ribotype status. Furthermore, plantain NSP blocked the epithelial interactions of five purified C. difficile spore preparations. In addition to its anti-adhesive effects, soluble plantain NSP significantly down-regulated the pro-inflammatory, cytotoxicity and apoptotic response induced by C. difficile and its toxins. Similar effects were also found with respect to mucosally-associated E. coli isolated from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, as well as bacterial components such as flagellin and LPS. Results demonstrated that the inhibitory activity of plantain NSP was mediated by its acidic polysaccharide fraction, which is mainly composed of pectic material. In addition, it was shown that soluble plantain disrupted bacterial-epithelial interactions via an interaction with the intestinal epithelium. Whilst plantain NSP induced increased cellular chloride secretion, this mechanism was not responsible for inhibitory activity. It was also hypothesised that plantain NSP might mimic intestinal MUC 2 glycans by interacting with cell-surface galectin- 3, with consequent nuclear localisation of β-catenin and down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. Whilst plantain NSP was shown to induce activation of β-catenin, the knockdown of surface galectin- 3 expression had no effect on inhibitory activity. Thus, the specific mechanism underlying the inhibitory activity of plantain NSP requires further investigation. This work supports the hypothesis that soluble <b>plantain</b> <b>fibre</b> can inhibit harmful interactions between bacteria and the human intestinal epithelium. Indeed, these studies provide convincing evidence to suggest that soluble <b>plantain</b> <b>fibre,</b> acting as a ‘contrabiotic’, could be developed as a potential prophylaxis or treatment against C. difficile and ETEC, which represent the main cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and traveller’s diarrhoea, respectively. In addition, dietary supplementation with soluble plantain NSP may also confer a therapeutic benefit in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDietary fibres {{may have}} {{prebiotic}} effects mediated by promotion of beneficial bacteria. This study explores {{the possibility that}} soluble plant fibre may also improve health by inhibiting epithelial adhesion and translocation by pathogenic bacteria. We have focussed on soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) from plantain bananas (Musa spp.) which previous studies showed to be particularly effective at blocking Escherichia coli epithelial adherence. In vitro and ex vivo studies assessed the ability of plantain NSP to inhibit epithelial cell adhesion and invasion of various bacterial pathogens, and to inhibit their translocation through microfold (M) -cells and human Peyer′s patches mounted in Ussing chambers. Plantain NSP showed dose-related inhibition of epithelial adhesion and M-cell translocation by a range of pathogens. At 5 mg/ml, a concentration readily achievable in the gut lumen, plantain NSP inhibited adhesion to Caco 2 cells by Salmonella Typhimurium (85. 0 ± 8. 2 %, P<. 01), Shigella sonnei (46. 6 ± 29. 3 %, P<. 01), enterotoxigenic E. coli (56. 1 ± 23. 7 %, P<. 05) and Clostridium difficile (67. 6 ± 12. 3 %, P<. 001), but did not inhibit adhesion by enteropathogenic E. coli. Plantain NSP also inhibited invasion of Caco 2 cells by S. Typhimurium (80. 2 ± 9. 7 %) and Sh. sonnei (46. 7 ± 13. 4 %); P<. 01. Plantain NSP, 5 mg/ml, also inhibited translocation of S. Typhimurium and Sh. sonnei across M-cells by 73. 3 ± 5. 2 % and 46. 4 ± 7. 7 % respectively (P<. 05). Similarly, S. Typhimurium translocation across Peyer′s patches was reduced 65. 9 ± 8. 1 % by plantain NSP (P<. 01). Soluble <b>plantain</b> <b>fibre</b> can block epithelial adhesion and M-cell translocation of intestinal pathogens. This represents an important novel mechanism by which soluble dietary fibres can promote intestinal health and prevent infective diarrhoea...|$|E
