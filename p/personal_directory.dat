50|$|The Tele. 232 {{came out}} of the box fitted with a base plate {{containing}} a drawer, holding a <b>personal</b> <b>directory</b> card. The telephone could then be screwed directly onto the matching Bell set 26, making a true, but very heavy, telephone set, or screwed down onto the desk of a CCB (coin collecting box), in a Public Telephone Kiosk. In this form it was fitted with a modified dial, a more durable handset cord, and was re-numbered as the Tele. 242. There was one other variant. With modified internals and designed purely to be used in combination with a Bellset 39a or 44, this was the Tele. 248 in the guise of the Extension Plans 5 & 7. This type of telephone is often featured in British made period television dramas. Curiously, the telephone often rings despite not being fitted with any bell unit.|$|E

The reason for the age limit was that the participants should have had time to decide whether to get a driving license and in that case acquire some driving experience, however the mean age in this group is rather high (Mean 71  years, SD 15  years). Furthermore, a hearing control group (N[*]=[*] 300), matched on age, gender and geographical location, was selected and also asked to answer the questionnaire.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} automatically structuring heterogenous document collections by using clustering methods. In contrast to traditional clustering, we study restrictive methods and ensemble-based meta methods that may decide to leave out some documents rather than assigning them to inappropriate clusters with low confidence. These techniques result in higher cluster purity, better overall accuracy, and make unsupervised self-organization more robust. Our comprehensive experimental studies on three different real-world data collections demonstrate these benefits. The proposed methods seem particularly suitable for automatically substructuring personal email folders or <b>personal</b> Web <b>directories</b> that are populated by focused crawlers, {{and they can be}} combined with supervised classification techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Enterprise {{directory}} {{services are}} commonly used in enterprise systems to store object information relating to employees, computers, contacts, etc. These stores can act as information providers or sources for authentication and access control decisions, and could potentially contain sensitive information. An insider attack, particularly if carried out using administrative privileges, could compromise large amounts of directory information. We present two solutions for protecting directory services information from insider attacks. The first is a centralized approach utilizing a customized virtual directory server. The second is a distributed approach using existing key management infrastructure and a new component called a <b>Personal</b> Virtual <b>Directory</b> Service. We explain how these solutions interact with existing directory services and client applications. We also show how impact to existing users, client applications, and directory services are minimized, and how we prevent insider attacks from revealing protected data. We compare and contrast both solutions, including potential tradeoffs, administrative overhead, and enterprise systems impact. Additionally, our solution is supported by implementation results showing the impact to client performance and directory storage capacity...|$|R

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of the Internet and distributed object technologies, naming and directory services have become key elements in distributed system architectures. A key benet of naming services is to enable location-independent access to remote objects. In the Java environment, the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is proposed as a common framework to provide an object-oriented view of naming and directory services, and to unify and federate dierent types of services. In the paper, we present a terminal infrastructure which relies on naming and directory services for accessing distributed objects. This infrastructure is based on the usage of a new component we have named <b>Personal</b> Naming and <b>Directory</b> Service (PNDS), which is embedded on a smart card. PNDS has been prototyped using a fully object-oriented Java card, and has been integrated as a new additional component in the JNDI framework. By leveraging the Open Card Framework, the standardized framework and interface to access both the smart card reader and applications on the card, and the JNDI framework approach to naming and directory services, PNDS enables access to both smart card and network based services. The PNDS smart card provides the proposed terminal infrastructure with knowledge of user's personal services, and with means for accessing and securing the access. 1...|$|R

40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 Chronological History of UTEP Buildings 2 ̆ 2 Timeline was {{compiled}} by Willie Quinn, {{a member of}} the UTEP Heritage Commission, between the period of January 2002 and September 2005, for the 90 th Anniversary of the school. It was recently updated to July 2015 for UTEP 2 ̆ 7 s Centennial Celebration. The final product is a computer spreadsheet equivalent to the physical size of 32 individual legal size paper sheets, when joined together forms a wall chart about 3 feet wide by 10 feet long. The timeline’s primary purpose was to identify the dates that all the buildings on the UTEP campus were constructed, so we could establish an accurate date for many of the campus aerial photos in the Heritage Commission files that did not have any date recorded. The timeline begins in 1913 with the founding of the school on the original building site just east of the old Fort Bliss on Lanoria Mesa in northeast El Paso and continues through 2015 with the buildings on the current site of UTEP {{on the west side of}} El Paso. This timeframe covers the construction of the original four (4) buildings on the current campus to the over 86 buildings now existing, ending with the construction of Miner Canyon Student Apartments in 2015. The basic research consisted of compiling data from the Annual Financial Reports (AFR), Institutional Self-Study Reports (IS-S), Flowsheet yearbooks (F/S), Origins book, Fugate 2 ̆ 7 s book Frontier College, Nancy Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s book Pictorial History of UTEP, College Catalogs, University <b>Directories,</b> <b>personal</b> conversations, etc. Nancy Hamilton also developed a schedule of 2 ̆ 2 When Were They Built? (1917 - 1997) ”, which was very helpful. More recently we received much help from the staff and management of Facility Services, Spatial Resources, and Drafting Divisions. Associated with this building construction information are the dates of any building name changes over the years, and in some cases when the original names were moved to a new building in a different location on Campus. The timeline also reflects when a building was razed and a new building with a different name was built on the same site. The very top information 2 ̆ 2 Line 2 ̆ 2 reflects the eight (8) 2 ̆ 7 unofficial 2 ̆ 7 and/or the five (5) 2 ̆ 7 official 2 ̆ 7 names of the educational institution we now call UTEP, or more officially 2 ̆ 2 UT El Paso. 2 ̆ 2 All of these names from the original State School of Mines and Metallurgy, to the College of Mines, thru Texas Western College, and finally to the University of Texas at El Paso are situated along the 2 ̆ 2 Line 2 ̆ 2 to permit the viewer to note the specific date that the name of the school was changed. The next three (3) long, narrow Rows of information shows what historically significant events were going on (1) in the World, (2) in El Paso, and (3) at UTEP, during any point in the school 2 ̆ 7 s history from 1913 - 2015, which was associated with the building construction. This puts the building construction into the proper perspective relative to what was going on all around us at the same time in history. For example, in 1914, when the school was started, World War I in Europe began, and in 1917, when the first buildings were opened on our current campus, the U. S. entered World War I. The timeline also has footnotes consisting of (1) General Comments on Timeline Criteria, (2) Specific Reference Sources, (3) Types of Buildings Not Shown, (4) Building Details for those buildings with a more complicated history, and (5) Details on the School Name Changes. These footnotes are generally located on the lower-left side of the chart.
