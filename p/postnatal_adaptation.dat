40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the role of the child nurse in the {{adaptation}} of the newborn after delivery. In the theoretical part we devote to the available scientific knowledge focused on the course of pregnancy, the way of giving birth (vaginal and operative), assessment of <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the newborn, breastfeeding and its importance. The essential part is mapping the role of child nurse in newborn care using the NOC system to evaluate their <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation.</b> The Czech and foreign literary sources were used for the theoretical part of the diploma thesis. The first aim of the diploma thesis was a detailed mapping {{of the role of the}} child nurse in <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the newborn after physiological and operative delivery. Two research questions have been selected for its solution. The first research question was, what Apgar values the newborns show after the physiological and operative delivery. The second research question was the success of the first application of the newborn to breastfeeding within 30 minutes after physiological and operative delivery. The second aim of this diploma thesis was to verify the classification of the NOC on the evaluation of the newborn adaptation. For the solution, a research question has been determined, what is the opinion of nurses on the use of the NOC classification system in <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation.</b> For the empirical part of the research we have chosen a qualitatively quantitative strategy. Observation, individual semi-structured interviews with nurses and written filling of NOC classification system forms were used for data collection. The first research group was 10 newborns after the physiological - vaginal delivery and 10 newborns after the operative delivery by Caesarean section. The second research group consisted of 2 child nurses working with neonates as part of <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> in Hospital Jihlava. Analyzing and interpreting the obtained results, we found out that newborns born by vaginal delivery had an average Apgar score of 8. 03 and newborns born by Caesarean section had an average Apgar score of 9. 50. The average values of the indicators in the NOC classification system code 0118 The adaptation of the newborn showed slightly poorer results after vaginal deliveries. Two groups of newborns that we followed did not match the generally expected results. Newborns after the Caesarean section are threatened by risk factors, but due to careful nursing care and gentle childbirth, such a risk does not occur and the process of <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> can be successful. In the NOC classification system code 1000 Beginning of breastfeeding child showed the indicators at vaginal deliveries, at least 8 feedings per day and infant satisfaction after feeding, better results. In the NOC classification system code 1001 Beginning of breastfeeding mother the average values of breast suction indicators and satisfaction with the breastfeeding process resulted better in favour of neonates born vaginally compared to neonates after Caesarean section. As regards the success of the first feeding of neonates to breastfeeding within 30 minutes after delivery, a clearly superior result was obtained for newborns born vaginally. The conclusions drawn from our research in relation to child breastfeeding by mother confirm the clear benefit of vaginal births for the successful adaptation of newborns. A child nurse undoubtedly plays an important role in the assessment of <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the newborn. The research of the diploma thesis shows that the classification system NOC is very well sophisticated in the context of a newborn adaptation and it is even detailed in connection with the follow-up and subsequent provision of newborn care. Its full use in current practice in the established care system of particular healthcare facilities is not possible due to insufficient staffing of the department.

40|$|Genomic {{imprinting}} {{results in}} parent-of-origin-dependent monoallelic expression of selected genes. Although their importance in development and physiology is recognized, few imprinted genes {{have been investigated}} for their effects on brain function. Gnas is a complex imprinted locus whose gene products are involved in early <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptations</b> and neuroendocrine functions. Gnas encodes the stimulatory G-protein subunit Gsalpha and two other imprinted protein-coding transcripts. Of these, the Nesp transcript, expressed exclusively from the maternal allele, codes for neuroendocrine secretory protein 55 (Nesp 55), a chromogranin-like polypeptide associated with the constitutive secretory pathway but with an unknown function. Nesp is expressed in restricted brain nuclei, suggesting an involvement in specific behaviors. We have generated a knockout of Nesp 55 in mice. Nesp 55 -deficient mice develop normally, excluding a role of this protein in the severe postnatal effects associated with imprinting of the Gnas cluster. Behavioral analysis of adult Nesp 55 mutants revealed, in three separate tasks, abnormal reactivity to novel environments independent of general locomotor activity and anxiety. This phenotype {{may be related to}} prominent Nesp 55 expression in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus.

We have shown that it elicits various <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptations</b> in terms of growth and glucose metabolism until weaning. Postweaning effects remain to be described. Pony (P), saddlebred (S), and draft (D) horses were used. Control Pony-in-Pony (P-P; n = 21) and Saddlebred-in-Saddlebred (S-S; n = 28) pregnancies were obtained by artificial insemination. Enhanced and restricted pregnancies were obtained by transferring P or S embryos into D mares (Pony-in-Draft [P-D], n = 6 and Saddlebred-in-Draft [S-D], n = 8) and S embryos into P mares (Saddlebred-in-Pony n = 6), respectively. Control and experimental foals were raised by their dams and recipient mothers, respectively and weaned on day 180. Weight gain, growth hormones, and glucose metabolism were investigated in foals between days 180 and 540. Pony-in-Draft (P-D) remained heavier than P-P on days 180, 360, and 540, with lower glucose and higher non-esterified fatty-acids on days 180, 360, and 540 and higher T- 3 on day 180. Insulin sensitivity was similar between pony groups on days 200 and 540. S-P were lighter than S-D on day 180 but caught up by day 540. S-P had higher glucose than S-D on days 180, 360, and 540, as well as lower non-esterified fatty acids and higher T 3 on day 180. Insulin sensitivity was higher in S-P than in S-D on day 200. No difference was observed between saddlebred groups thereafter. In conclusion, in horses, fetal growth is determinant for postnatal metabolism, especially for energy availability.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{patterns}} of early <b>postnatal</b> physiological <b>adaptation</b> and maturation in intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) infants by measuring changes in sleeping deep body temperature, heart rate, and concentrations of urinary cortisol. Setting: At home. Patients: Sixty five IUGR babies and 127 controls matched for sex, social class, and levels of parental smoking. Results: Night time sleeping deep body temperature, heart rate, and cortisol excretion fell with age, eventually establishing an adult type diurnal rhythm of physiological function. Minimum overnight temperature showed a linear decline with age (p < 0. 001), but the IUGR infants and the controls had significant differences in intercept (p = 0. 007) and slope (p = 0. 02). The estimated rate of decline per week was 0. 020 &DEG;C for IUGR infants and 0. 031 &DEG;C for controls. Maximum temperature did not show similar changes. IUGR infants had a mean (SE) age adjusted minimum overnight heart rate that was 4. 2 (1. 5) beats/min (p = 0. 005) higher than controls. Overnight cortisol/creatinine ratios declined with age {{at a rate of}} 4. 1 % per week (log ratio - 0. 421 (0. 0165), p = 0. 01), but the ratio for IUGR infants was on average 42 % higher (log ratio 0. 35 (0. 11), p = 0. 002) than for controls of the same age. Morning cortisol concentrations did not show a similar pattern. Conclusions: <b>Postnatal</b> physiological <b>adaptation</b> and maturation of IUGR infants is slower than normal and therefore they remain in a physiologically immature state for longer.

40|$|Objective Endorphins (EPs) {{present in}} human {{colostrum}} may be relevant for immediate <b>postnatal</b> fetal <b>adaptation</b> because this compound {{is involved in}} stress response and adaptation mechanisms. Endorphin levels in human colostrum are two-fold greater than corresponding maternal plasma levels; however, the high endorphin levels in human milk decrease as lactation continues. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the β-EP concentration in colostrums of women residing in Burkina Faso and Sicily. In addition, we investigated the source of potential differences in β-EP levels between these populations, especially ethnic sources of these deviations. Methods The concentration of β-EP was determined in the colostrum from the first 3 d subsequent to delivery by an enzyme immunoassay as immunoreactive material (IRM). Results The production of β-EP in the colostrum was significantly higher in Burkinabe mothers (0. 83 ± 0. 04 ng/mL) than in Sicilian mothers (0. 31 ± 0. 02 ng/mL) at 24 h after delivery. Colostrum levels of β-EP declined progressively during the first 3 d after delivery in both populations (0. 64 ± 0. 1 and 0. 28 ± 0. 015 ng/mL, respectively, at 72 h). The level of β-EP-IRM correlated significantly with pain and psychological involvement during and after delivery. In addition, the correlation between β-EP-IRM and length of stage II of labor was significant (< P < 0. 0001) in the colostrums of Sicilian mothers who received ergot derivatives, episiorrhaphy, and child birth preparation. The correlation between β-EP-IRM and length of stage II was less significant (P < 0. 001) in the colostrums of Burkinabe mothers who received neither ergot derivatives nor child birth preparation. Conclusion During the first 3 d after labor the β-EP-IRM concentration in the colostrums of Burkinabe mothers differs from that of Sicilians. In addition, because Burkinabe women produce a larger volume of colostrum, their newborns receive, during the first days of life, a larger absolute amount of β-EP-IRM, likely resulting in better <b>postnatal</b> fetal <b>adaptation...</b>|$|R

GC-C activation showed a polar pattern of the effects. GC-C mucosal activation resulted in a potent cGMP-chloride secretion activation and in a marginal enterocyte proliferation. Conversely, serosal GC-C activation induced a potent enterocyte proliferation, through MAP kinase ERK 1 / 2. Finally, the inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 enhanced the Isc increase in response to serosal but not to mucosal ST stimulation, indicating that ERK 1 / 2 also acts as a brake of chloride secretion.

The amino acid glutamine {{plays an important role}} in maintaining functional integrity of the gut. In addition, glutamine is utilised at a high rate by cells of the immune system. In critically ill patients, glutamine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid. VLBW infants may be especially susceptible to glutamine depletion as nutritional supply of glutamine is limited in the first weeks after birth. Glutamine depletion has negative effects on functional integrity of the gut and leads to immunosuppression. This double-blind randomised controlled trial is designed to investigate the effect of glutamine-enriched enteral nutrition on feeding tolerance, infectious morbidity and short-term outcome in VLBW infants. Furthermore, an attempt is made to elucidate the role of glutamine in <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the gut and modulation of the immune response.

Equivalent short-circuit currents (ISC) were measured in Ussing chambers and different kinase inhibitors {{were used to determine}} the pathway of insulin stimulation. In Western Blot measurements the activation of mediators stimulated by insulin was analyzed. The ISC showed a fast dose-dependent increase by insulin, which could be attributed to an increased ENaC (epithelial Na+ channel) activity in experiments with permeabilized apical or basolateral membrane. 5 -(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride inhibition of ISC was not affected, however, benzamil-sensitive ISC was increased in insulin-stimulated monolayers. The application of LY- 294002 and Akti 1 / 2 both completely blocked the stimulating effect of insulin on ISC. PP 242 partly blocked the effect of insulin, whereas Rapamycin evoked no inhibition. Western Blot measurements revealed an increased phosphorylation of AKT after insulin stimulation. SGK 1 activity was also increased by insulin as shown by Western Blot of pNDRG 1. However, in Ussing chamber measurements, GSK 650394, an inhibitor of SGK 1 did not prevent the increase in ISC induced by insulin. The application of IGF- 1 mimicked the effect of insulin and increased the ENaC activity. In addition, an increased autophosphorylation of the IGF- 1 R/IR was observed after insulin stimulation. We conclude that insulin rapidly increases epithelial Na+ transport by enhancing the activity of endogenous ENaC through activation of PI 3 K/AKT in alveolar cells...|$|R

The concentration of S 100 B, in colostrums of the first three days from the delivery, was assessed with commercial immunoluminometric assay. The production of colostrums was significantly higher in Burkinabe women, where the colostrums S 100 B levels in the first day of lactation showed to be at 24 h higher than those of Sicilian mothers (672. 21 ± 256. 67 ng/ml vs 309. 36 ± 65. 28 ng/ml) and progressively decreased reaching the values of Sicilian mothers in the second and third day (204. 31 ± 63. 25 ng/ml and 199. 42 ± 45. 28 ng/ml, respectively). Correlation was found between the level of S 100 B and the length of stage II (duration of expulsive phase of delivery), but the correlation with pain was found only in Burkinabe women. The S 100 B level in colostrums of Burkinabe mothers differs from that of Sicilians only in the first day of lactation, and in consideration that Burkinabe women produce more colostrums, their newborns receive, during the first days of life, an higher amount of S 100 B. The elevated quantity of S 100 B ingested by Burkinabe newborn in the first days of life could promote the physiological <b>postnatal</b> brain <b>adaptation</b> and maturation in the precarious delivery condition of African infants. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{early days}} of {{postnatal}} life in humans and animals have been extensively studied {{over the past few}} years by physiologists, paediatricians, neurologists and others, Whether the approach has been a biochemical or a physiological one, the enormous importance of the changes which take place during the first ten days of life have been widely recognized. Much attention has been paid to the detection of early regulating mechanisms and their specific nature. Data on body temperature, circulation, respiration, biochemical levels such as blood sugar, minerals, blood gases etc., have been collected and analysed. It has been found that there is much variation in the biochemical and physiological values at this time but that this variability decreases during the first few days of life, and it may be concluded that this is due to the development of regulating mechanisms. This phenomenon is known as the <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the infant to extrauterine life. [...] . Zie: Discussion and final conclusions...|$|E
40|$|During development, {{information}} about the three-dimensional shape and mechanical properties {{of the body is}} laid down in the synaptic connectivity of sensorimotor systems through adaptive mechanisms. This functional adaptation occurs through alteration of connection properties. Here, we characterize the differences between strong and weak connections in the nociceptive withdrawal reflex in adult decerebrate spinal rats, representing the preserved end product of the developmental adaptation process. Stronger excitatory reflex connections from the skin onto a muscle had relatively higher gain in their input-output relations, shorter onset latencies (up to similar to 150 ms) and lower trial-to-trial variability in relation to response amplitude (SD similar to mean(1 / 2)) than weaker pathways. Although inhibitory and excitatory nociceptive receptive fields of a muscle overlap to some degree, the results indicate that the inhibitory input is not a major determinant of the gain distribution within the excitatory receptive field and vice versa. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, D- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovalerate (0. 1 - 1 mug), applied topically on the spinal cord reduced the gain, whereas the response amplitude was mainly reduced by an absolute number by the alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole-propionic acid receptor antagonist, 6 -nitro- 7 -sulfamoylbenzo(f) quinoxaline- 2, 3 - dione (1 - 10 mug). The results indicate that NMDA receptors have a critical role in gain regulation in the nociceptive withdrawal reflex system. It is suggested that after normal <b>postnatal</b> experience-dependent <b>adaptation,</b> the number of connections from a given skin site onto the reflex encoding interneurons is a major determinant of the difference in gain...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the S 100 B concentration in colostrums of 51 Burkinabe and 30 Sicilian women, still living in their countries, and in case of a difference to search for its explanations, considering also ethnic differences. The concentration of S 100 B, in colostrums of the first three days from the delivery, was assessed with commercial immunoluminometric assay. The production of colostrums was significantly higher in Burkinabe women, where the colostrums S 100 B levels in the first day of lactation showed to be at 24 h higher than those of Sicilian mothers (672. 21 ± 256. 67 ng/ml vs 309. 36 ± 65. 28 ng/ml) and progressively decreased reaching the values of Sicilian mothers in the second and third day (204. 31 ± 63. 25 ng/ml and 199. 42 ± 45. 28 ng/ml, respectively). Correlation was found between the level of S 100 B and the length of stage II (duration of expulsive phase of delivery), but the correlation with pain was found only in Burkinabe women. The S 100 B level in colostrums of Burkinabe mothers differs from that of Sicilians only in the first day of lactation, and in consideration that Burkinabe women produce more colostrums, their newborns receive, during the first days of life, an higher amount of S 100 B. The elevated quantity of S 100 B ingested by Burkinabe newborn in the first days of life could promote the physiological <b>postnatal</b> brain <b>adaptation</b> and maturation in the precarious delivery condition of African infants...|$|R
40|$|Rabbits {{are born}} blind and deaf and receive unusually limited {{maternal}} care. Consequently, their suckling young heavily {{rely on the}} olfactory cue for nipple attachment. However, the <b>postnatal</b> morphofunctional <b>adaptations</b> of olfactory mucosa (OM) are not fully elucidated. To clarify on the extent and the pattern of refinement of the OM following birth in the rabbit, morphologic and morphometric analysis of the mucosa were done at neonatal (0 - 1 days), suckling (2 weeks), weanling (4 weeks), and adult (6 - 8 months) stages of postnatal development. In all the age groups, the basic components of the OM were present. However, proliferative activity of cells of the mucosal epithelium decreased with increasing age as revealed by Ki- 67 immunostaining. Diameters of axon bundles, packing densities of olfactory cells, and cilia numbers per olfactory cell knob increased progressively with age being 5. 5, 2. 1, and 2. 6 times, respectively, in the adult {{as compared with the}} neonate. Volume fraction values for the bundles increased by 5. 3 % from birth to suckling age and by 7. 4 % from weaning to adulthood and the bundle cores were infiltrated with blood capillaries in all ages except in the adult where such vessels were lacking. The pattern of cilia projection from olfactory cell knobs also showed age-related variations, that is, arose as a tuft from the tips of the knobs in neonates and sucklings and in a radial pattern from the knob bases in weanlings and adults. These morphological changes may be attributed to the high olfactory functional demand associated with postnatal development in the rabbit...|$|R
40|$|CDATA[Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) {{has been}} {{detected}} in the milk of various species, including the pig. It has been speculated that milk-borne TGF- may {{play an important role}} in <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the gut in suckling animals. However, a prerequisite for such a role is the presence of functional TGF- receptors in the gastrointestinal tract of the young. The aim of the present study was to determine if TGF- receptors are present in the small intestine in newborn pigs. The study also aimed to examine the developmental changes of TGF- receptors in the small intestine in suckling pigs. Immunohistochemical staining was used to localize the receptors in the tissue and Western blot analysis was used to determine their molecular characteristics. The level of the receptors present in the tissue was semi-quantified by a computerized image analysis and Western blot analysis. It was observed that TGF- receptors I (RI), II (RII) and III (RIII) all were widely distributed along the small intestine in newborn unsuckled pigs, and the receptors were predominantly localized at the villus epithelium. There was a significant difference in the tissue level for different receptors in newborn piglets, and there was also a significant difference for the receptor level among different regions of the small intestine. The Brunner`s glands in the duodenum of newborn piglets were strongly stained with RIII and the staining intensity in the glands reduced markedly following the onset of suckling. There was also a transient decline in the RI and RII density in the villus epithelium during the first day after birth but a marked increase in positively stained lymphocytes in the lamina propria of the intestinal villi during the immediate postnatal period. It was also observed that the staining of RI and RII at the villus epithelium shifted from the apical membrane in newborn and 3 -day-old piglets to the basolateral membrane in 7 - and 21 -day-old pre-weaning piglets, while the staining intensity for RIII decreased markedly in 7 -day-old pigs. These changes may correlate with the onset of endogenous TGF- production. The findings strongly support the hypothesis of a regulatory role of milk-borne TGF- in <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the intestine in neonatal pigs. ]]...|$|E

40|$|Low birthweight is {{associated}} with increased rates of coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes during adult life. This {{is thought to be}} the consequence of a 'programming', whereby a stimulus or insult at a critical, sensitive period of early life has permanent effects on structure, physiology and metabolism. Programming of the fetus may, hence, result from adaptations to a condition where placental nutrient supply fails to match fetal demand. Recently, compensatory feto-placental up-regulation of the nitric oxide system during fetal growth restriction (FGR) was shown. Particularly, restricted hypoxic fetuses present an elevation of nitrites and a reduction of asymmetric dimethylarginine. S-nitrosohemoglobin is consumed under hypoxic conditions. These events are followed by nitric oxide pathway down-regulation postnatally, increasing susceptibility to cardiovascular disorders later in life. The relative hyperoxia would favor any such occurrence through depletion of tetrahydrobiopterin secondary to oxygen radical formation. This concept may lead to new therapeutic strategies, based on tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation, free-radical scavenging, L-arginine administration and/or inhaled NO therapy in FGR hypoxic newborns, to improve their <b>postnatal</b> <b>adaptation</b> and {{to reduce the risk of}} metabolic pathologies in adult age...|$|E
40|$|Newborn infants must rapidly {{adjust their}} {{physiology}} and behavior {{to the specific}} demands of the novel <b>postnatal</b> environment. This <b>adaptation</b> depends, at least in part, on the infant's ability to learn from experiences. We report here that infants exhibit learning even while asleep. Bioelectrical activity from face and scalp electrodes was recorded from neonates during an eye movement conditioning procedure in which a tone {{was followed by a}} puff of air to the eye. Sleeping newborns rapidly learned the predictive relationship between the tone and the puff. Additionally, {{in the latter part of}} training, these infants exhibited a frontally maximum positive EEG slow wave possibly reflecting memory updating. As newborns spend most of their time sleeping, the ability to learn about external stimuli in the postnatal environment during nonawake states may be crucial for rapid adaptation and infant survival. Furthermore, because eyelid conditioning reflects functional cerebellar circuitry, this method potentially offers a unique approach for early identification of infants at risk for a range of developmental disorders including autism and dyslexia...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is a {{major health}} problem in the Western world. Mean birth weight has {{increased}} during the last 25 years. One {{explanation is that the}} proportion of large for gestational age (LGA) infants has increased. Such infants risk developing obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life. Despite the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia, their <b>postnatal</b> metabolic <b>adaptation</b> has not been investigated. Our data, obtained with stable isotope labeled compounds, demonstrate that newborn LGA infants have increased lipolysis and decreased insulin sensitivity. After administration of glucagon, the plasma levels of glucose and the rate of glucose production increased. The simultaneous increase in insulin correlated with the decrease in lipolysis, indicating an antilipolytic effect of insulin in these infants. We also demonstrated an intergenerational effect of being born LGA, since women born LGA, were at higher risk of giving birth to LGA infants than women not born LGA. Further, the LGA infants formed three subgroups: born long only, born heavy only, and born both long and heavy. Infants born LGA of women with high birth weight or adult obesity were at higher risk of being LGA concerning weight alone, predisposing to overweight and obesity at childbearing age. In addition we found that pregnant women with gestational diabetes were at increased risk of giving birth to infants that were heavy alone. This could explain the risk of both perinatal complications and later metabolic disease in infants of this group of women. To identify determinants of fetal growth, 20 pregnant women {{with a wide range of}} fetal weights were investigated at 36 weeks of gestation. Maternal fat mass was strongly associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was related to glucose production, which correlated positively with fetal size. The variation in resting energy expenditure, which was closely related to fetal weight, was largely explained by BMI, insulin resistance, and glucose production. Lipolysis was not rate limiting for fetal growth in this group of women. Consequently, high maternal glucose production due to a high fat mass may result in excessive fetal growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to evaluate embryo composition and changes in egg yolk fatty acid composition during embryonic development as a function of incubation temperature and age of breeders. Eggs obtained from a common breeder stock at 3 ages: 32 (younger), 42 (mid age), and 65 (older) wk were divided into 2 groups and placed into 2 incubators: the control and the second where eggs were heat-acclimated (HA) at 38. 5 °C for 6 h daily from d 10 to 18 of incubation. Body composition of embryos and chicks were measured on d 14, 18, and at hatch, respectively. Fatty acid profiles of yolk and residual egg yolk sac of chicks were analyzed before incubation and at hatch, respectively. Moisture content of embryos was highest on d 14 and then decreased regardless of parental age and incubation temperature. Moisture content of chicks at hatch from 42 - and 65 -wk parents were lower than those of chicks from 32 -wk parents, whereas the trend in chick fat content was opposite. Incubation temperature had no effect on composition of chicks. Consistently lower cis- 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 - eicosapentaenoic (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA; 22 : 6 n- 3) and cis- 11, 14, 17 - eicosatrienoic (20 : 3 n- 3) fatty acids in the residual yolk sac of chicks than in egg yolks before incubation may have resulted from preferential uptake from the yolk. The DHA content in the residual yolk sac was considerably higher in chicks from older parents incubated at HA, whereas, in contrast, levels of 18 : 3 n- 3 were lower. Also, chicks from younger parents in the HA treatment had lower transported 18 : 3 n- 3 and higher levels of transported DHA. It may be concluded that this process observed during the high incubation temperature may be related to a protective strategy and thus contributes to <b>postnatal</b> heat <b>adaptation.</b> Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu (project no. 155 O 044) and Ege University Scientific Research Projects (project no. 2005 ZRF 039...|$|R
