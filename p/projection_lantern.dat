A set of instruments for optical chemical analysis (1850-1900): a crystal goniometer, a polarimeter, a saccharimeter, a spectroscope, a bunsen burner, a solution tube, gas-discharge tubes. Devices to study, demonstrate and explain the physical qualities of light: prisms and lenses, a heliostat and carbon arc lamp (with clockwork)(1820-1870). A collection of applied optics: a camera, sextant, stereoscope, several telescopes, mechanical lantern slides, a repeating reflecting circle (?), a phantascope (two discs, one with slits, one with images, which when rotating in opposite directions create a cinematographic effect), a <b>projection</b> <b>lantern</b> (1770-1860). Several telescopes: achromatic telescopes (1770 and 1850) and a reflecting telescope (1830). Several electrostatical devices: batteries composed of leyden jars and electrical machines (1770-1800) {{that were used to}} generate electricity. A variety of electrostatic toys and experimentation kits (1770-1820) to amuse and educate the public. Some show cases still to do.|$|E

50|$|In 1911 Fletcher was {{the first}} student ever to earn a Ph.D. summa cum laude from the University of Chicago. His {{dissertation}} research was on methods to determine the charge of an electron. This included the oil drop experiment commonly attributed to his advisor and collaborator, Robert Andrews Millikan. Millikan took sole credit, in return for Fletcher claiming full authorship on a related result for his dissertation. Fletcher's contributions were detail-oriented but still contributed to the successful experiment, in which he incorporated, among other things, experience with <b>projection</b> <b>lanterns.</b> Millikan {{went on to win}} the 1923 Nobel Prize for Physics, in part for this work, and Fletcher kept the agreement a secret until his death.|$|R

No clear evidence of deceit seems to ever have been found, but critics have described several suspicions. The techniques that Schrepfer reportedly used for his elaborate effects included: actors performing as ghosts, ventriloquism, hidden speaking tubes, glass harmonica sounds, aromatic smoke, camera obscura <b>projections</b> and/or magic <b>lantern</b> <b>projections</b> on smoke, concave mirror projections and staged thunder.|$|R
50|$|Most spectators of Schrepfer's séances were {{convinced}} that the apparitions they saw were real. No clear evidence of deceit seems to ever have been found, but critics have described several suspicions. A local merchant who frequented Schrepfer's lodge claimed in his diary that he once barred {{the door behind them}} before the seance had started. Consequently the expected ghost was heard fiddling with the lock, but failed to enter. Another time he hid under the table and recognized the shoes of a ghost as the shoes he had sold the day before to Schrepfer's oldest marqueur. Schrepfer had once rather suspiciously refused to raise the spirit of the famous poet Christian Fürchtegott Gellert who had been known in person by some of the spectators. Among the techniques that Schrepfer reportedly used for his elaborate effects were actors performing as ghosts, ventriloquism, hidden speaking tubes, glass harmonica sounds, aromatic smoke, camera obscura <b>projections,</b> magic <b>lantern</b> <b>projections</b> on smoke, concave mirror projections and staged thunder.|$|R
50|$|Johann Georg Schrepfer, or Johann Georg Schröpfer (1738? - 8 October 1774 in Leipzig) was a German charlatan, {{independent}} Freemason, and necromancer. He performed ghost-raising séances {{for which}} he secretly used special effects, possibly including magic <b>lantern</b> <b>projections</b> of ghosts on smoke, which inspired the phantasmagoria shows popular in Europe from the 1790s to the 1830s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports and}} illustrations of <b>lantern</b> <b>projections</b> {{suggest that they}} were all intended to scare the audience. Pierre Petit, who probably saw a show by Walgensten, called the apparatus [...] "lanterne de peur" [...] (lantern of fear) in a 1664 letter to Huygens. Surviving lantern plates and descriptions from the next decades prove that the new medium was not just used for horror shows, but that all kinds of subjects were projected.|$|R
5000|$|Fantasmagoriana {{takes its}} name from Étienne-Gaspard Robert's , a phantasmagoria show (fantasmagoria, from , [...] "fantasy" [...] or [...] "hallucination", and {{possibly}} αγορά, agorá, [...] "assembly" [...] or [...] "meeting", with the suffix [...] ) of the late 1790s and early 1800s, using magic <b>lantern</b> <b>projection</b> through smoke together with ventriloquism and other sound effects to give the impression of ghosts (fantôme). This is appended with the suffix , which [...] "denotes a collection of objects or information relating to a particular individual, subject, or place".|$|R
50|$|Thomas Kirby Van Zandt (March 7, 1814 - January 2, 1886) was {{a painter}} {{active in the}} Albany, New York region. He is remembered for his {{paintings}} of race horses for owners including Leland Stanford, Erastus Corning, and Eli Whitney, but also painted bust-length portraits of Albany citizens, dogs, and other animals. It has been hypothesized (see Ione) that Van Zandt traced his horse figures from <b>lantern</b> <b>projections</b> of Eadweard Muybridge's celebrated photographs. Van Zandt is buried in the Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.|$|R
50|$|Phylidor {{referenced}} Johann Georg Schrepfer and Cagliostro {{in several}} advertisements. In the early 1770s Johann Georg Schrepfer had performed Masonic necromantic rituals and experiments, raising ghosts that were probably created with many hidden techniques including magic <b>lantern</b> <b>projections</b> on smoke. Soon after Schrepfer's death {{there was a}} boom of publications either attacking or defending his supposed supernatural abilities, expanding Schrepfer's fame across Europe. Several publications included explanations of techniques he might have used to conjure apparitions, which inspired several people to try to recreate Schrepfer's séances. Cagliostro was thought to have performed similar séances.|$|R
40|$|Mark Broughton, ???Dissolving Spectators: Lantern History and the Royal Polytechnic Institution???, paper {{presented}} at the <b>Lantern</b> <b>Projections</b> Colloquium, London, UK, 12 - 24 February, 2001. There appear to be very few descriptions and drawings of lantern slides projected at the Royal Polytechnic Institution, compared with accounts and depictions of other kinds of magic lantern show. This paper asks firstly why this is so, and then goes on to ask what kind of historiography we need to reconstruct the events based on a paucity of evidence and what we might learn about the Royal Polytechnic's lantern spectaculars through this historiography...|$|R
5000|$|There {{probably}} existed quite a {{few other}} types of projectors than the examples described below, but evidence is scarce and reports are often unclear about their nature. Spectators not always provided the details needed to differentiate between for instance a shadow play and a <b>lantern</b> <b>projection.</b> Many {{did not understand the}} nature of what they had seen and few had ever seen other comparable media. Projections were often presented or perceived as magic or even as religious experiences, with most projectionists unwilling to share their secrets. Joseph Needham sums up some possible projection examples from China in his 1962 book series Science and Civilization in China ...|$|R
5000|$|Some ancient {{sightings}} of gods and spirits {{are thought to}} have been conjured up by means of (concave) mirrors, camera obscura or magic <b>lantern</b> <b>projections.</b> By the 16th century necromantic ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan [...] "magicians" [...] and [...] "witches" [...] seemed commonplace. In his 1613 book Opticorum Libri Sex Belgian Jesuit mathematician, physicist and architect François d'Aguilon described how some charlatans cheated people out of their money by claiming they knew necromancy and would raise the specters of the devil from hell to show them to the audience inside a dark room. The image of an assistant with a devil's mask was projected through a lens into the dark room, scaring the uneducated spectators.|$|R
25|$|The {{background}} {{for the creation of}} the Orton and Spooner Ghost House might be seen in 18th and 19th-century London and Paris, when literature, performances by magicians, spiritualists and psychics, as well as theatrical shows and attractions introduced the public to gruesome entertainment. In 1802, Marie Tussaud scandalized British audiences with an exhibition of wax sculptures of decapitated victims of the French Revolution, including King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Robespierre and Jean-Paul Marat. Her exhibits exist today as the Chamber of Horrors in Madam Tussauds in London. In France, from 1897, the Grand Guignol theatre was scaring audiences with graphically staged horror entertainment. The Phantasmagoria show existed even earlier, but a well-known version in 1797 Paris was the Fantasmagorie, which made use of magic <b>lantern</b> <b>projections</b> and crude special effects.|$|R

40|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to understand the role of the camera obscura in Renaissance painting. This study tries to understand the actual practice necessary to produce the image. Based on original artifacts as well as reconstructions I will first explore the functioning and making of the device, especially that of the lenses. From there I will illuminate the practice required to project and control the image. In order to comprehend historic practice I will draw on comparions from astronomical lenses and especially magic <b>lantern</b> <b>projections.</b> I will try to show how historic observers could rely on their optical instruments and media and thereby were able to come to a judgement on what they saw and what they wanted to see. I will conclude that not the quality of the projected image but first of all the observer’s visual judgement was at the very center of camera obscura practice...|$|R
50|$|Projection {{of images}} can occur {{naturally}} when rays of light {{pass through a}} small hole and produce an inverted image on a surface in a dark area behind the hole. This phenomenon is known as camera obscura or pinhole image. Its oldest known recorded description is found in Chinese Mohist writings dated to circa 400 BCE. However, people have probably witnessed and made use of occurrences of the phenomenon since prehistoric times. It {{has been suggested that}} distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave paintings were possibly based on distortions seen in pinhole images formed through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide. Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits, especially in temple worship, are thought to possibly have been conjured up by means of camera obscura or proto magic <b>lantern</b> <b>projections.</b> In Arab and European science the camera obscura was used in darkened rooms since circa 1000 CE to study light and especially sun eclipses.|$|R
5000|$|Information, {{especially}} about Smith's early films, is uncertain, {{due to the}} work-in-progress nature of experimental filmmaking. He frequently reedited them (hence the different runtimes), incorporating on various occasions reassembled footage of different film to be viewed with varying music tracks. For instance, the handmade films now known as No. 1, 2, 3, and 5 were accompanied by an improvising jazz band on May 12, 1950 when they premiered {{as part of the}} Art in Cinema series curated by Smith's friend Frank Stauffacher at the San Francisco Museum of Art, though Smith had originally intended them to be accompanied by recordings of beat favorite Dizzy Gillespie. Later he showed the films with random records or even the radio as accompaniment. Smith stated that his films were made for contemporary music, and he kept changing their soundtracks. At the urging of his friend Rosemarie [...] "Rosebud" [...] Feliu-Pettet, Smith also re-cut Early Abstractions to sync with Meet the Beatles!. After Smith's death, artists such as John Zorn, Philip Glass or DJ Spooky provided musical backgrounds for screenings of his films: Zorn at many screenings at Anthology Film Archives (where he is composer-in-residence) as part of his Essential Cinema project, Glass at the 2004 summer benefit concert of the Film-Makers' Cooperative and DJ Spooky at several venues in 1999 for Harry Smith: A Re-creation, an embroidered compendium of Smith's films put together by his close collaborator M. Henry Jones who tries to screen the films in the manner intended by Smith - as performances - using stroboscopic effects, multiple <b>projections,</b> magic <b>lanterns,</b> and the like.|$|R
