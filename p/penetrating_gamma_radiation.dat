50|$|Neutron {{radiation}} {{is often called}} indirectly ionizing radiation. It does not ionize atoms {{in the same way}} that charged particles such as protons and electrons do (exciting an electron), because neutrons have no charge. However, neutron interactions are largely ionizing, for example when neutron absorption results in gamma emission and the gamma ray (photon) subsequently removes an electron from an atom, or a nucleus recoiling from a neutron interaction is ionized and causes more traditional subsequent ionization in other atoms. Because neutrons are uncharged, they are more penetrating than alpha radiation or beta radiation. In some cases they are more <b>penetrating</b> than <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation,</b> which is impeded in materials of high atomic number. In materials of low atomic number such as hydrogen, a low energy gamma ray may be more penetrating than a high energy neutron.|$|R

50|$|The Total {{effective}} dose equivalent (TEDE) is a radiation dosimetry quantity {{defined by the}} US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to monitor and control human exposure to ionizing radiation. It is defined differently in the NRC regulations and NRC glossary. According to the regulations, it {{is the sum of}} {{effective dose}} equivalent from external exposure and committed effective dose equivalent from internal exposure, thereby taking into account all known exposures. However, the NRC glossary defines it as the sum of the deep-dose equivalent and committed effective dose equivalent, which would appear to exclude the effective dose to the skin and eyes from non-penetrating radiation such as beta. These surface doses are included in the NRC's shallow dose equivalent, along with contributions from <b>penetrating</b> (<b>gamma)</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> {{induced changes}} in the optical and {{electrical}} properties of tellurium dioxide (TeO 2) thin films, prepared by thermal evaporation, have been studied in detail. The optical characterization of the as-deposited thin films {{and that of the}} thin films exposed to various levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose clearly show that the optical bandgap decreases with increase in the <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose up to a certain dose. At <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> doses above this value, however, the optical bandgap has been found to increase. On the other hand, the current vs voltage plots for the as-deposited thin films and those for the thin films exposed to various levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose show that the current increases with the <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose up to a certain dose and that the value of this particular dose depends upon the thickness of the film. The current has, however, been found to decrease with further increase in <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose.

5000|$|In {{presenting}} its product, the 360 Gamma, StemRad {{has gone}} against {{conventional wisdom that}} in order to protect one must shield as much of the body as possible. The problem with trying to protect the whole body is the resulting weight, as outlined by Nobel Laureate Michael Levitt: [...] "To make a full body suit with this level of protection would weigh something like 200 Kg". Thus, pre-existing shielding solutions had always been made using only thin layers of inherently heavy radiation-attenuating material to allow for mobility. This type of shielding is effective only for blocking of alpha and beta radiation, yet is ineffective in blocking highly <b>penetrating</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation.</b> Existing shielding is therefore incapable of preventing the acute health effects of exposure to gamma radiation (i.e. Acute Radiation Syndrome - ARS). StemRad's product line differs markedly in that it does not attempt to protect the whole body of the wearer but rather selectively protects the bone marrow-rich pelvic region.|$|E

Both the leachates and the reacted glass monoliths were analyzed to characterize the reaction. Radiation was seen to acidify the leachates, but the high bicarbonate content of the groundwater prevented the pH values from dropping below 6. 4. The glass reaction tended to raise the pH. Glasses based on SRL 165 black frit and PNL 76 - 68 glass compositions were leached. The SRL 165 type glasses were quite durable (as measured by the elemental mass loss after constant reaction times) and were unaffected by radiation. The PNL 76 - 68 glasses were much less durable, with the durability decreasing (after constant reaction times) as the exposure rate was increased.
