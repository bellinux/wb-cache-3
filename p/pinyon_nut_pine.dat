5000|$|Pinus cembroides, {{also known}} as pinyon <b>pine,</b> Mexican <b>pinyon,</b> Mexican <b>nut</b> <b>pine,</b> and Mexican stone pine, is a pine in the pinyon pine group, native to western North America. It grows in areas {{with low levels of}} {{rainfall}} and its range extends southwards from Arizona, Texas and New Mexico in the United States into Mexico. It typically grows at altitudes between 1600 and 2400 m. It is a small pine growing to about 20 m with a trunk diameter of up to 50 cm. The seeds are large and form part of the diet of the Mexican jay and Abert's squirrel. They are also collected for human consumption, being the most widely used <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> in Mexico. This is a common pine with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with <b>pinyon</b> <b>pine</b> <b>nuts.</b> Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them {{at the very top of}} the mountain ridges where they harvested <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|R
50|$|National Park Service naturalist, Will Neely {{created a}} list of the plants {{commonly}} used by the Ahwahnechee. Black oak, sugar pine, western juniper, canyon live oak, interior live oak, foothill <b>pine,</b> buckeye, <b>pinyon</b> <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> provided acorns and seeds for food. Other plants provided smaller seeds. Mariposa tulip, golden brodiaea, common camas, squaw root, and Bolander's yampah provided edible bulbs and roots. Greens eaten by the Ahwahnechee included broad-leaved lupine, common monkey flower, nude buckwheat, California thistle, miner's lettuce, sorrel, clover, umbrella plant, crimson columbine, and alum root. Strawberry, blackberry, raspberry, thimbleberry, wild grape, gooseberry, currant, blue elderberry, western choke cherry, Sierra plum, and greenleaf manzanita provided berries and fruits.|$|R
5000|$|Montezuma also figures {{prominently}} in {{the religion of the}} Pueblo Indians, who held that their god-king Montezuma was variously from Taos, Acoma, or one of the other pueblos, and was conceived from a beautiful virgin and a <b>pinyon</b> <b>pine</b> <b>nut.</b> Although weak as a youth, he was chosen to be their unlikely leader, and surprised everyone with his miracles, including the ability to produce rain. He taught the people their customs, and how to build the adobe pueblos. One day he kindled a fire that they were never to allow to burn out, then departed for Mexico (in some versions, on the back of an eagle), promising to return some day and save them from the Spanish.|$|R
50|$|As village-dwelling and {{sedentary}} Pueblo Indians, the Tompiros {{lived in}} a marginal climate. Their region was more than 6,000 feet in elevation, near the upper climatic limit for corn cultivation. They had little surface water for irrigation, rainfall was sparse and sporadic, and winters were long and cold. What made the Tompiro settlements viable was their proximity to salt deposits in the Salinas and to the bison herds of the Great Plains. Thus, they were important traders and middlemen between the Plains Indians and the Pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley for salt and bison skins and meat. The Tompiros also hunted small and large game in the region, especially deer, pronghorn, and rabbits and gathered wild foods, including <b>pinyon</b> <b>pine</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The pinyon jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) {{takes its}} name from the tree, and <b>pinyon</b> <b>nuts</b> form an {{important}} part of its diet. It is very important for regeneration of pinyon woods, as it stores large numbers of the seeds in the ground for later use, and excess seeds not used are in an ideal position to grow into new trees. The Mexican jay is also important for the dispersal of some pinyon species, as, less often, is the Clark's nutcracker. Many other species of animal also eat <b>pinyon</b> <b>nuts,</b> without dispersing them.|$|R
25|$|The Jicarilla used acorns, chokecherries, juniper berries, {{mesquite}} beans, <b>pinyon</b> <b>nuts,</b> {{prickly pear}} fruit, and yucca fruit, {{as well as}} many different kinds of other fruits, acorns, greens, nuts, and seed grasses.|$|R
50|$|The pinyon or piñon pine group {{grows in}} the southwestern United States and in Mexico. The trees yield edible <b>pinyon</b> <b>nuts,</b> which were {{a staple of the}} Native Americans, and are still widely eaten as a snack in New Mexican cuisine. The name comes from the Spanish Pino piñonero, a name used for both the American {{varieties}} and the Stone Pine common in Spain, which also produces edible piñon nuts typical of Mediterranean cuisine. Harvesting techniques of the prehistoric Indians are still being used to today to collect the pinyon seeds for personal use or for commercialization. The <b>pinyon</b> <b>nut</b> or seed is high in fats and calories.|$|R
25|$|Also eaten were mulberries, narrowleaf yucca blossoms, narrowleaf yucca stalks, nipple cactus fruit, one-seed juniper berries, onions, pigweed seeds, <b>pinyon</b> <b>nuts,</b> {{pitahaya}} fruit, {{prickly pear}} fruit, prickly pear juice, raspberries, screwbean (or tornillo) fruit, saguaro fruit, spurge seeds, strawberries, sumac (Rhus trilobata) berries, sunflower seeds, tule rootstocks, tule shoots, pigweed tumbleweed seeds, unicorn plant seeds, walnuts, {{western yellow pine}} inner bark (used as a sweetener), western yellow <b>pine</b> <b>nuts,</b> whitestar potatoes (Ipomoea lacunosa), wild grapes, wild potatoes (Solanum jamesii), wood sorrel leaves, and yucca buds (unknown species).

50|$|The pinyon has {{probably}} {{been a source of}} food since shortly after the earliest arrival of Homo sapiens in the American southwest, 12,000 or more years ago. In the Great Basin of the United States, archaeological evidence indicates that the range of the pinyon pine expanded northward after the Ice Age, reaching its northernmost (and present) limit in southern Idaho about 4,000 BCE. Hunter/gatherer Indians undoubtedly collected the edible seeds, but, at least in some areas, the <b>pinyon</b> <b>nuts</b> were not harvested and eaten in quantity until about 600 CE. Increased use of <b>pinyon</b> <b>nuts</b> was possibly related to a population increase of humans and a {{decline in the number of}} game animals, thereby forcing the Great Basin inhabitants to seek additional sources of food.|$|R
5000|$|The Late Basketmaker II Era (AD 50 to 500) was a {{cultural}} period of Ancient Pueblo People when people began living in pit-houses, raised maize and squash, and were proficient basket makers and weavers. They also hunted game and gathered wild foods, such as <b>pinyon</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R

40|$|A rich archaeological record {{spanning}} {{much of the}} Holocene {{exists in}} the Coso Range of southeastern California. An archaeological survey of over 2, 564 acres was focused within the pinyon-juniper zone of these uplands at Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake. In total, 184 prehistoric sites were recorded, and are used here to evaluate a series of alternative models regarding the origins of intensive <b>pinyon</b> <b>nut</b> use in the southwestern Great Basin. These findings indicate that fully-ripened nuts were probably used {{on a regular basis}} deep into antiquity, but the more intensive(and expensive) harvest of green-cone <b>pinyon</b> <b>nuts</b> largely occurred after 1, 350 B. P This conclusion has important implications for interpreting prehistoric land-use patterns in the region, and supports earlier hypotheses about the mechanisms responsible for the spread of Numic populations during the later phases of prehistory...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a methodology for controlled pollination of Araucaria angustifolia, aiming at the genetic improvement of the species and increased yield of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> through management with supplemental pollination. A methodology of controlled pollination was developed in which several experiments were carried out in 2003 - 2005 period. The effects of the following parameters were evaluated: controlled pollination, amount of pollen applied per female strobilus, time of pollination, and development stage of the female strobilus during pollination on the number of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> yielded per <b>pine</b> cone. A single controlled pollination procedure results in low yield of fully filled <b>pine</b> <b>nuts,</b> and pollination at later development stages of the female strobilus results in high yields of fully filled <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> per <b>pine</b> cone. Controlled pollination in A. angustifolia proved effective for <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> production and its application in oriented breeding procedures will enable breeding that up until now was considered impossible in nature on account of the considerable distance between the parent plants. Controlled pollination performed twice in female strobili more than 30 mm in diameter does increase the yield of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> per <b>pine</b> cone...|$|R

40|$|Congress {{designated}} the Kiavah Wilderness in 1994 under the California Desert Protection Act. It {{is located in}} the Scodie Mountains in Kern County, ca. 24 km (15 mi) east of Lake Isabella and 24 km (15 mi) west of Ridgecrest, and encompasses a total of 137 mi 2 (354 km 2) with elevations ranging from 1000 to 2200 m (3500 – 7294 ft). The Wilderness is ecologically important because it occurs in a transition zone between two floristic provinces, the Sierra Nevada of the California Floristic Province and the Mojave Desert of the Desert Province. It is of cultural significance because it has a rich history of Native Americans harvesting <b>pinyon</b> <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> and inhabiting the land. Prior to the study ca. 290 vascular plant taxa had been documented, primarily along roads and the Pacific Crest Trail. Jim Shevock and Barbara Ertter made significant collections and contributions to the floristic inventory during the 1980 s and early 1990 s, and LeRoy Gross added valuable collections in 2005 and 2006. The purpose of the project was to inventory the vascular plant taxa throughout the Kiavah Wilderness, document special status plants, and assess invasive non-native plants. The project took place in 2013 – 2015, and 68 days were spent in the field. It coincided with three severe to exceptional drought years, the driest span for the site in recorded history. During the study large stands of Pinus monophylla, found in the Wilderness and much of the Southwest, experienced large die-offs. About 1300 plant specimens were collected for the study, which are deposited at RSA, CAS, and UCR. In total, 70 families, 240 genera, 457 species, and 477 minimum-rank taxa were documented, including those collected previously. A total of 28 non-native taxa (5. 9 % of the flora) and 26 special status plants (5. 4 %) were documented. Three special status taxa previously documented in the Wilderness were not relocated: Lewisia disepala (Montiaceae), Cordylanthus rigidus subsp. brevibracteatus (Orobanchaceae), and Delphinium purpusii (Ranunculaceae). A range extension for Eriophyllum mohavense (Asteraceae) was documented...|$|R
