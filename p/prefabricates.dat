40|$|INTRODUCTION The current {{programming}} {{model of}} the Web revolves around application servers [5]. The application server architecture offloads most processing to a server, which hosts the application and <b>prefabricates</b> views (e. g., HTML pages) for the Web browser.

ENVIRONMENT CONSTRAINTS A successful application for personal wireless devices must deal {{with an array of}} constraints. The first set of constraints pertains to pocket-sized devices in general: limited processing power and memory space [6]; reduced screen real estate and limited input capabilities [7]. Another set of constraints pertains to wireless devices: limited bandwidth; disconnected operation; expensive airtime.

50|$|The {{project was}} also {{complicated}} by its required early-summer completion date, meaning {{that much of}} the work had to be done during the winter and early spring months when weather conditions posed a significant challenge.

Site-specific innovations in prefabrication and construction methods minimized outdoor work at the site and departed from conventional bridge-building practice. This careful consideration and planning resulted in a project completed on schedule and at low cost, despite the extreme conditions.|$|R
