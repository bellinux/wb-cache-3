25|$|Lindane, {{also known}} as gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, (γ-HCCH), gammaxene, Gammallin and {{sometimes}} incorrectly called benzene hexachloride (BHC), is an organochlorine chemical variant of hexachlorocyclohexane {{that has been used}} both as an agricultural insecticide and as a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>treatment</b> for lice and scabies.|$|E

25|$|The {{chemical}} {{was originally}} synthesised in 1825 by Faraday. It {{is named after}} the Dutch chemist Teunis van der Linden (1884–1965), the first to isolate and describe γ-hexachlorcyclohexane in 1912. Its pesticidal action was discovered only in 1942, after which lindane production, by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI), and use started up in the United Kingdom. It {{has been used to}} treat food crops and forestry products, as a seed treatment, a soil treatment, and to treat livestock and pets. It has also been used as <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>treatment</b> for lice and scabies, formulated as a shampoo or lotion. Between 1950 and 2000, an estimated 600,000 tonnes of lindane were produced globally, {{and the vast majority of}} which was used in agriculture. It has been manufactured by several countries, including the United States, China, Brazil, and several European countries, but as of 2007, only India and possibly Russia are still producing it.|$|E
25|$|There is {{significant}} controversy with the PIE and BICEPS principles. Throughout {{a number of}} wars, but notably during the Vietnam War, {{there has been a}} conflict among doctors about sending distressed soldiers back to combat. During the Vietnam War this reached a peak with much discussion about the ethics of this process. Proponents of the PIE and BICEPS principles argue that it leads to a reduction of long-term disability but opponents argue that combat stress reactions lead to long-term problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The use of psychiatric drugs to treat victims of CSR has also attracted criticism, as some military psychiatrists have come to question the efficacy of such drugs on the long term health of veterans. Concerns have been expressed as to the effect of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>treatment</b> on an already elevated substance abuse rate among former CSR sufferers. Recent research has caused an increasing number of scientists to believe {{that there may be a}} physical (i.e., neurocerebral damage) rather than psychological basis for blast trauma. As traumatic brain injury and combat stress reaction have very different causes yet result in similar neurologic symptoms, researchers emphasize the need for greater diagnostic care.|$|E
2500|$|The World Health Organization classifies lindane as [...] "moderately hazardous", and its {{international}} trade is restricted and regulated under the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent. In 2009, {{the production and}} agricultural use of lindane was banned under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. A specific exemption to that ban allows it {{to continue to be}} used as a second-line <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>treatment</b> for lice and scabies.|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, Leonore Tiefer of NYU School of Medicine voiced {{concerns}} {{that the success of}} Viagra, in combination with feminist rhetoric, were being used as a means of fast-tracking public acceptance of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>treatment</b> of female sexual arousal disorder. The justification behind this, she says, is that [...] "the branding of Viagra has succeeded so thoroughly in rationalizing the idea of sexual correction and enhancement through pills that it seems inevitable and only fair that such a product be made available for women", giving a dangerous appeal to [...] "nonapproved drugs though off-label prescribing." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine factors that {{contribute}} to adverse incidents by creating a model that included patient characteristics, clinical conditions, nursing unit context of care variables, medical <b>treatments,</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>treatments,</b> and nursing treatments.

The sample included older adults hospitalized during a four-year period at one, academic medical facility in the Midwestern United States who were at risk for falling.

Total registered nurse (RN) hours per patient day (HPPD) and HPPDs dropping below the nursing unit average were significant explanatory variables for experiencing an adverse incident.

5000|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} advances in identification of human deafness genes and elucidation of their cellular mechanisms {{as well as}} their physiological function in mice. [...] Nevertheless, pharmacological treatment options are very limited and clinically unproven. Such <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>treatments</b> as are employed are palliative rather than curative, and addressed to the underlying cause if one can be identified, in order to avert progressive damage.|$|R
50|$|Adverse effects at targets {{other than}} those desired for <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>treatments</b> often occur with drugs that are nonspecific. If a drug can bind to {{unexpected}} proteins, receptors, or enzymes that can alter different pathways {{other than those}} desired for treatment, severe downstream effects can develop. An {{example of this is}} the drug eplerenone (aldosterone receptor antagonist), which should increase aldosterone levels, but has shown to produce atrophy of the prostate.|$|R
