5|$|Philadelphians {{elected a}} seventeen-member city council in 1955, with ten members {{representing}} districts of the city, {{and the remaining}} seven being elected at-large. For the at-large seats, each political <b>party</b> <b>could</b> nominate five candidates, and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority <b>party</b> <b>could</b> only take {{five of the seven}} seats, leaving two for the minority party. The Democrats' citywide dominance continued into the city council races, as they retained control of nine of ten districts and five of seven at-large seats.|$|E
5|$|This created fairly limited {{circumstances}} in which a <b>party</b> <b>could</b> sue on behalf of another, if the other party would {{have benefited from the}} contract.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{thirteen}} seats open for magistrate, a local court, {{the duties of}} which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court. In the magistrate races, each political <b>party</b> <b>could</b> nominate eight candidates, and voters could only vote for eight, with the result being that the majority <b>party</b> <b>could</b> only take eight of the thirteen seats, leaving five for the minority party. The Democrats took {{the maximum number of}} eight magistracies, with incumbents Vincent A. Dean and William Cibotti leading the ticket. Republicans were held to just the five slots allotted them, with incumbent Benjamin W. Schwartz taking the most votes of his party's nominees.|$|E
50|$|Later, in 1880, the new Shari'a Courts Ordinance {{introduced}} the hierarchical judiciary. Through the Ministry of Justice, <b>parties</b> <b>could</b> {{appeal to the}} Cairo Shari'a Court against decisions of provincial qadis and ni'ibs.

5|$|Under the new charter, Philadelphians {{elected a}} seventeen-member city council in 1951, with ten members {{representing}} districts of the city, {{and the remaining}} seven being elected at-large. By {{the rules of the}} limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political <b>party</b> <b>could</b> nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result that the majority <b>party</b> <b>could</b> only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. The Democrats' citywide triumph continued into the city council races, as they took nine of ten districts and five of seven at-large seats.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large {{seat on the}} Philadelphia City Council. By {{the rules}} of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each {{political}} <b>party</b> <b>could</b> nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority <b>party</b> <b>could</b> only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from Bhopal to Mumbai {{was held}} up by {{a large group of}} {{passengers}} headed for a marriage in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that the wedding party was politically connected and attempted to coerce the cabin crew to disembark passengers, so that additional members of their <b>party</b> <b>could</b> be accommodated. The airline claimed it was a technical glitch in their booking system which led to overbooking.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} commander at Taizhou ordered his officer Zhai Yong to escort Choe Bu's Korean {{party to the}} regional command centre at Shaoxing on March 6. From there they could be transferred to provincial authorities at Hangzhou and finally to the empire's capital of Beijing where the <b>party</b> <b>could</b> be officially escorted back to Korea. Choe Bu and his officers were carried in sedan chairs, an accommodation provided by the Taizhou Battalion, although in spots of rough terrain Choe Bu and his officers were forced to walk on foot like the others.|$|E
5|$|While Sawyer {{was serving}} overseas, the reform {{coalition}} swept the Democrats into power in Philadelphia {{for the first}} time in 67 years. When he returned to Philadelphia, Clark asked him to run for an at-large seat on City Council in 1955. By the rules of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political <b>party</b> <b>could</b> nominate five candidates and voters could only choose five. The result was that the majority <b>party</b> <b>could</b> take only five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Sawyer was elected to one such seat and served a single four-year term. In that position, he sponsored legislation to establish the city's One Percent for Fine Arts program, which required one percent of the cost of construction projects in Center City to be spent on public art. He also worked for the creation of a Police Review Board. City Council did not pass that bill, but Mayor James Tate later created the board through an executive order.|$|E
5|$|Aflaq {{at first}} {{extended}} his {{support to the}} new government, believing {{that he and the}} Ba'ath <b>Party</b> <b>could</b> collaborate with Shishakli because they shared the same Arab nationalist sentiments. His analysis of Shishakli proved to be wrong, and one of Shishakli's first decisions as ruler was to ban all political parties, including the Ba'ath Party. The Ba'ath Party leadership, and several leading members, escaped to Lebanon in the wake of increased government repression. In Lebanon Aflaq and al-Bitar agreed to a merger of the Arab Ba'ath Party and the Arab Socialist Party (ASP), led by Akram al-Hawrani, to establish the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952. The newly formed party worked as a base of operation against Shishali's rule – Aflaq and the rest cooperated with non-Ba'athist opposition forces too. Shishakli was toppled in February 1954.|$|E

5|$|After taking {{power in}} the 1963 Syrian coup d'état, officially the 8th of March Revolution, a power {{struggle}} broke erupted between the Nasserites in the National Council for the Revolutionary Command and the Ba'ath Party. The Nasserites sought to reestablish the United Arab Republic, the former federation encompassing Egypt and Syria from 1958 to 1961, on Gamal Abdel Nasser's terms, the Ba'athists were skeptical of a new union with Nasser, and wanted a loose federation where the Ba'ath <b>Party</b> <b>could</b> rule Syria alone without interference. The Nasserites mobilised large street demonstrations in favour of a union. It took time before the Ba'ath Party knew {{how to respond to}} the issue, since the majority of Syrian Arab Nationalists were not adherents to Ba'athism, but of Nasserism and Nasser in general.|$|E
5|$|Cunard was in {{significant}} financial difficulties when Smallpeice joined, and posted {{a loss of}} $7.2 million in 1965, losing money on the passenger ships and making profits on their shipping line. Smallpeice initially attempted to resolve the financial position of the company by embarking on a merger with another shipping line. Ocean Steamship Company had previously asked that they have first refusal on a merger with Cunard. Ocean Steamship brought P into the discussions, and a three-way merger at one point looked feasible, but neither <b>party</b> <b>could</b> see any benefit in a deal involving Cunard, and backed out of proposed deal.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{almost half}} of the Tories' {{campaign}} funds were spent in Quebec, a province in which the party won only four of seventy-five seats. After the 1953 election, Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation. He concluded that the Progressive Conservatives were ill-advised to continue pouring money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province; the Tories could win at least a minority government by maximizing their opportunities in English-speaking Canada, and if the <b>party</b> <b>could</b> also manage to win twenty seats in Quebec, it could attain a majority. Churchill's conclusions were ignored by most leading Tories—except Diefenbaker.|$|E

5|$|Pliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was {{in command}} of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had {{meanwhile}} decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her <b>party</b> <b>could</b> only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a <b>party</b> <b>could</b> stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E
5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} <b>party</b> <b>could</b> never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running {{for re-election}}. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed {{a bill that would}} allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up. Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican <b>Party</b> <b>could</b> decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1837 and the {{depression}} that followed caused many to blame Van Buren and his Democratic Party {{for the hard}} times, making {{it more likely that}} the Whig nominee in 1840 would be the next president. In addition to Harrison and Webster, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky sought the nomination, as did General Winfield Scott. Some Whigs argued that because {{the depression}} was driving many to their ranks, {{there was no need to}} nominate a relative outsider such as Harrison; the <b>party</b> <b>could</b> win behind one of its statesmen, Clay or Webster, and by 1838, Clay was the frontrunner. A slaveholder, he commanded the near-united support of the South, though this came at the price of alienating many Northern Whigs. There was wide consensus in the party that a national convention was needed to decide on a presidential candidate, and in late 1837, the Whig congressional caucus agreed to work with the state parties to organize a convention. After considerable maneuvering, a convention to nominate candidates for president and vice president was called by the congressional caucus in May 1838, to be held at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania beginning on December 4, 1839. Having failed to gain much support, Webster dropped out of the race in June 1839.|$|E
5|$|When Constantine {{returned}} to Trinidad in late 1954, {{he found a}} growing desire for independence from Britain. At Trinidad Leaseholds he felt isolated from other, mainly white, senior staff; this drew him towards political involvement. Eric Williams, leader of the newly founded People's National Movement (PNM), was aware of Constantine's popular appeal and recruited him. By January 1956 Constantine, with the full co-operation and blessing of his employers, was party chairman {{and a member of}} its executive committee. Feeling that the PNM's policies were in harmony with his views on improving the lives of black people, and encouraged by his wife, Constantine stood for election in the parliamentary constituency of Tunapuna in 1956. He won a narrow victory, which his colleagues believed few in the <b>party</b> <b>could</b> have done, and resigned from Trinidad Leaseholds. The PNM formed a government, in which Constantine became the Minister of Communications, Works and Utilities.|$|E
