50|$|The die {{is divided}} into several {{different}} sections. First is an entrance angle that guides the wire into the die. Next is the approach angle, which brings the wire to the nib, which facilitates the reduction. Next is the bearing and the back relief. Lubrication is added at the entrance angle. The lube can be in <b>powdered</b> <b>soap</b> form. If the lubricant is soap, the friction of the drawing of wire heats the soap to liquid form and coats the wire. The wire should never actually {{come in contact with}} the die. A thin coat of lubricant should prevent the metal to metal contact.|$|E
50|$|Located {{on middle}} campus, Carney Faculty Center no longer hosts classes and is largely vacant. Rather, the {{building}} houses {{the offices of}} the Army ROTC program as well as the Student Program Offices. Often known as 'dark and dank,' the building is distinct from the quad area located across the campus green, known as the Dustbowl. Built in 1963, Carney has an unusual structure seeming to face away from the rest of campus. Contrary to popular belief, the building was not built backwards but rather styled to allow more offices to have windows, according to BC Historian, Professor Thomas O'Connor. The Beacon Street side of the building contains a fountain {{in the middle of the}} courtyard; the fountain has been dry for decades as the result of the frequent use of <b>powdered</b> <b>soap</b> pranks by undergraduate students. The building additionally contains sets of unused lockers throughout the floors, which added to the fictitious speculation of the building being a former high school although they had been used by the commuter students who formed the vast majority of enrollment for many years. The existing 10 year university plan slates Carney Hall for reconstruction. Sections of the first floor have received new carpets, fresh coats of paint, and new ceiling tiles. The existing university 30-50 year plan schedules the reconstructed building to remain part of the quad.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{pioneering}} {{the concept}} of bottle design, Coty was responsible for making perfume available to a mass market. Before Coty, perfume was considered a luxury item, affordable only to the very rich. Coty {{was the first to}} offer perfumes at many price points. His expensive perfumes, in their Lalique and Baccarat bottles, were aimed at the luxury market, but he also sold perfume in smaller, plainer bottles affordable to middle and working-class women. Coty perfume bottles, though mass-produced, were carefully designed to convey an image of luxury and prestige. Coty also invented the idea of a fragrance set, a gift box containing identically scented items, such as a perfume and matching <b>powder,</b> <b>soap,</b> cream, and cosmetics.|$|R

2500|$|The {{growth of}} the {{department}} stores and tourism created a much larger market for luxury goods, such as perfumes, watches and jewelry. [...] The perfumer François Coty began making scents in 1904, and achieved his first success selling through department stores. He discovered the importance of elegant bottles in marketing perfume and commissioned Baccarat and René Lalique to design bottles in the Art Nouveau style. He realized the desire of middle class consumers to have luxury goods and sold a range of less-expensive perfumes. He also invented the fragrance set, a box of perfume, <b>powder</b> <b>soap,</b> cream and cosmetics with the same scent. He was so successful that in 1908 he built a new laboratory and factory, La Cité des Parfums ("The City of Perfume"), at Suresnes in the Paris suburbs.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1900 s, Unilever’s {{entry into the}} Australian soap market had to employ a {{takeover}} strategy to overcome the barrier to entry created by long established local manufacturers. This had led to the merging of Lever Brothers (Australia) and J. Kitchen & Sons resulting {{in the formation of}} Lever and Kitchen Pty. Ltd. in 1914. From 1920 ’s to 1950 ’s Lever and Kitchen dominated the Australian <b>soap</b> <b>powder</b> market with no serious challenger. Persil was positioned as a heavy duty <b>soap</b> <b>powder</b> which promised "extra whiteness" while Rinso's claim was a <b>soap</b> <b>powder</b> which gave "thicker, richer suds". The prevalent hand washing habit of that time favoured a gentler <b>soap</b> <b>powder</b> and Rinso became the market leader. Unilever, however, maintained a two-brand policy throughout this period. By the late 1940 ’s the laundry washing habits of the Australian housewives were undergoing a rapid revolution. The washing machine promised to liberate the housewives from their heavy workload in the laundry and eliminate the drudgery which had chained women to the house for centuries. Lever and Kitchen reacted to the changing usage habits by repositioning Rinso and Persil as "powders suitable for both hand-wash and machine-wash. " Rinso's market leadership was ensured by its advertising claim that all washing machine manufacturers recommended Rinso. Both brands continued to offer secondary benefits as a dishwashing agent. Lever and Kitchen continued to enjoy dominant market shares throughout the late 1940 ’s and early 1950 ’s...|$|R

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{topic in}} the field of data mining is Utility Mining. The main objective of Utility Mining is to identify the itemsets with highest utilities, by considering profit, quantity, cost or other user preferences. Mining High Utility itemsets from a transaction database is to find itemsets that have utility above a user-specified threshold. Itemset Utility Mining is an extension of Frequent Itemset mining, which discovers itemsets that occur frequently. In many real-life applications, high-utility itemsets consist of rare items. Rare itemsets provide useful information in different decision-making domains such as business transactions, medical, security, fraudulent transactions, retail communities. For example, in a supermarket, customers purchase microwave ovens or frying pans rarely as compared to bread, washing <b>powder,</b> <b>soap.</b> But the former transactions yield more profit for the supermarket. Similarly, the high-profit rare itemsets are found to be very useful in many application areas. For example, in medical application, the rare combination of symptoms can provide useful insights for doctors [21]. A retail business may be interested in identifying its most valuable customers i. e. who contribute a major fraction of overall company profit[10]. Several researches about itemset utility mining were proposed. In this paper, a literature survey of various algorithms for high utility rare itemset mining has been presented...|$|R
