40|$|Consider {{a supply}} chain {{consisting}} of two independent agents, a supplier (e. g., a manufacturer) and its customer (e. g., a retailer), the latter in turn serving an uncertain market demand. To reconcile manufacturing/procurement time lags with a need for timely response to the market, such supply chains often must commit resources to production quantities based on forecasted rather than realized demand. The customer typically provides a <b>planning</b> <b>forecast</b> of its intended purchase, which does not entail commitment. Benefiting from overproduction while not bearing the immediate costs, the customer has incentive to initially overforecast before eventually purchasing a lesser quantity. The supplier must in turn anticipate such behavior in its production quantity decision. This individually rational behavior results in an inefficient supply chain. This paper models the incentives of the two parties, identifying causes of inefficiency and suggesting remedies. Particular attention {{is given to the}} Quantity Flexibility (QF) contract, which couples the customer's commitment to purchase no less than a certain percentage below the forecast with the supplier's guarantee to deliver up to a certain percentage above. Under certain conditions, this method can allocate the costs of market demand uncertainty so as to lead the individually motivated supplier and customer to the systemwide optimal outcome. We characterize the implications of QF contracts for the behavior and performance of both parties, and the supply chain as a whole. supply chain management, supply contracts, quantity flexibility, coordination, forecasting, forecast revision, materials planning...|$|E

The projected inputs and the technical coefficients are arrived at either through a regression of historical data or based on socio-economic conditions of the study area as brought out by State or District level statistical data or through a primary survey. For some variables, the best farm method was also employed for projections. The application of the method is illustrated by projecting a plausible scenario for the rural segment of Kanyakumari District for the year 1995. This paper also presents the application of scenario approach to micro level planning via impact analysis of various control parameters. The advantage of scenario analysis for micro level planning is discussed and scenarios for analyzing the impact of (1) replacing field crop by plantation crop, (2) introducing energy plantation, (3) introducing fuel efficient stoves, (4) increasing fertilizer price, (5) increased fertilizer application, (6) increased population growth, (7) drought conditions, (8) decreased fuelwood availability, have been developed and discussed for arriving at plausible recommendations for energy resource generation and optimum usage of available energy resources in a given rural system under various conditions.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} for model prediction and validation is providing them with data of appropriate spatial and temporal resolution. The maturation and increased application of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in aquatic environments allows systematic data collection on these model-relevant scales. The goal {{of this study was}} to apply a fine-scale circulation and transport model (Delft 3 D) to improve AUV mission planning and use data collected by the AUV to evaluate and improve model performance. A dye release was conducted in a tidally dominated embayment, and a planning phase model based on the best available data was used as a baseline for evaluation and for AUV mission <b>planning</b> (<b>forecast).</b> The planning phase model correctly predicted the general shape and direction of the dye plume and allowed for successful mission planning. Subsequently, bathymetry data collected by the AUV was incorporated into the model (hindcast), with temperature and salinity collected before the experiment. Comparisons with fluorometer measurements from the AUV indicate that the model effectively predicted the edges of the plume and centerline location. The location was also confirmed by remote sensing from an aircraft. Thermal stratification was found to be an important fate mechanism in the final model, and the results demonstrate the integration of observational data sets for small, short-duration surface-contaminant releases. This study highlights the strength of a phased, iterative approach with observation platforms and may serve as a guide toward improving the performance and evaluation of future coastal hydrodynamic and transport modeling efforts.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} integrated asset-liability management, a {{new management}} perspective that is evolving at the more innovative financial intermediaries {{in response to}} problems caused by the older functional management perspective. The older perspective calls for an organization to be structured into functional units (e. g., marketing, asset management, etc.), the decisions of which are coordinated by a corporate plan based on a macroeconomic forecast. Growing disenchantment with the accuracy of macroeconomic forecasting {{in the face of}} a more complex and volatile capital markets environment has led some financial intermediaries to begin implementing a new management perspective. This new management perspective, termed integrated asset-liability management (or more simply, integrated ALM) calls for an organization structured into integrated units that include all the functional activity related to a line of business. The integrated staff makes decisions regarding the product(s) in the business line with the help of computer models that represent both the assets and liabilities associated with the business line, characterize the uncertainty of the future business environment, and produce strategies for structuring the assets and liabilities of the business line in ways that are profitable across a range of alternative future environments. In short, the older functional management perspective calls for functional units to make decisions using profitability calculations based on a single-scenario <b>planning</b> <b>forecast,</b> while the newer integrated ALM perspective calls for business units to make decisions using risk-adjusted or hedged profitability calculations based on multiple-scenario projections.

In retrospection, we can find that the most {{attention has been paid to}} development <b>planning</b> <b>forecast,</b> and subsequent evaluation and reflection. But few researches have been done on real-time or near real-time monitoring and decision-making, which is a very important field deserving more attention. To perform real-time monitoring and decision-making, support from telecommunication technology is needed. In fact, only through the integration of GIS and telecommunication technology, could real-time monitoring be enabled. In this paper, we argue that a promising direction in GIS applications is the integration of GIS and telecommunication. Then the concept of Telegeomatics is presented, and its basic structural characteristics analyzed. The core of Telegeomatics is the integration of GIS and telecommunication, which will availably resolve the problem of obtainment and policy-making support for the real-time and near real-time spatial information. 1) In the case study, a real-time multi-factor environmental monitoring and information service system of Beijing is constructed. Through this research, we found that: 1) it is an effective way to integrate GIS, telecommunication and EO for real-time environment monitoring; 2) GIS is fundamental to the development of the proposed system; 3) The bottleneck of the proposed system is the development of Internet infrastructure, especially the development of IPV 6. This indicates that it is urgent to develop IP infrastructure in order to further promote the development of the proposed system. 1...|$|E

Background: The research {{is based on}} Papyrus Sweden, a paper merchant, which is facing {{a decrease in the}} demand of paper products. It was identified that inventory level reduction is now crucial for the company in order to stay in the market. Therefore, Papyrus Sweden is focused on inventory level and tied-up capital reduction in order to decrease costs and increase net profit. Purpose: This thesis aims to analyze the current situation in Papyrus Sweden in terms of inventory level and activities related to suppliers, and prepare recommendations which could help Papyrus Sweden to reduce its inventory level. Method: The data has been collected through interviews with managers from the supply chain department as well as through a data sample from Papyrus Sweden database given to the researchers. All data was analyzed and compared with the literature review. Data received from the database was processed and transformed in Microsoft Excel {{in order to make the}} analysis. Results: The analysis identifies issues in material planning methods, safety stock calculation, ABC-XYZ classification and forecast calculation, on which Papyrus Sweden could act in order to decrease its inventory level.

40|$|It {{is typical}} of medium to large sized {{organizations}} involved in new product development to have a portfolio of projects at all times. The planning for the execution of these projects is usually done at an individual project level using traditional project planning tools that were developed in the early half of the 20 th century to handle work in factories, with repeated standard work tasks that take up a fixed duration and sequence. However, the work performed in these knowledge intensive organizations is ill suited to be planned in a sequential fashion with fixed resources without taking into account iterations of work. The tasks in new product development projects tend to be iterative owing to concurrent dependencies between them, the teams on these projects tend to be geographically far flung leading to coordination and other socio-technical challenges. At the same time, the complexity of projects tends to grow as organizations deliver more system level solutions. These issues of iteration, concurrency, team distribution and complexity {{lead to an increase}} in demand for coordination, which is a real effort with real costs. Organizations face the challenge of making good forecasts that can include these real world execution issues through their project plans. Can project plans that include these in their <b>planning</b> <b>forecast</b> outcomes better? As the projects grow larger in size and count, and when the organizational budgets and practices do not keep pace with these changes, organizations tend to face resource constraints. Can the challenges of iteration, concurrency, distribution, and complexity be addressed by viewing the planning process at a higher level? That is, by conducting the process of planning at the level of a portfolio of projects versus planning for several individual projects? This work addresses these real world challenges in the planning of projects and demonstrates the efficacy of including concurrency, distribution, complexity and iteration in the project planning models using data from two large projects in a semiconductor organization. Analysis reveals that these models produce more insightful forecasts than the models using traditional tools of forecasting. This work addresses some of the impediments that come in the way when addressing these concerns. A project portfolio model based on these two projects demonstrates that such a model helps in better resource sharing and forecasts a 32 % improvement in the duration of one of the projects compared to the forecast based on planning for the projects individually. The work also demonstrates the concept of design of a project portfolio and illustrates how a portfolio of projects model allows new product development organizations to create flexible project plans that handle real world constraints leading to a reduction in the project durations of the projects in the portfolio. by Sudhir Korrapati.

40|$|The {{urbanisation}} {{of poverty}} and informality in East African cities {{poses a threat to}} environmental health, perpetuates social exclusion and inequalities, and creates service gaps (UN-Habitat, 2008). This makes conventional sanitation provision untenable citywide, giving rise to the emergence of sanitation mixtures. Sanitation mixtures have different scales, institutional arrangements, user groups, and rationalities for their establishment, location, and management. For assessing the performance of both the mixtures as a whole and the different sanitation approaches constituting these mixtures, novel approaches for analyses are required. This thesis, therefore, departs from the centralised-decentralised approaches to a modernised mixtures (MM) approach in seeking a more inclusive assessment of sanitary configurations taking into account public and environmental health, accessibility and flexibility of sanitation systems as sustainability criteria. To achieve this, the four objectives formulated for this thesis are to: 1. Make an inventory of sanitary systems in Kampala and Kisumu. 2. Assess and map sanitary systems along MM dimensions in Kampala and Kisumu. 3. Assess sustainability of sanitary systems on defined MM criteria in Kampala and Kisumu. 4. Enhance insights on the applicability of MM criteria as conceptual model, assessment and prescriptive tool for sanitary mixtures in East African cities. Case study cities were chosen from a typology of primary and secondary cities that have urban sewer systems since colonial times. The two cities were deemed to offer rich cases that would give a general outlook of other East Africa cities, thus can offer possibilities for generalization. The thesis utilised a multi-method and multi-level approach in data collection and analysis. A multicriteria analysis is used in sustainability performance assessment of sanitation systems based on defined MM criteria. Firstly, modernisation debates and resultant modernities in sanitation provision were reviewed in Chapter 2. The review shows that Western modernisation and resultant modernities and their structures of service provision have not resonated well in developing countries. Consequently, alternative theories that dispute a universal approach to modernity emerged to offer alternatives to modernisation. Alternative options are characterised by multiple rationalities, diversity and multiplicity. Modernities in terms of sanitation provision are further operationalized as competition between the proponents of centralised versus decentralised solutions. A third way of looking at sanitation modernisation that is more inclusive is advanced through the introduction of the MM approach. In Chapter 3, the presence of urban sewer systems in Kampala and Kisumu cities is assessed. The results show that urban systems are of medium scale and serve about 10 % of the city population. They are publicly owned and managed by public enterprises under new public management. Besides, they are conventionally designed, constructed and operated without the involvement of end-users. Treatment plants are either overloaded, underutilised or treatment stages are mismatched. Consequently, about 30 - 70 % of the treatment stages are not operational. Effluent discharge standards and bio-solids reuse requirements are not met, and the adopted treatment technologies are inappropriate for the investigated conditions. Sewer networks are supported by pumping stations and siphons that are only partially operational due to high operational costs and mechanical failures. Public sewerage is further plagued by urban informality and multiplicity of city spatial structures. Planned city core, and to a limited extent peri-urban areas, are served by public sewers, while sewer trunk lines pass through informal slum settlements without connections. In Chapter 4, satellite systems are analysed and configurations mapped. Satellite systems are intermediate semi-collective decentralised sewerage and treatment systems developed parallel to urban and onsite systems. They are provided by multiple actors, serve planned middle and high income residential, industrial complexes, endowed public and private universities, and government facilities. In terms of scale, they are community, neighbourhood and small-urban sanitation solutions. Besides, satellite systems are private sewerage systems that utilise gravity sewers and localised mechanised or non-mechanised treatment. The flows are based on land use or facility specific and are treated close to the point of generation. They are based on conventional designs and construction protocols without end-user involvement. Onsite systems in Kampala and Kisumu cities are examined in Chapter 5. <b>Planning</b> <b>forecast</b> indicates that onsite systems will dominate sewer (urban and satellite) systems beyond the next two decades. They are small-scale, highly decentralised and use simple technologies. Pit latrines dominate septic tanks in number, with eco-san on pilot scales and bio-latrine being a new sanitation option. Faecal sludge collection, treatment and safe disposal is dismal. The private sector dominates over local authorities in provision of faecal sludge services, but public sewerage agencies receive and co-treat faecal sludge with sewage although sewage works are not designed to receive faecal sludge. They are regulated by the Ministry of Health, enforced by the city councils and are provided by multiple actors solely or in partnership. Onsite sanitation can be a transient or permanent solution depending on mass flows and spatial requirements. However, for better sanitation provision, a permanent solution, with room for amendments to anticipate changes in space and mass flow is imperative. In Chapter 6, sustainability performance of sanitation systems are assessed following the defined three MM criteria. The performance shows that there is no sanitation system that is completely outcompeted in performance, neither are there systems with a very good performance. Sanitation system choices, consequently, are made among imperfect options, which call for balancing the various elements of sanitation provision to suit different policy and local contexts. Varying the assigned relative weight of the various criteria used in the overall MCA assessment indicates that generally, any slight increase in weight has an impact on systems that already have a high performance whereas in the case of systems with low performance the change is dismal or even negative. Therefore, programmes for improvement of sanitation systems might be directed to improvement options where systems already have a relatively high performance. However, those with a low performance may need comprehensive or even system reconfigurations for significant impacts to be realised. In conclusion, sanitation mixtures are theorised as the co-existence of different phases of modernity in tandem with local context variables. Thus, there is no one-fit-all paradigmatic way to sanitation provision if the local contexts are apparently different even within the same city. However, a shift of the centralised-decentralised dichotomy to modernised mixtures paradigm offers better impetus as it can utilise the advantages of both centralised and decentralised approaches without jeopardising existing provision pathways. The MM approach is helpful in assessing, mapping and describing sanitation systems in cities where sanitation mixtures are the norm rather than the exception. One way to modernise sanitation mixtures is by shifting the centralised-decentralised paradigm in order to modernise the mixed sanitation landscape. This is premised on the notion that such a shift will result in merging the strengths of centralised approach, e. g. economies of scale, efficiency, and convenience, with strengths of decentralised approach, e. g. accessibility, flexibility, participation, and reuse and recovery in development of intermediate systems configuration. This can be achieved through, among others, avoiding use of pumping stations, adoption of multiple service levels, involvement of private sector, servicing households at intermediate scale, and establishing sanitation suitability and management zones. The MM approach is also very helpful as a conceptual model for organising a research agenda which can be set along the four assessment dimensions of scale, management, flows and participation, as well as in searching for appropriate intervention measures along {{one or more of these}} dimensions. As an assessment and decision making tool, it is helpful in finding out which elements highlighted in the sustainability assessment need to be restructured and which need improvement in order to enhance their sustainability. However, translation of the proposed conceptual MM model into a mathematical model is a challenge yet to be explored. Considering its intrinsic dynamic character in dependence to varying spaces, flows, and scales along city development, a mathematical MM model would provide a regulatory design tool for city planners for adopting amendments to existing sanitation solutions. Obviously, up to date monitoring and inventory records are a pre-requisite for applying such a model, requiring institutional upgrading. Although the current results described in this thesis provide the basis for a more structured assessment and generalisation of sanitation mixtures, more research and contextualisation is needed in other regions, for further elaboration of MM model, and for the refinement of the assessment tool.  ...|$|E
