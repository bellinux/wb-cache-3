Conversely, he told Valiente a different story about its origins: according to this account, Howard was living with relations on a Norfolk farm in 1930 when he met an old lady named Alicia Franch who lived with the Romani Gypsies. Franch allegedly first came across Howard when he was playing by a roadside pond on the summer solstice, and she took an interest in him, instructing him in her witchcraft tradition and leaving him a number of artefacts in her will, including the Head of Atho. In a newspaper interview with the Eastern Evening News he identified Swaffham as the location in which this had happened, adding that the old lady had left him a deed box containing [...] "teeth, nail <b>parings</b> and old parchments. The historian Ronald Hutton later commented that there was [...] "no means of investigating this story", but added that Howard could not be considered a trustworthy source.|$|E

A 16-team tournament was held to crown new champions, the competitors were a mixture of regular teams and random <b>parings</b> of CMLL low to mid-card workers. The preliminary rounds were held on June 22, 2008 and saw the teams of Stuka Jr. and Flash (Collectively known as Los Bombadieros; [...] "The Bombardiers") and Los Infernales ("The Infernal Ones"; Euforia and Nosferatu) each win three matches {{to qualify for the}} final. On June 28, 2008 Stuka Jr. and Flash defeated Los Infernales to become the second CMLL Arena Coliseum Tag Team Champions of the modern age. Flash later changed his ring name to [...] "Fuego". On March 3, 2013, La Fiebre Amarilla ("The Yellow Fever"; Namajague and Okumura) defeated Fuego and Stuka Jr. to become the third modern age CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions, ending the previous champions' four and a half year reign. On November 4, 2013, Delta and Guerrero Maya Jr. became the fourth modern age Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions. After a long-running rivalry with the then-champions Delta and Guerrero Maya Jr., La Comando Caribeño ("The Caribbean Commando"; Misterioso Jr. and Sagrado) became the fifth modern day Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions on February 28, 2015.|$|E
500|$|The game's initial {{gameplay}} {{concept was}} for a squad-based tactical game that excluded role-playing elements, but it eventually settled back into the more traditional Fire Emblem style of single combat between units. He also noted that Kaga kept on pushing for more role-playing elements, {{to the point that}} the team felt it was being turned into a full-fledged role-playing video game. The scale of maps was greatly increased due to Kaga's wish for a story that was epic in scope. Adjustments were made to the money, character class and ranking systems to help with balancing, while some unit movements were adjusted to lend greater realism to battles. The [...] "Commander" [...] leveling system was intended to properly convey the impression of certain characters as leaders without resorting to relying on stat growth. A home base that could be freely explored between missions was initially planned, but most of its features needed to be cut due to hardware limitations, although the base concept remained in the game. The differences between the first prototype and the final build were described by Narihito as [...] "huge", and he estimated that the game had been remade two or three times during development. The Support system, introduced in Mystery of the Emblem, was greatly expanded based on fan feedback, such as conversations between units being triggered depending on various factors to give more backstory to them. The romance system was suggested by Kaga, partly as an expansion of the Support system and partly due to his wish to create an epic story. Some elements needed to be removed, such as how giving gifts affected a relationship, due to space restrictions. According to Toru Narihiro, one of the game's staff, the romance mechanics were inspired in Kaga's mind by the breeding of pedigree race horses. When he asked for the feature, all of the staff were shocked, and it was estimated that an entire year's development was dedicated to making the feature work. Romance also fell in with a popular gaming trend at the time. The systems governing children were intended to reward players through certain character <b>parings,</b> but were also open so players would not need to engage in the romance system at all while still getting enjoyment from the experience.|$|E

2500|$|With the Canadiens, Cleghorn was reunited {{once again}} with his brother, Odie. In his first season with the Canadiens, he scored 17 goals and nine assists for 26 points in 24 games. Towards {{the end of the}} season, he would also be named captain of the team. For the next three seasons, the Canadiens made the Stanley Cup playoffs three {{consecutive}} times. He played alongside Billy Coutu, and the pair established {{a reputation as one of}} the most feared defensive <b>parings</b> in the league. In a 1923 playoff series, against his former team, the Ottawa Senators (who he had grown to despise), Cleghorn struck Ottawa Senators defenceman Lionel Hitchman in the head with his stick. Later charged with aggravated assault, he was found guilty and fined $50. The incident also enraged Canadiens owner, Leo Dandurand, who suspended him from the roster for the remainder of the playoffs. In a separate incident versus the Senators in 1922, he initiated a brawl during which he injured three players: Eddie Gerard, Frank Nighbor and Cy Denneny. This led to an attempt by the Ottawa management to expel him from the league, and a referee to describe him as a [...] "disgrace to the game". [...] In the 1923–24 season, the Canadiens won their first Stanley Cup in the NHL era. It was the third championship of Cleghorn's career. After the following season, Montreal sold him to the Boston Bruins for $5000. He played out the following three seasons with the Bruins until his retirement in 1928. Cleghorn acted as the unofficial captain of the Bruins between 1925 and 1927, and in his final season with the Bruins, 1927–28, also served as an assistant coach. During his time with the Bruins, he served as a veteran presence on the team, as well as a mentor to future Hall of Fame defenceman Eddie Shore.|$|E
