5|$|Examples of <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in the {{response}} to insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of these drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification.</b> Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E

40|$|<b>Post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> {{increase}} proteome functionality {{for managing}} {{all aspects of}} normal cell biology. They {{are based on the}} covalent attachment of functional groups, leading to phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, acylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation and oxidation of protein targets. <b>Post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> occur at any step of protein life cycle, modulating in time and space protein folding, subcellular localization and activity. Aberrant <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> of one or more culprit proteins may lead to neurodegeneration, as shown in paradigmatic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and prion diseases. In this review, we report the most important <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> found in neurodegenerative disorders, illustrating the pathophysiological mechanisms in which they are involved. This work highlights the lack of a global framework of <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> in terms of complexity and regulation. Therefore, in the next future many efforts are required to describe the interplay existing between <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> and their combinatorial patterns on protein targets...|$|R
50|$|Several <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> {{including}} phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation are predicted. Additionally, it {{has several}} <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> such as acetylation, methylation, phosphoprotein - this includes amino acid modifications (or modified residues) such as N-acetylalanine, omega-N-methylarginine, and phosphoserine).|$|R
5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved functional properties of EFS relevant to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also be relevant to cancer and other disease states, influencing prognosis and therapeutic response. The changes in EFS expression and <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> {{in the context of}} disease discussed below are summarized in Table 2.|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification,</b> which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E
5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA {{damage tolerance}} process {{that allows the}} DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E

25|$|Chromatin {{structure}} inhibition is {{the process}} wherein the promoter is hidden by chromatin structure. Chromatin structure is controlled by <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> of the histones involved and leads to gross levels of high or low transcription levels. See: chromatin, histone, and nucleosome.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> {{that can}} {{regulate}} PDZ domains is {{the formation of}} disulfide bridges. Many PDZ domains contain cysteines and are susceptible to disulfide bond formation in oxidizing conditions. This modification acts primarily as an inhibitor of PDZ domain function.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of transcription factors is further modulated by intracellular signals causing protein <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> including phosphorylated, acetylated, or glycosylated.

40|$|AbstractIn many cases, <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> {{constitute}} indirect {{markers of}} non-dynamic microtubules. The correlation between stability of microtubular systems and <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> {{suggests that they}} may act as a signal in patterning mechanisms. However, a crucial question remains {{as to how the}} repertoire of distinctly modified microtubules is generated. We propose here an ubiquitous mechanism of spatial and temporal differentiation of microtubules. In this model, the diversity of <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> results from a dynamical pathway separation which is ensured by biochemical switches between self-regulated mechanisms of differentiation. Thus, it does not require any hypothetical subcellular compartmentalization of enzymatic activities responsible for the various <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications.</b> These results are discussed in relation to experimental evidences for a temporal and spatial regulation of microtubule modifications...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{produced}} {{information on}} <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> {{makes it possible}} to interpret their biological regulation with new insights. Various protein modifications finely tune the cellular functions of each protein. Understanding the relationship between <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> and functional changes (“post-translatomics”) is another enormous project, not unlike the human genome project. Proteomics, combined with separation technology and mass spectrometry, {{makes it possible to}} dissect and characterize the individual parts of <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> and provide a systemic analysis. Systemic analysis of <b>post-translational</b> <b>modifications</b> in various signaling pathways has been applied to illustrate the kinetics of modifications. Availability will advance new technologies that improve sensitivity and peptide coverage. The progress of “post-translatomics”, novel analytical technologies that are rapidly emerging, offer a great potential for determining the details of the modification sites...|$|R
25|$|The linker domain is {{the site}} of most <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification,</b> which include glycosylation, phosphorylation, and limited proteolysis. By electrophoretic {{analysis}} IGFBP-3 appears as a doublet, owing to the occupancy of either two or three of its N-glycosylation sites by carbohydrate. Hypoglycosylated IGFBP-3 may be seen after extended glucose starvation.|$|E
25|$|Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (or SUMO) {{proteins}} are {{a family}} of small proteins that are covalently attached to and detached from other proteins in cells to modify their function. SUMOylation is a <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> involved in various cellular processes, such as nuclear-cytosolic transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, protein stability, response to stress, and progression through the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|Any step of gene {{expression}} may be modulated, from the DNA-RNA transcription step to <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> of a protein. The {{stability of the}} final gene product, whether it is RNA or protein, also contributes to the expression level of the gene—an unstable product results in a low expression level. In general {{gene expression}} is regulated through changes in the number and type of interactions between molecules that collectively influence transcription of DNA and translation of RNA.|$|E

25|$|Another {{key event}} {{that takes place}} in the ER is N-linked glycosylation. In this process, polypeptides that have a unique stretch of 3 amino acids (asparagine - X - serine/threonine, where X {{represents}} any amino acid except proline) are modified with a complex sugar moiety on the amide group of asparagine. Other types of glycosylations include S-linked (via cysteine residues), C-linked (via tryptophan) and O-linked (via serine or threonine). By far, N-linked glycosylation is the most abundant <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> found in eukaryotic cells.|$|E
25|$|Once translated, the polyprotein is cleaved by a {{combination}} of viral and host proteases to release mature polypeptide products. Nevertheless, cellular <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> is dependent on the presence of a poly-A tail; therefore this process is not host-dependent. Instead, the polyprotein contains an autocatalytic feature which automatically releases the first peptide, a virus specific enzyme. This enzyme is then able to cleave the remaining polyprotein into the individual products. One of the products cleaved is a polymerase, responsible for the synthesis of a (-) sense RNA molecule. Consequently, this molecule acts as the template for the synthesis of the genomic progeny RNA.|$|E
25|$|Several {{steps in}} the gene {{expression}} process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and {{is the basis for}} cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Also it depends on the state of activator RNA. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can {{have a profound effect on}} the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification</b> of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{also suggests}} that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild-type cells independently of the CDK machinery. Orlando et al. used microarrays to measure {{the expression of a}} set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both wild type cells and cells lacking all S-phase and mitotic cyclins (clb1,2,3,4,5,6). Of the 1,271 genes assayed, 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells {{at the same time as}} in the wild type cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between G1 and S phase. However, 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery. Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells. These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events. Other work indicates that phosphorylation, a <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification,</b> of cell cycle transcription factors by Cdk1 may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes.|$|E
500|$|The two {{evolutionary}} models {{mentioned above}} describe {{ways in which}} genes may be circularly permuted, resulting in a circularly permuted mRNA after transcription. Proteins can also be circularly permuted via <b>post-translational</b> <b>modification,</b> without permuting the underlying gene. [...] Circular permutations can happen spontaneously through autocatalysis, {{as in the case}} of concanavalin A. Alternately, permutation may require restriction enzymes and ligases.|$|E
