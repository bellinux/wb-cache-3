40|$|ABSTRACT: Computerized {{tomography}} (CT) is {{an important}} tool in Soil Science for noninvasive measurement of density and water content of soil samples. This work aims to describe the aspects of sample size adequacy for <b>Planosol</b> (Albaqualf) and to evaluate procedures for statistical analysis, using a CT scanner with a 241 Am source. Density errors attributed to the equipment are 0. 051 and 0. 046 Mg m- 3 for horizons A and B, respectively. The theoretical value for sample thickness for the <b>Planosol,</b> using this equipment, is 4. 0 cm for the horizons A and B. The ideal thickness of samples is approximately 6. 0 cm, being smaller for samples of the horizon B in relation to A.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{semiarid}} {{region of}} northeastern Brazil {{has a large}} area occupied by <b>Planosols,</b> where in the State of Pernambuco these soils are mainly used for livestock farming and subsistence crops. The knowledge on these soils is limited, which compromises the understanding on their behavior, potentialities and limitations. This study aimed to analyze morphological, chemical, physical and mineralogical attributes of <b>Planosols</b> developed under different geoenvironmental conditions. Morphological descriptions and chemical, physical and mineralogical analyses were performed in four profiles of <b>Planosols</b> along a rainfall gradient. An increase in rainfall allowed {{for an increase in}} the clay content in the Bt horizon and a reduction in ESP, EC, Na+, CEC, S, pH (water and KCl) and soil density. Horizons A and E were thicker in <b>Planosols</b> in more humid environments. The increase in ESP associated with the presence of expansive minerals (smectite and vermiculite) allowed the development of a prismatic structure in Haplic <b>Planosols</b> and a columnar structure in Natric <b>Planosols.</b> The mineralogical assembly is indicative of poorly weathered soils.

40|$|Abstract : <b>Planosols</b> {{have been}} {{recognized}} as a Major Soil Group {{right from the beginning}} in the legend of the FAO Soil Map of the World. Also in WRB system it maintained that position at Reference Soil Group level on the account that a major pedogenetic process, ferrolysis, is underlaying the severe stagnic properties that characterize this group. With the recent introduction of Stagnosols in WRB it appears that a serious overlap has been introduced at Reference Soil Group level. This paper aims to throw new light on the genesis of <b>Planosols,</b> drawing from new soil surveys conducted in the south-western Ethiopian highlands. The conclusion is that {{it is highly unlikely that}} ‘ferrolysis’ can be called in to explain the genesis of <b>Planosols</b> in the Ethiopian highlands. As Ethiopia is one of the mainstays of <b>Planosols,</b> it is suggested that WRB rethinks its strategy on soils with stagnic properties as there is room for rationalization. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In the Gilgel Gibe {{catchment}} in Ethiopia, {{local farmers}} intensify land use on <b>Planosols</b> by adjusting a traditional soil burning practice known as guie. The burning practice {{used to be}} applied in a cycle of shifting cultivation. However, more recently, farmers burn small plots to make fertile seedbeds for Eucalyptus seedlings {{in the first year}} before these trees are transplanted to larger plots. The purpose of this research was to assess the physico-chemical properties of <b>Planosols</b> that have been subjected to burning over the last 10 yrs and evaluate the contribution of guie to land-use intensification of these soils. Transect studies and interviews of local farmers, followed by chemical, physical and micromorphological analyses of samples from selected plots were used to compare the soil properties of recently (0 - 2 yrs) and formerly (3 - 10 yrs) burnt <b>Planosols</b> with those of unburnt <b>Planosols.</b> The analytical results show that the burning practice improved nutrient availability in the first 2 yrs after guie. Increased amounts of exchangeable aluminium (Al) were reported in the long term. Charge fingerprints illustrate that the nutrient-buffering capacity of the soil was high shortly after the practice but subsequently decreased with time. Given the population pressure on the formerly extensively used <b>Planosols,</b> it is argued that the current application of guie on small, localized plots for raising Eucalyptus seedlings is well adapted to the local socio-economic context and promotes land-use intensification on the <b>Planosols.</b> The increased exchangeable Al content of former Eucalyptus seedbeds merits further in-depth research into the biophysical sustainability of the burning practice...|$|R
50|$|In the {{temperate}} zone these {{soils are}} mainly in grass or planted to {{crops such as}} wheat and sugar beet. Yields are modest even on drained and deeply loosened soils.

On pasture grassland soil, the substrate availability index (PR/BR) with values of 2. 32 was observed, which is lower compared to 7. 60 of arable soil. This fact to indicate that pasture grassland soil had more easy decomposable organic compounds than arable soils...|$|E
40|$|Data on soil particle-size for 768 {{profiles}} of Preluvosols, Luvosols, <b>Planosols,</b> Alosols and Vertosols, {{available in the}} PROFISOL Database, have been processed. These soil profiles have been grouped into 105 groups, grouping being based on soil genetic type and subtype, topsoil and subsoil texture, and physiographic unit. Average and standard errors were calculated for each group and each horizon. This way, a general characterization of the particle-size of these soils has been obtained. These data confirm that, {{from this point of}} view, the changes introduced in SRTS as compared to the earlier SRCS are justified. A more detailed analysis of the coarse sand content seems to be useful for a better characterization of soils than the present-day 6 texture classes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{estimated}} Rift Valley fever (RVF) incidence as {{a function}} of geological, geographical, and climatolog-ical factors during the 2006 – 2007 RVF epidemic in Kenya. Location information was obtained for 214 of 340 (63 %) confirmed and probable RVF cases that occurred during an outbreak from November 1, 2006 to February 28, 2007. Locations with subtypes of solonetz, calcisols, solonchaks, and <b>planosols</b> soil types were highly associated with RVF occurrence during the outbreak period. Increased rainfall and higher greenness measures before the outbreak were associated with increased risk. RVF was more likely to occur on plains, in densely bushed areas, at lower elevations, and in the Somalia acacia ecological zone. Cases occurred in three spatial temporal clusters that differed by the date of associated rainfall, soil type, and land usage...|$|R
40|$|Cation {{exchange}} capacity, among others, is {{an important}} soil property that guides interventions in soil management. However, the huge costs associated with laboratory determination of cation exchange capacity, limit the use of cec data in soil farm management and environmental intervention initiatives. Models were developed to predict cation exchange capacity (pH 7 NH 4 OAC) for soils in the Lake Victoria catchment. The soils data from the National soils characterisation database was used to develop the models using soil organic carbon, clay, silt and pH as predictor variables of CEC {{with the exception of}} <b>Planosols</b> where clay and pH were major predictors. The data were organised into homogeneous groupings to improve prediction accuracy. Groupings according to FAO and Parent materials showed statistical responses to CEC modeling. Validation results indicate that the prediction equations in Luvisols (R 2 = 0. 972, P 0. 05) from measured values. Predictions under Gneisses were unreliable (R 2 = 0. 346, RMSE of 15. 684). A decision tree to guide users on the choice of the model to use is presentedstatus: publishe...|$|R
