5|$|COBOL syntax {{has often}} been criticized for its verbosity. <b>Proponents</b> <b>say</b> that this was {{intended}} to make the code self-documenting, easing program maintenance. COBOL was also intended to be easy for programmers to learn and use, while still being readable to non-technical staff such as managers.|$|E
5|$|While McClellan's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} over time, especially {{over the last}} 75 years, {{there is a small}} but intense cadre of American Civil War historians who believe that the general has been poorly served on at least four levels. First, McClellan <b>proponents</b> <b>say</b> that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on the bandwagon of Lincoln as America's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen {{as a result of the}} Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.|$|E

5000|$|The attack {{prompted}} {{calls to}} allow firearms on campuses in Ohio. State Representative Ron Maag made {{a proposal for}} the expansion of [...] "concealed carry locations". The proposal downgraded the felony charge of illegally bringing a gun on campus to a misdemeanor, and gave universities the option to allow concealed firearms on their campuses. The proposal was met with a mixed response, with <b>proponents</b> <b>saying</b> that students would feel safer with access to concealed firearms, and opponents arguing that the expansion of concealed carry locations is unnecessary and could even complicate law enforcement response.|$|R

25|$|Due to PRT's efficiency, some <b>proponents</b> <b>say</b> solar {{becomes a}} viable power source. PRT {{elevated}} structures provide a ready platform for solar collectors, therefore some proposed designs include solar {{power as a}} characteristic of their networks.|$|E
25|$|Some film <b>proponents</b> <b>say</b> that Heironimus' {{arms are}} {{too short to}} match that of a Bigfoot {{and that he was}} a few inches shorter than the {{creature}} on the film (up to 14 inches shorter).|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a lot of studies on the safety of all types of bikeways. <b>Proponents</b> <b>say</b> that {{segregation}} of cyclists from fast or frequent motorized traffic is necessary to provide a safe and welcoming cycling environment. Opponents point out the increased risk from various types of infrastructure including shared use paths.|$|E

5000|$|Bernstein soon {{resented the}} war and by October 1914 was {{convinced}} of the German government's war guilt; and contacted the orthodox Marxists of the SPD, to unite to push the SPD to take an anti-war stance. Kautsky attempted to put aside his differences with Bernstein and join forces in opposing the war, and Kautsky praised him for becoming a firm anti-war <b>proponent,</b> <b>saying</b> that although Bernstein had previously supported [...] "civic" [...] and [...] "liberal" [...] forms of nationalism, his committed anti-war position made him the [...] "standard-bearer of the internationalist idea of social democracy". The nationalist position by the SPD leadership under Ebert refused to rescind.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} Ontario {{electricity grid}} had {{become dependent on}} fossil fuels, transformers, and nuclear energy for decades before the wind turbines started appearing. However, these concerns are negated by wind energy <b>proponents</b> who <b>say</b> that the turbines could lead to electricity price reductions through lower natural gas prices (due to the reductions in natural gas demand).|$|R
25|$|One of {{the keys}} to helping UB achieve the goals of the UB 2020 plan, <b>proponents</b> <b>say,</b> is the passage of S2020 and A2020 known as the UB 2020 Flexibility and Economic Growth Act, by the New York State Legislature. On June 3, 2009, the State Senate passed S2020 and sent the bill to the Assembly for their consideration.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked about}} the working {{condition}} in sweatshops, <b>proponents</b> <b>say</b> that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior {{by the standards of}} developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' standard of living, those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over subsistence farming and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or starvation by unemployment.|$|E
25|$|In October 2014, Quang Binh {{province}} {{announced plans}} by Sun Group {{to build a}} cable car system linking caves in the park. The plan was met {{with a great deal}} of opposition from conservationists, and the government backtracked, saying that the plan was not yet approved. <b>Proponents</b> <b>say</b> that the area is attracting a growing number of visitors and that the cable car would be the most environmentally friendly means of managing the crowds. Opponents say that construction of the cable car system could damage the fragile caves, and once it is operational it would attract more visitors than the park can sustainably handle.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{of civil}} unions {{say that they}} provide {{practical}} equality for same-sex couples and solve the problems over areas such as hospital visitation rights and transfer of property caused by lack of legal recognition. <b>Proponents</b> also <b>say</b> that creating civil unions is a more pragmatic {{way to ensure that}} same-sex couples have legal rights as it avoids the more controversial issues surrounding marriage and the religious source of the term.|$|R
50|$|Today, most {{mainstream}} economists reject Say's law. Steven Kates, {{although a}} <b>proponent</b> of <b>Say's</b> Law, writes:Before the Keynesian Revolution, {{the denial of}} the validity of Say's Law placed an economist amongst the crackpots, people with no idea whatsoever about how an economy works. That {{the vast majority of the}} economics profession today would have been classified as crackpots in the 1930s and before is just how it is.|$|R

25|$|The Caltrain Modernization Program will {{electrify}} {{the main}} line between San Francisco and the San Jose Tamien Station, allowing transition from diesel-electric locomotive power to fully electric rolling stock. <b>Proponents</b> <b>say</b> electrification would improve service times via faster acceleration, allow better scheduling and reduce air pollution and noise. Electrification would also allow future expansion to downtown San Francisco. Electrified vehicles require less maintenance, but electrification will increase required track maintenance by about the same dollar amount, at least initially. The plan calls to electrify the system between San Francisco 4th and King Street Station and San Jose Tamien Station. Originally scheduled for completion by 2020, the schedule had slipped {{after three months of}} construction to December 30, 2021 and then April 22, 2022. At that point, Caltrain plans to use electric multiple units and increase service to six trains per hour in each direction.|$|E
500|$|In January 2017 {{group called}} [...] "Salvage the Rail" [...] {{published}} a plan, based on Option 2A from six alternatives {{proposed by the}} FTA to HART in 2016, that would terminate the elevated section at Middle Street and run at street level to the terminus along a route one block inland from the HART plan. [...] The system {{would need to be}} reconfigured to use new driver-operated low floor vehicles, lowering the platforms on the stations already constructed. [...] <b>Proponents</b> <b>say</b> it would save $3billion and four years of construction, as well as avoid disturbing burial sites under the downtown area.|$|E

5000|$|Some <b>proponents</b> of <b>Say's</b> law {{argue that}} such {{intervention}} is always counterproductive. Consider Keynesian-type policies aimed at stimulating the economy. Increased government purchases of goods (or lowered taxes) merely [...] "crowd out" [...] the production and purchase of goods by the private sector. Contradicting this view, Arthur Cecil Pigou, a self-proclaimed follower of Say's law, wrote a letter in 1932 signed by five other economists (among them Keynes) calling for more public spending to alleviate high levels of unemployment.|$|R

50|$|Critics {{say that}} the design {{detection}} methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design <b>proponents,</b> they <b>say,</b> are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching {{for the results of}} human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.|$|R
2500|$|When {{they are}} alone together, David confides {{that he has}} [...] "found grace in Jonathan's eyes", a phrase <b>proponents</b> <b>say</b> {{normally}} refers to romantic or physical attraction.

2500|$|The TM {{technique}} {{is the main}} modality which <b>proponents</b> <b>say</b> improves mental health and promotes [...] "collective health" [...] in MVAH. A 2007 review of meditative practices that included Transcendental Meditation concluded that the definitive health effects of meditation cannot be determined as the scientific evidence was of [...] poor quality, though the review {{has been criticized for}} using an inappropriate method for assessing quality. The review found that TM [...] "had no advantage over health education to improve measures of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, body weight, heart rate, stress, anger, self-efficacy, cholesterol, dietary intake, and level of physical activity in hypertensive patients". Another review did find a reduction in diastolic and systolic blood pressure in those who practiced TM compared to controls. The review and its primary author were partially funded by Howard Settle, a proponent of TM.|$|E
2500|$|Craig Pearson, Executive Vice President of Maharishi University of Management (MUM), {{says that}} {{spending}} time in buildings that follow these principles makes one smarter. <b>Proponents</b> <b>say</b> that MVA homes have escaped wildfires that burned neighboring homes, and that businesses located in MVA office buildings have greater profit and lower absenteeism. Residents of MVA homes in Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa say they felt vitality, calm and happiness when they moved into their Vedic houses. A mother says that her boys are more orderly. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has said, [...] "Living in a proper vastu can eliminate 60 to 80 percent {{of the problems we}} encounter in life." [...] Peter Warburton, Raja of England, says that the practice of Maharishi’s Vedic peace technologies is more powerful with Vastu buildings. Yale University architecture professor Keller Easterling says that MVA is fueled by a desire to create outposts for broadcasting the Maharishi Effect.|$|E

However, the larynx is higher than in classical technique, and other experts believe that a high larynx position is both dangerous to vocal health and produces what many find to be an unpleasant sound.|$|R

50|$|A {{major issue}} in jury trials is the secretive nature of the process. While <b>proponents</b> may <b>say</b> that secrecy allows the jury to remain {{impartial}} by protecting it from undue pressure or attention, opponents contend that this prevents there from being a transparent trial. The fact that juries do not often {{have to give a}} reason for their verdict is also criticized, since opponents argue it is unfair for a person to be deprived of life, liberty or property without being told why it is being done so. In contrast where there is a decision by a judge or judges, they are required to provide often detailed reasons of both fact and law as to why their decision was made.|$|R
2500|$|Practitioners utilize pulse {{diagnosis}} (known in Sanskrit as [...] "nadi vigyan"), {{which they}} say is like [...] "plugging into the inner intelligence of the body". Based on [...] "imbalances", recommendations related to herbal preparations, diet, daily and seasonal routines, exercise, and physiological purification are offered. <b>Proponents</b> <b>say</b> that the pulse {{can be used to}} detect [...] "imbalances at early stages when there may be no other clinical signs and when mild forms of intervention may suffice". According to Deepak Chopra and Sharma, pulse diagnosis can detect a variety of diseases, including those unrelated to the cardiovascular system, including asthma, cancer, and diabetes. William Jarvis, president of The National Council Against Health Fraud, described pulse diagnosis as a variety of palm reading and that Chopra refused to have pulse diagnosis tested by JAMA in a blinded protocol [...] "on the grounds that a blinded experiment would 'eliminate the most crucial component of the experiment, which is consciousness.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Honest Adoption Language" [...] {{refers to}} a set of terms that <b>proponents</b> <b>say</b> reflect the point of view that: (1) family {{relationships}} (social, emotional, psychological or physical) that existed prior to the legal adoption often continue past this point or endure in some form despite long periods of separation, and that (2) mothers who have [...] "voluntarily surrendered" [...] children to adoption (as opposed to involuntary terminations through court-authorized child-welfare proceedings) seldom view it as a choice that was freely made, but instead describe scenarios of powerlessness, lack of resources, and overall lack of choice. It also reflects the point of view that the term [...] "birth mother" [...] is derogatory in implying that the woman has ceased being a mother after the physical act of giving birth. Proponents of HAL liken this to the mother being treated as a [...] "breeder" [...] or [...] "incubator". Terms included in HAL include terms that were used before PAL, including [...] "natural mother," [...] "first mother," [...] and [...] "surrendered for adoption." ...|$|E

Overkill <b>proponents,</b> however, <b>say</b> {{this is due}} to the fast extinction process in North America and the low probability of animals with signs of butchery to be preserved. Additionally, biochemical analyses have shown that Clovis tools were used in butchering horses and camels.
