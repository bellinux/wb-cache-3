40|$|The current {{consensus}} {{objective of}} development {{aid in the}} international community is to reduce poverty in general and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in particular. In addition, the dominant view identifies economic growth as the principal means to this end. But the <b>policy</b> <b>objective</b> of aid can be defined in many ways, and has in fact varied over time with shifting priorities with{{in the international community}} about the ultimate ends of development and the means for advancing those ends. This paper argues that more attention should be given to conflict prevention as a <b>policy</b> <b>objective</b> of development aid and explores the implications of doing so for aid programme priorities and the international aid architecture in general. The paper shows that violent conflict is a major obstacle to achieving the MDGs; it identifies 64 worst performing countries and finds that the majority have experienced violent internal conflict, and/or are vulnerable because of the socioeconomic correlates of internal war. The paper then argues that development policy priorities and their support with aid can be deployed to reduce these risks. Conflict prevention is thus an important <b>policy</b> <b>objective</b> as a means to achieving MDGs as well as an end itself since security from violence is an essential aspect of human wellbeing and human security. Integrating this <b>policy</b> <b>objective</b> would imply adjustments that would need to be made in aid architecture. aid, fragile states, conflict, human security, poverty, human development, donor policies...|$|R

The case of a policy programme implemented in Tuscany (Italy) is used to illustrate how the choice of performance indicators that are only loosely tied to the <b>policy’s</b> <b>objectives,</b> can lead intermediaries to adopt behaviours that are misaligned with those objectives. The findings are then used to develop some implications for the design of performance indicators that are aligned with the <b>objectives</b> of <b>policy...</b>|$|R

25|$|The National Water Strategy defines “water deficit” as “water demand” minus “water resources”. “Water demand” is {{not used}} in an {{economic}} sense where demand depends on price. Instead demand is defined as water needs derived from <b>policy</b> <b>objectives.</b> Thus the figure given in the strategy for water demand in agriculture - 1,080 million m3 (MCM)/year - is far greater than actual water use of about 600 MCM/year. In 2007, agriculture accounted for 72% of “water demand”, while the municipal share was 24% and the shares of tourism and industries were 3% and 1%, respectively. The water deficit of 565 million m3 (MCM)/year for 2007 thus is mainly caused by assumptions about “water needs” in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|With the {{emergence}} of a compromise government between the more right wing Liberals and the more moderate conservatives, as manifested in the constitutional monarchy, the lack of development and further notable reforms in the country led the more left wing Liberal party, made up mostly of middle class partisans, to reformulate its <b>policy</b> <b>objectives.</b> Thus was born a Republican Party that advocated radical liberal reforms such as universal suffrage, the end of the privileges of the Catholic Church and rents given to the nobles, and above all, the overthrow of a political elite discredited by its corruption and incompetence. The country went into debt and was increasingly dependent on the northern provinces of the country. The humiliation of submitting to the ultimatum of 11 January 1890 issued by Great Britain, an allied nation, was undoubtedly a cathartic episode. Britain demanded that Portugal surrender what are now Zambia and Zimbabwe and abandon its plans to acquire lands in this part of Africa that it needed to connect Angola and Mozambique.|$|E
