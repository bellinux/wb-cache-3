5|$|Critics have {{objected to}} {{the killing of the}} sea lions, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> level of {{mortality}} permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the novel}} {{has had its}} {{defenders}} among feminists in the academy, such as Alison Hennegan, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel did raise awareness of homosexuality among the British public and {{cleared the way for}} later work that tackled gay and lesbian issues.|$|E

25|$|Greece and Rome were {{looked to}} as model republics {{throughout}} this debate, and authors {{on both sides}} took Roman pseudonyms. Brutus <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Greek and Roman states were small, whereas the U.S. is vast. He also <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> expansion of these republics resulted in a transition from free government to tyranny.|$|R
50|$|Some {{commentators}} have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> complex design of scissor section flats {{leads to a}} more complex, and costly, construction process while architects have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of so many flights of stairs and the half-storey design means that this form of layout would not meet modern building regulations around accessibility.|$|R
5|$|However, {{evidence}} <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{number of}} bezants on each shield {{was greater than}} five during long periods following Afonso I's reign, {{as well as the}} fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by Fernão Lopes (1419), support this explanation as one of pure myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was created by divine intervention and was destined for great things.|$|E
5|$|Social {{media was}} blamed for {{bringing}} unwanted {{visitors to the}} site and not <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> area is off-limits to the public. Following these acts of vandalism, the state of Hawaii asked {{for the removal of}} directions to Kaniakapūpū on many social media websites and tourism blogs, and encouraged those who knew the direction to the ruins to come with respect.|$|E
5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of {{specific}} information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as {{just one part of}} Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: {{the gravitational}} influence of two masses {{is not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, as had {{been the case in}} Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the discussion of how the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs on}} Road to Ruin were {{considered}} by both fans and critics {{as an attempt}} to get the band more airplay. The album incorporated musical elements which were unheard of in punk rock, such as guitar solos and ballads. The difference in style caused for mixed reviews by critics, with many <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band was trying to sell more records through a change in form. This attempt by the band failed, as Road to Ruin debuted at 103 on the Billboard 200, nearly 50 places behind its predecessor Rocket to Russia.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality {{should not be a}} basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself.|$|E

5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
5|$|In early 1965, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon {{wrote to}} President Lyndon Johnson, {{opposing}} the dollar and <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coins {{would be unlikely}} to circulate in Montana or anywhere else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, the coins would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator that things would be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams hoped to avoid striking the silver dollars, but wanted to keep the $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1961, President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam {{asked the}} United States to conduct aerial {{herbicide}} spraying in his country. In August of that year, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force conducted herbicide operations with American help. But Diem's request launched a policy {{debate in the}} White House and the State and Defense Departments. However, U.S. officials considered using it, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British had already used herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy authorized the start of Operation Ranch Hand, the codename for the U.S. Air Force's herbicide program in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the American embassy {{believed}} the Ngô family's {{claims that the}} regular army {{was responsible for the}} raids. The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the dismay of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ngô family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, {{and the fact that the}} army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2007, President Bush {{signed the}} U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 into {{law for the}} wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that {{included}} an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin 'hotspots' on former U.S. military bases, and for public health programs for the surrounding communities; some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. airbase in Da Nang, alone, will cost $14 million to clean up, and that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup. The appropriation was renewed {{in the fiscal year}} 2009 and again in FY 2010. An additional $12 million was appropriated in the fiscal year 2010 in the Supplemental Appropriations Act and a total of $18.5 million appropriated for fiscal year 2011.|$|E
5|$|Jean Baptiste Lamarck used fossils in his {{arguments}} for {{his theory of}} the transmutation of species in the early 19th century. Fossil finds, and the emerging evidence that life had changed over time, fueled speculation on this topic {{during the next few}} decades. Robert Chambers used fossil evidence in his 1844 popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which advocated an evolutionary origin for the cosmos as well as for life on earth. Like Lamarck's theory it maintained that life had progressed from the simple to the complex. These early evolutionary ideas were widely discussed in scientific circles but were not accepted into the scientific mainstream. Many of the critics of transmutational ideas used fossil evidence in their arguments. In the same paper that coined the term dinosaur Richard Owen pointed out that dinosaurs were at least as sophisticated and complex as modern reptiles, which he claimed contradicted transmutational theories. Hugh Miller would make a similar argument, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fossil fish found in the Old Red Sandstone formation were fully as complex as any later fish, and not the primitive forms alleged by Vestiges. While these early evolutionary theories failed to become accepted as mainstream science, the debates over them would help pave the way for the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection a few years later.|$|E

5|$|Mobile Suit Gundam SEED was {{directed}} by Mitsuo Fukuda (Future GPX Cyber Formula and Gear Fighter Dendoh) with music by Toshihiko Sahashi. The series was first announced in June2002, while a trailer was available in September on the series' official website. A total of eight writers {{were in charge of}} the series. The characters were designed by Hisashi Hirai, while the mechanical designs were made by Kunio Okawara and Kimitoshi Yamane. Mobile Suit Gundam planning manager Koichi Inoue stated that the staff making Gundam SEED was a new and young team that would continue working with following Gundam series. Inoue, however, would work with anime based on the original Gundam series. Fukuda stated that Gundam SEED was initially told from Kira's point of view, but deeper into the series the point of view would shift to other characters. His main focus with the series was to entertain the audience, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> drama would develop through the series in a similar vein to previous Gundam series. The first part worked on was the plot followed by action sequences, stating that the human characters were more important than the combat sequences. In retrospect, Fukuda said that Kira's wish to fight was forced upon him stemming from his desire to protect his friends. Moreover, he considered these actions as being based on Japanese thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} Turkey in March 2012, with filming {{reported}} to be continuing until 6 May. Production was expected to take three months in the country. Adana stands in for the outskirts of Istanbul in the film. A group of Turkish teenagers infiltrated a closed set in a railway sidings in Adana to film rehearsals of a fight scene {{on top of a}} train before being caught by security. The train scene depicted in trailers showed the Varda Viaduct outside Adana. Bond stunt double Andy Lister dived backwards off the 300-foot drop for the scene. A crane was set up on a train carriage to hold a safety line. Parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Grand Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—were closed for filming in April. Store owners in the affected areas were reportedly allowed to open their shops, but were not allowed to conduct business, instead being paid TRY750 ($418) per day as compensation. Production faced criticism for allegedly damaging buildings while filming a motorcycle chase across rooftops in the city. Michael G. Wilson denied these claims, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film crew had removed sections of rooftops before filming began and replaced them with replicas {{for the duration of the}} shoot; when filming finished, the original rooftops would be restored. The production team negotiated with 613 part owners of the Calis Beach in Fethiye, to film along the coastline.|$|E
