50|$|Ho-Chunk has {{a set of}} {{instrumental}} <b>prefixes</b> which indicate that an action is accomplished by means of some instrument, force, or special type {{of instrumental}} movement. These <b>prefixes</b> are translated into English with such phrases as ‘by foot,' ‘by hand,' or ‘by striking.' Some sources list eight instrumental <b>prefixes</b> in Ho-Chunk, while others recognize a ninth nąą- ’by internal force’ (phonologically identical to nąą- ’by foot’). These <b>prefixes</b> are listed first with their English translation, then paired with a stem wax ’string’:The instrumental <b>prefixes</b> are identified as ’Inner’ or ’Outer’ due to their position relative to other <b>prefixes</b> attaching to the verb stem. Inner <b>prefixes</b> are closer to the verb stem, while outer <b>prefixes</b> are farther away on the left edge of the word. Instrumental <b>prefixes</b> are found in all Siouan languages, and it is theorized that outer instrumentals originated as nouns or nominalized stems.|$|R
