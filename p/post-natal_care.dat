40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the referral patterns and pregnancy outcomes of fetuses with conotruncal anomalies (CTA) from a fetal cardiology unit in South India. Methods: Records of 68 women identified to have diagnosis of CTA on fetal echocardiography (mean gestational age 26. 8 ± 5. 9 weeks; range 17 - 38 weeks) {{during the period}} 2008 - 2011 were reviewed. Results: The most common indication for referral was suspected congenital heart disease during routine antenatal scan (89. 7 %). The various CTA diagnosed included Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF, 44. 1 %), Double outlet right ventricle (DORV, 27. 9 %), Transposition of great vessels (TGA, 8. 8 %), TOF with pulmonary atresia (TOF-PA, 8. 8 %), TOF absent pulmonary valve (TOF-APV, 7. 4 %) and truncus arteriosus (TA, 2. 9 %). Extra cardiac anomalies were reported in 4 fetuses (7. 1 %). Pregnancy outcomes included pregnancies not culminating in live-birth (54. 4 %), delivery at term (41. 2 %) with 3 patients (4. 4 %) being lost to follow-up. Proportion of pregnancies not culminating in live-birth lesion wise include: TOF (53. 3 %), DORV (52. 6 %), TGA (50 %), TOF -APV (80 %), TOF-PA (50 %), and TA (50 %). Twenty-four babies (35. 3 %) received <b>post-natal</b> cardiac <b>care</b> with 5 (7. 4 %) undergoing neonatal surgical procedures. Seven babies (10. 3 %) died in neonatal period, including 2 who underwent surgery. The accuracy of fetal echo was 96. 4 % for primary lesion and 67. 9 % for complete segmental diagnosis. Conclusions: Pre-natal diagnosis of CTA, despite a high diagnostic accuracy, prompted utilization of <b>post-natal</b> tertiary cardiac <b>care</b> in a limited proportion of patients, including those with reparable lesions. Focus in developing countries should shift towards earlier referral, improving awareness about treatment options and a comprehensive evaluation for associated anomalies...|$|R

Group B Streptococcal (GBS) sepsis was diagnosed at birth and the patient was treated intensively with antibiotics. Cranial CT and magnetic resonance examination indicated irregularities consistent with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) on the right anterior lateral horn and in the periventricular area. He had a febrile convulsion at the age of ten months, and bilateral parieto-occipital multi-spikes and hypsarrhyttmia were evident on electroen- cephalogram (EEG) 10 days after the seizure. Valpronic acid (VPA) was prescribed for the prevention of attacks, but further infantile spasms occurred after 5 days. Convulsions increased with series formation, and retardation of development was also noted. He was admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of West syndrome. Increased doses of VPA and high doses of vitamin B 6 (VB 6) were administered without clinical benefit. In view of the clinical deterioration, Zonisamide (ZNS) was additionally prescribed. Eleven days after the initiation of ZNS treatment, the spasms disappeared, and the hypsarhytlmia and irregular spike and wave complex patterns on EEG were resolved.

40|$|Gonadotropins {{and their}} receptors' genes carry several single-nucleotide polymorphisms {{resulting}} in endocrine genotypes modulating reproductive parameters, diseases, and lifespan leading to {{important implications for}} reproductive success and potential relevance during human evolution. Here we illustrate common genotypes of the gonadotropins and gonadotropin receptors' genes and their clinical implications in phenotypes relevant for reproduction such as ovarian cycle length, age of menopause, testosterone levels, polycystic ovary syndrome, and cancer. We then discuss their possible role in human reproduction and adaptation to the environment. Gonadotropins and their receptors' variants are differently distributed among human populations. Some hints suggest {{that they may be}} the result of natural selection that occurred in ancient times, increasing the individual chance of successful mating, pregnancy, and effective <b>post-natal</b> parental <b>cares.</b> The gender-related differences in the regulation of the reproductive endocrine systems imply that many of these genotypes may lead to sex-dependent effects, increasing the chance of mating and reproductive success in one sex at the expenses of the other sex. Also, we suggest that sexual conflicts within the FSH and LH-choriogonadotropin receptor genes contributed to maintain genotypes linked to subfertility among humans. Because the distribution of polymorphic markers results in a defined geographical pattern due to human migrations rather than natural selection, these polymorphisms may have had only a weak impact on reproductive success. On the contrary, such genotypes could acquire relevant consequences in the modern, developed societies in which parenthood attempts often occur at a later age, during a short, suboptimal reproductive window, making clinical fertility treatments necessary...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{critical}} analysis of key concepts associated with post-natal depression (PND) to facilitate healthcare professionals with improving standards of <b>care.</b> <b>Post-natal</b> depression is often inadequately understood by healthcare professionals. The objective was to clarify and present understandings of PND. Post-natal depression may result in referral to Community Mental Health Teams and although initial contact and management is usually through Primary Care,increasingly there is involvement of liaison mental health nurses. A literature review and synthesis of research papers on PND was conducted. Using the keywords post-natal depression, post-partum, puerperium, perinatal, therapy, trial, review, systematic, 135 articles were yielded and limited to 57, which were critically reviewed and categorized into key concepts and themes. Synthesis of literature in relation to PND has facilitated construction of an evidence-based contemporary picture of clinical manifestation, aetiology, methods of screening, preventing, treating and managing PND. The veracity of the evidence surrounding the aetiology and treatment of PND is variable. Interventions are often ineffective and a vacuum in the evidence base exists leaving a dynamic environment for researchers to identify more successful ways of predicting, detecting, treating and managing PND...|$|R
40|$|Food-based {{safety net}} {{programs}} support adequate consumption {{and contribute to}} assuring livelihoods. They differ from other safety net programs {{in that they are}} tied to the provision of food, either directly, or through cash-like instruments (food stamps, coupons) that may be used to purchase food. Since food provided through a safety net program may be substituted for a household’s current consumption, freeing up income for other uses, food-based transfers represent a contribution to household real income or purchasing power. Because food is often seen as the domain of women, women in a household are likely to have control over the use of transfers of food, and of cash-like instruments tied to food. The fact that women control food-related transfers is one possible explanation of the fact, widely documented, that transfers in the form of food or tied to food are more likely to increase households’ net food consumption than are equivalent cash transfers. Food-based programs can be designed to be self-targeting to the poor. Because food-linked coupons or stamps are restricted in use, {{they are likely to be}} less desirable than cash. If the use of coupons is restricted to inferior, less-preferred foods, the self-targeting effect will be greater. Direct provision of food may be self-targeting because of the limited choice of commodities; because the foods may be inferior in terms of consumption patterns (though not nutritionally inferior); and because there may be inconvenience associated with receiving bulky commodities. Ordinarily, cash is considered preferable to food, but in crisis situations when food supply is disrupted, food may be preferred. Providing cash or cash-like stamps or coupons in situations where supply is limited and (in the short run) unresponsive to increased demand will only drive up prices. Public provision of food is generally more politically acceptable than cash transfers, because food is a merit good. The commonest types of food-based transfers are supplementary feeding programs, food for work programs, and food stamp programs. Supplementary feeding programs provide a direct transfer of food to target households or individuals. The commonest forms are maternal and child feeding and school feeding. The food may be prepared and eaten on-site (e. g., in child feeding centers or school feeding programs), or given as a “dry ration” to take home. Even if targeted to an individual (child, pregnant or lactating mother), supplementary food is shared among household members. In the case of on-site feeding, the meal eaten on site may be substituted for a home-prepared meal. Supplementary feeding is often provided as an incentive for participation in public services such as primary health <b>care</b> (pre- and <b>post-natal</b> and well-baby <b>care)</b> and education. To achieve nutritional improvement, supplementary food needs to be provided in the context of a more comprehensive program of health care and health and nutrition education. In school feeding programs, food provided on site may contribute to improved learning by alleviating short-term hunger, in addition to its effects as a food supplement and as an incentive to attend school. Food for work programs provide wages in the form of food for public works. Because the provide a source of guaranteed employment, they constitute a true safety net, but only households with able-bodies members can benefit. Effective food for work programs can build infrastructure that contributes to long term food security. Food stamp programs provide stamps or coupons that may be used for the purchase of food, or of particular foods. The stamps may be denominated in value terms or in terms of quantities of specific foods. Food stamps may be used in local stores, so they are more convenient to use than bulk commodities; they are less distorting than direct food distribution; and they can strengthen local retail establishments. Use of stamps requires a reliable system for printing and distributing the stamps, and a good banking system to assure that retailers can redeem the stamps for cash. As with supplementary feeding, food stamps are often provided in conjunction with primary health care or schooling, as an incentive for participation, though there are also stand-alone food stamp programs that function more like cash transfers. Food-based transfers in emergency situations include direct provision of family rations, supplementary feeding of vulnerable groups such as infants, children, and pregnant or lactating women, and therapeutic feeding of acutely malnourished individuals in a hospital-like setting. In many emergency situations, such as refugee or IDP camps, food transfers are the only source of food, and may constitute the only resources a household receives. The purposes of food-based transfer programs vary widely, and include income support, guarantee of a minimum level of consumption, improved participation in socially beneficial programs, and nutritional improvement. Costs also vary widely depending on the size of the transfer, the size of the target group, and the logistical difficulty of distribution. Cost-effectiveness depends on the specific objective(s); cost-effectiveness comparisons are difficult because of the multiple objectives often served by a single program. The multiple types of food-based transfer programs should be viewed as complements to each other, rather than alternatives, because they serve different populations and have distinct gfood, hunger, welfare...|$|R
