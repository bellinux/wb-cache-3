30|$|Given {{that there}} {{generally}} are no rerouting solutions that avoid conflicts in all network configurations, our second contribution {{is to avoid}} these situations. To reach this goal we use multiple planes to provide a rerouting strategy that avoids conflicts {{that could not be}} solved by using only one plane. Therefore, we introduce here a new scheme to solve the link and node failure problems in a network of switches. This new scheme negates the drawbacks of [7, 8] by showing that a conflict-free rerouting scheme for a multiple-link-failure situation can be constructed even when the network remains connected. The rerouting scheme described in this paper uses filters in switches to determine the next hop for the incoming flow. We provide each virtual network a specific filter. Then, the controller sets the flow path by programming the switches in the form of quadruplets (S, N, O, F) in which S is the source <b>port</b> (<b>node),</b> N the current node, O the output ports because flow can be split and forwarded through different paths to the same destination depending upon the spare capacity needed, and F the filter, which indicates the destination.|$|E

30|$|This {{research}} {{constitutes the}} first-ever analysis of global maritime networks {{in relation to}} urban development. Complementary analyses converged in verifying positively the initial hypothesis that maritime networks are spatial networks which spatial distribution strongly depends on the local characteristics of its (<b>port)</b> <b>nodes.</b> At the same time, the influence of city sizes tended to diminish during the period under study (1950 – 1990), which corroborates the validity of early spatial models of port-city separation. Changing technological standards and trade patterns fostered port competition, traffic concentration, and network rationalization {{to such an extent}} that maritime networks and city-systems became gradually less overlapped at the global scale. The simplification of the network’s structure motivated by time and cost reduction led to a decline in the number of intermediary port calls as ships increase in size and travel over longer distances. Still in 1990 however, the urban influence remains significant, especially in terms of maritime centrality and connectivity. At the same time, the world’s largest cities lose and maintain their maritime functions. This paradoxical result can be largely attributed to the underlying geographic shifts of urban and maritime dominance across the world, in an age of rapid globalization.|$|R
30|$|The {{conception}} of port governance models evolves both {{in time and}} space because of the confluence of several elements: i) devolution, ii) corporate governance, iii) operational profile, iv) functional autonomy, v) functional pro-activeness, vi) investment responsibility and (vii) financial autonomy (see Verhoeven and Vanoutrive 2012). This evolution has intensified since the 1990 s, in line with the devolution programs developed all around the world. Those reforms sought to increase the transparency, optimize the resources and find new financial sources (Brooks 2004) 1. Additional and relevant changes for the port governance evolution are: i) the new paradigm of <b>ports</b> (<b>nodes</b> instead of places); ii) the need for ports to be competitive, flexible and efficient, iii) the internationalization of cargo handling firms, iv) the confluence of different port governance models into the same geographical area and v) a larger spatial scope of ports and a reduction of ties with the cities where they are located (Vanoutrive 2012). It could be concluded that port governance models are influenced {{by the size of the}} corresponding port authority (Verhoeven 2011), and evolve because of the socio-economic framework and the performance of ports (Brooks and Pallis 2008).|$|R

40|$|In a {{reconfigurable}} network, lightpath connections can be dynamically {{changed to}} reflect changes in traffic conditions. This paper characterizes the gain in traffic capacity that a reconfigurable wavelength division multiplezed (WDM) network offers over a fixed topology network where lightpath connections are fixed and cannot be changed. We define the gain as {{the ratio of}} the maximum offered loads that the two systems can support for a given blocking probability. We develop a system model to approximate the blocking probability for both the fixed and reconfigurable systems. This model is different from previous models developed to analyze the blocking probability in WDM networks in that it accounts for a port limitation at the nodes. We validate our model via simulation and find that it agrees strongly with simulation results. We study high-bandwidth calls, where each call requires an entire wavelength and find that reconfigurability offers a substantial performance improvement, particularly when the number of available wavelengths significantly exceeds the number of <b>ports</b> per <b>node.</b> In this case, in a ring with nodes, the gain approaches a factor of 2 over a fixed topology unidirectional ring, and 4 over a fixed topology bidirectional ring. Hence, a reconfigurable unidirectional (bidirectional) ring can support 2 (4) times the load of a fixed topology unidirectional (bidirectional) ring. We also show that for a given traffic load, a configurable system requires far fewer <b>ports</b> per <b>node</b> than a fixed topology system. These port savings can potentially result in a significant reduction in overall system costs...|$|R

The main purpose of Node 1 was to provide internal storage by providing four stowage rack locations within the module and to allow docking of multiple modules and a truss segment to it.

30|$|The {{explosion}} of computer capacity, {{the revival of}} the “science of networks”, and the growing availability of maritime traffic data soon gave birth to numerous analyses of global maritime flows, which greatly varied in objectives and outcomes. Physicists for instance found rather natural to investigate the topological properties of the global maritime network, responsible for no less than 90 % of world trade volumes, but focusing primarily on container shipping (Deng et al. (2009); Doshi et al. (2012); Hu and Zhu (2009)). They stressed the belonging to the classes of scale-free and small-world networks using standard measures from the then buoyant research field of complex networks. Other contributions of the kind consisted in comparing the networks of different fleet types (Kaluza et al. 2010) to better understand marine bioinvasions, analyzing the inter-similarity of the container shipping and airline networks (Parshani et al. (2010); Woolley-Meza et al. (2012)), and constructing global port-to-port matrices to estimate the impact of various scenarios on flow distribution (Tavasszy et al. (2011); Wang et al. (2012)). Geographers also contributed to this dynamics by mapping the nodal regions and centrality of pivotal hub ports for container shipping (Ducruet and Notteboom (2012); Gonzalez-Laxe et al. (2012); Wang and Wang (2011)), general cargo (Pais Montes et al. 2012), and in the multiplex graph (Ducruet 2013). Li et al. ((2015)) as well as Xu et al. (2015) departed from the classical view of <b>port</b> <b>nodes</b> to analyze the evolution of a global container shipping network made of large regions.
