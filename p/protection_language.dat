25|$|There {{have been}} a number of criticisms of the premium support model. Some have raised concern about risk selection, where {{insurers}} find ways to avoid covering people expected to have high health care costs. Premium support proposals, such as the 2011 plan proposed by Rep.

Some critics are concerned that the Medicare population, which has particularly high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, would have a hard time choosing between competing health plans. Robert Moffit, a senior fellow of The Heritage Foundation responded to this concern, stating that while there may be research indicating that individuals have difficulty making the correct choice of health care plan, there is no evidence to show that government officials can make better choices. Henry Aaron, one of the original proponents of premium supports, has recently argued that the idea should not be implemented, given that Medicare Advantage plans have not successfully contained costs more effectively than traditional Medicare and because the political climate is hostile to the kinds of regulations that would be needed to make the idea workable.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{describe}} legal {{theories that}} non-smoking residents of multiple occupancy buildings may employ when affected by {{environmental tobacco smoke}} (ETS) from neighbouring units.  DESIGN—Legal research was conducted in several US states. Research was performed among statutes and regulations. State health regulations were examined as well as common law claims of nuisance, warranties of habitability, {{and the right of}} quiet enjoyment.  RESULTS—Through the use of state regulations, such as a sanitary code, several states provide general language for protecting the health of residents in multi-unit buildings. State law also supports more traditional claims of nuisance, warranties of habitability, and the right of quiet enjoyment.  CONCLUSIONS—The use of state regulations has the potential to provide an effective, existing vehicle for resolution of ETS incursion problems. The general health <b>protection</b> <b>language</b> of the regulations, in conjunction with the latest evidence of the harmful effects of ETS, gives state agencies authority to regulate environmental tobacco smoke incursions among apartments in multi-unit dwellings. Where state regulations are not available, other common law legal remedies may be available.    Keywords: environmental tobacco smoke; legal strategies; multiple occupancy dwelling...|$|E

40|$|THESIS 10770 This thesis aims to {{investigate}} language revitalization {{in terms of}} policy and planning in Occitan France. It comprises three main research questions. The first of these questions addresses the effectiveness of regional and municipal level language policy in the revitalization of an endangered language. The policies of the neighbouring regions of Languedoc-Roussillon and Midi-Pyrenees in France are analysed using a number of theoretical frameworks (Cooper, 1989; Ager, 2001; Spolsky, 2004 : Shohamy, 2006). The second research question focuses {{on the use of}} endangered languages in the public space and seeks to analyse to what extent this domain {{can be used as a}} mechanism for language revitalization. The third, and final, research question concerns the revitalization goals of the Occitan-speaking community in both regions. It is indicated in the literature that speakers of an endangered language community tend to aim too high in their revitalization goals (i. e. official status, legal <b>protection,</b> <b>language</b> in education) before first ensuring the language is stable in lower domains (Fishman, 1991) such as in the family home with continued intergenerational transmission...|$|E

Results indicate that consumer knowledge and/or self assessment is low in the area of personal finances, credit usage and consumer <b>protection.</b> <b>Language</b> and sex are significantly associated with consumer knowledge scores; lower scores are more likely if a language other than French or English was spoken in the childhood home, and if the student is female. Previous courses taken with consumer related content significantly improved consumer knowledge scores. Respondents are aware of their level of consumer knowledge based on self assessment and knowledge scores obtained. Generally, respondents judge school and the family as the most useful sources of consumer knowledge; the contribution of the family is not valued highly by respondents who spoke a language other than French or English at home. Support for courses in consumer education is almost unanimous...|$|E
40|$|The {{constitutionality}} {{of affirmative action}} has now {{become one of the}} central topics in the politics of race. Ironically, the United States Constitution says absolutely nothing about affirmative action. The text never mentions the term, and the equal <b>protection</b> <b>language</b> in the Fourteenth Amendment simply begs the question of whether equality requires or precludes the use of affirmative action. The intent of the Framers is similarly unhelpful. We know that the drafters of the Fifth Amendment owned slaves, and the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment envisioned a racially stratified society. But the Fourteenth Amendment was itself an affirmative action measure, and few of us think that the racial prejudices of the Framers should continue to govern contemporary race relations. There are a host of fancier, non-interpretivist constitutional theories, including structural theories, moral theories, civic republican theories, representation-reinforcement theories, public-choice theories, and postmodern critical-race theories, but none has sufficiently broad support to claim status as the one 2 ̆ 2 authentic 2 ̆ 2 approach to constitutional interpretation. Rather, they are parochial overlays imposed on a Constitution that is best understood as defining the terms of engagement for political bargaining.

40|$|International {{responses}} to conflict and complex humanitarian emergencies are diverse and multifaceted. Different actors – among them non-government organisations (NGOs), the United Nations (UN) protection mandated organisations, UN peacekeeping forces, both {{military and police}} – all {{have a role to}} play to mitigate the impact of armed conflict on civilian populations. Over the last 13 years a significant amount of work has been done to improve the international community’s response in relation to the protection of civilians (POC). This has been led by different actors – the UN Security Council, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the humanitarian community made up of UN humanitarian agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and NGOs – all working in the same complex humanitarian contexts. Despite the development of POC, there is a perceived ‘disconnect’ between the understanding of different forms of protection, the different disciplines practising or working on the POC, and the different guidance and legal regimes imposing obligations on both state and non-state actors in the area of protection. This paper is the first contribution to a broader research project that aims to determine whether the perceived disconnect between actors involved in protection work is real or anecdotal. By exploring the evolution of <b>protection</b> <b>language</b> and policy through the UN Security Council, DPKO and the humanitarian community, it is possible to develop an improved understanding of some of the reasons  for distinct protection policies and definitions that exist between different actors. Some initial variations in the interpretation of POC are quick to emerge, giving rise to additional questions about how the distinctions can be better understood...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{international}} {{humanitarian law}} (IHL) through the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 1977 has required the protection of civilian populations in armed conflict. The Geneva Conventions provide guidance {{with regard to the}} obligations of states and parties to a conflict to apply the principle of distinction and to ensure precaution in attack as they pursue their military objectives. This was the first international legal framework to provide for the protection of civilians and forms the foundation of the ‘Protection of Civilians’ concept. Throughout the 1990 s, devastating failures to protect civilians from violence and atrocities shaped thinking at the United Nations (UN) and gave rise to a more expansive concept of Protection of Civilians, incorporating international human rights law, international refugee law, and including best practices in peacekeeping operations and humanitarian response. This is reflected in the adoption of Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict as a thematic concern of the UN Security Council, and the development of policy and guidance relating to civilian protection since 1999, at the United Nations and elsewhere. The term ‘Protection of Civilians’ has expanded from a set of legal obligations in IHL to a conceptual and operational framework used by multiple ‘protection actors’[*] and practitioners—military and civilian, political and humanitarian. The concept of Protection of Civilians has developed in response to conflicts and crises as they emerged and as a result has developed unevenly. Combined with {{the fact that there is}} no operational definition of Protection of Civilians, there is a perception among protection practitioners that different actors involved in providing protection to people caught up in crisis understand and implement the concept differently. This perception raised questions among the researchers as to whether different understandings actually exist, and if so what the implications for the implementation of civilian protection might be. This gave rise to a research project titled In Search of Common Ground – Understanding Civilian <b>Protection</b> <b>Language</b> and Practice for Civil and Military Practitioners...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} how Canadian cattle producers are using NAFTA to demand $ 300 million in compensation from U. S. taxpayer funds, {{claiming that the}} Canadian cattle import ban instituted after mad cow disease was found in Canada violates their NAFTA rights. In addition, a Canadian tobacco company is using the private NAFTA tribunals to attack the U. S. tobacco settlements. These claims are among the 42 cases filed thus far by corporate interests and investors under NAFTA's "Chapter 11 " investor provisions, which grant foreign interests more expansive legal rights and privileges than those enjoyed by U. S. citizens or corporations. With only 11 of the 42 cases finalized, some $ 35 million in taxpayer funds have been granted to five corporations that have succeeded with their claims. An additional $ 28 billion has been claimed from investors in all three NAFTA nations. The U. S. government's legal costs {{for the defense of}} just one recent case topped $ 3 million. Seven cases against the United States are currently in active arbitration. The report documents how "fixes" to the NAFTA investor protection model required by Congress in the 2002 "Fast Track" legislation {{were not included in the}} proposed CAFTA. CAFTA's investment provisions include several cosmetic, ineffective tweaks to the NAFTA investor <b>protection</b> <b>language,</b> but otherwise expand the system of new privileges and private enforcement to investors in six additional nations. These rights include the ability to demand compensation when public health and environmental policies [...] even when applied equally to domestic and foreign firms [...] might undermine a foreign firm's profitability. On this ground and others, CAFTA fails to meet Congress' most significant Fast Track requirement regarding investment rules in future pacts by granting foreign firms greater rights when operating within the United States than U. S. firms or residents enjoy under constitutional property rights interpreted by the U. S. Supreme Court. CAFTA was signed in 2004 but has not yet been brought up for congressional consideration; support for the deal is limited, in part because of its investment provisions. The United States has not yet lost a case, thanks to an array of lucky technical breaks [...] such as an investor relocating into the United States and thus losing foreign investor standing under NAFTA. However, with the overall win-loss ratio of NAFTA investor-state cases running around 50 - 50, it is just a matter of time before a NAFTA claimant is successful against the United States...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the legal}} <b>protection</b> of <b>languages</b> {{from the point}} of view of ''regional majority languages'', i. e. languages of populations which, though a majority in their historic territory (where they may nevertheless be experiencing some form of assimilation), are minorities at the national level (French in Quebec, Catalan in Catalonia, and many languages in the pre- 1991 Soviet Union). Only the protection of aboriginal linguistic minorities seems to have been considered so far at the international level. The paper proposes some sociolinguistic principles related to the legal <b>protection</b> of <b>languages</b> which can be gathered from the Canadian experience: the present situation of aboriginal languages and the Quebec's experience of language planning. Some recent foreign experiences of legal language planning are also taken into account (mainly Spain and the countries of the former USSR). Comments are also made on a draft Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights that is currently circulating. The new linguistic situation arising from the suppression of barriers to free trade is briefly considered as in some cases language can be considered as a nontariff barrier to free trade: minority languages would be most vulnerable to such legal interpretations...|$|R

This article investigates the current legal framework for minority <b>language</b> <b>protection</b> in Japan, where a history of assimilation has threatened the ancestral language and culture of the Ainu minority. The situation in Japan is contextualised within a broader discussion of minority <b>language</b> <b>protection</b> at global and European level in order to better understand the political environment in which a shift in policy for the <b>protection</b> of minority <b>languages</b> has begun. Although the implementation of a new law to promote Ainu culture has led to limited benefits for the Ainu, the fact that Japan continues to deny that the Ainu were colonised and dispossessed of resources acts as a barrier to reconciliation and a way forward. Findings indicate that the processes of internationalisation are conducive to increased international cooperation to promote consensus, greater social inclusion and more opportunity for minorities to participate in political structures. A further significant finding is that an acceptance of diversity and local autonomy can lead to an assurance of human rights...|$|R

This creates the important normative {{question of how to}} respond politically to linguistic diversity. What is a just language policy? Are language minorities entitled to <b>language</b> <b>protection?</b> Should <b>language</b> rights be accorded to immigrants? Is the universal rise of English as a lingua franca to be applauded or to be regretted? The most important and comprehensive thinker within this debate over linguistic justice is Philippe Van Parijs. In his bold and controversial theory of linguistic justice, Van Parijs argues that the rise of English is a good thing, as well as that all language groups are entitled to grab a territory on which only their language receives public recognition. This collection, bringing together some of the most influential contemporary political philosophers, presents a critical review of Van Parijs’s theory and gives a state-of-the-art overview of the prevailing positions on linguistic justice within political philosophy. It will be of interest to students and scholars studying philosophy, politics, linguistics, international relations and law.
