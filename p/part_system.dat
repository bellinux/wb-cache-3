In protest, a United States national LGBT advocacy organization, the Gill Action Fund, canceled its reservation to hold a conference of major donors at the Beverly Hills Hotel and demanded a refund of its deposit. The hotel management responded by issuing a statement asserting that it does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Fashion designers Brian Atwood and Peter Som subsequently called for wider protests, urging the fashion industry to boycott all of the hotels owned by the Dorchester Collection.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{the design of}} a service <b>parts</b> <b>system</b> for system {{maintenance}} in the after-sale supply chain. With the increasing demand to secure critical system uptime, it is crucial to have spare parts that are organized and accessible. However, storing spare parts in various locations can lead to high costs. In recent years, due to the advancement of third-party logistics for expedited service and in response to this emerging trend, an increasing number of manufacturers have started to provide different service contracts, such as a next day service and a special expedited service. Through an appropriate service contract, users could then outsource the management of spare parts to service providers, apart from solely managing the on-site spare parts in the traditional approach. The system design of service <b>parts</b> <b>systems</b> incorporates the considerations of service contracts with different response time agreements, on-site spare parts, component failure uncertainty, component variety and the impact of component failure for different users. Under the framework of the axiomatic design theory, we identify customer attributes, functional requirements, design parameters and process variables in the service <b>parts</b> <b>system.</b> We then analyze the configuration of service options by modeling the user decisions on selecting the most suitable service contracts and optional on-site spare <b>parts</b> for <b>system</b> maintenance. With greater understanding of selection decision from different users, we study the design of inventory pool structures in the operation to support the part requests with two major types of service contracts. The contributions of these research studies are not only to design a mass customized service <b>parts</b> <b>system</b> for service providers to satisfy different user requirements with the operational efficiency, but also to align with various user decisions in the service parts fulfillment strategies in the after-sale supply chain...|$|R

We define a method for extending the use of conditional entropy to address the PCFP to prediction based on multiple paradigm cells. We apply this method to French and European Portugese and show that, on average, knowledge of multiple paradigm cells is dramatically more predictive than knowledge of a single cell. Moreover, this new entropy measure proves useful in studying principal <b>parts</b> <b>systems,</b> which correspond to sets of predictors yielding a null entropy. Using a graded measure allows us to highlight the relevance of non-categorical or “good enough” principal <b>parts</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

At the most advanced level, digital glass printers, ceramic inks, and image processing software are fully integrated with one another and each contributes to the overall advancements in the digital printing on glass process. The three <b>part</b> <b>system</b> allows for control and flexibility over the application of the ceramic inks. Transparency and levels of translucency and opacity can be precisely manipulated. There is a high level of control over color matching, and multiple colors can be printed simultaneously. Unlike screen printing, digital ceramic printing on glass does not require screens and the files are stored digitally making printing of all sizes and replacement of any panel simple, in high resolution, full color.|$|E

The CLU may also be used separately from the missile as a portable thermal sight. Infantry are no longer required to stay in constant contact with armored personnel carriers and tanks with thermal sights. This makes infantry personnel more flexible and able to perceive threats they would not otherwise be able to detect. In 2006, a contract was awarded to Toyon Research Corporation to begin development of an upgrade to the CLU enabling the transmission of target image and GPS location data to other units.|$|E
