50|$|There are {{a number}} of large mammals in Laos, {{including}} the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and Indochinese tiger (Panthera tigris corbetti). There are two species of bear, the sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) and Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus). Smaller carnovorans include the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), marbled cat (<b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata)</b> and hog badger (Arctonyx collaris).|$|R
50|$|<b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata</b> is {{included}} in CITES Appendix I and protected over parts of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Yunnan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Thailand. Hunting is regulated in Lao PDR and Singapore. In Bhutan and Brunei, the marbled cat is not legally protected outside protected areas. No information about protection status is available from Cambodia and Vietnam.|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} {{a hunting}} {{record of a}} rare felid, Marbled Cat <b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata</b> in Hija Village at the Ziro Valley, Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh. The ecological knowledge on marbled cats is limited {{in this part of}} the geographic range of this species. However, the threats like the hunting directly impact the marbled cat populations. Initiatives to study the impact of the hunting practices and assessing the sustainability of these hunting practices on this species are required...|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} park is home for {{other kinds of}} big, medium, and small cats, clouded leopard/macan dahan (Neofelis nebulosa), marbled cat/kucing batu (<b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata),</b> leopard cat/kucing hutan (Prionailurus bengalensis), and Asian golden cat/kucing emas (Catopuma temminckii). The Asian golden cats can be found everywhere in the {{national park}}, as they adapt well to various kinds of habitat, both forested and open spaces. One camera trap image gave a rare photo of a golden cat mother moving a cub to another location with her mouth.|$|R
50|$|Pardofelis {{was first}} {{proposed}} by the Russian explorer and naturalist Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 as generic name comprising a single felid species occurring in tropical Asia, the marbled cat Pardofelis marmorata.The British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic classification of Pardofelis in 1917 as comprising not only the marbled cat but also the Borneo bay cat Pardofelis badia, because of similarities {{in the shape of}} their skulls. In 1939, he described <b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata</b> on the basis of skins and skulls which originated in Java, Sumatra, Darjeeling and Sikkim.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} few {{targeted}} studies of small felids in Sumatra {{and there is little}} information on their ecology. As a result there are no specific management plans for the species on Sumatra. We examined data from a long-term camera trapping effort, and used Maximum Entropy Modeling to assess the habitat use and distribution of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi), Asiatic golden cats (Pardofelis temminckii), leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis), and marbled cats (<b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata)</b> in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Over a period of 34, 166 trap nights there were low photo rates (photo events/ 100 trap nights) for all species; 0. 30 for golden cats, 0. 15 for clouded leopards, 0. 10 for marbled cats, and 0. 08 for leopard cats. There is overlap in the predicted distributions of clouded leopards, golden cats, and marbled cats; indicating areas of high conservation importance for these species within the park. The predicted distribution of leopard cats was discrete from the other species which is important to consider in the development of conservation strategies. This study provides important documentation of small felid distribution in Sumatra, information for the development of management strategies within the park, and a basis upon which to develop future research for the species...|$|R
40|$|The {{cytogenetics}} {{of eight}} Felidae species in Thailand were {{investigated by the}} colchicines-hypotonic fixation-air drying technique followed by a conventional technique. All species studied have an identical number of 38 diploid chromosomes, indicating a close genetic relationship among species. At a deep study level, the genetic relationships of eight Felidae species were accessed by the AFLP method. Blood samples were collected from sources locating in their original regions for DNA extraction. With ten successful primer combinations, a total of 4208 scorable bands were generated. Of these bands, 18. 91 % are polymorphic. Percentages of Polymorphic Bands (PPB) for each primer combination range from 15. 00 to 23. 59 %. The generating bands were used for dendrogram construction. The average genetic similarity values among all Felidae species are 68. 20 % (between Panthera tigris and Neofelis nebulosa) to 85. 53 % (between Prionailurus bengalensis and Prionailurus viverrinus). The dendrogram shows that the eight Felidae species were clustered together and the subfamily Pantherinae and Felinae with Neofelis nebulosa are distinguished. The Felinae, Prionailurus bengalensis, Prionailurus viverrinus, Catopuma temminckii, Felis chaus, <b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata</b> and Neofelis nebulosa were clustered together with 91 % bootstrap support and the Pantherinae, Panthera pardus is clustered with Panthera tigris with 92 % bootstrap support. In summary, the ten successful primer combinations {{can be used to}} determine genetic differences among eight Thailand Felidae species...|$|R
40|$|A {{study to}} {{identify}} the field biodiversity of the Sabangua Forest, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, was initiated in May 2008 and involved continuous sampling until October 2009. A total of 44 cameras in 27 locations were used and 5, 777 functional trap nights (of 6, 542 survey nights) resulted in confirmed sightings of the Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa, leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis, marbled cat <b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata</b> and flat-headed cat Prionailurus planiceps, representing {{four of the five}} wild felids of Borneo. The long-term use of fixed and roving cameras provided insight into the movements, occurrence and activity patterns of these elusive felids within in a disturbed peat-swamp forest. In an area of 145 km² (including buffer) the clouded leopard was the most commonly photographed felid (22 photo-captures of 53 total captures), followed by the leopard cat (21), flat-headed cat (7) and marbled cat (3). A total of 231 camera-trap nights were required to obtain the first photograph of a felid, the leopard cat, 704 for the clouded leopard, 3, 498 for the flat-headed cat, and 5, 423 (476 calender days) for the marbled cat. A female clouded leopard was not photographed until 5, 764 trap nights. This highlights the importance of long-term camera-trapping studies to maximise capture probability of these elusive felids and especially to account for potential differences in home range size and use by clouded leopard males and females.

40|$|The {{clouded leopard}} Neofelis nebulosa {{is a potent}} {{ambassador}} species for conservation, occurring from the Himalayan foothills eastwards to Indochina, between which Myanmar is a biogeographical land bridge. In Myanmar's Northern Forest Complex, the species co-occurs with the tiger Panthera tigris, leopard Panthera pardus, marbled cat <b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata,</b> golden cat Catopuma temminckii and leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis. We deployed cameras within the Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary over 2 consecutive years. In 2014 – 2015 we deployed 82 camera stations around the Nam Pa Gon stream (Catchment 1) for 7, 365 trap days. In 2015 – 2016 we deployed 80 camera stations around the Nam E Zu stream (Catchment 2) for 7, 192 trap days. In Catchment 1 we identified five tigers from 26 detections, five clouded leopards from 41 detections (68 photographs) and 11 marbled cats from 13 detections. Using Bayesian-based spatial capture–recapture we estimated the densities of tigers and clouded leopards to be 0. 81 ± SD 0. 40 and 0. 60 ± SD 0. 24 individuals per 100 km 2, respectively. In Catchment 2 we identified two tigers from three detections, nine clouded leopards from 55 detections and 12 marbled cats from 37 detections. Densities of clouded leopards and marbled cats were 3. 05 ± SD 1. 03 and 8. 80 ± SD 2. 06 individuals per 100 km 2, respectively. These differences suggest that human activities, in particular gold mining, are affecting felid populations, and these are a paramount concern in Htamanthi. We demonstrate the importance of Htamanthi within the Northern Forest Complex and highlight the Yawbawmee corridor {{as a candidate for}} protection...|$|R
40|$|The {{marbled cat}} <b>Pardofelis</b> <b>marmorata</b> is a poorly known wild cat {{that has a}} broad {{distribution}} {{across much of the}} Indomalayan ecorealm. This felid is thought to exist at low population densities throughout its range, yet no estimates of its abundance exist, hampering assessment of its conservation status. To investigate the distribution and abundance of marbled cats we conducted intensive, felid-focused camera trap surveys of eight forest areas and two oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Study sites were broadly representative of the range of habitat types and the gradient of anthropogenic disturbance and fragmentation present in contemporary Sabah. We recorded marbled cats from all forest study areas apart from a small, relatively isolated forest patch, although photographic detection frequency varied greatly between areas. No marbled cats were recorded within the plantations, but a single individual was recorded walking along the forest/plantation boundary. We collected sufficient numbers of marbled cat photographic captures at three study areas to permit density estimation based on spatially explicit capture-recapture analyses. Estimates of population density from the primary, lowland Danum Valley Conservation Area and primary upland, Tawau Hills Park, were 19. 57 (SD: 8. 36) and 7. 10 (SD: 1. 90) individuals per 100 km 2, respectively, and the selectively logged, lowland Tabin Wildlife Reserve yielded an estimated density of 10. 45 (SD: 3. 38) individuals per 100 km 2. The low detection frequencies recorded in our other survey sites and from published studies elsewhere in its range, and the absence of previous density estimates for this felid suggest that our density estimates may be from the higher end of their abundance spectrum. We provide recommendations for future marbled cat survey approaches...|$|R
