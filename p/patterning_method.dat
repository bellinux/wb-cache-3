Thus, Uhrich investigates the optimal dimensions for promoting neuronal growth in conjugation with Professors Helen Buettner, Martin Grumet and David Shreiber, and the most effective <b>patterning</b> <b>method</b> to generate protein gradients. More recently, Uhrich's group is collaborating with Professor Sally Meiners of UMDNJ to create nerve guidance conduits from biodegradable polymers.|$|E
50|$|When covalently {{attached}} to a surface, PPGs do not exhibit any surface-induced properties (i.e. they behave like PPGs in solution, and not not exhibit any new properties because of their proximity to a surface). Consequently, PPGs can be patterned on a surface and removed in manner analogous to lithography to create a multifunctionalized surface. This process was first reported by Solas in 1991; protected nucleotides were {{attached to}} a surface and spatially-resolved single stranded polynucleotides were generated in a step-wise “grafting from” method. In separate studies, there have been multiple reports of using PPGs to enable the selective separation of blocks within block-copolymers to expose fresh surfaces.

5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>patterning</b> <b>method</b> {{used by the}} {{semiconductor}} device industry is photolithography -- patterning using light. In this process, the substrate of interest is coated with photosensitive resist and irradiated with short-wavelength light projected through a photomask, which is a specially prepared stencil formed of opaque and transparent regions - usually a quartz substrate with a patterned chromium layer. The shadow of opaque regions in the photomask forms a submicrometer-scale pattern of dark and illuminated regions in the resist layer -- the areal image. Chemical and physical changes occur in the exposed areas of the resist layer. For example, chemical bonds may be formed or destroyed, inducing a change in solubility. This latent image is then developed for example by rinsing with an appropriate solvent. Selected regions of the resist remain, which after a post-exposure bake step form a stable polymeric pattern on the substrate. This pattern {{can be used as}} a stencil in the next process step. For example, areas of the underlying substrate that are not protected by the resist pattern may be etched or doped. Material may be selectively deposited on the substrate. After processing, the remaining resist may be stripped. Sometimes (esp. during Microelectromechanical systems fabrication), the patterned resist layer may be incorporated in the final product. Many photolithography and processing cycles may be performed to create complex devices.|$|E

Despite nonoptimal wet etch and repassivation processes which currently limit the obtained lifetime, proof of concept cells on p type wafers fabricated using this novel emitter patterning process and lithographically patterned metallization exhibit an open circuit voltage of 694 mV and pseudo fill factors of 83.

There are mainly two design methods to determine the form of ETFE cushion. According to the model used for the analysis process of cutting, the two forming design methods consist of three-dimensional pattering method and flat <b>patterning</b> <b>method.</b> To investigate the forming design methods of ETFE cushion, two methods are presented which are the three-dimensional <b>patterning</b> <b>method</b> based on the zero-stress state and the flat <b>patterning</b> <b>method</b> based on nonlinearity of ETFE material. The physical states and mechanical models are defined for the two methods, respectively. On {{the basis of the}} theoretical analysis, experiments and numerical simulations on the two separate ETFE cushions are performed to obtain the shapes, stress distributions and the variations. It is found that, for the three-dimensional patterning model, the maximum difference of the shapes between experimental and numerical results is only 4 mm and the difference of the stress distributions is only 0. 4 MPa. For the flat patterning model, a good agreement between the experimental and numerical results is obtained for the initial shape, and it is obtained that the stress decreases when the shape height and the ratio of rise to span increase due to the creep properties of ETFE materials. These findings have validated the proposed forming design methods, which are great importance for the application and development of ETFE cushion...|$|E

40|$|Tensile fabric {{structures}} are efficient and cost effective structural systems for covering large areas. The performance of such structures is {{highly dependent on}} their geometry, {{and for this reason}} they must be doubly curved. However, doubly curved surfaces may not be formed from flat fabric without incurring distortions. The process of patterning is employed to determine the planar configuration of panels, such that after assembly, these distortions are minimised. However, patterning is sensitive to the numerical models and processes employed. Shear of the fabric is required for it to adopt a doubly curved shape, but this has been overlooked in the numerical models used currently for the patterning of tensile fabric structures. On this basis, a discrete element model for numerical representation of the fabric, during the patterning process, is proposed and examined in this thesis. Further to this, the computational process of patterning is examined thoroughly, and improvements to sub-processes within patterning form part of a proposed <b>patterning</b> <b>method.</b> This thesis reviews the literature relating to tensile fabric structures, patterning, and numerical modelling. The discrete model is described, along with its implementation in the proposed <b>patterning</b> <b>method.</b> Comparison with published results is included to evaluate the suitability of the proposed model and <b>patterning</b> <b>method.</b> It is shown that the proposed discrete element model offers an alternative model for architectural fabrics at the patterning stage.

40|$|One way of {{reducing}} the cost of crystalline silicon solar cell fabrication is by increasing the conversion efficiency of the device. However, most high efficiency solar cell designs require more complex fabrication methods that also increase the fabrication cost. Photolithography {{is an example of}} such an indispensable but costly process. The most common use for photolithography in solar cell fabrication is for dielectric patterning. In this thesis, inkjet printing is proposed as an alternative method for dielectric patterning in solar cell fabrication. There are two inkjet printing methods developed in this thesis. The indirect inkjet <b>patterning</b> <b>method</b> involves the deposition of a suitable plasticiser droplet onto an intermediate resin coating layer on top of the dielectric surface. Diethylene glycol and novolac resin are used as the plasticiser and coating layer respectively. The plasticiser changes the permeability of the affected region of the resin such that it becomes permeable to liquid dielectric etchants. When the resin layer is removed, the printed pattern is transferred to the dielectric layer. The optimised process produces round openings with diameters as small as 30 - 35 &# 956;m and continuous line patterns with width as narrow as 40 - 50 &# 956;m. The direct inkjet <b>patterning</b> <b>method</b> involves the deposition of liquid phosphorus dopant sources onto both silicon and dielectric surfaces. Two types of phosphorus sources are used: phosphoric acid and specially-formulated dopant sources. Narrow lines as wide as 15 - 20 &# 956;m are produced after appropriate surface treatments on both silicon and dielectric surfaces. Using this method, a process that simultaneously pattern the dielectric layer and diffuse the silicon underneath is developed. Various high efficiency solar cell structures such as selective emitter, localised contacts, surface texturing and edge isolation are demonstrated using the indirect inkjet <b>patterning</b> <b>method.</b> Both inkjet patterning methods are then used in the fabrication of a selective emitter solar cell. Fill factors in the range of 0. 79 - 0. 80 are shown to be achievable with both patterning methods, thus indicating the high quality metal-silicon contacts formed by these inkjet techniques...|$|E

The <b>patterning</b> <b>method</b> begins with transferring a highly uniform reduced graphene oxide thin film, which is pre-prepared on a glass substrate, onto hydrophobic silanized (rigid/flexible) substrates. Patterns of the as-prepared reduced graphene oxide films are then formed by modulating the surface {{energy of the}} films and selectively delaminating the films using an oxygen-plasma-treated elastomeric stamp with patterns. Reduced graphene oxide patterns with various sizes and shapes can be readily formed onto an entire wafer. Also, they can serve as the source/drain electrodes for benchmark n- and p-type organic field-effect transistors with enhanced performance, compared to those using conventional metal electrodes. These results demonstrate the general utility of this technique. Furthermore, this simple, inexpensive, and scalable electrode-patterning-technique leads to assembling organic complementary circuits onto a flexible substrate successfully. Reproducible and effective wafer-scale patterning of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrodes by transfer-and-reverse stamping method is reported. The highly defined rGO micropatterns with various shapes are readily formed on rigid or flexible hydrophobized substrates and serve as the electrodes for high-performance n- and p-type OFETs and complementary inverters. close 2...|$|E
