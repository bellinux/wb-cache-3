40|$|OBJECTIVE: Events {{occurring}} {{very early}} in life, even prenatally, may have long-term effects on future health and behaviour. The influence of <b>poor</b> <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> and gestational stress in the mother on the risk of emotional problems in offspring was reviewed. METHOD: A selective {{review of the literature}} was undertaken. RESULTS: Studies of preterm infants and infants born small for gestational age have shown increased levels of emotional problems across the lifespan. In general, studies examining maternal depression/anxiety during pregnancy and other indices of gestational stress have shown significant associations with emotional problems in children. The results of several studies also point to the importance of psychosocial and genetic factors in moderating associations. CONCLUSION: Future research that focuses on identifying the mechanisms underlying these associations is needed. The moderating role of psychosocial and genetic risk factors is an important area in which future research should be directed. These findings have clinical implications for the provision of antenatal care...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{revealed}} strong relationships between <b>poor</b> <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> and subsequent {{development of the}} metabolic syndrome. Persisting effects of early malnutrition become translated into pathology, thereby determine chronic risk for developing glucose intolerance and diabetes. These epidemiological observations identify the phenomena of foetal programming without explaining the underlying mechanisms that establish the causal link. Animal models have been established and {{studies have demonstrated that}} reduction in the availability of nutrients during foetal development programs the endocrine pancreas and insulin-sensitive tissues. Whatever the type of foetal malnutrition, whether there are not enough calories or protein in food or after placental deficiency, malnourished pups are born with a defect in their beta-cell population that will never completely recover, and insulin-sensitive tissues will be definitively altered. Despite the similar endpoint, different cellular and physiological mechanisms are proposed. Hormones operative during foetal life like insulin itself, insulin-like growth factors and glucocorticoids, as well as specific molecules like taurine, or islet vascularization were implicated as possible factors amplifying the defect. The molecular mechanisms responsible for intrauterine programming of the beta cells are still elusive, but two hypotheses recently emerged: the first one implies programming of mitochondria and the second, epigenetic regulation...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{over the}} recent decades {{indicates}} that susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be established already prenatally and in early childhood, {{and that the}} aetiological processes of the disease involve biological and social influences occurring throughout a person’s life span. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} small size at birth is associated with increased risk of CVD later in life. This finding is suggested to reflect the influence of <b>poor</b> <b>foetal</b> nutrition on the body’s organ structure, physiology and metabolism. Surprisingly, there is little empirical evidence available to support the proposed causal mechanisms. The aim of this thesis is to study the mechanisms underlying the inverse association of size at birth with CVD. Three studies in the thesis are based on Uppsala Birth Cohort Study (UBCoS), a prospective cohort study which includes men and women, who were born at the Uppsala Academic Hospital between 1915 and 1929. Information from birth records, school catalogues, Hospital Discharge Register, Cause of Death Register and Censuses is used. One study is based on Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program (SHEEP), a population based case-control study of risk factors for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with study base including all Swedish citizens aged 45 - 70 years with no prior clinically diagnosed AMI, who lived in Stockholm County during 1992 - 1994. Data from birth records, questionnaire, health exami-nation and blood sampling is used. In both data materials small size at birth was associated with increased risk of CVD. Further analyses showed that birth weight for gestational age in men was associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality within the non-manual class but not among the manual workers, even if the overall mortality rate was higher in the latter. There was no difference in the association by the men’s family’s social class at birth. For women, social class neither at birth nor in adulthood modified the association between birth weight for gestational age and IHD mortality. We found that there was a synergistic interaction between low weight for gestational age and overweight in adulthood on risk of AMI. The simultaneous analysis of <b>foetal</b> <b>growth,</b> cognitive ability and IHD mortality suggested that there is an indirect association between <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> and cognitive ability through childhood cognitive ability. Finally, men with very low and very high birth weight for gestational age had a higher risk of dying after an AMI than men with intermediate birth size. Case fatality in women was not associated with their size at birth. The results suggest that the effect of <b>poor</b> <b>foetal</b> nutrition on CVD may be modified by social exposures later in life. The synergistic interaction between small size at birth and high adult body mass index with respect to AMI risk supports the thrifty phenotype hypothesis according to which a mismatch between foetal and adult nutrition is causing the disease. The existence of an indirect association between <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> and IHD mortality through childhood cognitive ability implies that mechanisms related to brain development are contributing to the association between <b>poor</b> <b>foetal</b> nutrition and IHD, in addition to the effects on physiology and metabolism. As the association of size at birth with case fatality was different from the associations with incidence and mortality, the mecha-nisms that operate after the AMI event and determine the prognosis might partly be different from the mechanisms that drive the development of the disease...|$|R

40|$|Background: Low {{birth weight}} {{increases}} the risk of childhood behavioural problems, {{but it is not clear}} whether <b>poor</b> <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> has a long-term influence on susceptibility to depression. Aims: To examine the relation between birth weight and riskof psychological distress and depression. Method: At age 16 years 5187 participants in the 1970 British Cohort Study completed the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire to assess psychological distress. At age 26 years 8292 participants completed the Malaise Inventory to assess depression and provided information about a history of depression. Results: Women whose birth weight was 3 kg had an increased risk of depression at age 26 years (OR= 1. 3; 95 % CI 1. 0 – 1. 5) compared with those who weighed > 3. 5 kg. Birth weight was not associated with a reported history of depression or with risk of psychological distress at age 16 years. In men there were no associations between any measurement and the full range of birth weight but, compared with men of normal birth weight, those born weighing 2. 5 kg were more likely to be psychologically distressed at age 16 years (OR= 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 5) and to report a history of depression at age 26 years (OR= 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 3).

40|$|Objective: New findings, {{that relate}} <b>poor</b> <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> to {{long-term}} outcomes, highlight {{the need to}} understand more {{about the nature of}} women's diets before and during pregnancy. This study examines the influence of sociodemographic and anthropometric factors {{on the quality of the}} diets of young women in the UK. Design: Diet was assessed by an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire. A single diet score was calculated for each woman using the first component defined by principal components analysis. Setting: Southampton, UK. Subjects: A total of 6125 non pregnant women aged 20 - 34 y. Results: The diets of women with low diet scores were characterised by low intakes of fruit and vegetables, wholemeal bread, rice and pasta, yogurt, and breakfast cereals, but high intakes of chips and roast potatoes, sugar, white bread, red, and processed meat and full-fat dairy products. Educational attainment was the most important factor related to the diet score. In all, 55 % (95 % CI 50 - 59 %) of women with no educational qualifications had scores in the lowest quarter of the distribution, compared with only 3 % (95 % CI 2 - 4 %) of those who had a degree. Smoking, watching television, lack of strenuous exercise, and living with children were also associated with lower diet scores. After taking these factors into account, no other factor including social class, the deprivation score of the neighbourhood, or receipt of benefits added more than 1 % to the variance in the diet score. Conclusions: Poor achievement at school defines a substantial group of women in the UK who may be vulnerable. Many of these women have poor diets that are not simply a result of the level of deprivation in their neighbourhood, or of living at a level of poverty that entitles them to benefits. We suggest that it is a priority to identify and to address the barriers that prevent these women from improving the quality of their diets.

The key to prevention of <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> restriction is the recognition of those women at risk and implementation of effective interventions. Ideally, all women should plan pregnancy, providing an opportunity for lifestyle change, reduction of risk factors and optimisation of medical conditions. Failing adequate preconception care, antenatal care should include an assessment of risk factors in early pregnancy, so appropriate interventions may be instituted. Effective interventions are available for women with HIV and also those living in malaria-endemic areas.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that some adult diseases, such as {{cardiovascular}} diseases, may be programmed during foetal life. It is not clear, however, whether final height may be predicted from <b>foetal</b> <b>growth.</b> A longitudinal cohort of full-term healthy Swedish babies (n = 3650) was followed up from birth to maturity in a population-based growth study. Length or height and its changes were analysed from birth to 18 y of age; 2807 children, with data available on birth length, final height and parental height, were included in this analysis. The result clearly shows that length at birth relates to final height. In terms of standard deviation scores (SDS), the mean difference in length at birth from the mean was greatly decreased in final height, but retained the same order as was seen at birth. In terms of centimeter difference from the reference mean values, the difference in length at birth remained roughly stable into final height. For instance, babies 5 cm above or below the mean birth length will end up approximately 5 cm above or below the mean in final height. Parental height–a surrogate value of the genetic final height potential of an individual–is shown to influence postnatal growth in height strongly. However, the difference from the mean in length at birth remained into adulthood within the same midparental height group. Conclusion: This study reveals that trends in <b>foetal</b> linear <b>growth</b> continue into maturity. <b>Foetal</b> <b>growth</b> is a significant predictor of postnatal growth.

40|$|Fat {{mass and}} obesity-associated (FTO) gene {{variants}} {{are associated with}} childhood and adult obesity; however, the influence of FTO polymorphisms on <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> is unknown. Associations between the FTO variant rs 9939609 and the <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> trajectories, maternal pregnancy weight gain, anthropometric measures at birth and body mass index (BMI) at age 14 years were assessed in 1079 singleton-birth Australian Caucasians. Analyses were repeated in 3512 singleton-birth Dutch Caucasians. The rs 9939609 obesity-risk AA genotype was associated with symmetrical intrauterine growth restriction; an effect reversed in mothers who smoked during pregnancy. The effect increased over time and was modified by maternal smoking for head circumference (P = 0. 007), abdominal circumference (P = 0. 007), femur length (P = 0. 02) and estimated foetal weight (P = 0. 001). The modification of the association between the AA genotype and birth anthropometrics by maternal smoking was consistent across birth weight (P = 0. 01) and birth length (P = 0. 04) and neonatal day 2 anthropometry. Consistent associations were replicated in the Generation R cohort. Maternal pregnancy weight gain matched the pattern of birth weight and was independent of placental weight. In adolescents, the AA genotype was associated with increased BMI-adjusted-for-age in males (P = 0. 00009), but no effect was detected in females. A variant in the FTO gene influences <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> trajectories in the third trimester, early postnatal growth and adiposity in adolescence. Maternal smoking during pregnancy reversed the direction of association of rs 9939609 on <b>foetal</b> <b>growth,</b> which was probably mediated by maternal energy intake.

40|$|AbstractThe {{control of}} <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> is poorly {{understood}} {{and yet it}} is critically important that at birth the body has attained appropriate size and proportions. Growth and survival of the mammalian foetus is dependent upon a functional placenta throughout most of gestation. A few genes are known that influence both <b>foetal</b> and placental <b>growth</b> and might therefore coordinate growth of the conceptus, including the imprinted Igf 2 and Grb 10 genes. Grb 10 encodes a signalling adapter protein, is expressed predominantly from the maternally-inherited allele and acts to restrict <b>foetal</b> and placental <b>growth.</b> Here, we show that following disruption of the maternal allele in mice, the labyrinthine volume was increased {{in a manner consistent with}} a cell-autonomous function of Grb 10 and the enlarged placenta was more efficient in supporting <b>foetal</b> <b>growth.</b> Thus, Grb 10 is the first example of a gene that acts to limit placental size and efficiency. In addition, we found that females inheriting a mutant Grb 10 allele from their mother had larger litters and smaller offspring than those inheriting a mutant allele from their father. This grandparental effect suggests Grb 10 can influence reproductive strategy through the allocation of maternal resources such that offspring number is offset against size...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decades {{there has been}} an {{improvement}} in the medical treatment of children born preterm or with reduced <b>foetal</b> <b>growth.</b> This has resulted in a much higher survival rate of these children, but also in a higher number of surviving children with chronic conditions. These changes have, in turn, increased interest in investigating the connection between birth-characteristics and outcomes in later life. The overall aim of the present thesis was to study the relations between birth-characteristics, subsequent hospitalisations, and childbearing by means of data available in Swedish population-based registries. The study population in this thesis consisted of women (and men in Paper III) born in 1973 - 75 according to the Medical Birth Register and the Total Population Register. Information available in other registries, such as the Hospital Discharge Register, was obtained by individual record linkage. In Paper I, 148, 281 women, alive and living in Sweden at 13 years of age, were included. Of the women, 4. 1 % were born preterm and 5. 4 % were born small for gestational age, and approximately 30 % of all women had given birth between 13 and 27 years of age. We found that reduced <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> and possibly preterm birth were related to the likelihood of giving birth during the study period. The intergenerational effects of preterm birth and reduced <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> were investigated in Paper II and the study population consisted of 38, 720 mother-offspring pairs. An intergenerational effect of reduced <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> was found, and reduced <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> in the mother also increased the risk for preterm birth in the child. Paper III was concerned with 304, 275 men and women living in Sweden at 13 years of age. Of these men and women, 30 % were hospitalised during adolescence and early adulthood (i. e. between 12 and 23 years of age). We found that men and women born small for gestational age or preterm {{were more likely to be}} hospitalised, and that those born small for gestational age seemed to be more at risk compared to those born preterm. Finally, in Paper IV, the relation between hospitalisations during adolescence and the likelihood of giving birth was studied in 142, 998 women living in Sweden at 20 years of age. We found that a majority of the causes of hospitalisation during adolescence were positively connected to the likelihood of giving birth between 20 and 27 years of age.

40|$|During {{physiological}} pregnancy, all tissues and, mostly, placenta and foetus require high {{amounts of}} oxygen.

Hypothesized causes include maternal malnutrition, foetal glucocorticoid overexposure and reduced growth factors. Animal studies suggest {{a role for}} epigenetic processes in maintaining early-life effects into adulthood, but human relevance is unknown. We aimed to investigate relationships between an unbalanced maternal diet in pregnancy, neonatal and adult anthropometric variables with methylation at key genes controlling tissue glucocorticoid action and <b>foetal</b> <b>growth.</b> Design: we studied 34 individuals aged 40 from the Motherwell cohort study whose mothers ate an unbalanced diet in pregnancy, previously linked with elevated blood pressure and cortisol in adult offspring. Measurements: DNA methylation at 11 ?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD 2), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF 2) was measured by pyrosequencing on buffy coat DNA. Results: methylation at specific CpGs in the HSD 2 promoter and {{at one of the}} IGF 2 differentially methylated regions (H 19 ICR) correlated with neonatal anthropometric variables. CpG methylation within HSD 2, GR and H 19 ICR was positively associated with increased adiposity and blood pressure in adulthood.

40|$|AbstractImprinted genes, {{which are}} {{expressed}} {{from a single}} parental allele in response to epigenetic marks first established in the germline, function in a myriad of processes to regulate mammalian development. Recent work suggests that imprinted genes may regulate the signalling function of the placenta by modulating {{the size of the}} endocrine compartment. Here we provide in vivo evidence that this hypothesis is well founded. Elevated expression of the imprinted Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family a, member 2 (Phlda 2) gene drives a reduction of the spongiotrophoblast endocrine compartment, diminished placental glycogen and asymmetric <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> restriction. Using both loss-of-function and gain-in-expression mouse models, here we further show that Phlda 2 exclusively modulates the spongiotrophoblast compartment of the placenta without significantly altering the composition of the trophoblast giant cell endocrine lineages that share a common progenitor with this lineage. Additionally, we show that Phlda 2 loss-of-function placentae contain nearly three times more placental glycogen than non-transgenic placentae. Remarkably, relative to a fully wild type scenario, wild type placentae also accumulate excessive glycogen. While loss-of-function of Phlda 2 increased both placental weight and placental glycogen, the weight of both mutant and non-transgenic fetuses was lower than that found in a fully wild type scenario indicating that excessive glycogen accumulation comes at the cost of <b>foetal</b> <b>growth.</b> This work firstly highlights a novel signalling function for the spongiotrophoblast in stimulating the global accumulation of placental glycogen. Furthermore, this work suggests that Phlda 2 manipulates the placenta's demands for maternal resources, a process that must be tightly regulated by epigenetic marks to ensure optimal <b>foetal</b> <b>growth...</b>|$|R

All {{three of them were}} using low-molecular weight heparin for the prevention of thromboembolic complications. The first two women were admitted because of <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> retardation. In the first patient, either HELLP syndrome or exacerbation of APS was suspected. A caesarean section was performed due to foetal distress. The patient's condition deteriorated further postoperatively. Multiple infarctions in liver and placenta were identified. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) was diagnosed. Despite intensive medical treatment including anticoagulation the patient died of massive pulmonary embolism. The second patient suffered from thrombocytopaenia, disturbances in hepatic function and epigastric pain. CAPS was diagnosed. The condition improved after treatment with glucocorticoids, but because of a <b>poor</b> <b>foetal</b> prognosis, delivery was induced and a lifeless son was born. The third woman was admitted due to pyelonephritis. Shortly thereafter, symptoms of HELLP syndrome developed and she was administered glucocorticoids.

40|$|MSc (Biokinetics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Regular {{physical}} activity during pregnancy provides both maternal and infant health benefits. The complexity of measuring {{physical activity}} during pregnancy hampers {{the determination of}} the optimal dose of habitual physical activity for pregnant women and has led to broad physical activity guidelines for pregnant women. Subjectively-determined physical activity levels by means of questionnaires may have contributed to these broad guidelines. However the ActiHeart®, a dual heart rate monitor and accelerometer, is an accurate and reliable measurement tool to determine physical activity levels during pregnancy. Maternal physical activity tends to decrease during pregnancy and may lead to various health risks, including excessive weight gain, risk for gestational diabetes, lower back pain and adverse foetal outcomes. Determining the influence of physical activity on <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> is confounded by various variables, therefore objectively-measured habitual physical activity is essential. This study aims to objectively determine habitual physical activity patterns of pregnant women and the relationship between habitual physical activity and <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> parameters. In a longitudinal, observational, cohort study design, 60 pregnant women were measured at four stages in their pregnancy: the first trimester (9 – 12 weeks), second trimester (20 – 22 weeks), third trimester (28 – 32 weeks) and three months postpartum. Demographic information was collected by means of a questionnaire specifically compiled for this study, followed by anthropometric measurements (height and weight). Assessment of the participants resting blood pressure, heart rate (Microlife® Semi-Automatic blood pressure and heart rate monitor) and metabolic rate (FitmateTM, Cosmed) was obtained. Thereafter, a step-test was performed for individualised calibration of the ActiHeart® device for assessment of habitual physical activity patterns over a 7 -day period. <b>Foetal</b> <b>growth</b> parameters that included birth weight (kg), birth length (cm), abdominal circumference (cm) and head circumference (cm), were collected from medical records and from the mother post-partum. Habitual physical activity, presented as average Activity Energy Expenditure (AEE), physical Activity Level (PAL), activity counts and minutes spent in activity, declined from the first to the third trimester of pregnancy. The AEE during the first trimester averaged 803 ± 34 kCal/day and declined statistically significant to 592 ± 383 kCal/day in the third trimester. Minutes spent per week doing moderate activity declined from 103 ± 83 min/week in the first trimester to 55 ± 66 min/week in the third trimester. Average pregnancy AEE indicated a non-significant negative relationship with all <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> measurements - birth weight (r = - 0. 39, p = 0. 45), birth length (r = - 0. 16, p = 0. 77), Ponderal Index (r = - 0. 34, p = 0. 51) - and a non-significant positive relationship with head circumference at birth (r = 0. 14, p = 0. 79). In conclusion, the objectively-determined, habitual physical activity levels of the participants did not meet the stated guidelines for pregnant women. During the progression of pregnancy, the activity levels declined significantly at the third trimester. The habitual activity levels indicate no effect on the <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> parameters.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the mesaurements of some specific somatic parameters in the foetus, such as crown rump length (CRL), biparietal diameter of the cranium (BPD), abdominal diameter (AD), muzzle occipital length (MOL) and femur, tibia and metatarsial bone lengths in order to estimate <b>foetal</b> <b>growth.</b> Several regression equations have been formulated in order to do this in buffalo species...|$|R
50|$|Mating {{occurs in}} temperate, {{subtropical}} seas during the winter. Gestation {{is estimated to}} vary around 10 months, 11 months, or one year, depending which model of <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> is used. The different estimates result from scientists' inability to observe an entire pregnancy; most reproductive data for baleen whales were obtained from animals caught by commercial whalers, which offer only single snapshots of fetal growth. Researchers attempt to extrapolate conception dates by comparing fetus size and characteristics with newborns.|$|R
40|$|The pig {{industry}} suffers economical loss due to stillbirths, piglet {{mortality and}} low birth weight. This {{is due to}} breeding programs that have resulted in larger litters. It {{has been suggested that}} these problems are due to the metabolic state of the sow during gestation {{and the fact that she}} might not be able to supply her foetuses with enough nutrients for survival and a high and even birth weight. A lot of research has been done to investigate whether body weight and back fat thickness of the sow has any impact on her reproductive traits and if there are any special feed components that improve reproduction. Fibers and unsaturated fatty acids have a positive impact on reproductive traits as long as the sow is fed a sufficient amount of energy and protein during gestation and lactation. In conclusion <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> and survival is affected by the amount and type of sow feed. Thus there is a connection between the metabolic state of the sow and the ability of the piglets to survive and it is possible to affect <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> with different feeding strategies. However more research is needed...|$|R

40|$|Amino acids are {{essential}} nutrients for <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> and development, and maternal protein restriction decreases <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> despite increasing placental size. To determine if placental structure is altered {{so as to}} impair function despite increased size, the effect of maternal protein restriction on the composition and vascularization of the placenta in the rat was determined. Pregnant rats were randomized to receive either a normal protein (20 per cent) or an isocaloric low (8 per cent) protein diet. Placentae were studied at day 18 of gestation. Tissue sections were stained with biotinylatedBandeiraea simplicifolia (BS- 1) lectin to allow identification of foetal capillaries, and analysed using stereological techniques. Protein restriction increased total placental volume, but decreased {{the proportion of the}} placental volume composed of labyrinth. Consequently the total volumes of labyrinthine tissue and of foetal and maternal blood space were not different between the two groups. Protein restriction increased the surface area density and total surface area of the materno-foetal interface, but did not alter foetal capillary surface area, diameter or length. This study found that maternal protein restriction is associated with an increase in placental size, and that this enlargement is accompanied by increases in some, but not all, structural crelates of function...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of restriction of placental <b>growth</b> on <b>foetal</b> adrenal <b>growth</b> and adrenal expression of mRNAs for Insulin-like Growth Factor II (IGF-II), the IGF binding protein IGFBP- 2, Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF- 1) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) receptor (ACTH-R) and the steroidogenic cytochrome P- 450 enzymes: cholesterol side chain cleavage (CYP 11 A 1), 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP 17) and 21 -hydroxylase (CYP 21 A 1); and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta 5 Delta 4 isomerase (3 betaHSD). Endometrial caruncles were removed from non-pregnant ewes before mating (placental restriction group; PR). The total adrenal: foetal weight ratio was higher in PR (n= 6 foetuses) than in control foetuses (n= 6 foetuses). There {{was no difference in}} plasma ACTH concentrations between the PR and control foetuses between 130 and 140 days gestation. Adrenal IGF-II mRNA levels were lower (P< 0. 05) in the PR group, however, adrenal IGFBP- 2 mRNA levels were not different between the PR and control groups. Adrenal ACTH-R mRNA levels were also lower whilst CYP 11 A 1 mRNA levels were increased (P< 0. 005) in the PR group. We conclude that <b>foetal</b> adrenal <b>growth</b> and steroidogenesis are stimulated as a consequence of <b>foetal</b> <b>growth</b> restriction and that factors other than ACTH are important in foetal adrenal activation during chronic, sustained hypoxaemia...|$|R
