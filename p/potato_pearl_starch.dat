In the 1950s, they established a potato processing plant in Blackfoot, Idaho, whereby potato powder could be turned into mashed potatoes by adding boiling water. This technique was used by brands such as <b>Potato</b> <b>Pearls,</b> Golden Grill, Classic Casserole and Savory Series. In 1986, they invented the same technique for beans, for brands such as Santiago Refried Beans and later Santiago Black Beans and Santiago Quick-Start Chili.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effect of oxygen absorber packets (OAP) (AGELESS Z. 300 E) in improving the shelf-life of selected dried food products, including dried <b>potato</b> <b>pearls,</b> dried sliced apple, dried carrot, white rice, nonfat dry milk, all purpose flour, rolled oats, and wheat. Items were stored at four different temperatures (- 20, 10, 21, and 29. 5 °C) over a period of 24 months with observations at 6 -month intervals. Hunter colorimeter, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) germination rate, gluten weight, and volume were parameters used as quality indicators of various dried foods. Statistical analysis indicated a significant time and temperature effect for almost all the stored products. Storage at a high temperature (29. 5 °C) renders OAP ineffective in reducing browning during storage. <b>Potato</b> <b>pearls,</b> dried sliced apple, and dried carrot exhibit darkening by the first 6 months of storage at 29. 5 °C regardless of oxygen status of the container. White rice showed yellowing under the same conditions. Most of the dried food products that were stored at 10 and 21 °C with or without oxygen absorber packets maintained their color as indicted by a relatively constant lightness reading (L*) over time. TBARS values rose in all stored food with increasing storage time, especially when the dried products were stored at higher temperature (29. 5 °C). Statistical analysis indicated a significant OAP effect in reducing TBARS concentration over time. Germination of wheat kernel was reduced to less than 80 % after 24 months of storage at 29. 5 °C. However, when stored with oxygen absorber packets, germination was still 86 %. Storage length and temperature are the primary factors that determine the quality of home-stored dried food items...|$|R

5000|$|Sago [...] is a starch {{extracted}} from the spongy centre, or pith, of various tropical palm stems, especially that of Metroxylon sagu. It is a major staple food for the lowland peoples of New Guinea and the Moluccas, where it is called saksak, rabia and sagu. The largest supply of sago comes from Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. Large quantities of sago are sent to Europe and North America for cooking purposes. It is traditionally cooked and eaten in various forms, such as rolled into balls, mixed with boiling water to form a glue-like paste (papeda), or as a pancake. Sago is often produced commercially {{in the form of}} [...] "pearls" [...] (small rounded starch aggregates, partly gelatinized by heating). Sago pearls can be boiled with water or milk and sugar to make a sweet sago pudding. Sago pearls are similar in appearance as the <b>pearled</b> <b>starches</b> of other origin, e.g. cassava starch (tapioca) and potato starch, and they may be used interchangeably in some dishes.|$|R

Most of the major staple crops of the world, such as rice, wheat, cassava, beans, sweet <b>potato,</b> <b>pearl</b> millet or maize are often deficient in some of these mineral elements. Hence, increasing the concentration of bioavailable micronutrients in edible crop tissues (biofortification) has become a promising strategy in modern agriculture, allowing the access of more nutritious foods, to more people, with the use of fewer resources. Traditional agricultural practices can partly enhance the nutritional value of plant foods, but the advances in the 'omics' technologies are rapidly being exploited to engineer crops with enhanced key nutrients. Ionomics, or the study of the ionome (which can be defined as the mineral trace element composition of a particular organism), is a modern functional genomics tool that can provide high throughput information about the broad spectrum nutrient composition of a given plant food. In alliance with other 'omics' technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics {{it can be used to}} identify numerous genes with important roles in the uptake, transport and accumulation of mineral nutrients in plant foods, in particular in their edible parts. This review provides a critical comparison of the strategies that have been developed to diminish nutrient deficiencies in plant-based foods (SWOT analysis) and a summary of the gene families involved in the mineral nutrient pathways. Finally, it also discusses how 'omics' techniques can be used in genetic engineering programs to increase mineral levels and bioavailability in the most important staple food crops and the socioeconomic implications of plant-based biofortified foods.

40|$|Skim milk was ultrafiltered {{to three}} lactose/protein ratios and spray dried. The skim milk powder was {{extruded}} with <b>pearled</b> corn <b>starch</b> at different moisture contents, protein contents, lactose/protein ratios, and feed rates (control variables). Response surface methodology and a central composite in cube experimental design were used. This design required 30 experimental runs with 16 factorial points, 8 axial points, and 6 center points for replication. The physical and functional properties evaluated were expansion ratio, product temperature, bulk density, color, shear stress, viscosity, and water absorption index (response variables). Scanning electron microscopy {{was done to}} evaluate the microstructural attributes of the extrudates. A quadratic model was used to express the response variables {{in terms of the}} control variables. Response surfaces were generated by assigning center point values to 2 of the 4 control variables and then solving the fitted equations as a quadratic in the remaining 2 control variables. An increase in moisture content decreased expansion ratio, product temperature, color, and water absorption index, and increased bulk density, shear stress, and viscosity. An increase in protein content decreased product temperature, shear stress, viscosity, and water absorption index, increased color, and had no effect on expansion ratio and bulk density. An increase in lactose/protein ratio decreased product temperature, viscosity, and water absorption index, and had no effect on expansion ratio, bulk density, color, and shear stress. Feed rate did not have significant individual effect on any response variable. Expansion ratio had a negative correlation with bulk density (r = - 0. 61) and shear stress (r = - 0. 62) and a positive correlation with product temperature (r = 0. 52). Bulk density and shear stress were positively correlated (r = 0. 69), and product temperature and water absorption index were positively correlated too (r = 0. 81).

40|$|Four plant {{starches}} {{were used}} to study human amylase activity in normal serum and urine, “pancreatitis ” serum,duodenal fluid (secretin stimulated),saliva, and pancreatic extract. The starches were derived from waxy maize, high amylosecorn, <b>potato,</b> and corn (<b>pearl),</b> and were lintnerized. It was shown {{that the rate of}} digestion of starch by each of the fluids tested dependson the plant starch selected as substrate. Diges-tion of waxy maize was most rapid. The advantagesof using waxy maize as a sub-strate are indicated as a means of markedly enhancing the sensitivity of serum amylasedetermination. It was also found that normal serum, urine, and saliva digested potato starch at a greater rate than corn starch with few exceptions,while pancreatitis serum, secretin-stimulated duodenalfluid, and pancreatic extract digestedcorn starch at a greater rate than potato. These findings suggest that organ-specific amylases exist, and that plant starchesmight be used to distinguishthem. RECENT REPORTS (1 - 5) on human amylase reaffirm older findings that “normal ” serum amylase probably represents a mixture of enzymes which may be “organ-specific. ” Amylase in serum is attributed chiefly to the salivary glands and pancreas, and possibly to the liver. At least two “isoamylases ” are found in normal human urine (6, 7). Salivary amylase is separable into several multimolecular forms (8, 9). Physical methods for detel’millillg organ-specific amylases in serum and urine are {{in the early stages of}} development.

40|$|In Malaysia, the {{processing}} of sago starch predates that of cassava, having been established before 1416. With its introduction, cassava, which is a much shorter term crop, quickly replaced sago palm as the preferred raw material among starch processors. Hence, except for a small amount serving the fresh food market, cassava is planted in Malaysia mainly for starch processing. The cassava area in Peninsular Malaysia has declined steadily to 1, 631 ha in 1997 after peaking in 1976 at 20, 913 ha. This decline {{is due to the}} curbing of illegal cultivation; land alienation policy with a bias against cassava; switching from cassava to more lucrative crops; rising costs of production; low prevailing price for cassava roots; and competition for land for agricultural and non-agricultural activities during the economic boom prior to July 1997. Of the eight starch factories reported in Perak in 1984, only two are still in operation. Recently, in Sabah, a starch factory opened to process roots supplied through contract farming from an area of more than 3, 000 ha. In trade, cassava starch takes the form of flour, flakes, <b>pearls</b> and <b>starch</b> powder. There is a growing demand for starch with imports amounting to 88, 210 tonnes in 1997. Most of this starch is used in food industries, particularly for making monosodium glutamate (using about 3, 000 tonnes of starch per month). Other significant users are manufacturers of glucose, bakery and biscuit products, textiles and paper. There is also increasing interest in growing edible varieties of cassava for processing into snacks. The future potential in terms of domestic demand for cassava starch is very good. Since the onset of the economic downturn faced by Southeast Asia, the Malaysian government has actively encouraged agriculture (to offset the country’s huge food import bill amounting to almost US$ 2. 9 billion a year) by providing easier access to farmland. There is recent renewed enthusiasm for planting cassava for production of starch, dried chips for livestock feed and sweeteners (high fructose glucose syrup or HFGS). For large-scale mechanized cassava production, certain prerequisites of soil type, terrain, climate and farm size matching the factory’s capacity, must be satisfied. While land is hard to come by in Peninsular Malaysia, more than 80, 000 ha of land are still available in Sabah. Starch is the most likely product to be feasible and profitable in the immediate future compared to dried chips and HFGS production, because of a high demand in the local market, and a well-established technology for starch processing. Stable, high-yielding varieties with intermediate to high starch content to ensure higher starch recovery are required; better still if they can be harvested early. The potential of using cassava as a carbohydrate-rich animal feedstuff is promising, but being low in protein compared to maize, additional protein is required from another source, entailing extra costs. Also, it is costly to dry cassava by artificial means. Although it is technically possible to produce HFGS from cassava, it involves converting starch by enzymatic processes – a complicated and expensive procedure. This does not seem economically feasible in the immediate future, given the current low world price for sugar. Instead, modified starches and their products have very good future potential as profitable agro-based industries. Modification of starches not only expands their scope of utilization by altering their physico-chemical characteristics, but also increases their value as compared to native starch. An alternative use of cassava, which has some prospects, is the production of snack foods. Although oil-fried crisps and crackers are traditional snacks produced by cottage industries, only recently have attempts been made by larger food processors to improve their quality and packaging, and to target the more up-market urban consumer and overseas market. Preliminary work at MARDI has shown that cassava makes a very good raw material for extruded snacks...|$|R
