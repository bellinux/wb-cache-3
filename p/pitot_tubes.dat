5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes)</b> can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{measurement}} {{avoids the}} need for <b>Pitot</b> <b>tubes,</b> hotwire anemometers or other intrusive Flow measurement probes. The method is capable of measuring an entire two-dimensional cross section (geometry) of the flow field simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{difference}} between an Annubar averaging <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> and a <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is that an Annubar averaging <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> takes multiple samples across a section of a pipe or duct. In this way, it averages the differential pressures encountered accounting for variations in flow across the section. A <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> will give a similar reading if the tip is located {{at a point in}} the pipe cross section where the flowing velocity is close to the average velocity.|$|R

25|$|Investigators {{found that}} the flightcrew had not {{activated}} the pitot head heaters and the <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> had become blocked with ice which caused the crew to receive incorrect airspeed readings. The crew, believing the readings were true, pulled back on the control column and raised the nose, which caused the aircraft to stall.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} address the {{inherent}} flight instability of a flying wing aircraft, the B-2 uses a complex quadruplex computer-controlled fly-by-wire flight control system, that can automatically manipulate flight surfaces and settings without direct pilot inputs {{in order to maintain}} aircraft stability. The flight computer receives information on external conditions such as the aircraft's current air speed and angle of attack via pitot-static sensing plates, as opposed to traditional <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> which would negatively affect the aircraft's stealth capabilities. The flight actuation system incorporates both hydraulic and electrical servoactuated components, and it was designed {{with a high level of}} redundancy and fault-diagnostic capabilities.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress on a {{low-level}} training mission entered {{a swarm of}} locusts. The insects' impacts on the aircraft's windscreens rendered the crew unable to see, forcing them to abort the mission and fly using the aircraft's instruments alone. The aircraft eventually landed safely. In 2010 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) issued a warning to pilots about the potential dangers of flying through a locust swarm. CASA warned that the insects could cause loss of engine power and loss of visibility, and blocking of an aircraft's <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes,</b> causing inaccurate airspeed readings.|$|E
30|$|The {{theory of}} flow {{measurement}} by <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> was adopted first by a French Scientist Henri Pitot in 1732 A.D. for measuring velocities in the river. The <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> {{is used to}} measure the local velocity at a given point in the flow stream. It is a very simple and low-cost device used to measure mean velocities for various industrial purposes (Bryant et al. 2014; Graham et al. 2013; Oh and Lee 2011). The <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is not suitable for velocities lower than 5  m/s (Nakra and Chaudhry 2004) because of low pressure differential availability. The <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> has many disadvantages, as ports for pressure measurements require modification to the wall and present potential disturbance to the flow (Liu et al. 1999). The order of error in the measurement of velocity is up to 20  % as reported by Bakke (1957) and the average error is ± 2  % (Nakra and Chaudhry 2004). <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is not so practicable for turbulence study.|$|R

500|$|The type's second fatal accident, {{and first}} while in {{commercial}} service, occurred on 1 June 2009 when Air France Flight 447, an A330-200 {{en route from}} Rio de Janeiro to Paris with 228 people on board, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean [...] northeast of the islands of Fernando de Noronha, with no survivors. Malfunctioning <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> provided an early focus for the investigation, as the aircraft involved had Thales-built [...] "–AA" [...] models known to record faulty airspeed data during icing conditions. In July 2009, Airbus advised A330 and A340 operators to replace Thales pitots with equivalents manufactured by Goodrich. Investigators later determined that the inadequate response of the pilots to both a loss of airspeed data from malfunctioning <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> and subsequent autopilot disengagement resulted in Flight 447 entering into an aerodynamic stall.|$|E
500|$|The pitot-static system obtains {{pressures}} for interpretation by the pitot-static instruments. [...] While the explanations below explain traditional, mechanical instruments, many modern aircraft use an {{air data computer}} (ADC) to calculate airspeed, rate of climb, altitude and Mach number. In some aircraft, two ADCs receive total and static pressure from independent <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> and static ports, and the aircraft's flight data computer compares the information from both computers and checks one against the other.

500|$|The {{albatrosses}} are a {{group of}} large to very large birds; they are {{the largest of the}} procellariiformes. The bill is large, strong and sharp-edged, the upper mandible terminating in a large hook. This bill is composed of several horny plates, and along the sides are the two [...] "tubes", long nostrils that give the order its former name. The tubes of all albatrosses are along the sides of the bill, unlike the rest of the Procellariiformes where the tubes run {{along the top of the}} bill. These tubes allow the albatrosses to measure the exact airspeed in flight; the nostrils are analogous to the <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> in modern aircraft. The albatross needs accurate airspeed measurement in order to perform dynamic soaring. Like other Procellariiformes, they use their uniquely developed sense of smell to locate potential food sources, whereas most birds depend on eyesight. The feet have no hind toe and the three anterior toes are completely webbed. The legs are strong for Procellariiformes, making them and the giant petrels the only members of that order which can walk well on land.|$|E
500|$|A blocked {{pitot tube}} is a pitot-static problem {{that will only}} affect {{airspeed}} indicators. [...] A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> are equipped with a heating element. [...] A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|E

50|$|In a <b>pitot</b> <b>tube,</b> {{the height}} of the fluid column is {{proportional}} to the square of the velocity of the fluid at the depth of the inlet to the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube.</b> This relationship was discovered by Henri Pitot in 1732, when he was assigned the task of measuring the flow in the river Seine.|$|R
50|$|The {{airspeed}} indicator averaged readings from two sources: the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> {{on the leading}} edge of the port wing, and a small pitot inlet in the nose, just above the top edge of the underskid channel. There was a further tapping-off of pressure-ducted air from the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> which also provided the rate of climb indicator with its source.|$|R
