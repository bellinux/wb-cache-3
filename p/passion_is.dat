25|$|Passion {{begins with}} a long {{introductory}} foray into the Western philosophical tradition of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger {{that is at the}} heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. <b>Passion</b> <b>is</b> at the heart of this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.|$|E

500|$|According to Tattvarthasutra, a major Jain text, [...] "the {{severance}} of vitalities out of <b>passion</b> <b>is</b> injury". Therefore, {{the higher}} the number of senses and vitalities a being has, the more is its capacity to suffer and feel pain. Hence according to Jainism, violence to higher-sensed beings like man, cow, tiger {{and those who have}} five senses and the capacity to think and feel pain attracts more karma than violence to lesser-sensed beings like insects, or single-sensed beings like microbes and plants.|$|E
