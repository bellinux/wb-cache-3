40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to check {{construction}} and operation costs for simplified posttreatment trains able to produce water displaying a quality suitable for different agricultural uses. Having in mind the quality of most of surface waters in Italy, the main parameters to control for a general purpose reclaimed water supply are microbial quality and TSS content. Therefore a contact filtration followed by disinfection is to be considered the minimum option, while the use of polishing ponds can be strictly limited in many Italian regions due to the area requirements and {{to the need to}} provide a full lining of bottom and levees. Some data referring to surface waters quality and to the Italian epidemiological situation are given. On the basis of the current Italian situation, the construction and operation cost increases due to a <b>polishing</b> <b>section,</b> downstream a standard municipal WWTP, are evaluated and the impact of different technical choices is shortly discussed (disinfection options, chemicals, etc.). Some considerations about the link existing in Italy between the cost of water for irrigation and the agricultural economy are mad...|$|E

40|$|Earthen {{architectural}} fragments (burned or cemented) {{are often}} {{collected during the}} excavation in Italian prehistoric and protohistoric sites. The technological characterization of these remains is relevant to recognize the existence of local or regional building traditions and to understand the exploitation of raw materials and, more in general, the ancient production strategies. In addition to the current macroscopic analysis (morphology of fragments and classification of pastes) and before the realization of archaeometric analysis, it’s possible to complete the analytical protocol of daub with some observations in <b>polished</b> <b>section.</b> To realize a <b>polished</b> <b>section,</b> the daub sample is cut and the resulting <b>section</b> is <b>polished</b> with sandpaper. The realization {{of this kind of}} section allows a better description of the arrangement of the constituents, to identify the processes of transformation and deformation of raw materials during the building activity. The aim of these mesoscopic analysis is to characterize the behavioral chain referred to the processing of raw materials and their installation, linking the observed characteristics to specific actions. It’s possible to obtain some functional data about the original function of the earthen structures or the dynamics of entrance in the archaeological record a well. This paper presents some case-studies and some preliminary keys to understand the features observed in <b>polished</b> <b>section.</b> The use of this analytical technique gives some encouraging results, especially in comparing the number of relevant data to the low cost of production of a <b>polished</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R
