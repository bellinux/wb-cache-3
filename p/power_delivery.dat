USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5A and 3.0A over the 5V power bus in addition to baseline 900mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line or they can support the full <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.|$|E
5|$|The USB <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> Specification revision2.0 (USB PD rev. 2) {{has been}} {{released}} {{as part of the}} USB3.1 suite. It covers the Type-C cable and connector with four power/ground pairs and a separate configuration channel, which now hosts a DC coupled low-frequency BMC-coded data channel that reduces the possibilities for RF interference. <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> protocols have been updated to facilitate Type-C features such as cable ID function, Alternate Mode negotiation, increased VBUS currents, and VCONN-powered accessories.|$|E
5|$|As of USB <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> Specification revision2.0, version1.2, the six fixed power {{profiles}} {{for power}} sources have been deprecated. USB PD Power Rules replace power profiles, defining four normative voltage levels at 5V, 9V, 15V, and 20V. Instead of six fixed profiles, power supplies may support any maximum source output power from 0.5W to 100W.|$|E
50|$|Workhorse Group Incorporated is an American {{manufacturing}} {{company based in}} Ohio, currently focused on manufacturing electrically <b>powered</b> <b>delivery</b> and utility vehicles. The company was founded in 1998 by investors {{who took over the}} production of General Motors' P30/P32 series stepvan and motorhome chassis. By 2005 they were taken over by Navistar International, which had been selling them diesel engines since before. Navistar then shuttered the plant in 2012, to cut costs after having suffered heavy losses. In March 2015 AMP Electric Vehicles took over Workhorse Custom Chassis, changing the company name to Workhorse Group Incorporated, and began offering a range of electrically <b>powered</b> <b>delivery</b> vans.|$|R
40|$|The nose {{offers an}} {{attractive}} noninvasive alternative for drug delivery. Nasal anatomy, {{with a large}} mucosal surface area and high vascularity, allows for rapid systemic absorption and other potential benefits. However, the complex nasal geometry, including the narrow anterior valve, poses a serious challenge to efficient drug delivery. This barrier, plus the inherent limitations of traditional nasal delivery mechanisms, has precluded achievement of the full potential of nasal <b>delivery.</b> Breath <b>Powered</b> bi-directional <b>delivery,</b> a simple but novel nasal delivery mechanism, overcomes these barriers. This innovative mechanism has now been applied to the delivery of sumatriptan. Multiple studies of drug deposition, including comparisons of traditional nasal sprays to Breath <b>Powered</b> <b>delivery,</b> demonstrate significantly improved deposition to superior and posterior intranasal target sites beyond the nasal valve. Pharmacokinetic studies in both healthy subjects and migraineurs suggest that improved deposi-tion of sumatriptan translates into improved absorption and pharmacokinetics. Importantly, the absorption profile is shifted toward a more pronounced early peak, representing nasal absorption, with a reduced late peak, representing predominantly gastrointestinal (GI) absorption. The flattening and “spreading out ” of the GI peak appears more pronounced in migraine sufferers than healthy volunteers, likely reflecting impaired GI absorption described in migraineurs. In replicated clinical trials, Breath <b>Powered</b> <b>delivery</b> of low-dose sumatriptan was well accepted and well tolerated by patients, and onset of pain relief was faster than generally reported in previous trials with noninjectable triptans. Interestingly, Breath <b>Powered</b> <b>delivery</b> also allows for the potential of headache-targeted medications to be better delivered to the trigeminal nerve and the sphenopalatin...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> Specification defines six fixed power {{profiles}} for {{the power}} sources. PD-aware devices implement a flexible power management scheme by interfacing with the power source through a bidirectional data channel and requesting {{a certain level of}} electrical power, variable up to 5A and 20V depending on supported profile. The power configuration protocol uses a 24MHz BFSK-coded transmission channel on the VBUS line.|$|E

5|$|In July 2012, the USB Promoters Group {{announced}} the finalization of the USB <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> (PD) Specification (USB PD rev. 1), an extension that specifies using certified PD aware USB cables with standard USB Type-A and Type-B connectors to deliver increased power (more than 7.5W) to devices with larger power demand. Devices can request higher currents and supply voltages from compliant hosts up to 2A at 5V (for a power consumption {{of up to}} 10W), and optionally up to 3A or 5A at either 12V (36W or 60W) or 20V (60W or 100W).

The range has seen a general uprating of the transformer compared with the versions they replaced, allowing for better <b>power</b> <b>delivery.</b> The manufacturer claims use of better components in critical areas and new circuitry.

25|$|A {{high power}} factor is {{generally}} desirable in a <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> system to reduce losses and improve voltage regulation at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the apparent power demand on the supply system.

Individual electrical customers who are charged by their utility for low power factor may install correction equipment to increase their power factor so as to reduce costs.|$|E
25|$|Sandia, with {{extensive}} experience in pulsed <b>power</b> <b>delivery,</b> designed the capacitor banks used to feed the flashlamps, completing the first unit in October 1998. To everyone's surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed {{that there was no}} way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing. Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E
