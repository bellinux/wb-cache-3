5|$|After his tour, Dylan {{returned}} to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour {{for the latter}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods. When Tyler chose not to seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he nevertheless expressed concern as he anticipated the proper education his growing family. While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> and his plantation was also more profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E
50|$|After 1958, Richter spent <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> in Ascona and Connecticut and {{returned}} to painting.|$|R
50|$|Bald eagles, hawks, deer, {{wild turkey}} {{and other small}} mammals all make Lake Perry their home during <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Wild animals are seen from the trail frequently.|$|R

5|$|Lita {{continued}} to feud with Dean Malenko in early 2001, and she defeated {{him in a}} singles bout on the February 19 episode of Raw is War {{with the assistance of}} Matt Hardy. Following the match, Hardy kissed Lita, beginning their on-screen relationship and turning their real-life romance into a storyline. The couple wrestled in several intergender tag team matches throughout the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sandalj had a {{court in}} Novi (modern day Herceg Novi) {{where he spent}} some time every year, usually in winter and spring. Beginning in 1424, Jelena spent a good <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> at this court, {{accompanied}} by her sister Olivera.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{was again}} the fifth starter in the Giants' {{rotation}} in 2009. The season {{did not start}} well for him, though, as he had a 2–8 record in the first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> On June 28, Ryan Sadowski replaced him in the rotation.|$|E
25|$|Two {{portions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OC network {{are also}} currently used for tourist trains during certain <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> including <b>the</b> Cape Cod Central Railroad and the Old Colony and Newport Scenic Railway.|$|R
25|$|The {{river is}} also a popular {{location}} for kayaking and river rafting during <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> when water from the Lighthouse Hill Dam is released, with several companies making excursions to the river.|$|R

5|$|Above the Arctic Circle, {{an extreme}} case is reached {{where there is}} no {{daylight}} at all for <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> up to six months at the North Pole itself, a polar night. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} forest at least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainson’s hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrow’s goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, ruffed grouse and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during at least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula {{may also have been}} present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E

50|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem for}} Swedish rugby {{has been the}} climate, which means that many pitches may be under snow for large <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> For this reason rugby is a summer sport in Sweden, the season running from late April to <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> October.|$|R
50|$|Families {{based in}} Talayuela, {{many of them}} immigrants, live thanks to agriculture. People in Talayuela use to {{alternate}} tobacco and asparagus harvest in different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> so they're rarely unemployed, and some immigrants work on grape and orange harvest in other autonomous communities too.|$|R
5|$|Caelum is {{bordered by}} Dorado and Pictor to the south, Horologium and Eridanus to the east, Lepus to the north, and Columba to the west. Covering only 125square degrees, it ranks 81st of the 88 modern constellations in size. It appears {{prominently}} in the southern sky during the Southern Hemisphere's summer, and the whole constellation is visible for at least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> to observers south of latitude 41°N.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Chaoyong and Yangwei {{continued}} to operate together. They operated out of Taku, {{but since the}} water froze over during winter, they would spend that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> in the Korean port of Chemulpo (now Incheon). During the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Chaoyong remained with the fleet and was supporting troop transports when they made contact with a Japanese fleet {{on the morning of}} 17 September.|$|E
5|$|In general, seabirds live longer, breed {{later and}} have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest {{a great deal}} of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for {{undertaking}} long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> away from the sea entirely.|$|E
2500|$|The average {{temperature}} ranges from [...] to average humidity is 75%. The northern coastal plains are normally hotter, averaging [...] {{during the day}} in the dry season. The south coast is generally cooler than the north, and highland areas inland are even cooler. The wet season begins in November and ends in April. During that rain falls mostly in the afternoons and intermittently during other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> <b>The</b> wettest months are January and February.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} to paddle on much of Catawissa Creek for <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> However, it is not usually possible to paddle on the creek during <b>the</b> summer. Upstream <b>of</b> Mainville, there are some riffles and small rapids. There is a larger rapid downstream of a lowdam in <b>the</b> lower reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek.|$|R
50|$|As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jubilee <b>year</b> <b>the</b> First Colonial Conference {{was held}} in London.|$|R
5|$|In {{tropical}} {{regions with}} a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> alternates {{with a wet}} period as in the Amazon rainforest, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous. In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such areas.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> {{trying to find}} the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the mûmakils bellow comes from {{the beginning and end of}} a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} rough bark in sheltered and shaded habitats in moist and dense subtropical forests. More rarely, {{it is found}} on rocks or on leaves. In the USA it occurs in hammocks (hardwood forests) and swamps which have standing water, at least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> It is also common in oak or oak-pine scrub vegetation. The species {{is often associated with}} Cryptothecia striata in the USA.|$|E
30|$|Higher {{levels of}} {{harmonic}} voltage distortion may be accepted during certain <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Its {{impact on the}} end-customer {{is likely to be}} limited because only a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voltage distortion originates from higher voltage levels. Capacitor banks at transmission level may, however, age faster. The overall higher voltage distortion could result in increasing aging for motor loads.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this project}} is heating and warm water {{preparation}} for apartment block in Choceň (Pardubice region). Apartment block has three aboveground heated floors and one underground unheated floor. The heat source is gasifying firewood boiler or pellet boiler {{which is at the}} same time used for water heating but only in the winter time. <b>The</b> other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>the</b> solar collectors are installed and used for water heating. The heat source is located in detached room with its own access, in boiler room...|$|R
50|$|Abbey Field and Chestnut Paddocks - two larger fields (to <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate) used {{mainly for}} grazing cattle during various <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> helping promote further {{wildlife}} and plant life diversity within the park. Chestnut Paddocks takes {{its name from}} a large group of ancient Sweet Chestnut trees growing near <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field.|$|R
5|$|Air Commodore Peter Frank Raw, DSO, DFC, AFC (5 June 1922– 14 July 1988) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{pilot and}} officer. He joined the RAAF in 1941, {{and served as}} a flight instructor, bomber pilot and the {{commander}} of a communications unit during World War II. After the war he became a specialist navigator. Raw was appointed the commander of No. 2 Squadron in January 1953, but temporarily left this position for <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> to participate in the 1953 London to Christchurch air race, in which he placed second. He returned to lead No. 2 Squadron at the end of 1953 and held this position until 1955.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has {{the highest}} average {{elevation}} of all the continents. Antarctica is a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200mm (8in) along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached −89.2°C (−128.6°F) (or even −94.7 as measured from space), though the average {{for the third quarter}} (the coldest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year)</b> is −63°C (−81°F). Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it occurs, is tundra.|$|E
5|$|Evan Lysacek was {{originally}} coached by Candice Brown in Naperville. After that, {{he worked with}} Deborah Stoery in Naperville, Illinois and Addison, Illinois for three years. For the next two years, he had an arrangement where he would train under both Addison-based Maria Jeżak-Athey and Moscow-based Viktor Kudriavtsev. Kudriavtsev would come to Chicago for <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> to coach, and Lysacek spent his summers at Kudriavtsev's summer training camps in Moscow, Russia and Flims, Switzerland. When that arrangement proved untenable, Kudriavtsev recommended Lysacek to Carroll, who agreed to coach Lysacek {{on the condition that}} Lysacek would work more with Congemi than with himself, due to Carroll's commitments to Timothy Goebel. Lysacek moved to El Segundo, California to work with Frank Carroll and Ken Congemi in June 2003. Lysacek worked with both Congemi and Carroll through the 2006-2007 season, after which he began working solely with Carroll. He has also trained with ballerina Galina Barinova.|$|E
5|$|The park is open {{every day}} except Christmas (December 25) on a {{schedule}} that varies slightly with the seasons. In 2010, {{it and its}} Painted Desert Visitor Center and Rainbow Forest Museum were open from 7a.m. to 7p.m. from May9 through September6 but opened as early as 8a.m. and closed as late as 5p.m. during other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> <b>The</b> Painted Desert Inn (a historic museum and bookstore) is open from 9a.m. to 5p.m. year-round except Christmas. Park clocks are always set to Mountain Standard Time, as Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time.|$|R
50|$|Around the 6th century CE, merchants began sailing to Srivijaya where {{goods were}} transhipped {{directly}} on Sumatran ports. <b>The</b> limits <b>of</b> technology and contrary winds during <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> {{made it difficult}} for <b>the</b> ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time to proceed directly from the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea. The third system involved direct trade between the Indian and Chinese coasts.|$|R
