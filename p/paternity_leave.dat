The Additional <b>Paternity</b> <b>Leave</b> Regulations 2010 provided parents with the option to split the year's maternity leave the mother could then take from her employment, allowing parents greater flexibility with childcare arrangements. An extension of 10–15 hours free nursery provision for disadvantaged 2-year olds was also carried out. Between 2008 and 2010, additional money was put into tax credits for families with children, while child poverty fell during Brown's last year as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2012, Young {{signed on}} {{a minor league}} deal with the Mets. He had {{recently}} undergone surgery to repair a torn anterior capsule in his right shoulder. He spent the first 33 days of the season on the triple A Buffalo Bisons' disabled list before being activated on May 10. Young subsequently made three starts with the single A St. Lucie Mets on May 11, May 16 and 25 before being promoted back to Buffalo on May 27. He compiled a 1–0 record with 3.18 ERA in 17.0 innings during the three starts. On May 31, he pitched 6 scoreless innings for the Bisons against the Columbus Clippers. The Mets announced on June 4 that they would call Young up to the major league roster on June 5. On June 5, 2012, Young made his return against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park with the Mets, giving up 3 runs (2 earned) over 5 innings {{in a game that}} was eventually decided in 12 innings. On June 6 his wife gave birth and he was placed on a <b>paternity</b> <b>leave,</b> which was not intended to interfere with his June 10 scheduled start. The move was for the purpose of freeing up a roster spot during Young's off days under a Major League Baseball rule that allows for a three-day leave. Young made his next start on June 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays, earning his first win in over a year.|$|E

30|$|The aims of {{this article}} are fourfold. Firstly, the article {{outlines}} {{the development of the}} ECEC policy in Taiwan, with a principle focus on female labor force participation rates and birth rates. Secondly, it describes the different types of ECEC services in Taiwan, discussing the process of their evolution and related statistics from a historical perspective. Thirdly, it introduces two important policy initiatives undertaken in the last decade, both of which are suggestive of either a) a political paradigm shift or, b) a transformation of the role of government in Taiwan. One is “woman/family friendly policies” or policies reconciling work and family, which also include maternity and <b>paternity</b> <b>leaves,</b> parental leave, flexible working hours as well as family leave; and the other are a number of “child care friendly policies”, comprising subsidies for infant care, an early childhood education voucher program, and the Free Tuition Education Project for 5 year old Children. Finally, the authors provide a general introduction of the ECEC integration policy in Taiwan together with an analysis of possible implications resulting from the implementation of the ECEC Act.|$|R

30|$|Relatedly, {{after initial}} {{abandonment}} {{of many of}} the programs supporting women in the labor market immediately following the breakdown of the Eastern bloc, in recent years, additional protective measures in the labor laws of many transition countries have been taken to counter low birth rates and low employment rates of females, as well as to support the status of women with small children—including maternity, parental, and <b>paternity</b> <b>leaves</b> (Kuddo 2009). The maternity leaves are particularly widespread and are also quite substantial in most transition economies, including the six studied here, where the financed durations are as follows: Kazakhstan 126  days, Tajikistan 140  days, Ukraine 126  days, Moldova 126  days, FYR Macedonia 9  months, and Serbia 365  days (Kuddo 2009 : Table A 10). In some countries, the duration even increases with the birth order—among the countries studied here, this is the case for Serbia, where the leave period for the third and each successive child is paid for 2  years (Kuddo 2009 : Table A 10). Notably, this is much more generous than most Western European countries—where in Germany, Ireland, and Portugal, for example, the duration of paid maternity leave is less than 100  days (Kuddo 2009 : 52).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Australian fathers 2 ̆ 7 use of {{leave at}} the time of the birth of a child, drawing on data from The Parental Leave in Australia Survey, conducted in 2005, and a subsequent organizational case study. Our analysis shows that although most Australian fathers take some leave for parental purposes, use of formally designated <b>paternity</b> or parental <b>leave</b> is limited. This is unsurprising given the Australian policy framework, which lacks legislative provision for paid <b>paternity</b> or parental <b>leave,</b> and does not require any of the shared unpaid parental-leave entitlement to be reserved for fathers. Use of leave is shown to be influenced primarily by fathers 2 ̆ 7 employment characteristics, with those working in small organizations or non-permanent positions least likely to utilize paternity or other forms of leave. Overall, the analysis suggests that improvements in the policy framework would increase Australian fathers 2 ̆ 7 propensity to take parental leave, but highlights barriers to usage associated with labour market divisions and career pressures that will not be solved solely by the adoption of more progressive leave policies...|$|R

He opened the season by hitting a grand slam against the Texas Rangers, which was also his 200th career home run. After two games, Rollins left the team on <b>paternity</b> <b>leave</b> to be with his wife as the couple had their second child. On April 12, he hit a walk-off home run against the Miami Marlins. On June 14, Rollins singled to right field for his 2,235th hit to surpass Mike Schmidt as the Phillies' all-time leader in hits. The game paused as Schmidt and the remainder of the Phillies congratulated Rollins at first base. Following the season, Rollins became the first ever co-winner of the Roberto Clemente Award when he and recently retired Chicago White Sox captain Paul Konerko being announced as the awards' recipients.|$|E

However, it was with reluctance that the Rangers recalled Davis; general manager Jon Daniels said, [...] "We talked about another center fielder or a third catcher and think we will address that at some point. But whoever we called up wasn't going to get regular playing time, so we felt Chris was the most deserving." [...] Used in a part-time role, Davis remained with the club until Hamilton came off the DL on May 23.

Valignano made an impassioned appeal to the Pope, saying that he would forgo all trade {{as soon as the}} 12,000 ducats required to meet their annual expenses were forthcoming from another source. Abandoning the silk trade, he said, would be the equivalent to abandoning the mission to Japan, which was doubtlessly true.

5000|$|Moves {{have been}} made at {{decreasing}} the gender bias in labor.

[...] The wage levels for women with none, primary, and secondary education are similar. [...] Women only see significant changes in their wages with tertiary education.
