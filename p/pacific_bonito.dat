40|$|Effort, catch, {{and catch}} rates for {{southern}} California sportfishing from private boats {{and from the}} shoreline were estimated for one-year periods. These categories represent two of four major types of marine sportfishing; the others are fishing from party boats and from piers and jetties. Probability sampling plans employing fisherman interviews were used in obtaining the basic data for the surveys. Shoreline surveys were supplemented by aerial progressive counts of fishing poles. Private boat sportfishing activities during 1964 were estimated at 2. 8 million man hours (mh) of fishing. The catch of almost 1 million fish was composed primarily of five species, <b>Pacific</b> <b>bonito,</b> California halibut, white croaker, sand bass, and kelp bass. A 12 -month survey, 1965 – 66, revealed that surf fishermen expended an estimated 1. 7 million mh of effort in taking 0. 5 million fish. More fishing effort was expended from the bay shoreline, 869, 557 mh, than from the open coast, 776, 732 mh. The catch in each area was markedly different. White croaker, queenfish, and smelt (jack and top) were the most significant species in inland bays, while for the open coast, barred surfperch, opaleye, and California corbina were most important. A synoptic picture of the annual sportfishing activities and harvest in southern California was constructed.

40|$|Management of <b>Pacific</b> <b>bonito</b> in California is {{examined}} in this Management Information Document by a State-Federal team of scientists. Abundance of <b>Pacific</b> <b>bonito</b> in southern California has fallen dramatically between the 1963 - 1969 period and the 1974 - 1977 period. Since 1976 the commercia 1 fleet has found few large fish in southern California, and has caught fish in the size range of 15 to 57 cm (1. 2 to 4. 7 pounds). This fact, coupled with the low abundance indices, point out {{the need for a}} more active management regime. To develop management measures for the California bonito fishery both a surplus yield analysis and a yield-per-recruit analysis were performed. A maximum sustained yield of 10, 000 short tons was estimated for the fishery in southern California, while the whole fishery, including Baja California, has an estimated MSY of 13, 000 tons. In order to achieve this level of catch, however, the stock abundance must be increased by a factor of five. Yield-per-recruit considerations suggest that a minimum size limit in the commercial fishery has two important effects. A three-pound size limit could result in a slight increase in yield-per-recruit. If the size limit is increased to 5 or 7. 5 lbs, the yield-per-recruit would fall significantly. Offsetting the effect on yield-per-recruit, however, would be a substantial increase in average amount of spawning per recruit which should result in a proportional increase in recruitment. With the current depressed stock abundance both a reduced annual take and a minimum size limit on commercial catch would confer substantial benefits {{in the form of an}} increase in the future stock size. After considering seven different types of management measures, the team finds that three types [...] an annual commercial catch quota, a commercial size limit, and a recreational bag limit [...] appear desirable. Re-establishment of the stock in southern California was the major consideration in this evaluation because the stock is currently depressed. All segments of the fishery will benefit from a more abundant resource. The difficult issues for policy, however, concern the rate of rebuilding, the degree of risk that is acceptable, and the distribution of benefits among user groups. By judicious choice among the options discussed here, a variety of positions can be established with respect to these issues. The greater the size limit, for instance, the more benefit is provided the recreational sector while difficulties are imposed upon commercial fishermen. The higher the quotas adopted, the slower the stock rebuilding and the greater the risk of continued stock depletion. A final reconciliation of the management options involves social, political and legal considerations which must be thoroughly incorporated by decision-makers before adoption of a management plan.

40|$|Specialisations in excitation–contraction {{coupling}} {{may have}} {{played an important role}} in the evolution of endothermy and high cardiac performance in scombrid fishes. We examined aspects of Ca 2 + handling in cardiomyocytes from <b>Pacific</b> <b>bonito</b> (Sarda chiliensis), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis). The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was used to measure the temperature sensitivity of the L-type Ca 2 + channel current (ICa), density, and steady-state and maximal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + content (ssSRload and maxSRload). Current–voltage relations, peak ICa density and charge density of ICa were greatest in mackerel and yellowfin at all temperatures tested. ICa density and kinetics were temperature sensitive in all species studied, and the magnitude of this response was not related to the thermal preference of the species. SRload was greater in atrial than in ventricular myocytes in the Pacific bluefin tuna, and in species that are more cold tolerant (bluefin tuna and mackerel). ICa and SRload were particularly small in bonito, suggesting the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger plays a more pivotal role in Ca 2 + entry into cardiomyocytes of this species. Our comparative approach reveals that the SR of cold-tolerant scombrid fishes has a greater capacity for Ca 2 + storage. This specialisation may contribute to the temperature tolerance and thermal niche expansion of the bluefin tuna and mackerel...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addressed {{questions related}} to the selective advantages of regional endothermy and its independent evolution among several fish groups. The chapters integrate laboratory and field physiological measurements to provide a better understanding ofthe evolution of regional endothermy and its importance as an adaptation to the pelagic environment. Studies on the swimming energetics of the eastern <b>Pacific</b> <b>bonito</b> (Sarda chiliensis) revealed that the bonito had a similar cost of transport to that of similar sized yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and that the bonito had a significantly lower standard metabolic rate than tuna. Thermal studies on live slender tuna, Allothunnus fallai, {{were the first to}} document both red muscle (RM) and eye and brain endothermy for this species and establish regional endothermy as a synapomorphy of the Tribe Thunnini. Additional findings for A. fallai revealed this species to possess a brain heater, a thermogenic organ composed of portions of all four of the rectus muscles. These findings demonstrate that the use of a heater tissue to elevate cranial temperatures has evolved independently in at least three fish groups. Movement studies on the mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) used acoustic telemetry to record the in-vivo stomach temperatures and depth distribution off the coast of Southern California. This work showed that the tracked makos remained in the upper 12 m of the water column during up to 80 % of the track period and that larger makos dove to greater depths. Stomach temperature data were recorded for all tracked makos (including young of the year), and these data were used to document feeding events in five of the seven tracking sessions. A study on the muscle morphology of three thresher shark species (common thresher, Alopias vulpinus, pelagic thresher, A. pelagicus, and bigeye thresher, A. superciliosus) revealed interspecific differences in the RM transverse position and distribution along the body. The common thresher is the only alopiid to possess a RM arrangement {{similar to that of the}} endothermic lamnid sharks, suggesting that this species is likely the only thresher to be capable of RM endothermy...|$|E
40|$|Our {{study focused}} {{on the status of}} the marine {{recreational}} fishery along the northern and central California coast, where surveys of recreational fishing effort and catch were conducted from 1958 – 61 and from 1981 – 86. Between the two surveys, annual recreational fishing effort rose from 1. 6 million fishing days to 2. 7 million fishing days. Nearly all the increase was due to increases in fishing from boats (commercial passenger fishing vessels and private/rental boats). Annual recreational catch rose from 3. 9 million fish weighing 2700 metric tons to 6. 5 million fish weighing 5400 metric tons. The average number of fish caught per day decreased for fishing from piers (1. 9 to 1. 6), other shore areas (1. 7 to 1. 1), and private/rental boats (2. 8 to 2. 4), and increased from commercial passenger fishing vessels (5. 4 to 6. 0). The variety of different fish species caught in a typical day of fishing from boats decreased, but variety from shore increased. Direct expenditures in the fishery from 1981 – 86 were about $ 160 million per year (1992 dollars). Rockfish (Sebastes spp.) dominated the catch from boats in both surveys. Between the two surveys, recreational catch of rockfish rose from 1. 3 million fish to 3. 4 million fish, while average weight per rockfish decreased from 0. 82 kg to 0. 71 kg. Average weight decreased in 12 of 16 major rockfish species. The 12 species were mainly shallow-water (m) species or species with wide depth ranges. The catch from boats shifted towards a higher proportion of deep-water (> 73 m) species. Signs of population stress were found in blue rockfish S. mystinus (decrease in catch), canary rockfish S. pinniger and yellowtail rockfish S. flavidus (decrease in mean length in recreational and trawl catches and high incidence of sexually immature fish in recreational catch), and brown rockfish S. auriculatus (decrease in mean length and high incidence of sexually immature fish in recreational catch). Abrupt declines in lengths of blue rockfish and yellowtail rockfish occurred in central California between 1983 and 1984. Declines reflect mortalities that may in part be attributed to effects of the 1982 – 83 El Niño event. Mean weight per rockfish decreased in a north-to-south cline from Del Norte/Humboldt (1. 13 kg) to San Luis Obispo (0. 48 kg) in 1980 – 86. The major species generally had smaller fish and fewer successful year-classes in central California than northern California. Catches of lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, a trophy species of importance to both boat and shore fishing, have been in slow oscillating decline since the early 1970 s. It is unclear whether the decline is due to overharvest and is a long-term trend that will continue, or if it is due to natural population fluctuations. Fishes of the surfperch family (Embiotocidae) dominated catch from shore in both surveys. of the fish groups we examined, the surfperch showed the greatest evidence of decline. Between the surveys, the weight of sport catch of surfperches declined by 54 % and the weight of commercial catch declined by 26 %. Barred surfperch Amphistichus argenteus and redtail surfperch A. rhodoterus (the two most important surfperches by number and weight landed), and also striped seaperch Embiotoca lateralis showed substantial decreases in recreational catch and average weight per fish. Commercial landings of redtail surfperch in the Eureka area declined by 54 % from 1953 through 1992, despite a rise in price per pound. Commercial landings of barred surfperch in the Santa Barbara area rose by 118 % from 1953 through 1992, perhaps due to a rise in price per pound. White seaperch Phanerodon furcatus stocks may have collapsed prior to the 1958 – 61 survey. Like rockfish, mean weight per surfperch decreased in a north-to-south cline from Del Norte/Humboldt (0. 33 kg) to San Luis Obispo (0. 22 kg) in 1980 – 86. Populations of lingcod and five of six rockfishes examined for interannual length-frequency trends were found to be subject to wide variation in recruitment from year to year. Strong year-classes often dominated a species' catch for several consecutive years. Strong year-classes were not found to be established in the 1957 – 58 and 1982 – 83 El Niño periods. Ten pelagic fish species (albacore Thunnus alalunga, bigeye tuna T. obesus, bluefin tuna T. thynnus, bullet mackerel Auxis rochei, Pacific mackerel Scomber japonicus, <b>Pacific</b> <b>bonito</b> Sarda chiliensis, skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis, yellowfin tuna T. albacares, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, and California barracuda Sphyraena argentea) showed obvious northward shifts in the sampled recreational catch during the 1982 – 83 El Niño event.
