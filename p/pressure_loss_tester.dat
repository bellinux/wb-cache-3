Figure  1 c shows the pump head {{as a function of the}} applied permeate flow velocity of sodium lactate using fermentation broth as the feed. As the LA is only a small part of the fermentation broth, the permeate flow velocity of the LA within the fermentation broth is also quite small, and therefore, the system curves are steep. In the case of SW 30, the permeability of LA was limited.

40|$|ObjectivesThe authors {{sought to}} measure the {{turbulent}} kinetic energy (TKE) in the ascending aorta of patients with aortic stenosis and to assess its relationship to irreversible <b>pressure</b> <b>loss.</b> BackgroundIrreversible <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> caused by energy dissipation in post-stenotic flow is an important determinant of the hemodynamic significance of aortic stenosis. The simplified Bernoulli equation used to estimate pressure gradients often misclassifies the ventricular overload caused by aortic stenosis. The current gold standard for estimation of irreversible <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> is catheterization, but this method is rarely used due to its invasiveness. Post-stenotic <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> is largely caused by dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy into heat. Recent developments in magnetic resonance flow imaging permit noninvasive estimation of TKE. MethodsThe study {{was approved by the}} local ethics review board and all subjects gave written informed consent. Three-dimensional cine magnetic resonance flow imaging was used to measure TKE in 18 subjects (4 normal volunteers, 14 patients with aortic stenosis with and without dilation). For each subject, the peak total TKE in the ascending aorta was compared with a <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> index. The <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> index was based on a previously validated theory relating <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> to measures obtainable by echocardiography. ResultsThe total TKE {{did not appear to be}} related to global flow patterns visualized based on magnetic resonance–measured velocity fields. The TKE was significantly higher in patients with aortic stenosis than in normal volunteers (p < 0. 001). The peak total TKE in the ascending aorta was strongly correlated to index <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> (R 2 = 0. 91). ConclusionsPeak total TKE in the ascending aorta correlated strongly with irreversible <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> estimated by a well-established method. Direct measurement of TKE by magnetic resonance flow imaging may, with further validation, be used to estimate irreversible <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> in aortic stenosis...|$|R

30|$|In a {{conventional}} well, the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> in the drill pipe typically exceeds {{that of the}} annulus.

40|$|When {{water vapour}} {{condenses}} at a sub-atmospheric pressure, the pressure drop {{may be a}} significant fraction of the absolute pressure. Furthermore the pressure drop in a condenser passage also reduces the absolute vapour temperature and therefore affects the heat transfer capacity of a condenser. For a tubular heat exchanger the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> in the heat exchanger tubes can be minimized {{by the use of}} contoured or rounded inlet sections at the inlets of the tubes instead of using a sudden contracting inlet section or a protruding inlet section for the tubes. The <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> characteristics of different inlet sections to the tubes were obtained through a literature survey of the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> coefficients. The <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> at the inlet sections were also investigated with computational fluid dynamics, using the Star-CD software system. The flow regimes for which the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> was investigated were for the laminar incompressible and turbulent incompressible flow regimes. The inlet sections investigated were a sudden contraction and two rounded inlet sections with a rounding radius of 52 % and 105 % of the tube diameter respectively. The computational fluid dynamics results of the laminar flow simulations revealed that the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> coefficients of the sudden contraction and rounded inlet sections were very similar. The <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> coefficient of the sudden contraction inlet sections only being 3 to 6 % higher than the rounded inlet sections. This is due to the dominant effect of viscosity in the laminar flow regime. The viscosity reduces the extent of flow contraction occurring since transverse momentum is damped by the viscous dissipation. The dominant <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> mechanism in the laminar flow regime is hydrodynamic flow development. With hydrodynamic flow development the flow velocity profile changes from a uniform velocity profile before the inlet section into a pointed parabolic profile downstream in the tube.

The <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> coefficient of the sudden contracting inlet section was higher than the rounded inlet sections’ <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> coefficient.

40|$|Gas {{pulsation}} produces excessive {{noise in}} the piping system of the reciprocating compressor and even causes damage in the piping and the machine. Therefore, {{it is very important}} for reasonable analysis and proper control of pressure pulsation. The perforated tube attenuator is widely applied in the compressor because of its favourable performance of acoustic attenuation. For the attenuator design, <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> and transmission loss are the two equally significant parameters characterizing its performance. Even if an attenuator can greatly reduce the compressor pressure pulsation, but cause large <b>pressure</b> <b>loss,</b> it will not be used yet. So it’s necessary to pursue the attenuator with low <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> as well as low pressure pulsation. The traditional method of calculating <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> of the attenuator is according to empirical formulas, which only fit for simple structures. But for the perforated tube attenuator, the flow is complex, and the empirical formulas are not available to calculate the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss.</b> Presently, CFD method is used to calculate <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> of the attenuator with complex structure. Most perforated attenuators could consist of hundreds of small holes distributed on the pipe, so three-dimensional flow models ensure the accurate solution. This paper predicts <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> of the perforated tube attenuator with various geometry parameters using CFD. A three-dimensional CFD model of the attenuator was established under the following assumptions: (1) The physical parameters of the solid and fluid domain of the attenuator are constant; (2) The flow is steady turbulent flow; (3) The influence of the gravity is ignored; (4) The inlet velocity of the attenuator is homogeneous without impulse effect. The standard - model is used in this paper. The flow through the attenuator follows the law of conservation of mass, law of conservation of momentum and the law of conservation of energy. The solution of the model was implemented with the FVM method of the commercial CFD code fluent. According to the CFD model, the following three aspects were analyzed: (1) The influence of the hole diameter on the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> (2) The influence of porosities on the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> (3) The influence of the inlet velocity on the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> Based on analysis of the above three aspects, an attenuator with low <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> as well as low pressure pulsation was designed...|$|R

5000|$|For a given system, an {{increase}} in exhaust volume will result in increases in static and total pressures. For example, for a 20% increase in exhaust volume in a system with 5 in. <b>pressure</b> <b>loss,</b> the new <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> will be 5 × (1.20)² = 7.2 in.|$|R
5000|$|The {{friction}} head can {{be related}} to the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> due to friction by dividing the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> by the product of the acceleration due to gravity and the density of the fluid. Accordingly, the relationship between the friction head and the Fanning friction factor is: ...|$|R
50|$|Some bypass ducts are unlined, so {{the bypass}} air must pass over {{a series of}} flanges, pipes, etc. {{associated}} with the engine core, which increases the bypass duct <b>pressure</b> <b>loss.</b> A lined bypass duct has a lower <b>pressure</b> <b>loss,</b> due to the streamlining effect of the inner wall introduced.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to design two {{improved}} baffles to solve the injection problem caused by traditional baffle in compact test separatorand use FLUENT software to study their effects on separator <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> and separation efficiency. The result shows: that anti-injection baffle can make compact test separator with a high separation efficiency with a relatively low <b>pressure</b> <b>loss.</b> Also, the diameter of anti-injection plate which makes the compact test separator at its highest separation efficiency is slightly smaller than that which makes the lowest <b>pressure</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|R
