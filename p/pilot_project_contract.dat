40|$|Local authorities, {{particularly}} coastal municipalities {{are gradually}} incorporating sustainability {{as one of}} the core values to drive the tourism industry forward, in an attempt to be more responsive to current market, environmental and community requirements. Central to this process are the adoption of voluntary initiatives such as environmental guidelines and certification schemes that encourage commitment to change. The Blue Flag Programme, run by the independent non-profit organization Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE), brings a reliable guarantee to tourists regarding the environmental quality of beaches and marinas. Therefore, it serves to encourage local authorities and other tourism stakeholders to constantly enhance the environmental quality of their destinations as a whole. The Blue Flag works towards sustainable development through strict criteria dealing with water quality, environmental education and information, environmental management, safety and other services at the beach. This study presents the results of work undertaken for a <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> <b>contracted</b> by ENEA and the University of Bologna, under the patronage of the Foundation for Environmental Education, which had the central aim of conducting research on the role that the Blue Flag award can play, working together with local authorities to build a common conscience, and providing guidance towards sustainable tourism development. The research was performed through a questionnaire, which was sent to all the Blue Flag awarded municipalities across Italy. In future, this method could be extended to all the Blue Flag beaches/marinas around the world. Results confirmed the validity of the Blue Flag Programme as a tool for improving coastal zone management in a holistic way, promoting the incorporation of environmental issues in the decision-making processes of local authorities and their partners...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>projects</b> {{are widely}} applied in water management. They {{can be used}} to test risky {{innovations}} at confined scale, but {{can also be used to}} delay policy decisions or to advocate a particular innovation. In this book the phenomenon ‘pilot project’ is explored both theoretically and empirically. A framework to analyse <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> is developed and applied. Sixteen <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> conducted within the WINN innovation program in the Netherlands are analysed and three floodplain restoration <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in the Rhine Basin are studied in-depth. These include the <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> on the floodplains of Beuningen (the Netherlands), in Polder Altenheim (Germany) and in Basel (Switzerland). Insights are developed regarding different types of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects,</b> different reasons actors have for initiating or participating in a <b>pilot</b> <b>project,</b> effects that <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> have on policy and practice, and factors that influence the diffusion process.

40|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are favoured {{instruments}} for exploring and perhaps realising policy change. The challenges that coastal policy faces, {{the frequency with}} which <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are implemented, and the criticisms regarding their efficacy make it interesting and relevant to study <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in this policy field. This dissertation on ‘Narrative perspectives on the development of coastal pilot projects’ aims to deepen understanding of the development of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in their actor-networks. It utilises the concept of narratives both in the conceptualisation of the development of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> and in the design of a research strategy, choosing to learn from the experiences of actors involved in coastal <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> The Sand Engine in the Netherlands and Ystad’s sand nourishment project in Scania, Sweden, are the two coastal <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> from which empirical data are drawn. Retrospective biographies of the Sand Engine <b>pilot</b> <b>project,</b> and the narrative competitions active in both the Sand Engine and Ystad cases were identified using deductive and inductive narrative analysis methods.

40|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are policy {{instruments}} applicable for {{many types of}} purposes. <b>Pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are mainly applied to introduce or test new practices, ideas or technologies. Among the benefits and impacts of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects,</b> we found the change in perceptions and practices at local levels and notably, social learning. When <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are proved effective, they can be diffused and lead to a broader policy transition. However, {{there is little evidence}} on both the content factors of the <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> and on the process of pilot’s diffusion. The research objective of our paper is to investigate the nature of diffusion focusing on the subjects of diffusion (namely the artefacts, ideas and concepts and institutional designs) and on the pathways of diffusion (namely dissemination, organic and transposing scaling up). The developed framework of <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> diffusion is illustrated in four case studies in water management where insights in the functioning of these <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> and their contribution to diffusion of the innovation are also revealed...|$|R
40|$|According to the government, clearly agreed local {{arrangements}} should enable individual general {{practitioners to}} make their full contribution to the new system of community care without getting involved in extra bureaucracy. From 1 April {{the main part of}} that contribution will be to refer to social services those patients who seem to need social care. Many general practitioners are worried that such referrals will be complex and time consuming and will generate too much extra work. Moreover, general practitioners may also be asked to see patients specifically to help social workers' assessment procedures, and many fear that such consultations will overwork and underpay them. General practitioner fundholders already use contracts to spell out what they expect from hospital services. From 1 April {{they will be able to}} set up contracts for community health services such as district nursing and chiropody, and possibly this might be extended to social aspects of community care. Over the past 14 months Dr Rhidian Morris and his partners in a fundholding practice in Devon have piloted contracts for all aspects of community care. In this article Dr Morris explains how the most radical part of the <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> [...] the <b>contract</b> for social care [...] was set up.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} the supported <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> in introducing and embedding eco-design practices.

40|$|In Evidence Based Policy Making, <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> {{have been}} {{recognized}} as important tools to develop ‘evidence’ of policy innovations. This paper presents a theoretical and empirical study of three water management <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in the Rhine basin to deepen understanding of how they can contri-bute to EBPM and which limitations and problems may arise when realizing EBPM. Three types of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> have been identified: research, mana-gerial and political-entrepreneurial <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> To different extent all types of <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> have the following effects: biophysical- and actor-network system response, knowledge development and diffusion into wider public policy. The Beuningen pilot demonstrated that anticipated evidence can be sufficient to change policy or management due to its strong mana-gerial characteristics and {{that the lack of}} policy ambassadors limits its insti-tutionalization. The Basel case illustrated the importance of interpretation of evidences and the consequences of the use of evidence as alibi. The Alten-heim case demonstrated that top-down research <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are easily in-stitutionalized but lack to take the step to dissemination. In order to contri-bute to the realization of EBPM, <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> might need to be designed as both a means to develop and to transfer evidence through experience...|$|R

In addition, USDA did not complete an evaluation on or prepare a report evaluating the <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> at 5 young turkey plants and has no plans to do so because of the small sample size. Nevertheless, in publishing a proposed rule that includes an optional new poultry (chicken and turkey) inspection system, USDA stated that the new system was based on its experience with the <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> at young chicken and young turkey plants. As a result, USDA may not have assurance that its evaluation of the <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> at young chicken plants provides the information necessary to support the proposed rule for both chickens and turkeys. However, the agency will not complete another evaluation before it issues a final rule. USDA has begun drafting a preliminary report evaluating the <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> at young hog plants using analyses similar to those presented in the report evaluating young chicken plants, suggesting that similar limitations may apply. Agency officials stated that when USDA develops a proposed rulemaking to modify its slaughter inspection system for hogs, the agency will need to decide whether to collect additional data.
