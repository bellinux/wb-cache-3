40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Because Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii(Mirb.) Franco] bark is a raw {{material}} produced in our renewable forests along with wood, {{an understanding of}} the ultrastructure of bark cells is of paramount importance if wood technologists are to utilize the bark to the fullest potential. The objectives of this study were to develop microscopic techniques in order to 1) describe and illustrate ultrastructurally the anatomy of parenchyma cells present in phloem and changes that occur to them in rhytidome formation, 2) describe and illustrate pitting between sclereids and adjacent cells. To accomplish these objectives required the development of procedures. Standard techniques were used, modified and integrated with newly developed techniques. Micromanipulation of cells and tissues was required. Stereo, light, phase contrast, fluorescence, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy were employed. The developed procedures resulted in successful bark preparations for ultrastructural examination. The results of this study showed that the longitudinal phloem parenchyma are connected by thin pit areas similar to primary pit fields and not by well defined simple pits as found between parenchyma cells in the xylem. The cell wall of the longitudinal parenchyma is a layered structure with orientated microfibrils. Expansion of the phloem parenchyma with rhytidome formation involves a stretching out of wrinkled and folded cell walls to fully expanded and smooth cell walls. Pitting between a sclereid and a parenchyma cell consists of a long <b>pit</b> <b>canal</b> through the sclereid wall about one micrometer wide with little or no flaring out at the outer surface to form a pit chamber. The pit membrane is the original double cell wall of the parenchyma. Pitting between two sclereids exhibited similar long pit canals extending across the sclereids into a chamber area separated again by a thick pit membrane consisting of the original double cell wall of the parenchyma. Additional layers of secondary wall apparently are deposited by apposition on the original parenchyma cell wall in the pitted region during sclereid formation...|$|E

The thickness of the pit membranes was measured on transmission electron micrographs while their topochemical nature was also analyzed via cellular UV microspectrophotometry. Pit membranes of R. mucronata were slightly thicker in dry season wood than in rainy season wood, but their spectra showed for both seasons a lignin and a yet unidentified higher wavelength absorbing component.

By contrast, bordered pit pairs with round to oval pit apertures and indistinct <b>pit</b> <b>canals</b> that connected narrow (incomplete) vessel elements or vascular tracheids with distinct helical thickenings were frequently characterized by a torus in ring-porous wood samples of Ulmus and Zelkova. Tori were lacking in diffuse-porous species of Ampelocera, Aphananthe, Gironniera, Holoptelea, Phyllostylon, Trema and Ulmus. • Our observations suggest that tori are more common in cold temperate climates than in warm (sub) tropical environments.

Chiral nematic liquid crystalline orientational order is observed frozen-in in the solid state in plant cell walls and {{is known as a}} liquid crystal analogue characterized by a helicoidal plywood architecture. The emergence of the plywood architecture by directed chiral nematic liquid crystalline self assembly has been postulated as the mechanism that leads to optimal cellulose fibril organization. In natural systems, tissue growth and development takes place in the presence of inclusions and secondary phases leaving behind characteristic defects and textures, which provide a unique testing ground for the validity of the liquid crystal self-assembly postulate. In this work, a mathematical model, based on the Landau-de Gennes theory of liquid crystals, is used to simulate defect textures arising in the domain of self assembly, due to presence of secondary phases representing plant cells, lumens and <b>pit</b> <b>canals.</b> It is shown that the obtained defect patterns observed in some plant cell walls are those expected from a truly liquid crystalline phase.

40|$|This book is {{designed}} as a practical guide for the identification of fossil and extant woods {{with the aid of}} a marginally perforated card key, based on the ones devised by Clarke and perfected in the well-known Hardwood and Softwood keys published by the Princes Risborough Laboratory in 1961 and 1948 (1966) respectively. Using the cards originally prepared for Metcalfe and Chalk’s Anatomy of the Dicotyledons, the Princes Risborough cards, and numerous additions to these sets, the authors have gained considerable experience with this time-honoured identification method. A microfiche of these cards can be purchased separately from the Botanical Museum of Harvard University. Besides general chapters and appendices on for instance wood structure and variability, and how to prepare wood for microscopic examination and how to use the key cards, the main body of the book consists of a richly illustrated catalogue of diagnostic characters to be used in wood identification. It is in this section that the book shows most of its weaknesses. This is because of numerous mistakes in the choice of illustrations or misleading legends to the latter. For instance: fig. 3 c (p. 24) is said to show abrupt latewood in Larix laricina, but the earlywood-latewood transition zone is not included in the photomicrograph; on p. 68 the vessels of Nyssa are said to be predominantly in multiples of four or more but the photograph illustrates vessel pairs alternating with fibres (i. e., vessel multiples in a distinct radial pattern; the latter feature is illustrated on p. 69 with examples showing no sign of such a pattern at all!); the tangential vessel arrangement of fig. 4 b, p. 70 is in fact oblique; Myrica is incorrectly credited with ephedroid perforations on p. 73; Sphenostemon pictured with the most beautiful example of scalariform intervessel pits is said to show spiral thickenings instead (p. 74); long and slender <b>pit</b> <b>canals</b> are mistaken for plasmodesmata on p. 83; essentially similar fibre-tracheids in Eucryphia are classified as belonging to two fibre types (p. 87); fibres of Sleumerodendron are mistaken for vascular tracheids and crystals in the Dicotyledons are illustrated with an example from Gnetum (p. 124).

The line then tilted upwards again for a second incline to the vicinity of Shut End. A short level section brought it to its termination at Corbyn's Hall collieries. Agenoria only had sufficient power to pull carriages along the level section of the line.
