50|$|By itself, {{once the}} beam leaves the {{deflection}} region, it {{can produce a}} usefully bright trace. However, for higher bandwidth CROs where the trace may move more rapidly across the phosphor screen, a positive <b>post-deflection</b> <b>acceleration</b> ("PDA") voltage of over 10,000 volts is often used, increasing the energy (speed) of the electrons that strike the phosphor. The kinetic energy of the electrons is converted by the phosphor into visible light {{at the point of}} impact.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{short history}} is given of {{cathode-ray}} tubes, {{from the earliest}} laboratory tubes available during the early 1900 's through present day high performance tubes. Special {{attention is paid to}} the development of <b>post-deflection</b> <b>acceleration</b> types especially band-type PDA tubes and an improvement on that type known as the helix-type PDA tube. One of the most severe complications of the band or helix-type PDA tube has been scan compression. Analysis of this problem has led directly into the noncompressing method developed here. A model of this noncompressing method, i. e. the voltage and gradient between two spheres, is applied to a practical system. Some of the constraints of the practical system including the problem of two virtual sources for the beam, the design of the field-forming element and the limitations on the application of the required boundary conditions, have complicated the design somewhat. These constraints have not prevented the achievement of a close approximation to the voltage and gradient required from the analysis. Evaluation of this new noncompressing CRT (now called a mesh-type tube) shows it to be superior to the older types of PDA tubes in every respect except for minimum spot size. In addition to the mesh tube's low sensibility and high writing speed, the mesh tube is compact and adapts nicely to the small package size required for modern day equipment...|$|E
