The Guwahati Refinery is the most important manufacturing industry in the city.

In this study, bottom-up and top-down <b>processing</b> <b>capacities</b> have been operationalized as L 2 learners&rsquo; ability to answer local and global reading comprehension questions, respectively. To achieve this aim, two intact advanced classes, one as the experimental group (n = 26) and the other as the control group (n = 25), were selected {{to be included in the}} present study. The learners in the experimental group participated in an ER course in which each learner was required to read four story books during four weeks (i. e., one story book per week) at their homes.

The computers were owned by the company A/S ND-FUNN, based in Mo i Rana and which was wholly owned by Norsk Data. It received share capital from ND {{in such a way}} that ND received an identical tax break. The share capital was then used to purchase computers from Norsk Data.

The centers were not to receive any operating subsidies from the government or Norsk Data. Five years after installation the computers would be handed over free of charge from ND-FUNN to the respective centers.

30|$|Production {{scheduling}} {{consists of}} defining the production rates of wells and field with time (production profiles). Although to produce {{as much as}} possible as early as possible would appear to be the best alternative to early mitigate the development expenses, this is not always true (Haldorsen 1996). Higher production flow rates require bigger <b>processing</b> <b>capacities</b> of production fluids (oil, gas, and water) and injection (e.g., gas injection, water injection, etc.). Bigger <b>processing</b> <b>capacities</b> translate into higher capital expenditures (due to the increase in size and weight of the processing equipment) that might reduce the NPV of the project. This is especially relevant for standalone offshore developments, where capacity of topside facilities directly affect the design, size, and cost of the supporting structures such as platforms and floating vessels.|$|R

40|$|Working {{memory is}} {{considered}} a well-established predictor of individual variation in reading comprehension in children and adults. However, how storage and <b>processing</b> <b>capacities</b> of working memory in both the phonological and semantic domain relate to reading comprehension is still unclear. In the current study, we investigated the contribution of phonological and semantic storage, and phonological and semantic processing to reading comprehension in 123 Dutch children in fifth grade. We conducted regression and mediation analyses to find out to what extent variation in reading comprehension {{could be explained by}} storage and <b>processing</b> <b>capacities</b> in both the phonological and the semantic domain, while controlling for children's decoding and vocabulary. The analyses included tasks that reflect storage only, and working memory tasks that assess processing in addition to storage. Regression analysis including only storage tasks as predictor measures, revealed semantic storage to be a better predictor of reading comprehension than phonological storage. Adding phonological and semantic working memory tasks as additional predictors to the model showed that semantic working memory explained individual variation in reading comprehension over and above all other memory measures. Additional mediation analysis made it clear that semantic storage contributed indirectly to reading comprehension via semantic working memory, indicating that semantic storage tapped by working memory, in addition to <b>processing</b> <b>capacities,</b> explains individual variation in reading comprehension. It can thus be concluded that semantic storage plays a more important role in children’s reading comprehension than previously thought...|$|R
