5000|$|Ambulatory Lectures were {{delivered}} through a closed-circuit shortwave radio broadcasting {{system in which}} the amplified audio output of an analog playback tape recorder served as a broadcast station, and transmission was via a loop aerial fixed around the gallery or galleries. Identical lectures in Dutch, French, English, and German were recorded onto magnetic tapes, broadcast in turn through the aerial, and picked up by visitors through a <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> with headphones, when inside the loop.|$|E
5000|$|A {{transistor}} {{radio is}} a small <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> that uses transistor-based circuitry. Following their development in 1954, {{made possible by the}} invention of the transistor in 1947, they became the most popular electronic communication device in history, with billions manufactured during the 1960s and 1970s. Their pocket size sparked a change in popular music listening habits, allowing people to listen to music anywhere they went. Beginning in the 1980s, however, cheap AM transistor radios were superseded by devices with higher audio quality such as portable CD players, personal audio players, boom boxes, and (eventually) smartphones, some of which contain radios themselves.|$|E
50|$|With {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} solid-state {{design in the}} 1970s, voltage and power requirements for tabletop <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> dropped significantly. One common approach was to design a battery-powered radio (typically 6 volts DC from four dry cells) but include a small built-in step down transformer and rectifier to allow mains electricity (120V or 240V AC, depending on region) {{as an alternative to}} battery-powered operation.|$|R

50|$|Vertical whip antennas {{are widely}} used for nondirectional radio {{communication}} {{on the surface of}} the Earth, where the direction to the transmitter (or the receiver) is unknown or constantly changing, for example in <b>portable</b> FM <b>radio</b> <b>receivers,</b> walkie-talkies, and two-way radios in vehicles. This is because they transmit (or receive) equally well in all horizontal directions, while radiating little radio energy up into the sky where it is wasted.|$|R

It {{is part of a}} three-element ntruder Detecti on System developed by NASA's Ames Research Center from technology acquired in the Apollo lunar exploration program. Apollo astronauts left behind on the moon small portable seismic (shock) detectors to record subsurface vibrations and transmit to Earth data on the moon's density and thickness. A similar seismic detector is the key component of the lntruder Detection System. Encased in a stainless steel tube, the detector is implanted in the ground outside the facility being protected-home, bank, industrial or other facilities. The vibration-sensing detector picks up the footstep of anyone within a preset range. The detector is connected by cable to the transmitter, which relays the warning to a <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receiver.</b> The radio alerts plant guards or home occupants by emitting an audible tone burst for each footstep...|$|E
5000|$|Transistor radio - {{an older}} {{term for a}} <b>portable</b> pocket-sized {{broadcast}} <b>radio</b> <b>receiver.</b> Made possible by {{the invention of the}} transistor and developed in the 1960s, transistor radios were hugely popular during the 1960s and 70s, and changed the public's listening habits.|$|R
50|$|Previously, <b>portable</b> HD <b>Radio</b> <b>receivers</b> were {{unavailable}} due to {{the early}} chipsets either being too large for a portable enclosure or needing too much power to be practical for a battery-operated device. However, in January 2008 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas iBiquity unveiled a prototype of a new portable receiver, {{roughly the size of}} a cigarette pack. Two companies are currently making low-power chipsets for HD Radio receivers: Samsung, and Santa Clara startup SiPort, acquired by Intel in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Human powered {{direct current}} {{generators}} are commercially available, {{and have been}} the project of some DIY enthusiasts. Typically operated by means of pedal power, a converted bicycle trainer, or a foot pump, such generators can be practically used to charge batteries, {{and in some cases}} are designed with an integral inverter. An average [...] "healthy human" [...] can produce a steady 75 Watts (0.1 horsepower) for a full eight hour period, while a [...] "first class athlete" [...] can produce approximately 298 Watts (0.4 horsepower) for a similar period. At the end of which an undetermined period of rest and recovery will be required. At 298 Watts the average [...] "healthy human" [...] becomes exhausted within 10 minutes. [...] It {{is important to note that}} the power figures referenced above are for direct human output and not the electrical power that can be generated from it. <b>Portable</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> with a crank are made to reduce battery purchase requirements, see clockwork radio. During the mid 20th century, pedal powered radios were used throughout the Australian outback, to provide schooling (School of the Air), medical and other needs in remote stations and towns.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{transistorized}} {{radios and}} other equipment needed a suitable voltage miniature battery. Early transistor radios required a [...] volt battery. Although the transistors would theoretically operate from lower voltages, in 1954, the point contact transistors had to be operated very close to their VCB0 limit {{in order to get}} the required frequency response. Fortunately a suitable miniature battery was already marketed for (vacuum tube) hearing aids. As transistors rapidly improved, particularly when alloy transistors were introduced, radios were able operate from lower voltages and the battery manufacturers introduced suitable batteries as the demand arose. The PP3 (physically identical to 6LR61 or 1604A) appeared when <b>portable</b> transistorised <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> became common, and is still called a [...] "transistor" [...] battery by some manufacturers. The Eveready company claims that it introduced this battery type in 1956.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Portable</b> <b>Radio</b> Science <b>Receiver</b> (PRSR) is a suitcase-sized {{open-loop}} digital receiver {{designed to}} be small and easy to transport {{so that it can}} be deployed quickly and easily anywhere in the world. The PRSR digitizes, downconverts, and filters using custom hardware, firmware, and software. Up to 16 channels can be independently configured and recorded with a total data rate of up to 256 Mbps. The design and implementation of the system's hardware, firmware, and software is described. To minimize costs and time to deployment, our design leveraged elements of the hardware, firmware, and software designs from the existing full-sized operational (non-portable) <b>Radio</b> Science <b>Receivers</b> (RSR) and Wideband VLBI Science Receivers (WVSR), which have successfully supported flagship NASA deep space missions at all Deep Space Network (DSN) sites. We discuss a demonstration of the PRSR using VLBI, with one part per billion angular resolution: 1 nano-radian / 200 ?as synthesized beam. This is the highest resolution astronomical instrument ever operated solely from the Southern Hemisphere. Preliminary results from two sites are presented, including the European Space Agency (ESA) sites at Cebreros, Spain and Malargue, Argentina. Malargue's South American location is of special interest because it greatly improves the geometric coverage for spacecraft navigation in the Southern Hemisphere and will for the first time provide coverage to the 1 / 4 of the range of declination that has been excluded from reference frame work at Ka-band...|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> {{systems in the}} early 20th century {{gave rise to the}} possibility of using radio broadcasters (beacons) as a landmark that would be visible to a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> at very great ranges, hundreds of miles or more. The angle between the navigator and the beacon can be measured by using a simple mechanism known as a loop antenna. As the antenna is rotated around a vertical axis, the strength of the received signal varies, and drops to zero (the null) when the loop is perpendicular to the line to the beacon.|$|R
40|$|In 2001, Texas Instruments (TI) {{announced}} their first product for the Eureka Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) digital radio market, the TMS 320 DRE 200. This product intended to address several {{issues facing the}} digital <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> market today: cost, power and product variety. Before this introduction, Eureka DAB digital radio solutions were expensive. As a result, digital radios were priced {{out of reach for}} most consumers. In July 2001, TI announced a bill of material cost of less than $ 40 dollars, enabling manufacturers to create less expensive radios for customers. Power consumption of earlier solutions was extremely high. Consequently, battery-operated and <b>portable</b> <b>radios</b> were non-existent. This paper details the advances made by the DRE 200 and how it enabled the first commercial handheld and <b>portable</b> <b>radios.</b> Finally, initial DAB products focused on the home hi-fi and trunk-mounted car radios and typically provided only DAB radio functionality. This paper also shows how the DRE 200 expands DAB product capabilities by hosting a variety of features, including MP 3 functionality...|$|R

5000|$|Fun with Radio {{is a book}} by Gilbert Davey first {{published}} in 1957 by Edmund Ward Ltd (London). At a time when <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> were still very expensive, and <b>portable</b> <b>radios</b> still a rarity (transistors were just being introduced), the book introduced many youngsters, mainly boys, to radio construction, {{and in some cases}} a career in radio or electronics. Radio construction was, {{in the early years of}} broadcasting, a very popular hobby among boys. By the time he published Fun with Radio, Davey already had a huge following among readers of the Boys Own Paper, where he was said to be the most popular contributor on practical subjects among its readers, and in that same year he presented a series on BBC Televisions Studio E which reportedly brought him 26,000 letters within a few days of the first broadcast ...|$|R
5000|$|All NWR {{channels}} {{are available on}} stand-alone [...] "weather radio" [...] receivers that are currently sold online and in retail stores (available for prices ranging from US$20 and up), {{as well as on}} most marine VHF radio transceivers, amateur radios and digital scanners. In addition, more mainstream consumer electronics, such as clock <b>radios,</b> <b>portable</b> multi-band <b>receivers</b> and two-way <b>radios</b> (such as FRS, GMRS and CB radio), now feature the ability to also receive NWR channels. Many of the aforementioned devices also incorporate alerting capabilities. With the American digital television transition making most existing portable televisions obsolete and no longer usable and the current infant and development stage of mobile digital television, along with the need to provide a public service to their viewers and encourage the use of the NWR system, many American television station weather operations cooperate with radio manufacturers and local retail outlets to offer weather radios at discounted pricing to viewers (especially in highly tornado-prone areas), where they are often marketed as an essential safety device on par with a smoke alarm for home fires.|$|R
