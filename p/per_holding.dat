In addition, the agricultural land is characterized by excessive land fragmentation (approximately 2 ha <b>per</b> <b>holding).</b> In {{the context of a}} strong will to stimulate the land market and to encourage competitiveness by modernizing the production systems, the Ministry of Agriculture in 2005 decided to implement a specific policy: the life annuity subsidy. This consists in a subsidy calculated according {{to the surface of the}} agricultural land, paid to people over 62 years old who commit themselves to stopping agricultural activity. This paper analyses the opportunity for farmers to participate in this program using a Net Present Value to test the financial incentive of the measure under renting or selling contracts. We based our analysis on data concerning the land market and profitability from a survey conducted in the Mures region in the summer of 2007 and on land price figures.

30|$|The {{land holding}} {{pattern of the}} Kangayam {{grassland}} has been studied by taking the case of Dharapuram taluk (of 1800 AD) which covers over 50 percent of the area under grassland. The Dharapuram taluk comprising five blocks is predominantly agrarian in character. 84.2 {{percent of the total}} workforce is engaged in agricultural activities, of which 37.4 percent are cultivators and 46.8 percent are agricultural labourers. The remaining 15.8 percent of the workforce is engaged in other pursuits like handloom weaving, poultry production etc. The distribution of landholdings and the corresponding area under each category with respect to Dharapuram taluk, where detailed data are available, shows that there are still very large areas under big holdings. Only 16.1 percent {{of the total number of}} land holdings covers 51.2 percent of the area with a holding of over 4 ha. The net sown area in Dharapuram taluk is 30.3 percent, of which the area under irrigation is 13.1 % (almost all by well) while 17.2 percent is rainfed. Considering the total area sown and the area of land holding, it can be inferred that any holding over 2.5 ha is devoted to pasture, as holdings larger than 2.5 ha are not usually tilled. Thus, about 70 percent of the area is under pasture used for rearing livestock. It means that there are 25, 662 holdings covering an area of 135, 807 ha at an average of 5.3 ha <b>per</b> <b>holding</b> that are used as pastureland.|$|E

The distribution of this count variable is zero-truncated since zero identifications do not occur in the sample. As an application we consider the surveillance of scrapie in Great Britain.

Production structure was quantified using a disaggregation methodology based on the number of poultry <b>per</b> <b>holding.</b> Population densities of extensively- and intensively-raised ducks and chickens were derived both at the sub-district and at the village levels.

We used Monte Carlo simulation of Boosted Regression Trees models of predictor variables to characterize the risk of HPAI H 5 N 1. Maps of mean risk and uncertainty were derived both at the sub-district and the village levels. The overall accuracy of Boosted Regression Trees models was comparable to that of logistic regression approaches. The proportion of area flooded made the highest contribution to predicting the risk of outbreak, followed by the densities of intensively-raised ducks, extensively-raised ducks and human population.

Promptly, serotype specific real-time PCR tests were developed for serotypes 1, 6, and 8 (S 2 genotyping). Agreement was found between results by S 10 - and S 2 genotyping. Further, BTV 1 was identified by both S 10 - and S 2 genotyping in one imported animal. After initial discovery of BTV 6 in the Netherlands, animals from 18 holdings tested PCR positive for BTV 6 /net 08 in 2008.

40|$|Poultry sectors’ {{domestic}} {{support and}} trade protection, or assistance, influences {{the way they}} develop, in particular their structure, trade, investments, and aspects of disease risk. Nominal Rates of Assistance (NRAs) measuring adjusted gaps between international and domestic prices were used in analysis of relationships between these factors. Structural data {{took the form of}} average chickens <b>per</b> <b>holding</b> as well as the predominant FAO Sector (I Industrial - IV Traditional). General “bird flu” incidence was obtained from an official website. Assistance constrains efficient trade, encourages smuggling/informal trade, diminishing the incentives for good management, leading to greater disease risk. It also constrains efficient investment, leading to greater disease risk through weaker SPS, research and other relevant institutions. Assistance can also constrain structural change, hindering development of efficient industrial production systems, or maintaining larger traditional sectors, resulting in greater disease risks. The research illustrates that “true” (unassisted) exporters tended to have low NRAs and “true” importers high NRAs. Negligible trading countries mainly had low NRAs apart from those with strong self-sufficiency policies. Structurally, all countries experienced concentration with relative growth in industrial sector holdings. The NRA and structure scatter plot illustrated that the “true” exporters and “true” importers fell into two groups of mixed structures; low (high) NRAs, more (lower) market incentives and lower (higher) HPAI incidences. HPAI experiences also appeared to be regionally based. A clear conclusion is that assistance does not determine structure – some countries had strong enough political economy objectives to be willing to pay the high cost of over-riding open market forces on their structures. However, assistance did determine whether structures were distorted and not economically efficient. Technically efficient developed structures in conjunction with (export) market incentives driving economic efficiency and encouraging better risk management, appear to positively impact on HPAI risk. High assistance levels hinder open markets’ role in the demise of inefficient, poorly managed productions systems, whether they be traditional or not, and creates greater disease risk. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{run up to}} the June EU Agricultural Council meeting Agriculture Commissioner Fischler {{called for}} real reform and 'no lame compromises [...] . that lead to more and not less red tape, {{continue}} to encourage farmers to overproduce and expect the taxpayer to foot the bill'. He argued that reform was needed now in order to lay {{the basis for a}} long term, modern and sustainable EU agriculture which serves the interests of farmers, consumer and taxpayers alike. He emphasised that in order to achieve this it was essential to 'decouple farm aid from production, reinforce our rural development policy and ensure that in return for aid farmers produce the public goods our society nowadays expects from them'. In a question-and-answer memorandum released on June 10 th 2003, the Commission set out the case for further CAP reform. The memo argues that both impending enlargement and the need for a new WTO agreement on agriculture provide compelling reasons for implementing reform now rather than later, but that the basic reason for reform was that it was essential to the future of European agriculture, since its main aim was to make European agriculture more competitive and market orientated. The memo argues that the planned adjustments 'allow maximum flexibility in farmers' production decisions while guaranteeing them income stability'. It highlights how the strengthened rural-development component of the CAP is directly linked to the introduction of higher food standards and forms a central component of the CAP-reform process, and argues that farmers will benefit from a strengthened rural-development policy through new 'incentive payments for farmers who participate in schemes designed {{to improve the quality of}} agricultural products and the production process'. This will amount to: up to € 3, 000 <b>per</b> <b>holding</b> for the next five years; up to 70 % of the costs of promotion of quality products through producer-organisation campaigns; direct aid of a maximum of € 10, 000 <b>per</b> <b>holding</b> per annum for meeting new standards, which will be gradually reduced over five years; a maximum of € 1, 500 for farm advisory services; support for the costs of improved animal welfare up to a maximum of € 500 per livestock unit. The memo seeks to define decoupling as the provision of 'support payments to farmers in a way that is not linked to what they produce'. The Commission is de facto proposing a system of a 'single decoupled income payment per farm'. 'This system would integrate existing direct payments that a producer receives from various schemes into this single payment, determined on the basis of historical references. According to the Commission memo the main aim of decoupling is to stabilise farmers' incomes. It is maintained that the system would be simpler and would generate a greater market orientation in EU agriculture. It would pay farmers not just for producing but for the wider role that they play in society, providing other public goods. The memo maintains that decoupling will strengthen the EU's negotiating position in the WTO through cutting the trade-distorting link between subsidy and production. By contrast, direct aid payments are seen as non-trade distorting, and therefore this form of CAP reform will improve market opportunities for developing countries. At the sectoral level dairy sector reform will bring the sector into line with the wider CAP by introducing progressive increases in quotas, accompanied by cuts in intervention prices and further compensatory aid payments to dairy farmers. The memo argues that by introducing the Agenda 2000 reforms sooner and by going further, real progress can be made in addressing the imbalances in the dairy sector, which have led to a falling share in the world market, without undermining farm incomes. In the cereals sector further reform is seen as essential to deal with market volatility and the appreciation of the € against the US $. Comment: Since the decoupled system would be based on historical payments to farmers it would lock in existing trade distortions, but on the basis of a system of payments compatible with current WTO rules and thus not subject to challenge. From an ACP perspective this would freeze existing patterns of EU (over) production with the notable difference that this production would be available at much lower (world market) prices. This is likely to carry serious trade implications, particularly in those product areas where current distortions are greatest (e. g. sugar, dairy products and rice). Furthermore, this would occur at a time when, as a result of price reductions induced by the process of CAP reform, the value of trade preferences on the EU market granted to ACP countries would be greatly reduced as each tonne of CAP-covered agricultural produce exported by the ACP would receive less. In the run up to the June EU Agricultural Council meeting Agriculture [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The Peruvian hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus) {{stock has}} been in a {{delicate}} state in the last decades due to overexploitation combined with adverse climatic events. The stock is showing certain signs of recovery since 2012. This work analyses the environmental impacts of current fleet operations and its likely trend. Methods: The fleet was divided into coherent segments, <b>per</b> <b>holding</b> capacity and engine power. The validity of both segmentations, as well as the presence of an effect of economies of scale driving fuel use intensity (FUI), was tested. Life cycle assessment was used to calculate environmental impacts, per individual sampled vessel and per segment, complemented with indicators of energy efficiency and biotic resource depletion. Results and discussion: The fleet is highly fuel-efficient (120 kg fuel per tonne fish) when compared with other reported values, despite a large overcapacity that increases the impact of the construction and maintenance phases. Significant inter-annual FUI variations were observed (80. 0 kg t− 1 in 2008 to 210. 3 kg t− 1 in 2006), but no clear trend. Neither significant differences in FUI among fleet segments nor a clear effect of economies of scale were found (but FUI analysis was based on a small sample of 32 values for nine vessels, two of which had data for a single year). Only the largest vessels, featuring 242 m 3 holding capacity and 850 hp engine power, were found to have lower FUI {{than any of the other}} vessels, but no statistical test could be applied to validate this difference. Differences in environmental impacts of individual vessels are mostly dominated by their relative FUI. Fuel use and, to a lower extent, maintenance are the main sources of environmental impacts. The most contributing impacts to ReCiPe single score are climate change, human toxicity and fossil depletion. The fishery's impacts on the biotic natural resource were orders of magnitude higher than many other global hake stocks, due to overexploitation. Conclusions: The environmental impacts of the national hake fleet are relatively low during the study period, despite an overcapacity of the fleet. With the perspective of expanding its operations and obtaining better yields on the eventuality that the stock fully recovers, these impacts should decrease. More research based on additional FUI data is necessary to effectively compare the performance of these vessels with larger ones (featuring > 180 m 3 and > 500 hp, of which nine existed in 2016) before possibly recommending their preferential use.

40|$|Administrative data on rent prices do {{not exist}} in Norway. Statistics on this topic must either be based on direct {{observation}} and/or network of experts. The System of Application for Governmental Production Subsidies (PRO) includes information on rented agricultural land <b>per</b> <b>holding</b> distributed on arable land, permanent grassland and unutilised land. PRO includes 99. 7 per cent of the utilised agricultural land in Norway and thus is an excellent target population for surveys on rent prices. The Norwegian Agriculture Agency (NAA) has been working out annual statistics on rent prices for quite many years. These statistics cover a selection of important crops and are based on expert assessments. The existing statistics do not provide the results requested by Eurostat. Based on this background a pilot sample survey on agricultural land rents in 2013 was launched by Statistics Norway. The sample was drawn among holdings in PRO. After some limitations the target population amounted to 27 300 holdings and 3 002 of these {{were included in the}} gross sample. The survey was voluntary and 1 656 holdings responded, corresponding to a response rate of 55. Average renting prices were estimated at regional and country level for arable land, permanent grassland and total agricultural land respectively. Evaluated by region and type of land, the results of the survey seemed reasonable. Also comparison with the Census of Agriculture 1999 was satisfactorily. The pilot sample survey also included renting prices for the same crops as included in the NAA survey. Average renting prices in the pilot survey were lower than the prices in the NAA statistics for all specified crops. The relative difference varied significantly by crop. Different data collection method is assumed to be the main reason for the difference in average prices between the two surveys. After internal discussions and meeting with NAA, Statistics Norway has decided not to establish an annual survey based on direct observation. There are several reasons for this: - Resources are scarce at Statistics Norway. Introducing new statistics would probably cause closing down of other important statistics. - Collection of data directly from holders would increase the response burden. - The NAA conducts a well established statistics. These statistics cover national needs beyond the Eurostat requirements, e. g. regional renting prices for selected important crops. If Statistics Norway should include these needs, resource requirements and response burden would further increase. The Norwegian Agriculture Agency has accepted to continue the annual statistics and to take steps to adapt it to fulfil the Eurostat methodology...|$|E
40|$|The Agricultural Commissioner Franz Fischler {{outlined}} {{the findings of}} the recent impact assessment studies and the rationale behind the EU legislative proposals for further reform of the CAP to the European Parliament on January 22 nd 2003. He highlighted the fact that the proposals: would remove the structural imbalances in the rye, beef and rice markets; would not, through de-coupling, lead to farmers leaving the industry in droves, but would boost overall farm incomes, as farmers switched to more profitable products. He also highlighted two major changes in the proposed regulations compared to the July 2002 proposals, namely the adoption of a proposal for reform of the dairy regime and wholesale changes to the arrangements for dynamic modulation. Savings on the EU budget have no made it possible to bring forward dairy sector reform. The specific proposals put forward in the dairy sector involve: extending the quota system until 2014; a further reduction in the support price for milk and an increase in quotas of 1 % per annum in 2007 and 2008 in the EU- 25; a reduction in the intervention price for skimmed milk powder by 3. 5 % per year; a reduction in the intervention price for butter by 7 % per year; compensation of dairy producers for price reductions at an level equivalent to 58 % of the price cut. Commissioner Fischler expressed the view that these proposals would make the EU dairy sector more competitive and increase the EU's room for manoeuvre of at the WTO. The proposals for dynamic modulation now consist of the following elements: no reduction in payments to farmers receiving up to € 5, 000 in payments; a 12. 5 % reduction in payments to farmers receiving between € 5, 000 and € 50, 000; a 19 % reduction in the payments to farmers receiving more than € 50, 000. Some 6 % of the total amount saved would be re-deployed to rural development, with the remainder being used to finance further reform and being directed to farmers in greatest need. The Commissioner took the trouble to explain in simple terms how de-coupling will work: 'For every holding, the direct payments to which they are currently entitled would be bundled into a single payment, the level of which would be based on the amounts they received in the 2000 - 02 period {{as a result of their}} full entitlements under the present scheme. All the criteria on which this support was based during the reference period would be taken into account (area payments, head of livestock, per tonne payments etc). ' These payments would be conditional upon compliance with binding standards in environmental protection, food safety, animal health and welfare and occupational safety. Holdings would have their support cut for non-compliance. To facilitate the transfer of payment entitlements from one holding to another, payment entitlements would be worked out by dividing the level of payment <b>per</b> <b>holding</b> by the size of the area on which payments were based. Thus areas of pasture, cereals and oilseeds would be included but those used for growing sugar beet or potatoes would not. ' Member states would be allowed to implement the scheme according to regional circumstances providing the principles of cross compliance were adhered to. He pointed out that the Commission's proposals would not entail de-coupling in all sectors, since this could lead to unacceptable reductions in the production of some products. As a consequence certain aids would continue to be tied to production, for example, durum wheat, potato starch, rice and feed proteins. Indeed, de-coupling would only be introduced to the extent that it was necessary to meet EU goals, including securing international recognition and acceptance of the EU system of support. With reference to the WTO, Commissioner Fischler argued that if the EU was proactive it would make it easier to protect the European model of agriculture and secure international acceptance of EU positions on non-trade issues. Comment: It should be noted that the use of savings on the EU budget to bring forward dairy-sector reform means that sugar-sector reform may well be further deferred. By highlighting that de-coupling would be introduced only as far as necessary to meet EU goals such as securing international acceptance of the EU support scheme, the Commissioner made clear that he would not allow reform to in any way threaten continued production of any CAP-covered products in the EU. This suggest some very real limits to the extent of reform of the CAP and the extent to which the EU will reduce public aid to the agricultural sector.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with optimal production rates for a failure-prone machine that produces two distinct part types. We consider the problem of controlling production rates so as to minimize the expected long-run average cost of product surpluses over time. We assume constant <b>per</b> unit <b>holding</b> and shortage costs and constant demand rates for the part types. We provide an expression for the potential function and prove the optimality of a zero-inventory policy, when the average capacity is sufficiently large...|$|R
