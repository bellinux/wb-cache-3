5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size. In oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG suitable for further <b>processing,</b> <b>the</b> surface of the material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an anchoring point for linkers suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E

30|$|Depending on <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> phase can {{partially}} {{or completely}} happen {{in parallel with}} the sampling phase. The time used for collecting samples from the air {{is referred to as}} the sampling time, while the time required by <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> phase in addition to the sampling time is referred to as <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> time. <b>The</b> sensing efficiency is then defined as the ratio of the sampling time and the summation of the sampling time and <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> time. During <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> time, <b>the</b> sampling of the wireless medium is put onto hold, which means that the sensing engine is ‘blind’. It is possible that a number of transient signals are missed during this period. The time interval when sampling activity is put onto hold {{is referred to as the}} blind time. Ideally, the blind time should be reduced to zero, meaning 100 % sensing efficiency to achieve seamless detection.|$|R

These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after <b>processing.</b> <b>The</b> mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E
