40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{determine}} the most bioactive glasses of SiO 2 -CaO-Na 2 O ternary, and of this system doped with <b>phosphorus.</b> <b>Soaking</b> glasses in the simulated body fluid allowed to study the formation of crystalline hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA). This layer allows a chemical anchoring implant-natural bone. The most bioactive glasses are Na 2 O-rich and SiO 2 -poor glasses. They forms an HCA layer within 12 hours. For this same glasses doped with phosphorus, adding phosphorus don't improve bioactivity. For less Na 2 O-rich invert glasses with phosphorus, corresponding to the less bioactive glasses of the ternary, the higher rate of P the faster HCA forms (6 hours with 6 mol % of P 2 O 5). In conventional glasses, bioactivity stays middle (2 - 3 days). Some studies of cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility on the most Na-rich glass without and with phosphorus showed that these glasses form rapidly the HCA but make the environment too aggressive for the cells.

Phosphorus gettering allowed to considerably reduce the leakage current and to avoid the threshold voltage drift that still plagued MOS technology with aluminum gate (MOS transistors with aluminum gate were not suitable for phosphorus gettering due to the high temperature required).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} on white and dark raw deboned meat from light and heavy fowl to observe effects of sodium chloride and polyphosphate (Kena) soak treatments before cooking. Treatments were soaked overnight at 3 C in the following solutions: distilled water, 2 % sodium chloride, 3 % Kena (commercial polyphosphate mixture), and 2 % sodium chloride + 3 % Kena. White and dark meat from light and heavy fowl were treated separately. Determinations were made of proximate composition after soak and after cook, sodium chloride and phosphorus absorption and retention, percent weight gain after soak, and percent cook yield. Sensory evalua-tions and objective texture measurements were also made on water-cooked pieces. Significant (P<. 05) effects of the phosphate, with and without sodium chloride, were noted in improved sensory quality and lower shear values of meat from light fowl. Soaking heavy fowl in phosphate, with and without sodium chloride, significantly (P<. 05) reduced objective texture values for hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, and chewiness. The various meat-fowl combinations responded differently {{to the amount of}} sodium chloride and <b>phosphorus</b> absorbed on <b>soaking</b> and retained after cooking. However, the primary source of variation in the data was due to treatment of soaking in sodium chloride or phosphate, alone or in combination.
