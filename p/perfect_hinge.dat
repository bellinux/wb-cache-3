40|$|Published {{two years}} before Antonio de Nebrija' s splendid Diccionario latino-español, Alfonso Fernández de Palencia's Universal Vocabulario has not aroused among the critics the enthusiasm it deserves. This Spanish humanist's work has been {{frequently}} described as medieval. Furthermore, there is enough evidence to state unmistakably that Palencia's dictionary follows very closely Papias' Elementarium Doctrinae Durimentum. In fact, Palencia takes Papias' work as a starting point, whom he copies literally. But it is a reflexive and selective copy, {{not the kind of}} hurried plagiarism we are used to in lexicography. Palencia laboured over Papias' work until he turned his own Universal Vocabulario into the threshold of modern lexicography which starts definitely from Nebrija's dictionaries: a) As constrasted with other dictionaries of the same period, the Universal Vocabulario sometimes includes several meanings under a single entry. b) Palencia is different from other contemporary lexicographers because he tries to form small lexematic groupings. c) He resorts to drawings in order to illustrate the explanations given for the entries. The use of drawings reveals the pedagogical aim inspiring him in the planning of his work, rather than his unability to give definitions. This pedagogical aim is reflected in the many classical authors' quotations and examples included. All these features —except for the drawings which will not appear again until the XVth century with Francisco Rosal— {{can be found in the}} most successful and well-known dictionaries of the XVth and XVIth centuries: in Rodrigo Fernández de Santaella's Vocabularium ecclesiasticum (Sevilla, 1499) and in Diego Jiménez Arias' Lexicon ecclesiaticum (Salamanca, 1566). Therefore, the Universal Vocabulario arises in the history of Spanish lexicography as a <b>perfect</b> <b>hinge</b> between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but also as the first link of a chain which goes without a break for centuries except for Nebrija, who steps out of line in points where his immediate predecessor had made important progress...|$|E

40|$|In current design {{practice}} for seismic resistant steel braced frames, general rules and standard provisions are aimed {{to ensure a}} structural behaviour for beam-to-column joints of non-braced spans {{as close as possible}} to <b>perfect</b> <b>hinges.</b> This is done to prevent any kind of interaction with the bracing systems, in particular under horizontal loads. However, the global performance of composite joints is markedly affected by the structural interaction between the concrete slab and the steel components and - especially during seismic events - struts can occur in the slab at the beam-to-column intersection. In this paper, the possibility of realizing a composite joint that behaves as moment-resisting under gravitational loads and essentially as hinged under horizontal loads is investigated. Aiming to assess the actual slab-interaction effects on the overall response, a full 3 D Finite Element (FE) model representative of a beam-to-column composite joint taking part of a braced frame is described in ABAQUS and validated towards past full-scale experiments. A parametric study is hence proposed, by accounting for three geometrical configurations, being characterized by (i) isolated slab with absence of rebar continuity (i. e. fully disconnected slab and steel joint only), (ii) presence of slab with partial column interaction (i. e. isolated slab and continuity of rebar), (iii) presence of fully interacting slab. It is shown that, if properly detailed, a joint with isolated slab and continuous rebars can be used in nonbraced spans of composite braced frames without affecting the behaviour of the bracing system (i. e. as in presence of a hinge). Nonetheless, the composite beam can be designed as continuous on multiple supports under vertical loads, hence leading to a reduction of the steel cross-sectional size...|$|R
40|$|Deployable and transformable {{structures}} are of broad interest for applications including satellites and space exploration, temporary shelters, packaging, transportation, robotics and medical devices. One emerging approach to scalable fabrication of such structures involves the general concept of Origami-inspired design along with cutting, folding, and fastening of sheet materials. However, contrasting the classical approach of modeling Origami structures as having <b>perfect</b> <b>hinges</b> and rigid panels, {{consideration of the}} finite bending and rotational stiffness of these elements is essential to understand their constituent mechanics. Moreover, meta-materials and functional structures having fundamentally new mechanical properties can be designed this way. We present the design, fabrication and mechanics of a novel, deployable cellular material, which we call Flexigami. The unit cell {{takes the form of}} two parallel regular polygons, connected by a circuit of diagonally creased panels. Upon compression, individual unit cells transform either gently or abruptly between two stable equilibrium states depending on the interplay between hinge and panel properties. The mechanical behavior of each unit cell can be deterministically designed via geometry, dimensions and topology of the panels and hinges. Individual unit cells can collapsed reversible to less than 10 % of their deployed volume. Within this transition regime, the force-displacement curve of each cell can be tuned to exhibit a smooth compression behavior or an instability followed by a self-reinforcing response. We use finite-element models complemented by analytical and computational analysis of the results to understand the importance of different mechanical properties of constituent hinges and panels and also demonstrate the fabrication of flexigami cells and mechanisms in various structural materials. Finally we present different mechanisms and their subsequent applications. by Nigamaa Nayakanti. Thesis: S. M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2016.

40|$|In current practice, {{the design}} of seismic {{resistant}} steel-concrete composite braced frames generally aims to ensure a structural behaviour for beam-to-column joints {{as close as possible}} to <b>perfect</b> <b>hinges,</b> hence preventing any kind of interaction with the bracing system. The global performance of steel-concrete composite joints, on the other hand, is markedly affected by the structural interaction between the concrete slab and all the steel components at the beam-to-column intersection. This is especially true during seismic events, when compression forces can typically arise in the concrete slab in the vicinity of the column, leading to the occurrence of struts in contact with the column itself. As such, for appropriate design assumptions, it is thus necessary to fully understand the influence of the joint components interactions. To this aim, in this paper a refined Finite Element (FE) model representative of a hinged beam-to-column joint in a braced frame is implemented in the ABAQUS computer software and validated with experimental results. A full 3 D solid modelling approach is first taken into account, with careful consideration for the geometrical and mechanical properties of each joint component, as well as for the corresponding contact interactions, including properly calibrated damage material models. After a preliminary validation of the FE modelling approach carried out towards earlier full-scale experimental tests, a parametric FE study is proposed. By taking into account four different geometrical configurations for a reference steel-concrete composite joint, in particular, being characterized by (i) absence of slab, (ii) presence of slab with partial interaction with the column (i. e. isolated slab), (iii) presence of slab with interaction (even with small gap on one side) and (iv) fully interacting slab, major FE outcomes are critically discussed. It is shown, in this regard, that the isolation of the slab is typically associated to important effects on the structural performance of the joint itself, compared to a fully interacting concrete slab...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, masonry churches under {{horizontal}} actions are studied. Such structures feature strong seismic vulnerability, {{both because of}} the mechanical properties of the material and the particular configuration. Besides, uncertainty of the conventional seismic action is detected. Different codes provide different spectra and, subsequently, different total seismic actions. In order to assess such difficulties, the four basilicas of SGMR, SI, SGMG and SP have been selected. These study cases are analysed with a two step procedure in which the whole structure is analyzed in the linear field through a complete 3 D model, and then the single structural elements are assessed in non linear field through FEA and limit analyses. The following remarks can be stated: Certain uniformity in the global plan-altimetric apparatus can be recognised so that the four churches {{can be regarded as}} deriving from a sort of three-dimensional global model that changes only for a scale factor. Similarly, a common structural behaviour is expected and in the analyses confirmed. The modal shapes for the analyzed buildings show low torsional and transversal stiffness and great out of the plane deformation. When rigid diaphragms are inserted to model retrofit interventions, greater global stiffness (especially in terms of torsion) and a more monolithic behaviour is detected. It is noticed, furthermore, a stress concentration in the stiffer elements of the buildings (façade elements and in the transept zone) which absorb a larger amount of the total shear. Given the already stated uncertainty in the characterisation of seismic actions, assessment of the behaviour at collapse through spectrum-independent analyses is preferable. In this aim, advanced nonlinear analyses using the code ABAQUS are carried out on the single macro-elements constituting the structural complex. This approach is apparently the most accurate methodology for structural analyses. The results, in fact, are reliable only providing that very precise material characterisation is made. This can be very tricky for historical existing structures. Additional difficulties also derive from the complex geometrical configuration of the studied non-conventional structures. Load-displacement curves providing the collapse multiplier, the horizontal stiffness and the maximum displacement of some control points are obtained for all the macro-elements. These curves are compared with the elastic demands derived through global analyses. It has been shown that generally the bearing capacity of these elements is smaller than the strength demand. Therefore, these constructions are prone to damage and retrofit techniques are necessary. The presence of a rigid slab {{at the height of the}} roof has not improved at all the seismic behaviour of the study cases. On the contrary, the effective use of such retrofit technique has to be carefully evaluated specially when adopted in ancient constructions. In the light of the analyses conducted on these complex constructions it is derived that is quite hard following a unique procedure able to define with consistency the most influencing quantities. Therefore, the necessity of defining a handy and suitable methodology for designers is strongly felt. In order to seek a simplified procedure on churches macroelements, a basic structural element in historical buildings, such as the portal frame, has been studied in detail. An analytical exact expression, derived using the kinematic theorem, and an approximate formula have been used for performing a parametric analysis varying geometrical proportions. The extension of the single portal frame to the multi-bay frame has been applied in order to perform the comparison between non linear analyses and simplified analyses. The use of approximate expressions derived for the portal frame implies an averaging of the pier widths. When the medium value is taken into account, generally, greater error percentages are encountered in the model with the load condition considering the only self weight: in this case, the non linear analyses give higher values; on the contrary the limit analysis gives small values of the collapse multiplier. In the load condition of self weight plus dead load, the scatters are smaller. When the maximum pier is taken into account, the values of non linear analysis will be the same but limit analysis values will assume greater values, moving on the right side so that are inside the domain. This evidence has been confirmed for the churches of SGMR, SI and SP. On the contrary, in the church of SGMG, medium values have shown a better comparison with non linear procedure. In the last part of the thesis, the structural behaviour of another typical element in ancient structures is sought: it is the masonry arch. In order to determine the thrust ranges and the minimum thickness, a parametric analysis has been carried out on whole and half arches. A theory for the displacement of the supports has been developed: pointed arches can bear greater displacement than circular arches. This result is confirmed moving one of the supports in any direction into the plane and tracing the domains of possible positions. All the theoretical values have been checked with two different codes and the results agree well. Later, in order to verify these values, an extensive experimental campaign has been held on rigid concrete blocks in small scale representing eight different pointed arches varying eccentricity, the thickness and the angle of embrace. Five types of test were made on the arches: first, friction coefficient measures were taken on the blocks; then moving the supports horizontally apart and together, and vertically up and down. The comparison of theoretical and experimental results has allowed to emphasize the limits of both of them. <b>Perfect</b> <b>hinges,</b> sharp blocks, exactly symmetric structures, absence of friction, all accepted hypothesis in the theory, can never exist in reality; as a consequence the theoretical numerical results are greater than those measured in the experiments. At the same time the presented methods correctly predicted the final collapse mechanisms for the circular and specially the pointed arches. In the light of the conducted experiences in this study, in terms of modelling, analysis and testing, it is believed that masonry structures deserve great attention in the design and assessment process. Many mistakes can be made regarding the basic assumptions on the constitutive model of the material, the suitable structural modelling, the choice of the seismic action and an effective retrofit techniques. Furthermore, churches are more sensitive to damages than other “conventional” structures for their characteristic typology. The main features of these structures have been drawn throughout this work so that whatever similar building will fairly show the same topics here presented. About the material properties, only experimental campaigns on the structural constituents of the building under study could provide a good characterization. Regarding the suitable analysis types, undoubtedly, a global three-dimensional analysis is necessary to get the general idea of the construction and understand its behaviour. On the other side, a useful quantitative result is the evaluation of the ultimate condition at collapse on bi-dimensional elements. This consideration is also made since the definition of the seismic forces for masonry structures according to different code provisions is not unique. Simplified approaches do prove their appeal. Though some approximations are unavoidably to be made, in the aim of assessing the structural behaviour of ultimate capacity, such techniques seem to provide a very interesting path to follow in the futur...|$|R
