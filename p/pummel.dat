5|$|The dreaded North Vietnamese wet season {{offensive}} (Campaign Z) {{began on}} 17 December 1971. The multi-division offensive was commanded by Major General Le Trong Tan, who had commanded the PAVN counteroffensive against Operation Lam Son 719. Once again the communists rolled across the Plain of Jars {{and to the}} outskirts of Long Tieng. This time however, they had brought along a battery of 130mm artillery, which proceeded to <b>pummel</b> the defenders. By 17 January 1972, reinforcement by Unity troops and strikes by B-52s had driven the PAVN from the high ground surrounding the valley, but they could not be pushed out of the area. General Tan then shifted the focus of his forces to the southwest and seized Sam Thong on 18 March. The fighting around Long Tieng did not cease until 28 April.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Stauffer's {{battalion}} was deployed {{into new}} blocking positions, as Viet Cong units {{were believed to}} be moving toward the Michelin Rubber Plantation. On October 11, Cavazos led two of his companies out on a northward probe, and they were immediately attacked by the Viet Cong. While under heavy fire, Cavazos ordered the lead company to pull back behind a perimeter formed by the second company. As the lead company fell back, artillery and air support were called in to <b>pummel</b> the Viet Cong's attacking formation. When the battle was over, 21 Viet Cong soldiers were found dead, whereas U.S. casualties for the day were 1 killed and 4 wounded. Shortly afterwards, Cavazos' battalion pulled back to Phuoc Vinh for rest and refitting. By mid-October, Hay believed the Viet Cong's 271st Regiment had suffered a major defeat and was ready to withdraw from the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, so he was ready to terminate Shenandoah II. However, increased Viet Cong activity near the Ong Thanh Stream, where the 1st Brigade made most of its contacts, had indicated otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which <b>pummel</b> through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E

25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with <b>Pummel,</b> so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E
25|$|Stevenson, Alvarez, and Egerton {{start a new}} band, All, with singer Dave Smalley. They put out {{the album}} Allroy Sez and EP Allroy for Prez in 1988, but their {{constant}} touring schedule proves too much for Smalley, who soon quits. They replace him with Scott Reynolds and release Allroy's Revenge (1989), but have difficulty finding an audience without the recognizable Descendents name and frontman. Seeking a more affordable cost of living and centralized location from which to tour, All relocates to Brookfield, Missouri in 1990. Reynolds quits the band following 1992's Percolater album. With new singer Chad Price All releases 1993's Breaking Things. Signing to a major record label, they relocate to Fort Collins, Colorado and build their own recording studio, The Blasting Room. Their lone major label album is 1995's <b>Pummel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{bombardment}} of Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip began on April 18, 1862. Porter had opined that {{two days of}} concentrated fire {{would be enough to}} reduce the forts, but after five days they seemed as strong as ever. The mortars were beginning to run low on ammunition. Farragut, who put little reliance on the mortars anyway, made the decision to bypass the forts on the night of April 24. The fleet successfully ran past the forts; the mortars were left behind, but they bombarded the forts during the passage in order to distract the enemy gunners. Once the fleet was above the forts, nothing significant stood between them and New Orleans; Farragut demanded the surrender of the city, and it fell to his fleet on April 29. The forts were still between him and Porter's mortar fleet, but when the latter again began to <b>pummel</b> Fort Jackson, its garrison mutinied and forced its surrender. Fort St. Philip had to follow suit. Surrender of the two forts was accepted by Commander Porter on April 28.|$|E

25|$|As of 2007, {{there is}} almost {{universal}} agreement in the astrophysics community that the long-duration bursts {{are associated with the}} deaths of massive stars in a specific kind of supernova-like event commonly referred to as a collapsar or hypernova. Very massive stars are able to fuse material in their centers all the way to iron, at which point a star cannot continue to generate energy by fusion and collapses, in this case, immediately forming a black hole. Matter from the star around the core rains down towards the center and (for rapidly rotating stars) swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into the black hole drives a pair of jets out along the rotational axis, where the matter density is much lower than in the accretion disk, towards the poles of the star at velocities approaching the speed of light, creating a relativistic shock wave at the front. If the star is not surrounded by a thick, diffuse hydrogen envelope, the jets' material can <b>pummel</b> {{all the way to the}} stellar surface. The leading shock actually accelerates as the density of the stellar matter it travels through decreases, and by the time it reaches the surface of the star it may be traveling with a Lorentz factor of 100 or higher (that is, a velocity of 0.9999 times the speed of light). Once it reaches the surface, the shock wave breaks out into space, with much of its energy released in the form of gamma-rays.|$|E

500|$|Overall, Breakout is {{dominant}} on pop rock but explores {{a variety}} of other musical genres.

The song's lyrics are [...] "a girls-only call to fun" [...] that anecdote on feelings about coming of age and the desire to be school-free. The uptempo refrains of [...] "7 Things" [...] are pop punk influenced. The song is [...] "a three-tempo patchwork quilt", transitioning [...] "from sensitive breakup song in the strummy verses to punky-pop kiss-off in the double-time choruses." [...] "7 Things"' lyrics list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend. [...] "The Driveway" [...] is a power ballad whose lyrics regard a breakup, insisting [...] "nothing hurts like losing when you know it's really gone." [...] The cover of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] replaces the subtle reggae undercurrent in the original version with a more rock music driven sound that includes pop punk beats and string stabs. The lyrics of [...] "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] primarily discuss the [...] "desire to let loose with one's friends", touching upon details of the life of an overworked child star. The song [...] "Full Circle" [...] is composed of a several pop rock hooks; in one of the hooks, Cyrus finishes various words with [...] "Oh, oh, oh!".

[...] "Other than that, though, we didn't really have much involvement with them. I don't know if we were below their radar, really, and they didn't care that much.
