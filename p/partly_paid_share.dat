Mr Allen, one of the executors of Mr Zuccani (trying to get money back) sued to get the fully paid shares’ value.|$|R
50|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>paid</b> <b>shares</b> in {{a company}} are ones in respect of which only a partial payment (or deposit) has been made, with the {{understanding}} that as the company requires more funds, calls will be made from time to time until the <b>shares</b> are fully <b>paid,</b> when no further calls can be made.|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} move, an actuarial {{report found that}} James Hardie {{asbestos}} liabilities were likely to reach A$574.3 million. The MRCF sought extra funding from James Hardie and was offered A$18 million in assets, an offer the MRCF rejected. The estimate of asbestos liabilities was promptly revised to A$751.7 million in 2002 and then A$1.573 billion in 2003. The funding shortfall became of increasing concern in 2004 as {{it became clear that}} eligible victims would miss out on receiving compensation after it was revealed that in March 2003 James Hardie had cancelled the <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> <b>shares</b> that were intended to be a safety net for the fund. In discussing the shortfall with the MRCF, James Hardie refused to accept further responsibility for the liabilities on the basis that the MRCF and James Hardie were separate legal entities.|$|R

2500|$|The {{main reason}} to control directors’ power over share allottments and issues {{is to prevent}} shareholders’ rights being watered down if new shares are created. Under CA 2006 section 561, {{existing}} shareholders have a basic pre-emption right, to be offered any new shares first in proportion to their existing holding. Shareholders have 14 days {{to decide whether to}} buy. There are a series of exceptions under CA 2006 sections 564-567, for issuing bonus <b>shares,</b> <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> <b>shares,</b> and employee shares, while private companies can opt out of pre-emption rules altogether. Furthermore, by special resolution (a three-quarter majority vote) under CA 2006 sections 570-571, shareholders may disapply pre-emption rights. In practice, large companies frequently give directors ad hoc authority to disapply pre-emption rights, but within the scope of a ‘Statement of Principles’ issued by asset managers. At present, the most influential guide is the document by the Institutional investors’ Pre-emption Group, Disapplying Pre-emption Rights: A Statement of Principle (...) [...] This suggests that the general practice is to disapply the pre-emption rights on a rolling basis for routine share issues (e.g. shares subject to a clawback) at no more than 5% of share capital each year.|$|R
25|$|In the UK {{there was}} {{initially}} a widespread {{belief that a}} corporation needed to demonstrate its creditworthiness by having its <b>shares</b> only <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> as where <b>shares</b> are <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> the investor would be liable {{for the remainder of}} the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to £1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866–1867) and the Long Depression (1873–1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the unpaid portion of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid.|$|R
2500|$|The firm now {{started to}} {{experience}} financial difficulties. Many stock auctions were held, the first, of engravings, {{taking place in}} 1865. That year Day & Son became a Limited Company. This not only meant that capital could be raised by the sale of shares but also that, in some cases, employees could be <b>paid</b> <b>partly</b> in <b>shares</b> in lieu of real wages. [...] Another auction, this time of illustrated books, was held in 1866. Hodgson & Co. would continue to sell off Day & Son assets up until 1873.|$|R
25|$|However, {{the means}} of urban {{development}} in this particular area {{of the city was}} subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest {{in the context of a}} public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at land undervalued land rates, and <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> in company <b>share.</b> Strict urbanization laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatized. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.|$|R
50|$|James Hardie {{had been}} {{structured}} {{as a parent}} company operating through subsidiaries since the 1930s. All asbestos operations, including the provision of compensation, were undertaken by James Hardie's subsidiaries, principally James Hardie and Coy and Hardie-Ferodo (later known as Jsekarb). Between 1995 and 2000, James Hardie (the parent company) began to remove the assets of these subsidiaries (since renamed Amaca and Amaba respectively), whilst leaving them {{with most of the}} asbestos liabilities of the James Hardie group. In 2001 these two companies were separated from James Hardie and acquired by the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation (MRCF) which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for Hardie's asbestos liabilities. Then CEO of James Hardie, Peter McDonald, made public announcements emphasising that the MRCF had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that James Hardie would not give it any further substantial funds. Indeed, the net assets of the MRCF were A$293 million, mostly in real estate and loans, and exceeded the 'best estimate' of $286 million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by James Hardie. The Jackson Report found that this 'best estimate' was 'wildly optimistic' and the estimates of future liabilities was 'far too low'. After this separation, James Hardie moved offshore to the Netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders. To make this move, the company had to assure Australian courts (as it was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange) that the MRCF would be able to meet future liabilities. The courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its Australian asbestos victims through the issue of <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> <b>shares</b> to MRCF obliging the new Dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed. The value of the call at the time was $1.9 billion. The move to the Netherlands therefore proceeded. However, the tax benefits which James Hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the United States in 2001 and later with the United States signing a new trade agreement with the Netherlands in 2006. While the move to the Netherlands resulted in tax savings of $US85.5 million over seven years, in 2009 James Hardie had to pay the Australian Taxation Office $AU153 million after an audit of the 2001 move showed James Hardie had violated the Income Tax Assessment Act. Also in 2009, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service alleged that James Hardie had not been in compliance with the US-Dutch treaty since it had been implemented in 2006 and claimed $US37 million in unpaid taxes plus $US10 million in interest and penalties.|$|R

30|$|Paid and unpaid {{overtime}} {{hours are}} calculated {{mainly on the}} basis of the yearly GSOEP while also the Microcensus enters the accounts for computations on recent years. The GSOEP contains information about the number of weekly overtime hours and its compensation form (compensated with time-off; <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> <b>partly</b> compensated with time-off; paid; not compensated at all). On that basis, the number of annual paid and unpaid overtime hours can be calculated. Problems arise due to the assignment of <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> overtime hours. Since 2001, these overtime hours can be assigned through information by the additional question of the number of paid overtime hours last month. With this information the otherwise undetermined cases of <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> overtime hours are made unambiguous, while the resulting fraction of paid hours among the ambiguous cases is extrapolated to previous years. Certain groups of employees (marginally employed, apprentices and employees with zero working hours, e.[*]g., on parental leave) do not work paid overtime according to their contract, which we take into account in the calculations.|$|R

60|$|To {{provide that}} {{taxation}} shall fall entirely on income, {{and not at}} all on capital, is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements. There is no tax which is not <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> from what would otherwise have been saved; no tax, the amount of which, if remitted, would be wholly employed in increased expenditure, and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital. All taxes, therefore, are in some sense <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> out of capital; and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth. But, in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong, this effect of taxation is scarcely felt. To take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove, or a commercial crisis destroy, is only to do what either of those causes would have done—namely, to make a clear space for further saving.|$|R
