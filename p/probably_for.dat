5|$|In both East and West, the scholae, the emperors' {{personal}} cavalry escort, lay {{outside the}} normal military chain of command. According to the Notitia, the tribuni (commanders) of the scholae {{reported to the}} magister officiorum, a senior civilian official. However, this was <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> administrative purposes only. On campaign, a tribunus scholae probably reported direct to the emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was already}} {{obsolete}} {{by the time}} it had been completed, as European military design had moved beyond curved bastions, embracing the angular designs seen in the later star forts. Nonetheless, it remained operational as an artillery fort {{for the rest of the}} century, with an initial garrison in 1540 of 24 men under the command of Chute, rising to 28 men and the captain after 1542. Although it had been fitted with gunloops for handguns from the very start, the castle initially relied heavily on archers for its own protection against attack from the land. It had stocks of 140 longbows and 560 sheaves of arrows in 1568, for example, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> use by the local militia in the event of a war. Polearms were also stored there in considerable numbers, again <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> use by the militia.|$|E

5|$|Access to {{the central}} island {{occurred}} over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped on a grand scale, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> the use of the castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> display.|$|E
5|$|As {{a proponent}} of {{religious}} reform, Henry gave extensively to reformist groups within the Church. He was a keen supporter of the Cluniac order, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> intellectual reasons. He donated money to the abbey at Cluny itself, and after 1120 gave generously to Reading Abbey, a Cluniac establishment. Construction on Reading began in 1121, and Henry endowed it with rich lands and extensive privileges, making it a symbol of his dynastic lines. He also focused effort on promoting the conversion of communities of clerks into Augustinian canons, the foundation of leper hospitals, expanding the provision of nunneries, and the charismatic orders of the Savigniacs and Tironensians. He was an avid collector of relics, sending an embassy to Constantinople in 1118 to collect Byzantine items, {{some of which were}} donated to Reading Abbey.|$|E

5|$|By the 12th century, Southampton was an {{important}} trading port with trade routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony. Both the town and castle played {{an important}} role in this trade, in part forming a warehouse for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown Bailiff. The former castle hall was turned into a subterranean vault in the 13th century, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> storing wine. Stone houses, often combining accommodation and storage facilities, began to be built in Southampton by the wealthiest merchants, particularly in the prosperous western and southern parts of the town, but these properties could not be easily defended against attack.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe that}} the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (<b>probably</b> <b>for</b> feeding behavior), and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|In February 1858 Felice Beato {{arrived in}} Calcutta and began {{travelling}} throughout Northern India {{to document the}} aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862.|$|E

5|$|MacGregor {{joined the}} British Army at 16, the {{youngest}} age {{it was possible}} for him to do so, in April 1803. His family purchased him a commission as an ensign in the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> around £450. MacGregor's entrance to the military coincided with the start of the Napoleonic Wars following the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens. Southern England was fortified to defend against a possible French invasion; the 57th Foot was at Ashford, Kent. In February 1804, after less than a year in training, MacGregor was promoted without purchase to lieutenant—an advancement that usually took up to three years. Later that year, after MacGregor had spent some months in Guernsey with the regiment's 1st Battalion, the 57th Foot was posted to Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Major {{restoration}} {{work was}} carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed. Scott's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front.|$|E
5|$|On {{some of the}} figures, however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation {{for this is that}} over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he <b>probably,</b> <b>for</b> a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{went on to}} rent further {{land around}} the north of Plas Mawr. The land {{at the south end}} of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there. Wynne {{purchased}} this in 1585, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> the relatively high price of £40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr. Further small pieces of land were bought on the north-west side of the house and converted into an ornamental garden, bringing the total cost of the land to around £300. The result was the grandest Elizabethan town house in Wales at the time.|$|E
5|$|Southampton was an {{important}} trading port in the 12th century, with trade routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony. The castle played {{an important}} role in this trade, in part forming a warehouse for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown Bailiff. Royal purchases of wine were particularly important for the castle, being stored and distributed to royal properties across the south of England. The former castle hall was turned into a subterranean vault in the 13th century, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> storing wine.|$|E
5|$|The {{airfield}} is very {{isolated in}} northwest Utah, {{sitting in the}} middle of a vast wasteland miles away from any major population center. It is <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> this reason, and the dry hot climate, that much of the airfield remains today. Still-extant facilities include the vast runway system, numerous ramps, taxiways, dispersal pads, and most of the original hangars (including the Enola Gay B-29 hangar). Most of the hospital complex and many barracks remain, as does a chow hall, chapel, swimming pool and many other World War II-era buildings.|$|E

5|$|The churchyard covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern – {{many of them}} are from the nineteenth century – but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E
5|$|Zigrasimecia {{is known}} for its unusual morphology, and most likely had habits no longer seen in extant species. It has a highly movable head that {{suggests}} mobility was an important factor for them (this is <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> feeding behavior). The morphology of the mandibles would have prevented nest excavation, so the rugose projections on the head may have provided assistance. There is no evidence that Cretaceous ants exhibited nesting behavior, although the queen caste in Z. tonsora suggests that a dealate queen was needed for creating nests. Also, Zigrasimecia and Gerontoformica ants coexisted with each other; this is evident as a recovered piece of amber showed both genera trapped inside. This means that the two ants may have shared some of their ecological niches and possibly interacted with each other through fighting.|$|E
5|$|Chesma {{was named}} after the Russian victory at the Battle of Chesma in 1770. She was built by the Russian Steam Navigation Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down in late June 1883, {{launched}} on 18 May 1886, and completed on 29 May 1889. She served with the Black Sea Fleet until 1907. She was inactive in 1895, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> mechanical problems. Chesma conducted trials in 1902 with towing spherical observation balloons and she was re-boilered the following year. Plans were made for a radical reconstruction to be done while her boilers were being replaced. The rebuilding involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the turrets in an armoured citadel that used Krupp armor. This proved to be too expensive and it was cancelled, but not before the armor and turrets had been ordered. Her turrets were used to equip the pre-dreadnought , then under construction.|$|E
