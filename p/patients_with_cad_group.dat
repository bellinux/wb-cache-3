40|$|Intravenous {{dipyridamole}} thallium {{testing is}} a useful alternative procedure for assessing coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients {{who are unable to}} perform maximal exercise tests. Ischaemic ST segment depression and angina pectoris are frequently observed during the test, in particular when exercise is added to dipyridamole infusion. To establish the clinical significance and additional diagnostic value of these markers of ischaemia during dipyridamole low-level exercise testing (DXT) 57 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> (<b>group</b> A), 21 patients with normal or near-normal coronary arteries at coronary arteriography (group B), and 20 healthy subjects with low likelihood of CAD (group C) were studied. During DXT ischaemic ST segment depression was observed in 28 patients (47 %) of group A and in two patients (10 %) of group B. Angina pectoris was experienced by 35 patients (61 %) of group A and by five patients (24 %) of group B. The positive predictive value of both ST depression and angina pectoris was high (88 and 93 %, respectively), but the negative predictive values were low (42 and 40 %, respectively). Combining ST segment analysis with the findings of thallium imaging significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy of the test. ST segment depression, angina pectoris, and thallium abnormalities were highly specific findings if the study population consisted of asymptomatic subjects with a low likelihood of CAD (group C). Sensitivity for the detection of the presence of CAD increased with the extent of CAD for all parameters studied. Thus, ST depression and angina pectoris, alone or in combination, during DXT have little diagnostic significance, although sensitivity is increased in patients with triple-vessel CAD.

40|$|Although {{exercise}} stress echocardiography {{is currently}} {{used to evaluate}} coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, the best exercise methodology is still undefined. The objectives of the study were: (1) to compare supine bicycle stress echocardiography (SBSE) and treadmill {{in the evaluation of}} CAD; and (2) to define, in normal subjects, the different behavior of factors determining MVO 2 wish treadmill and SBSE. We selected 10 male <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> (<b>group</b> A), and 10 male control subjects (group B). Each patient underwent SBSE and tread-mill testing in random order. We studied heart sate, systolic blood pressure, heart rate x systolic blood pressure, and end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes. in group A, we also studied wall motion score index (according to the American Society of Echocardiography) and in group B, systolic blood pressure/end-systolic volume index. The results were as follows: Group A: SBSE resulted in significantly lower work load, heart rate, and significantly higher systolic blood pressure, heart hate x systolic blood pressure, end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index, and wall motion score index. SBSE showed wall motion abnormalities in each patient, whereas treadmill did not detect wail motion abnormalities in 4 patients (3 single-vessel; 1 multivessel); of the other 6 patients, 2 showed a lower wall motion score index and 4 did not show any difference in left ventricle kinetics with the 2 methodologies of exercise. Mean acquisition time for postexercise images was 72 +/- 6 seconds. Group B: SBSE resulted in lower work load, heart rate, heart rate x systolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure/end-systolic volume index, and higher end-diastolic volume index and end-systolic volume index. Systolic blood pressure was similar with SBSE and treadmill testing. In conclusion, our experience suggests SBSE is a highly accurate diagnostic fool for evaluating CAD compared with treadmill testing; the maximum cardiovascular performance can be achieved With lower values of heart rate, suggesting the echo test is more feasible. Treadmill testing could lose important information about the existence, extension, and location of CAD; ire contrast, SBSE detects even small, quickly reversible wall motion abnormalities.

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) is {{characterized}} by an inflammatory status and it represents the major {{cause of death in}} elderly. Zinc deficiency and inflammatory genes within major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region are implicated in ischaemic heart diseases. TNF-alpha is present in coronary artery plaques and may provoke plaque instability. Hsp 70 plays instead a pro-atherogenic role, via proinflammatory cytokine production, in atherosclerotic lesions contributing to plaque rupture. Contradictory data report the association between - 308 TNF-alpha polymorphism and CAD, while no investigations exist on Hsp 70 - 2 gene in CAD.

In contrast, we observed a high prevalence of colorectal adenomas in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> coronary artery disease (CAD) in our previous study. Aims: To investigate whether aspirin prevents colorectal adenomas recurrence in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Methods: <b>Patients</b> scheduled for coronary angiography as workup for CAD were enrolled for screening colonoscopy as described in our previous study. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> colorectal adenoma after a clearance colonoscopy were recruited for follow up study. Surveillance colonoscopy was performed at the end of first year. Aspirin was prescribed to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> (aspirin <b>group)</b> as part of the routine management, but not to those without (control group). Results: There were 46 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> coronary artery disease (aspirin group) and 51 without (control). There was no difference in sex (91. 3 % male vs 82. 4 %, p= 0. 19), age (66 ± 7 vs 64 ± 8 yrs, p= 0. 18) or advanced colorectal lesion (23. 9 % vs 17. 6 %, p= 0. 44) at screening colonoscopy in the two groups. In the surveillance colonoscopy, the aspirin group, did not have a lower colorectal adenoma recurrence rate (32. 6 % vs 27. 5 %, p= 0. 58) nor advanced lesion (15. 2 % vs 7. 8 %, p= 0. 25) than the control. However, the presence of advanced lesion in the first screening colonoscopy predicted the subsequent recurrence of colorectal adenoma (50 % vs 24. 7 %, p= 0. 028).

40|$|Objective: Diabetes {{has long}} been known to be an {{independent}} risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recognition of diabetic individuals at greatest risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) would have important public health importance by allowing the distribution of limited resources to be directed on those who would most benefit from aggressive management. Several functional differences between haptoglobin (Hp) phenotypes have been demonstrated that appear to have important biological and clinical consequences in the development of <b>CAD</b> in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> type 2 DM. The present study was conducted to demonstrate the relationship between the Hp phenotypes and the development of <b>CAD</b> among Egyptian <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> type 2 DM. To our knowledge this work had not been carried out in Egypt before. Subjects and methods: The study included 160 subjects divided into three groups. Group I: 72 type 2 DM patients without <b>CAD,</b> <b>Group</b> II: 48 type 2 DM <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> developed <b>CAD,</b> <b>Group</b> III: 40 age and gender matched apparently healthy subjects to serve as controls. All patients and controls were subjected to full history taking, complete clinical examination, and routine laboratory investigations. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and serum haptoglobin levels were measured. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for Hp phenotypes’ determination. Results: Analysis revealed association between Hp 2 - 2 phenotype and the presence of CAD in type 2 DM.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to verify whether HDL {{particles}} isolated from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> coronary artery disease (CAD) and low HDL-C had diminished ability to promote cholesterol efflux from cultured cells compared with HDL isolated from subjects without <b>CAD</b> and <b>with</b> normal HDL-C. METHODS: Smooth muscle cells isolated from human aortas cultured and radiolabeled with ³H-cholesterol were loaded with cholesterol and incubated with increasing concentrations of HDL isolated from 13 <b>CAD</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> low HDL-C (<b>CAD</b> <b>group)</b> or from 5 controls without <b>CAD</b> (C <b>group).</b> Efflux of cellular cholesterol was measured by cellular depletion of radiolabeled cholesterol and by the appearance of ³H-cholesterol into experimental medium expressed as a percentage of total labeled cholesterol. RESULTS: Cholesterol efflux increased with the amount of HDL present in the medium, and no difference was found between groups at various HDL protein concentrations: efflux was 28 ± 6. 3 % (C) and 25. 5 ± 8. 9 % (<b>CAD)</b> <b>with</b> 25 mg/mL; 34 ± 4. 3 % (C) and 31. 9 ± 6. 6 % (CD) with 50 mg/mL and 39. 5 ± 3. 5 % (C) and 37. 1 ± 4. 4 % (<b>CAD)</b> <b>with</b> 100 mg/mL, HDL.

40|$|Background: Polymorphisms of the {{renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system}} {{have been found}} in {{association}} with coronary artery disease (CAD). The M 235 T polymorphism is the most important angiotensinogen (AGT) genetic variant. The relationship between AGT gene polymorphisms and CAD has been investigated in only a few studies, however, with conflicting results. In most of these studies, not all participants underwent coronary angiography to determine the existence of coronary artery stenosis. In this study, we tested this relationship again in Taiwanese subjects who underwent coronary angiography. Methods: This study enrolled 576 patients who underwent coronary angiography, including 362 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> (the <b>CAD</b> <b>group)</b> and 214 without <b>CAD</b> (the control <b>group).</b> The M 235 T angiotensinogen genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and subsequent digestion of the products with Tth 111 I. Results: The frequencies of the variant M 235 T genotypes in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> were MM 3. 3 %, MT 52. 2 %, and TT 44. 5 %, not significantly different from those in the control group (MM 3. 7 %, MT 49. 5 %, and TT 46. 7 %) (p = 0. 82).

40|$|Objective Coronary {{heart disease}} (CAD) {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} chronic disease and the main {{leading cause of death}} in the world, with {{more than half a million}} newly diagnosed CAD patients each year. The development of atherosclerosis involves the interaction of multiple metabolic and cellular processes. Central to this are disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. Apolipoprotein A-I is the major protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in plasma. Chylomicrons secreted from the intestinal enterocyte also contain Apo A-I, but it is quickly transferred to HDL in the blood stream. The aim of this study is to determine if Apo-A 1 can be used as indicator to severity and extent of CAD. Methods This study was conducted in cardiac catheterisation unit at Al Hussein Medical city from November 2014 to September 2015. It included 76 patients (49 males and 27 females) who presented with signs and symptoms of CAD and have undergone angiography. Control group consisted of 20 healthy subjects (14 males and 6 females) matched for age and BMI. Serum levels of Apo-A 1 were measured in both groups. After coronary angiography was done for all patients, the extent and severity of <b>CAD</b> was correlated <b>with</b> serum levels of Apo-A 1. The extent of CAD was determined by angiography, according to number of coronary arteries involved and degree of narrowing in coronary artery diameter. Results The angiographic finding in patient group was normal in 22 patients (28. 9 %), single vessel involvement in 15 patients (19. 7 %), two vessels disease in 15 patients (19. 7 %) and three vessels disease in 18 patients (23. 8 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{clinical}} significance of coronary flow reserve (CFR) was evaluated after pharmacological (papaverine) and physiological (exercise) vasodilation in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD). METHODS: CFR was determined using parametric imaging in 10 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> normal coronary arteries (group 1) and in 10 <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> (<b>group</b> 2). Contrast density and mean appearance time were measured (region of interest = 249 pixels) in the perfusion beds of the left circumflex and the left anterior descending coronary arteries at rest, 45 s after 10 mg intracoronary papaverine, and during supine bicycle exercise. CFR was calculated from coronary perfusion after papaverine divided by perfusion at rest and coronary perfusion during exercise divided by perfusion at rest. Perfusion zones in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> were subdivided into regions supplied by a non-stenosed (group 2 a) and a stenosed (group 2 b) coronary artery. RESULTS: In control patients, heart rate increased from 75 beats/min at rest to 125 beats/min during exercise, and in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> from 63 to 107 beats/min, respectively. Mean aortic pressure showed a significant increase during exercise in both groups. Mean pulmonary artery pressure increased significantly during exercise from 19 to 28 mmHg in control patients and from 22 to 42 mmHg in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 001). Coronary driving pressure (mean aortic minus diastolic pulmonary artery pressure) tended to increase during exercise {{in the control group}} (from 90 to 101 mmHg, NS) and remained nearly unchanged in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> (from 92 to 94 mmHg, NS). In the control group, CFR was significantly higher during exercise than after papaverine (4. 0 versus 3. 5, respectively; P < 0. 01). However, coronary resistance (coronary driving pressure divided by coronary flow index) was similar after papaverine and during exercise. In <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> papaverine-dependent CFR was significantly reduced in the perfusion zone of the stenosed (2. 1) but not of the non-stenosed coronary artery (3. 0). In contrast, CFR during exercise was significantly decreased in both perfusion zones (2. 5 in non-stenosed arteries and 1. 5 in stenosed vessels). CONCLUSIONS: In control patients, CFR is slightly but significantly larger during exercise than after papaverine because of the exercise-induced increase in coronary driving pressure. In contrast, CFR is smaller during exercise than after papaverine in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> most probably as a result of secondary mechanisms such as exercise-induced narrowing of stenosed vessels or an increase in extravascular resistance. Thus, CFR based on papaverine appears to be of limited value for assessing the functional significance of a stenotic lesion...|$|R
40|$|Background. Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a common}} cause of {{hospitalisation}} in cardiac wards, while chronic pancreatitis (CP) is in gastroenterology wards. Both diseases are chronic and the clinical picture is dominated by pain. Objectives. The objective was to describe the psychological characteristics of patients hospitalised for the worsening of CAD and CP. Material and methods. The sample comprised 30 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and 30 <b>with</b> CP. Participants completed personal questionnaires, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, STAI, Beck Depression Inventory and Scale A-Framingham. Results. Mild depression occurred in 20 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and 30 % with CP. A severe degree of depression was found in 20 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and in 15 % with CP while {{the highest levels of}} anxiety (9 – 10 sten) were found in 30 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CP and in 20 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> In relation to introversion-extraversion personality dimension, 74 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and 53 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CP were classified as ambivert or introvert.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pathogenesis}} {{of cognitive}} dysfunction in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> remains unclear. <b>CAD</b> is associated <b>with</b> brain atrophy and specific lesions. Detailed {{knowledge about the}} association of brain volume measured with MRI, and cognitive function in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> is lacking. We therefore investigated brain volume and cognitive function in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> revascularized coronary artery disease (CAD), and controls without CAD. METHODS: Brain MRI scans and cognitive tests from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> were compared <b>with</b> data from control subjects without CAD. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (short term memory) and Trailmaking (divided attention) tests. Multivariable regression {{analysis was used to}} study associations between CAD, brain volume and cognitive function. RESULTS: A total of 102 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and 48 control subjects were included. Level of education and age were comparable between the groups. Compared <b>with</b> controls, <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> had smaller total brain volume (expressed as fraction of intracranial volume) [%ICV, mean (SD), 0. 78 (0. 03) vs 0. 80 (0. 02), P= 0. 001] and larger volume of non-ventricular cerebrospinal fluid [%ICV, median (IQR) 0. 19 (0. 18 to 0. 21) vs 0. 18 (0. 17 to 0. 20), P= 0. 001]. Patients in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> had poorer cognitive function [mean (SD) Z-score - 0. 16 (0. 72) vs 0. 41 (0. 69), P< 0. 01]. Multivariable regression showed that CAD, higher age, lower level of education and greater cerebrospinal fluid volume were independent predictors of poorer cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: CAD patients had a smaller total brain volume and poorer cognitive function than controls. Greater volume of cerebrospinal fluid was an independent predictor of poorer cognitive function...|$|R

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the leading}} cause of death worldwide. Patients who have survived a {{coronary}} event are the highest priority for secondary prevention. In the secondary prevention of CAD, strong evidence of the beneficial effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is confirmed. The positive effects of physical activity are well established in primary prevention, but the question of whether these effects also relate to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> still remains to be explored. It is theoretically possible that kinesiophobia, fear of movement, may prevent successful cardiac rehabilitation. The impact on kinesiophobia by rehabilitation outcomes in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> has not previously been investigated. The overall aim of this thesis was to study the impact of exercise and physical activity in relation to kinesiophobia and cardiac risk markers in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Study I evaluated the effects of high-frequency exercise before and after an elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Study II examined the level of physical activity in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and investigated the association between physical activity and cardiac risk markers. Study III investigated the validity and reliability of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia Heart (TSK-SV Heart), a brief questionnaire to detect kinesiophobia, in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Study IV described the occurrence of kinesiophobia in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and investigated the impact on kinesiophobia by clinical variables with an influence on rehabilitation outcomes. The main findings were that high-frequency exercise improved the maximum aerobic capacity and muscle function in <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> PCI, which may have clear advantages when it comes to preventing the progress of CAD. A relatively high level of physical activity was found among <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> six months after the cardiac event. After adjustment for confounders, statistically significant, yet weak, associations were found between physical activity and several cardiac risk markers. Support was found for the TSK-SV Heart as a reliable, valid questionnaire for measuring kinesiophobia in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> A high level of kinesiophobia was found in 20 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> six months after the cardiac event. In addition, an impact on kinesiophobia was identified by clinical variables with an influence on rehabilitation outcomes in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> representing medical variables, all components of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and health-related quality of life. In conclusion, high-frequency exercise in <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> PCI improved their maximum aerobic capacity and muscle function. Significant, yet weak, associations were identified between physical activity and cardiac risk markers in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Several important clinical findings with an impact on rehabilitation outcomes were found to be associated with a high level of kinesiophobia.

40|$|Depression is an {{independent}} risk factor for morbidity and mortality in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> coronary artery disease (CAD). Altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, a common feature of depression, is also {{a risk factor for}} cardiac events in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects ANS activity, and reduced HRV predicts morbidity in cardiac populations. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether differences in HRV exist between depressed and nondepressed <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Twenty-one depressed inpatients, <b>with</b> angiographically documented <b>CAD</b> were retrospectively matched to 21 nondepressed CAD patients by sex, age, and smoking status.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravenous {{thrombolysis}} (IVT) for stroke {{seems to}} be beneficial independent of the underlying etiology.

METHODS: We used the Swiss IVT databank to compare outcome and complications of IVT-treated <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>with</b> IVT-treated <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> other etiologies (non-CAD patients). Main outcome and complication measures were favorable 3 -month outcome, intracranial cerebral hemorrhage, and recurrent ischemic stroke. Modified Rankin Scale score <or= 1 at 3 months was considered favorable. RESULTS: Fifty-five (5. 2 %) of 1062 IVT-treated <b>patients</b> had <b>CAD.</b> <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> were younger (median age 50 versus 70 years) but had similar median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (14 versus 13) and time to treatment (152. 5 versus 156 minutes) as non-CAD patients. In the <b>CAD</b> <b>group,</b> 36 % (20 of 55) had a favorable 3 -month outcome compared with 44 % (447 of 1007) non-CAD patients (OR, 0. 72; 95 % CI, 0. 41 to 1. 26), which was less favorable after adjustment for age, gender, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (OR, 0. 50; 95 % CI, 0. 27 to 0. 95; P= 0. 03). Intracranial cerebral hemorrhages (asymptomatic, symptomatic, fatal) were equally frequent in CAD (14 % [7 %, 7 %, 2 %]) and non-CAD patients (14 % [9 %, 5 %, 2 %]; P= 0. 99). Recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 1. 8 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and in 3. 7 % of non-CAD-patients (P= 0. 71). CONCLUSIONS: IVT-treated <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> do not recover as well as IVT-treated non-CAD patients. However, intracranial bleedings and recurrent ischemic strokes were equally frequent in both groups. They do not account for different outcomes and indicate that IVT should not be excluded in patients who may have CAD.

40|$|Aim : Prevalence {{rates of}} {{coronary}} artery disease (CAD) are reported to be very high in Asian Indians. Conventional risk factors do not explain the high rates of CAD among Indians. Recently, several newer risk factors {{have been reported to}} be associated <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> We measured tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) and fibrinogen levels in South Indian diabetic and non-diabetic subjects <b>with</b> and without <b>CAD.</b> Methods : Four groups of subjects were studied (all males); Group 1 comprised of non-diabetic subjects without CAD (n= 50).

40|$|International audienceWe {{reviewed}} the literature about {{the usefulness of}} screening for carotid artery lesions in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> coronary artery disease (CAD). The use of duplex ultrasonography to detect carotid lesions has a two-fold interest in this situation. First, it enables the detection of severe carotid artery stenosis (CS), a potentially reversible cause of stroke. Stroke is frequent in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> accounting for at least in one-fourth of all cardiovascular events during follow-up. The mean prevalence of CS > 60 % in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> is 9 %, too low to justify routine carotid screening. However, older age, history of a cerebrovascular event, and peripheral arterial disease are useful factors for focusing screening on a high-risk subset of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Trials assessing the interest of prophylactic carotid surgery in asymptomatic CS of 60 % or more found similar benefits in the subset of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Screening for CS in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting is also important because CS is a marker, and sometimes the source, of perioperative stroke. Unfortunately, randomized studies {{to determine the best}} strategy in this situation are lacking. Second, while measurement of the carotid intima-media thickness does not provide substantial prognostic information for <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> the presence of plaque, especially hypoechogenic or echolucent (lipid-rich) plaque, is associated with an unstable or high-risk cardiovascular status.
