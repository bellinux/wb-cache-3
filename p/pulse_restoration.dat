40|$|We {{present and}} discuss a time {{dependent}} {{solution of the}} transmission line model of a channel electron multiplier, introduced in a previous paper and already solved in steady-state conditions. The model is applicable to all the situations in which the multiplier input current is sufficiently large so that the statistical variations of the gain for each electron can be ignored {{and it does not}} apply to photon counting detectors. By introducing the appropriate boundary conditions the time dependent non-linear equations of the model are reduced to an integral equation in implicit form, whose solution can be calculated numerically by a perturbative approach. In this way the multiplying current signal i(z,t) and the voltage V(z,t) are found as functions of the position z along the channel, and of the time t during the pulse itself, for any arbitrary shape of the input current waveform. The important case of the amplification of input current pulses with a short duration compared to the multiplier recovery time is investigated in detail, showing that the non-linear behavior can be entirely described by a general function of a conveniently defined saturation parameter and that this function is characteristic of any uniform channel multiplier. The model is then used to investigate the recovery of the multiplier after a saturating pulse, and it is found that the gain recovery from weak or moderate saturation levels is exponential to a very good approximation, but with a time constant different from the characteristic time constant RC of the multiplier. Finally the case of pulses of arbitrary shape and duration is considered and examples are given of the amplification of step pulses and of a regular sequence of identical pulses. A remarkable feature of the model is that the solution can be calculated from the time shape of the output pulse, rather than from the input. This makes possible to implement methods for <b>pulse</b> <b>restoration,</b> i. e. for recovering the original input pulse shape from a measured saturated output...|$|E

Crystalloid solutions and blood transfusion are the mainstays of pre-hospital and in-hospital treatment of hemorrhagic shock. In the pre-hospital setting four types of fluid are presently recommended: crystalloid solutions, colloid solutions, hypertonic saline and oxygen-carrying blood substitutes. In unstable or unresponsive hemorrhagic shock surgical treatment is mandatory as soon as possible to control the source of bleeding. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{many large}} ecosystems, {{conservation}} projects are selected by a diverse set of actors operating independently at spatial scales ranging from local to international. Although small-scale decision making can leverage local expert knowledge, {{it also may}} be an inefficient means of achieving large-scale objectives if piecemeal efforts are poorly coordinated. Here, we assess the value of coordinating efforts in both space and time to maximize the restoration of aquatic ecosystem connectivity. Habitat fragmentation is a leading driver of declining biodiversity and ecosystem services in rivers worldwide, and we simultaneously evaluate optimal barrier removal strategies for 661 tributary rivers of the Laurentian Great Lakes, which are fragmented by at least 6, 692 dams and 232, 068 road crossings. We find that coordinating barrier removals across the entire basin is nine times more efficient at reconnecting fish to headwater breeding grounds than optimizing independently for each watershed. Similarly, a one-time <b>pulse</b> of <b>restoration</b> investment is up to 10 times more efficient than annual allocations totaling the same amount. Despite widespread emphasis on dams as key barriers in river networks, improving road culvert passability is also essential for efficiently restoring connectivity to the Great Lakes. Our results highlight the dramatic economic and ecological advantages of coordinating efforts in both space and time during restoration of large ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a hybrid time-domain chirp switch (TDCS) {{in which the}} nonlinear chirper is an AlGaAs waveguide and the soliton dispersive delay line is a polarization-maintaining fiber. The hybrid TDCS can restore timing in a switching or transmission system, and when combined with an optical amplifier, it can act as an ultrafast, all-optical regenerator for soliton <b>pulses.</b> The timing <b>restoration</b> concept is applicable to other nonlinear materials with negligible walk-off, and the acceptable time window can be tailored by adjusting the width and intensity of a reference pulse. In optical switching and transmission systems, {{it is important to}} restore logic level and timing periodically, with current networks performing the restoration at regenerators. However, with the trend toward light-pipe systems in which the regenerators are replaced by erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, the system becomes limited by timing jitter and fluctuations. Here we show that a hybrid time-domain chirp switch (TDCS) that consists of a semiconducto...|$|R
40|$|The {{counting}} efficiency for a liquid scintillation sample varies with its composition. Impurities from solubilizers {{as well as}} the specimen itself typically quench the available energy, reducing both the pulse heights and the total number of detectable events. Counting efficiency as measured in a pulse height channel is therefore uncertain, particularly when assaying low-energy radionuclides or dual labeled samples. An external source of gamma radiation is frequently utilized to quantitate the degree of quenching. This is done by analyzing the additional pulse height spectrum created from Corn pton electrons, which are produced in the sample by the radiation from the gamma source. The resulting data may then be used to correct for losses in pulse height and {{counting efficiency}}. The counts induced by the gamma source are usually measured in two pulse height channels and the ratio of the counts in these channels is used to quantitate quenching. This is called the external standard ratio (ESR). The fixed windows in these channels, however, limit the useful dynamic range of quench determination or may produce unacceptable statistical uncertainty in the estimated counting efficiencies of quenched samples. A new method of quench determination based upon relative pulse height (RPI-!) is described. Applying this technique to the external standard Compton spectrum provides a means for quantitating quench in tenils of RPH over a 30 to 1 change with less than 1 %standard deviation. By recognizing the quantum characteristic of weak scintillations, accurate <b>pulse</b> height <b>restoration</b> can be extended to quenched samples containing low energy radionuclides such as SI-i and l 4 C. Isotope energy, window settings, and true disintegration rate can be computed from the RPH quench value of unknown samples without empirical curves...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To improve fat {{saturation}} in coronary MRA at 3 T {{by using}} a spectrally selective adiabatic T 2 -Prep (WSA-T 2 -Prep). METHODS: A conventional adiabatic T 2 -Prep (CA-T 2 -Prep) was modified, such that the excitation and <b>restoration</b> <b>pulses</b> were of differing bandwidths. On-resonance spins are T 2 -Prepared, whereas off-resonance spins, such as fat, are spoiled. This approach was combined with a CHEmically Selective Saturation (CHESS) pulse to achieve even greater fat suppression. Numerical simulations were followed by phantom validation and in vivo coronary MRA. RESULTS: Numerical simulations demonstrated that augmenting a CHESS pulse with a WSA-T 2 -Prep improved robustness to B 1 inhomogeneities and that this combined fat suppression was effective over a broader spectral range {{than that of a}} CHESS pulse in a conventional T 2 -Prepared sequence. Phantom studies also demonstrated that the WSA-T 2 -Prep+CHESS combination produced greater fat suppression across a range of B 1 values than did a CA-T 2 -Prep+CHESS combination. Lastly, in vivo measurements demonstrated that the contrast-to-noise ratio between blood and myocardium was not adversely affected {{by using a}} WSA-T 2 -Prep, despite the improved abdominal and epicardial fat suppression. Additionally, vessel sharpness improved. CONCLUSION: The proposed WSA-T 2 -Prep method was shown to improve fat suppression and vessel sharpness as compared to a CA-T 2 -Prep technique, and to also increase fat suppression when combined with a CHESS pulse...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{evaluated}} {{our immediate}} and midterm (mean 4. 3 years) results of balloon dilation of critical valvular aortic stenosis in 33 neonates. Background. Balloon dilation {{has been used}} as an alternative to surgical treatment. Reports to date consist of small series (largest 16 babies) with short-term follow-up (longest 4. 8 years). Methods. From 1985 to 1991, 33 neonates had dilation at a mean age of 13 days and a mean weight of 3. 4 kg. Nineteen of the neonates (58 %) were intubated and received prostaglandins, and 94 % had other cardiac abnormalities. Results. The dilation was completed retrograde in 31 of the neonates (umbilical artery in 11 and femoral artery in 20) and anterograde (femoral vein) in 2. The average immediate peak gradient and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure reductions were 54 % and 20 %, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 12 % (three early deaths and one late). All 20 neonates dilated through a femoral artery initially had <b>pulse</b> loss with <b>restoration</b> in 35 % after thrombolytic therapy. At 8. 3 years, survival and freedom of reintervention probability rates were 88 % and 64 %, respectively. At mean 4. 3 years of follow-up, 83 % of the survivors were asymptomatic; Doppler study revealed a maximal instantaneous gradient < 50 mm Hg in 65 % of neonates and significant aortic regurgitation in 14 %. Conclusions. This study confirms that dilation of aortic stenosis in neonates is effective; reintervention (mostly redilation) is frequent (40 %); and midterm survival is encouraging (88 %).

40|$|Entrainment {{may involve}} {{responses}} to dawn, to dusk, {{and to the}} light in between these transitions. Previous studies showed that the circadian system responds to only 2 light pulses, one {{at the beginning and}} one {{at the end of the}} day, in a similar way as to a full photoperiod, as long as the photoperiod is less than approximately 1 / 2 tau. The authors used a double 1 -h light pulse protocol with different intervals of darkness in between (1, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 16 h) to study the phase responses of mice. The phase response curves obtained were compared to full light pulse PRCs of corresponding durations. Up to 6 hours, phase responses induced by double light pulses are virtually the same as by a corresponding full light pulse. The authors made a simple phase-only model to estimate the response reduction due to light exposure and response restoration due to dark exposure of the system. In this model, they assumed a 100 % contribution of the first I-h light pulse and fitted the reduction factor for the second light pulse to yield the best fit to the observations. The results suggest that after I h of light followed by less than 4 h of darkness, there is a considerable reduction in response to the second light <b>pulse.</b> Full response <b>restoration</b> requires more than 10 h of darkness. To investigate the influence of the duration of light on the response saturation, the authors performed a second series of experiments where the duration of the 2 light pulses was varied from 4 to 60 min each with a fixed duration of the stimulus (4 h). The response to 2 light pulses saturates when they are between 30 and 60 min long. In conclusion, double pulses replace single full light pulses of a corresponding duration of up to 6 h due to a response reduction during light, combined with response restoration during darkness. By the combined response reduction and response restoration, mice can maintain stable entrainment to the external LID cycle without being continuously exposed to it...|$|R
