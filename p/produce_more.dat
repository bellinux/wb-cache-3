5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> of both goods.|$|E
5|$|Moderately {{emissions}} intensive {{activities are}} those that <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> than 800 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per million dollars of revenue. Highly emissions intensive activities {{are those that}} <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> than 1600 tonnes per million dollars of revenue.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{controversy}} concerning the widely reported imbalance of the game, as the rules strongly favor the king, {{although there are}} several rule modifications that can <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> balanced play, such as a weaponless king (the king cannot participate in captures), escape to the corners (rather than to the edges), or hostile attacker camps (the king and defenders may be captured against a vacant attacker camp square). Schmittberger (1992) even reveals some workarounds to <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> balanced play without modifying the rules of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} powerplants. The He 111 was {{equipped}} with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked powerplants that could <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> than 600 hp. Engines of suitable quality were kept for military use, frustrating German airline Luft Hansa and forcing it {{to rely on the}} BMW VI or 132s.|$|E

50|$|The fourth moment method <b>produces</b> <b>more</b> {{localized}} virtual orbitals than Foster-Boys method, {{since it}} implies a larger penalty on the delocalized tails.

5|$|Although sodium is less {{reactive}} than potassium, {{this process}} works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and {{can easily be}} distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E
5|$|Among insects, {{so-called}} killer bees were accidentally {{created during}} {{an attempt to}} breed a strain of bees that would both <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions. It was done by crossing a European honey bee and an African bee.|$|E
5|$|Aston Martin Racing {{adapted the}} DB9 for sports car racing, {{producing}} the DBR9 for FIA GT1 and the DBRS9 for FIA GT3. These two cars are lightened DB9s; the interior features are removed and the aluminium body panels {{are replaced by}} carbon fibre panels. Additionally, the engine has been tweaked in both the cars to <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> horsepower.|$|E

5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds. A complementing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> water vapour in the upper atmosphere. Methane concentrations {{have more than doubled}} in the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Firewatch {{runs on the}} Unity game engine. Ng {{disapproved of}} the tools for {{creating}} trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of trees that would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader was also employed to <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> stylized and simplified foliage. The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt was unsatisfactory.|$|E

5|$|Gryllus firmus {{exhibits}} wing polymorphism; {{some individuals}} have fully functional, long hind wings {{and others have}} short wings and cannot fly. The short-winged females have smaller flight muscles, greater ovarian development, and <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{encouraged}} local {{industry to}} design and build trainers for the RAAF and <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated combat aircraft under licence from overseas manufacturers. This led to the Winjeel basic trainer and Australian industry co-partnership in production of the CAC Sabre and Canberra jets; such local participation has continued to figure in major RAAF aircraft acquisitions.|$|E
