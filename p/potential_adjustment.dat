40|$|Abstract — During ashing process, resist {{has been}} {{intuitively}} {{regarded as a}} protection layer and deliberately removed in previous studies by wet process prior to plasma exposure {{in an effort to}} amplify the damage effect. Recently, we found instead that resist does not simply act as a protection layer. This newly observed phenomenon cannot be explained by the well-known electron shading effect which should not affect the area-intensive antenna structure used in our study. In this letter, we hypothesize that this resist-related charging damage is de-termined by the plasma <b>potential</b> <b>adjustment</b> difference between those devices with and without resist overlayer. The experimental results show a good correlation with our explanation. To be specific, severe antenna area ratio (ARR) dependent degradation of thin gate oxide is induced during the initial ashing stage while the resist is still on the electrodes, not during the overashing period.

Common examples are voltage supply adjustments, adjustable links and screws, and shims. This paper presents methods to determine the increased performance and robustness that can be achieved through including different possible manufacturing adjustments. All possible potential tuning adjustments that exist in a design are identified. Given this, the tuning variable model can be used to calculate the reduced product variation achievable when using any of the potential tuning adjustments, including none at all. This process can be used to help select which variables in a design should be adjusted, based on the increased robustness to noise and the increased difficulty in manufacture. Doing so can allow for more robust product performance at reduced manufacturing expense, by allowing <b>potential</b> <b>adjustment</b> on many different possible variabl [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Arc and glow {{discharges}} {{are defined}} {{based on their}} cathode processes. Arcs are characterized by collective electron emission, which can be stationary with hot cathodes (thermionic arcs), or non-stationary with cold cathodes (cathodic arcs). A brief review on cathodic arc properties serves {{as the starting point}} to better understand arcing phenomena in sputtering. Although arcing occurs in both metal and reactive sputtering, it is more of an issue in the reactive case. Arcing occurs if sufficiently high field strength leads to thermal runaway of an electron emission site. The role of insulating layers and surface <b>potential</b> <b>adjustment</b> through current leakage is highlighted. In the situation of magnetron sputtering with ''racetrack'', the need for a model with two spatial dimensions is shown. In many cases, arcing is initiated by breakdown of dielectric layers and inclusions.

40|$|Global {{external}} imbalances widened persistently {{over the}} last several years and have narrowed abruptly over the course of the financial crisis. Understanding the extent to which structural or cyclical factors may have driven these patterns is important to assess the likely evolution of global imbalances going forward, as well as the <b>potential</b> <b>adjustment</b> that can be achieved through changes in policy. This paper assesses the link between structural and cyclical factors and current-account balances using a panel of 94 countries from 1973 to 2008. We find that the medium-term evolution of global external imbalances can be related in large part to structural factors including cross-country differences in demographics, fiscal deficits, oil dependency and intensity, stage of economic development, financial market development, and institutional quality. Part of the narrowing in current-account balances since the financial crisis appears to be related to various cyclical factors including changes in output growth, oil prices, and exchange rates, and may be expected to reverse alongside the economic recovery...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid Permanent Magnet Quadrupoles {{are used}} in several {{applications}} for the Fermilab Recycler Ring and associated beam transfer lines. Most of these magnets use a 0. 6096 m long iron shell and provide integrated gradients up to 1. 4 T-m/m with an iron pole tip radius of 41. 6 mm. A 58. 4 mm pole radius design is also required. Bricks of 25. 4 mm thick strontium ferrite supply the flux {{to the back of}} the pole to produce the desired gradients (0. 6 to 2. 75 T/m). For temperature compensation, Ni-Fe alloy strips are interspersed between ferrite bricks to subtract flux in a temperature dependent fashion. Adjustments of the permeance of each pole using iron between the pole and the flux return shell permits the matching of pole potentials. Magnetic potentials of the poles are adjusted to the desired value to achieve the prescribed strength and field uniformity based on rotating coil harmonic measurements.

Assuming ‘immediate ’ complete elimination of all tariffs on imports from the EU, {{there is a small}} welfare loss (- 0. 17 % of 2002 GDP) unless we include potential production gains (generating a welfare gain of 0. 06 % of GDP).

However, <b>potential</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs are much greater than these low welfare effects suggest: tariff revenue will fall by 33 - 52 % of 2002 levels, domestic (non-export) production will decline by almost a quarter and direct employment by 12 % (about 11, 000 jobs lost overall).

To understand the <b>potential</b> <b>adjustments</b> made to overcome limb loss, we compared the gait mechanics, or footfall patterns, between one healthy and one hindlimb-amputee German Shepherd across various speeds. Data was collected using high-speed video, which was used to determine the differences in contact times, duty factors, and cycle frequencies between the animals. Preliminary results suggest that the amputee dog uses fewer gaits than the healthy dog for a wider range of speeds, rather than changing its footfall pattern as speed changes. This knowledge provides us with a foundation for understanding the compensatory changes made by amputee dogs and can be applied in the fields of prosthetics, rehabilitation, or injury-prevention...|$|R
