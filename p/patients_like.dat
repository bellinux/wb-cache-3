5|$|Inspired by German and American examples, he {{successfully}} {{asked the}} council to construct a system of villas at Bexley, advocated the separate treatment of acute and chronic cases, and introduced parole-style rewards for 'industrious' <b>patients.</b> <b>Like</b> some of his earlier administrative innovations, villas became popular and inspired similar designs elsewhere. Stansfield also served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I, and as a consultant on nervous diseases to the Eastern Command. Although he was appointed a CBE in 1919 for his war work, historians have drawn attention to his scepticism about shell shock, his attitudes towards eugenics and heredity, and his potentially misogynistic views about medical officers marrying. He nonetheless married twice, settling with his first wife at a house in Wimbledon where he enjoyed tending to the gardens; after her death, he married a second time in 1929 {{and moved to a}} villa in Sanremo, Italy, where he lived out his retirement.|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately, {{the claims}} {{procedure}} laws {{are not always}} followed, [...] {{in part because the}} only recourse set forth by these laws for failure to provide such an appeal process is the right for the patient to consider the appeals process to be exhausted and bring a Civil action under ERISA. [...] Such an action might in theory be applied for <b>patients</b> <b>like</b> Calad if the patient had a lawyer prepared to file an emergency [...] ex parte [...] Motion [...] for a [...] Temporary restraining order [...] in US District Court, [...] perhaps even by phone to a [...] Magistrate, [...] to compel the Utilization review nurse to approve treatment to protect the patient from imminent danger to life or health that might occur from discharging the patient against medical advice.|$|E

60|$|He {{had never}} had a holiday before, and Mr. Froggatt rivalled his {{guardian}} in his desire that it should not be too short. The first call was by appointment on the doctor. He was not used to have <b>patients</b> <b>like</b> Theodore brought by youths of Felix's age, and was touched by the care and tenderness of the young man, as he tried to overcome the alarm that was rendering the little one impracticable, when it was desirable to exhibit his slender store of accomplishments. His nearest approach to his natural state was when perched on his brother's knee, {{with his back to the}} strange faces, listening as Felix whistled the tunes he loved best.|$|E
6000|$|Six {{years passed}} after this battle, and Dr. Brown was {{a medical student}} and a clerk at Minto Hospital. How he renewed his {{acquaintance}} there, and in what sad circumstances, with Rab and his friends, it is superfluous to tell, for every one who reads at all has read that story, and most readers not without tears. As a medical student in Edinburgh, Dr. Brown made the friendship of Mr. Syme, the famous surgeon--a friendship only closed by death. I only saw them once together, {{a very long time}} ago, and then {{from the point of view}} of a patient. These occasions are not agreeable, and <b>patients,</b> <b>like</b> the old cock which did not crow when plucked, are apt to be [...] "very much absorbed"; but Dr. Brown's attitude toward the man whom he regarded with the reverence of a disciple, as well as with the affection of a friend, was very remarkable.|$|E

30|$|Objectives: Adhesions are a {{well known}} {{complication}} of every abdominal operative procedure in gynaecology. Adhesions do not only cause an economic {{burden on the}} general health system but may also imply negative side effects in every individual <b>patient</b> <b>like</b> infertility, bowel obstruction, pelvic pain and difficult re-entry.

50|$|Somnolence is a symptom, so the {{treatment}} {{will depend on}} its cause.
