50|$|The Housing Finance Act 1972 {{also brought}} {{fundamental}} changes to rent legislation.

This was to be done by making <b>provisional</b> <b>assessments</b> of fair rents for their properties. These assessments had to be submitted to a rent scrutiny board that could confirm them or substitute different rents. These provisions were repealed in 1976. Dwellings owned by housing associations and housing trusts (usually charities), which were registered with the Housing Corporation (but not those that were registered societies under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965) were brought within the fair rent system. From 1 January 1973, their rents were to be determined by Rent Officers and registered in a separate part of the Rent Register. New subsidies were introduced for housing associations and housing trusts registered with the Housing Corporation.|$|R
30|$|This {{issue of}} Poiesis & Praxis will give—by means of its recent “Forum” section—opportunity {{to a broader}} and {{enhanced}} debate about new and emerging fields of research, thus contributing to early assessments and ethical evaluation of recent developments in science and technology. Nevertheless, “early warnings” in this field—although favorable—basically suffer from still poor knowledge on corresponding evolving developments and on their chances and risks to the society.

40|$|The 1995 – 96 cereal {{harvest in}} the Southern African Development Community (SADC) {{is the best}} within the last ten years. <b>Provisional</b> <b>assessments</b> project a {{regional}} maize surplus of 2. 08 million tons, a 72 % increase in production over the previous year’s harvest. Overall cereal production substantially increased in all countries except Tanzania, where the current cereal forecast of 3. 73 million tons is a 14 % drop from last year’s output of 4. 34 million tons.

Although all the SADC states harvested a normal to above-normal crop, only Zimbabwe, Zambia, and South Africa have the capacity to export. The other countries need to import grain from these three to augment strategic grain reserves, especially maize. Anticipated opening stocks for the 1996 – 97 marketing year are critically low despite the optimistic cereal supply expectations for the year.

40|$|The Max Rubner-Institute (MRI) has {{discovered}} increased findings of vacuum-packed meat contaminated with psychrophilic (growth in cold temperatures) bacteria. The meat is spoiled before the best-before date. Typical signs {{of this are}} bloated packaging and bad odour stemming from the meat. This {{is caused by the}} bacterium Clostridium estertheticum which has contaminated the meat. Beef is most commonly affected, but lamb and venison are also affected. Meat that exhibits such sensory changes is unfit for human consumption, yet a potential health hazard for consumers is unlikely according to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). Due to insufficient data on the bacterium, BfR can only provide a <b>provisional</b> risk <b>assessment</b> of Clostridium estertheticum. Research literature includes no indication of health risk for humans through the ingestion of the bacterium. The bacterium is not considered disease-causing and was therefore classified in the lowest risk group by the Committee for Biological Agents (ABAS). Many species of clostridia occur everywhere in the environment. It is assumed that C. estertheticum is transmitted to the carcass during evisceration and skinning. In contrast to other spoiling agents, these bacteria multiply preferably at temperatures between - 1. 5 to 16 degrees Celsius. They then produce gases that lead to a distension of vacuum packages.

40|$|The Shinmoe-dake volcano in {{southwest}} Japan, which produced its first major eruption in 52 yr on 26 January 2011 {{but had been}} quiescent since 1 March, re-erupted on 13 March. It was only {{two days after the}} occurrence of the M = 9. 0 Tohoku-oki earthquake in eastern Japan. The coincidence of the two events {{raises the question of whether}} the earthquake triggered the volcanic activity. As a <b>provisional</b> but rapid <b>assessment</b> of this question, we examined high-resolution strain data at a site located 18 km from Shinmoe-dake. In terms of the Tohoku-oki earthquake, three points can be drawn from the strain data: (1) static strain changes were less than 0. 05 × 10 &minus; 6 , which is too small to trigger an eruption; (2) the amplitudes of dynamic strain changes are on the order of 10 &minus; 6 , which may trigger seismicity or volcanic eruption; and (3) strain rates were not accelerated, which indicates no significant change in magma pressure. Comparing these results with reports of other eruptions coincident with seismic events, and considering a scenario in which a seismic event triggered an eruption, we tentatively conclude that the eruption on 13 March was not a triggered event. However, this conclusion may be revised after analyzing seismic data...|$|R

40|$|Do laws ever {{deepen the}} crime risks facing {{managers}} and auditors? According {{to the literature}} and drawing upon several research traditions—actuarial, opportunity reduction and sectoral vulnerability studies—a <b>provisional</b> approach to <b>assessment</b> is developed and applied. Some headline risk concepts are: incoherence or lack of clarity of legalisation; potential for opening up opportunities for illegal acts by market participants; {{and the extent to}} which legislation might or might not signal to exposed persons that opportunities exist. This approach is deployed briefly in relation to EC directives on business transparency and auditing and, in more detail, in relation to the Enron debacle. The latter very clearly shows how changes in regulation in two distinct sectors, the energy market and securities (financial instruments), produced an excrescence of risk. Whilst some risks may come from regulation/de-regulation that is intended to directly apply to specific roles (e. g., auditing), other risks come from regulation/de-regulation in adjacent policy areas. Assessment has both to cast its net wide and to drill down to detail, looking for risks in the nooks and crannies of economic practices. In reaching such assessments, it would be most appropriate to ask traders, compliance persons, enforcement agents and jurists how they would understand the provisions of and risks implied by legislative proposals. Whilst officials can steer that process, it seems questionable whether the actual authors of legislative proposals should be asked to critically assess those same proposals, so “Chinese Walls” may be required within the European Commission. Finally, there are questions of the limits to assessment in cases when details of implementation have yet to supplied by future measures. EC Regulations, which do not rely upon transposition into national laws, may be easer to assess than Directives...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this audit {{was to examine the}} effectiveness of the Australian Government Reconstruction Inspectorate, supported by the National Disaster Recovery Taskforce, in providing assurance that value for money is being achieved in respect to Queensland reconstruction projects. Overall conclusion The flooding that occurred in Queensland during {{the spring and summer of}} 2010 – 11 was widespread. Reconstruction was expected to be expensive, with the latest (February 2013) data available estimating the cost of the resulting damage to be more than $ 7 billion. A significant proportion of reconstruction expenditure is expected to be paid for through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA), which provide for the Australian Government to meet up to 75 per cent of the cost of reconstruction. Value for money review processes were an important element of the additional oversight and accountability mechanisms introduced, given the significant financial assistance that was expected to be provided to Queensland under NDRRA. In this respect, a reasonable start has been made on the Inspectorate’s planned program of 129 project reviews, with 81 projects selected for review and 70 Tier One reviews 8 completed by the Taskforce as at the end of March 2013. However, many of the completed reviews are <b>provisional</b> <b>assessments</b> based on early project estimates, and further assessment will be required once tender results and project progress reports are available and/or projects are completed. In addition, progress with the reviews has been slower than planned (as the aim had been to select the projects and complete all 129 reviews by 31 December 2012). This situation reflects some delays with the delivery of the reconstruction program by state and local government agencies, challenges that have been experienced by the Taskforce in obtaining and analysing project information, as well as some shortcomings in the Taskforce’s sampling procedures. The purpose of the value for money project assessments was to compile a representative sample that could be used to make judgements about the reconstruction program as a whole. Reporting by QRA and the Inspectorate has outlined that there has been significant reconstruction progress but the project level information obtained by the Taskforce has indicated delays across the reconstruction program. Queensland has been granted a 12 month extension to the allowable period under NDRRA in which to complete reconstruction work. There has also been little in the way of project progress reports provided to the Taskforce to enable it to monitor the delivery of the individual projects it has sampled. In these circumstances, and given the situation with the planned program of project reviews, it is too early to reliably extrapolate the findings to the reconstruction program. Notwithstanding this situation, it is evident that, for a relatively modest investment given the expected cost to the Australian Government of reconstruction activity, the establishment of the Inspectorate with the support of the Taskforce to conduct value for money reviews has been effective in providing the Australian Government with greater visibility and more timely assurance concerning reconstruction expenditure than would have occurred under NDRRA. This is because NDRRA generally operates on a reimbursement basis, with the Australian Government having little oversight of reconstruction as it occurs as there is no reporting from the states until such time as they seek reimbursement, which is commonly some years after the disasters occur. In addition, limited Australian Government oversight at the conclusion of reconstruction is afforded by the audited claims submitted by states and territories, with no project level information provided in these claims. In this context, the experience to date of the project level scrutiny provided by the Inspectorate and the Taskforce (which have identified potential reductions in NDRRA claims from Queensland totalling more than $ 100 million) is likely to be beneficial in informing the approach adopted by Emergency Management Australia in its ongoing administration of NDRRA in respect to natural disasters that occur in other states and territories. It also underlines for other Commonwealth agencies the potential benefits of closely considering arrangements for assuring information provided by the states and territories, where this information determines the amount of Commonwealth payments. In addition to providing greater insights into the nature and estimated cost of reconstruction work, the Inspectorate’s value for money reviews have identified issues concerning the eligibility of estimated expenditure in a number of the projects that have been examined. In this respect, in July 2012 a process was agreed on the actions to be taken where the Inspectorate determines that a project does not represent value for money. Specifically, the Inspectorate may recommend to the Attorney-General that the Commonwealth’s reimbursement under NDRRA reflect the likely cost of the project had value for money been achieved, rather than the actual project costs incurred. As at the time of completing the audit fieldwork, there have been no projects that the Inspectorate has determined do not represent value for money although, for a number of projects, the Inspectorate has written to QRA identifying items of estimated expenditure that it considered should not be claimed under NDRRA. In addition, in March 2013 the Inspectorate wrote to QRA, the Auditor-General of Queensland, and EMA recommending that the state not be reimbursed for profit margins in respect to reconstruction projects undertaken by RoadTek, a state government entity. To increase the benefits that are derived from the program of value for money reviews, the ANAO has made four recommendations. The first two recommendations are aimed at the Taskforce obtaining information that allows the project reviews to examine the scope and cost of works actually being delivered (rather than early estimates) and improvements to the application of the sampling approach to make it more representative of the reconstruction program. The remaining two recommendations relate, respectively, to improvements in the approach taken by the Taskforce to: scrutinising the cost of delivering reconstruction projects; and stronger oversight of the timeliness of the delivery of reconstruction work...|$|R
40|$|A review of: Line, Maurice B. "The Information Uses and Needs of Social Scientists: An Overview of INFROSS. " Aslib Proceedings 23. 8 (1971) : 412 - 34. Rpt. in Lines of Thought: Selected Papers. Ed. L. J. Anthony. London: Bingley, 1988. 45 - 66. Objective - The study {{reported}} in this article was conceived in order {{to answer a question}} of very large scope: What are the information systems and services requirements of social scientists? Inherent in this question was the correlative question: How do social scientists tend to use such systems and services, and what resources and information access approaches do they by choice employ? The choice for such an approach was well-considered, given that 1) there were at the time almost no research results available in this area; 2) the investigators feared that approaches developed earlier for the natural sciences and technology would be uncritically adopted for the social sciences as well; and 3) "the social science information system was developing anyway, and if it was to develop in appropriate ways, some guidance had to be provided quickly" (412). The Investigation into Information Requirements of the Social Sciences (INFROSS) project team believed that there was "no point" (412) in embarking first on a series of more narrowly focused studies. The express intention was to derive findings that would be usable "for the improvement of information systems, or for the design of new ones" (414). For more on the project's conceptual underpinnings, see Line’s "Information Requirements. " Design - Exploratory study employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches over a period of three and a half years, beginning in the autumn of 1967. Setting - The whole of the United Kingdom. The project was funded by that country’s Office for Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), which had been established in 1965. Subjects - Almost 1, 100 randomly selected academic social science researchers, plus a substantial number of government social science researchers and social science "practitioners" ("college of education lecturers, schoolteachers, and individuals in social work and welfare" [413]). For the purposes of the study, the social sciences included anthropology, economics, education, geography, political science, psychology and sociology, but numerous historians and statisticians ultimately participated. Methods - Three methods were employed: surveys, interviews, and direct observation. A "very long" (413) questionnaire was sent to 2, 602 of the identified ca. 9, 100 social science researchers in the United Kingdom, with 1, 089 (41. 8 %) completed questionnaires returned. Two pilots were conducted with the questionnaire before a definitive version was finalized for the study. Seventy-five interviews were conducted (individually or in groups) with researchers, some of whom had received but not responded to the questionnaire, and some of whom {{were not included in the}} questionnaire sample. The interviews with non-responding persons in the sample were for purposes of determining "whether they were non-typical" (413). Fifty additional interviews were conducted (individually or in groups) with practitioners. Day-to-day observation of a small number of social scientists was undertaken in the context of a two and a half year-long experimental information service at Bath University - the first time any UK university had employed information officers for the social sciences. Main results - The results showed a pronounced perception among social scientists that informal "methods of locating references to relevant published information" (416 - 8, 426 - 7, 431) are more useful than formal methods (such as consulting the library catalogue, searching library shelves, or searching in indexing and abstracting publications), and an even more pronounced inclination to actually use such informal methods - something of a revelation at the time. Less than one sixth of all sociologists, for example, made use of Sociological Abstracts. On both counts, "consulting librarian" (418) scored worse than all the other ten options. Forty-eight percent of respondents never did it, and only 8 % perceived it as a "very useful" (418) method. Nonetheless, 88 % of respondents were in principle prepared to delegate at least some of their literature searching, and approximately 45 % all of it, "to a hypothetical information officer" (425). More than 75 % of the experimental service clients also responded affirmatively to the question: "Should a social science information officer be a high priority," given limited available resources? (Line, Cunningham, and Evans 73 - 5). Most subjects found, in any case, that their major "information problems" (427 - 8) lay not in discovering what relevant documents might exist, but rather in actually getting their hands on them. In only around 20 % of the cases were they ultimately successful in doing so. The younger the researcher, the greater the dissatisfaction with her/his own institution’s collection. This study also revealed that academic social scientists drew little distinction between information needs for their research and those for their teaching. There was one social science discipline which clearly stood out from the rest: psychology. Psychologists were the heaviest users of abstracting and indexing (A&I) publications, as well as of the journal literature, published conference proceedings, and research reports. They were also the least tolerant of time lags in the A&I services’ coverage of new publications. Further significant findings were: • A librarian’s way of categorizing research materials was not very meaningful to the researchers themselves. • A&I services were generally used more often for ‘keeping up’ than for retrospective searching. • Consultation with librarians was more common in the less scholarly and more intimate college environment than at research institutions. • A large percentage found library cataloguing insufficiently detailed. The same was true for book indexes. • There was considerable enthusiasm for the idea of a citation index for the social sciences. (N. B. : the SSCI began publication two years after the appearance of this article.) • Among informal methods of scholarly communication and information transfer, conferences (to the investigators’ surprise) rated remarkably low. • Researchers with large personal collections made more use of the library and its services than those with small collections. • Social scientists had little interest in non-English-language materials. Line speaks of "a serious foreign language problem" (424). The INFROSS study produced an enormous amount of data. Only 384 of the computer tables produced were made available in 4 separate reports to OSTI. Only 3 tables, 2 of which were abbreviated, appeared in this article. The further raw data were available on request. Conclusion - Line himself was exceedingly cautious in drawing explicit positive conclusions from the INFROSS results. He even stated that, "No major patterns were detected which could be of use for information system design purposes" (430).

He was, furthermore, prepared to go out on a limb with the following assertions and inferences: 1) It was a great strength of INFROSS that it had - in marked contrast to previous science user studies - generated "a mass of comparable [his italics] data within a very broad field, so that every finding can be related to other findings" (430). 2) There are discernable - and exploitable - differences in the information needs and use patterns among the different social science disciplines (which he often also refers to as the different "subjects"). 3) INFROSS had likewise made more evident the nature of similarities across disciplines. 4) There is indeed, from an information/library perspective, a continuum from the ‘harder’ to the ‘softer’ social sciences. 5) Social scientists showed too little awareness, made too little use, and even displayed "insufficient motivation" (431) to make use of available information systems/services. He elsewhere ("Secondary Services" 269, 272) characterizes them as "remarkably complacent," "even apathetic. " 6) There is good reason to doubt the wisdom of libraries’ investing in user education, since it is bound to have little effect (for further discussion of this matter, one can consult his "The Case for" 385 - 6 and "Ignoring the User" 86). 7) User-friendly systems amount inevitably to underdeveloped and ineffective systems - and therefore "personal intermediaries," in sufficient numbers, will remain essential if we wish to offer social scientists really good information services (426, 431). Line believed that INFROSS was only a beginning, and he had already, even before writing this article, begun follow-up research aimed at attaining results really of use for information system design purposes (e. g., the DISISS project). He complained many years later, however, that all this research "indicated means of improvement, but led to no action" ("Social Science Information" 131). In any case, "Bath" (the common shorthand subsequently used to refer to all this research) became, and has remained, the starting point for all subsequent discussions of social science information problems. Several years ago, there was a well-argued international call for "a new and updated version of the INFROSS study" - with an eye to finally using the findings for practical purposes, and aiming "to extend and follow up the research agenda set by the original study" (Janes "Time to Take") ...|$|R

40|$|Objective – The study {{reported}} in this article was conceived in order {{to answer a question}} of very large scope: What are the information systems and services requirements of social scientists? Inherent in this question was the correlative question: How do social scientists tend to use such systems and services, and what resources and information access approaches do they by choice employ? The choice for such an approach was well‐considered, given that 1) there were at the time almost no research results available in this area; 2) the investigators feared that approaches developed earlier for the natural sciences and technology would be uncritically adopted for the social sciences as well; and 3) “the social science information system was developing anyway, and if it was to develop in appropriate ways, some guidance had to be provided quickly” (412). The Investigation into Information Requirements of the Social Sciences (INFROSS) project team believed that there was “no point” (412) in embarking first on a series of more narrowly focused studies. The express intention was to derive findings that would be usable “for the improvement of information systems, or for the design of new ones” (414). For more on the project's conceptual underpinnings, see Line’s “Information Requirements. ” Design – Exploratory study employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches over a period of three and a half years, beginning in the autumn of 1967. Setting – The whole of the United Kingdom. The project was funded by that country’s Office for Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), which had been established in 1965. Subjects – Almost 1, 100 randomly selected academic social science researchers, plus a substantial number of government socialscience researchers and social science “practitioners” (“college of education lecturers, schoolteachers, and individuals in social work and welfare” [413]). For the purposes of the study, the social sciences included anthropology, economics, education, geography, political science, psychology and sociology, but numerous historians and statisticians ultimately participated. Methods – Three methods were employed: surveys, interviews, and direct observation. A “very long” (413) questionnaire was sent to 2, 602 of the identified ca. 9, 100 socialscience researchers in the United Kingdom, with 1, 089 (41. 8 %) completed questionnaires returned. Two pilots were conducted withthe questionnaire before a definitive version was finalized for the study. Seventy‐five interviews were conducted (individually orin groups) with researchers, some of whom had received but not responded to the questionnaire, and some of whom {{were not included in the}} questionnaire sample. The interviews with non‐responding persons in the sample were for purposes of determining “whether they were nontypical” (413). Fifty additional interviews were conducted (individually or in groups) with practitioners. Day‐to‐day observation of a small number of social scientists was undertaken in the context of a two and a half year‐long experimental information service at Bath University – the first time any UK university had employed information officers for the social sciences. Main results – The results showed a pronounced perception among social scientists that informal “methods of locating references to relevant published information” (416 ‐ 8, 426 ‐ 7, 431) are more useful than formal methods (such as consulting the library catalogue, searching library shelves, or searching in indexing andabstracting publications), and an even more pronounced inclination to actually use such informal methods – something of a revelation at the time. Less than one sixth of all sociologists, for example, made use of Sociological Abstracts. On both counts, “consulting librarian” (418) scored worse than all the other ten options. Forty‐eight percent of respondents never did it, and only 8 % perceived it as a “very useful” (418) method. Nonetheless, 88 % of respondents were in principle prepared to delegate at least some of their literature searching, and approximately 45 % all of it, “to a hypothetical information officer” (425). More than 75 % of the experimental service clients also responded affirmatively to thequestion: “Should a social science information officer be a high priority,” given limited available resources? (Line, Cunningham, and Evans 73 ‐ 5). Most subjects found, in any case, that their major “information problems” (427 ‐ 8) lay not in discovering what relevant documents might exist, but rather in actually getting their hands on them. In only around 20 % of the cases were they ultimately successful in doing so. The younger the researcher, the greater the dissatisfaction with her/his own institution’s collection. This study also revealed that academic social scientists drew little distinction between information needs for their research and those for their teaching. There was one social science discipline which clearly stood out from the rest: psychology. Psychologists were the heaviest users of abstracting and indexing (A&I) publications, as well as of the journal literature, published conference proceedings, and research reports. They were also the least tolerant of time lags in the A&I services’ coverage of new publications. Further significant findings were: A librarian’s way of categorizing research materials was not very meaningful to the researchers themselves. A&I services were generally used more often for ‘keeping up’ than for retrospective searching. Consultation with librarians was more common in the less scholarly and more intimate college environment than at research institutions. A large percentage found library cataloguing insufficiently detailed. The same was true for book indexes. There was considerable enthusiasm for the idea of a citation index for the social sciences. (N. B. : the SSCI began publication two years after the appearance of this article.) Among informal methods of scholarly communication and information transfer, conferences (to the investigators’ surprise) rated remarkably low. Researchers with large personal collections made more use of the library and its services than those with small collections. Social scientists had little interest in non‐English‐language materials. Line speaks of “a serious foreign language problem” (424). The INFROSS study produced an enormous amount of data. Only 384 of the computer tables produced were made available in 4 separate reports to OSTI. Only 3 tables, 2 of which were abbreviated, appeared in this article. The further raw data were available on request. Conclusion – Line himself was exceedingly cautious in drawing explicit positive conclusions from the INFROSS results. Heeven stated that, “No major patterns were detected which could be of use for information system design purposes” (430). He was freer with his negative and <b>provisional</b> <b>assessments.</b> Two years earlier he had written: “It still remains to be established that there is an information problem in the social sciences, or that, if there is, it is of any magnitude” (“Information Requirements” 3).
