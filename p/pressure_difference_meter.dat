40|$|In this report, {{measurements}} are described that were {{done on the}} wire cloths of a Fine Wire Heat Exchanger. This heat exchanger consists of a centrifugal fan and a circular set of wire-cloths that are surrounding the fan. The fan blows air along the wire cloths, that consists of copper wire woven on capillaries through which (warm or cold) water flows. The ratio between heat transfer and friction of this Fiwihex fan is so high, that i t becomes possible to heat {{a room with a}} temperature difference of only 5 °C between the water and the desired room temperature. Therefore, a Fiwihex can be used well in combination with other heat producing systems than a boiler, for example a solar panel, and heat storage in ground water. To gain more insight in the heat transfer and the friction of air that flows along such a wire cloth, measurements were done, in which the heat transfer coefficient, expressed as StPr 2 / 3, and the friction factor were measured. For these measurements two types of wire cloths were used, the distance between the capillaries was 8 or 12 mm. The heat transfer and the friction of the 8 mm wire cloths was measured at different mutual distances. A mass balance was used to measure the friction on a single object, but the influence of the wall seemed to be too large and to uncertain to use this kind of set-up. In further measurements the cloths were placed in a stack in a tube, the pressure was measured with a <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> <b>meter,</b> the heat transfer was measured by temperature sensors. The heat transfer per cloth seemed to be between 2 and 4 times higher than that of a flat plate with the same size. The heat transfer per cloth increased, with increasing mutual distance (from 0. 007 to 0. 011 m). The friction factor of the wire cloths was lower than what would be expected according to the theory.

We also examined leaves of these species for anatomical differences to determine whether this could explain differences in stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air vapour <b>pressure</b> <b>differences.</b> Finally, we conducted a split-root experiment {{with one of those}} species to look for interactions between xylem abscisic acid concentration, predawn water potential, leaf area to root mass ratio and stomatal responses to leaf-to-air vapour <b>pressure</b> <b>differences.</b> Stomatal conductance declined linearly with increasing leaf-to-air vapour <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> in all species. Leaves that expanded in the ‘dry’ season were more sensitive to leaf-to-air vapour <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> than those that had expanded in the ‘wet’ season. The value of leaf-to-air vapour <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> where 50 % of extrapolated maximum stomatal conductance would occur was 5. 5 kPa for wet season but only 3. 4 kPa for dry season leaves.

In the split-root experiment, a very mild water stress increased stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air vapour <b>pressure</b> <b>differences,</b> and stomatal conductivity declined linearly with decreasing predawn water potential. However, levels of ABA in the xylem did not change, and stomatal sensitivity to exogenous ABA did not change.

The relationship between interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> {{and risk of}} future cardiovascular disease is uncertain. We described the prevalence and risk factor correlates of interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) original and offspring cohorts and examined the association between interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> and incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Methods An increased interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> was defined as ≥ 10 mm Hg using the average of initial and repeat blood pressure measurements obtained in both arms. Participants were followed through 2010 for incident cardiovascular disease events. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to investigate the effect of interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> on incident cardiovascular disease. Results We examined 3390 (56. 3 % female) participants aged 40 years and older, free of cardiovascular disease at baseline, mean age of 61. 1 years, who attended a FHS examination between 1991 and 1994 (original cohort) and from 1995 to 1998 (offspring cohort). The mean absolute interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> was 4. 6 mm Hg (range 0 - 78). Increased interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> was present in 317 (9. 4 %) participants. The median follow-up time was 13. 3 years, during which time 598 participants (17. 6 %) experienced a first cardiovascular event, including 83 (26. 2 %) participants with interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> ≥ 10 mm Hg. Compared with those with normal interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference,</b> participants with an elevated interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> were older (63. 0 years vs 60. 9 years), had a greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus (13. 3 % vs 7. 5 %,), higher systolic blood pressure (136. 3 mm Hg vs 129. 3 mm Hg), and a higher total cholesterol level (212. 1 mg/dL vs 206. 5 mg/dL). Interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> {{was associated with a}} significantly increased hazard of incident cardiovascular events in the multivariable adjusted model (hazard ratio 1. 38; 95 % CI, 1. 09 - 1. 75). For each 1 -SD-unit increase in absolute interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference,</b> the hazard ratio for incident cardiovascular events was 1. 07 (95 % CI, 1. 00 - 1. 14) in the fully adjusted model. There was no such association with mortality (hazard ratio 1. 02; 95 % CI 0. 76 - 1. 38). Conclusions In this community-based cohort, an interarm systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> is common and associated with a significant increased risk for future cardiovascular events, even when the absolute difference in arm systolic blood pressure is modest.

30|$|It {{should be}} taken into account that, by {{analyzing}} the obtained results it was understood that, for the production rates less than 500, 200, 230, 50  STB/day for each case respectively, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> were not significant at all. This shows the significance of production rate at which for every depletion time and reservoir radius the <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> was insignificant. To put it another way, while the flow rates of each cases are under the boundary values, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> are less than critical and unimportant. To clarify the presented issue, the critical flow rates with variation of time and reservoir radius are determined by nodes in Figs.  7 and 8. As seen in Fig.  7, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> are highly significant for presented case 6 where the flow rates are higher than 50  STB/day. On the other side, there is no critical flow rate for case 3 regarding the smaller flow in compare with 500  STB/day index. Also, the indicated nodes on plotted curve of cases 4 and 5 show the range of flow rates at wellbore radius at which <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> are critical or not. The similar scenario was repeated in Fig.  8, in which the <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> were determined versus flow rates for 10 th and various radiuses. As observed from Fig.  8, the designated nodes on curves of cases 4 and 5 belonging to state A (wellbore radius) determine the border of critical pressure. Whereas, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> of cases 3 and 6 are unimportant and highly critical, respectively. As shown in Fig.  8, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> become unimportant for further distances. Hence, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> of other states (B–D) for each flow rates are normal and unimportant as radius is extended.|$|R
40|$|Air {{pressure}} {{conditions in}} typical Finnish residences are analysed {{using data from}} field measurements and computer simulations. Field measurements were conducted in three two-storey detached houses and in two five-storey apartment buildings. The effects of air tightness, ventilation performance, air leakage distributions, and outdoor environmental conditions on air pressure conditions in a detached house were simulated with a multi-zone simulation model using the IDA ICE simulation program. Despite of common design assumption, negative air <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> indoors, {{the results show that}} there is almost always a positive and negative air <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> across the building envelope in detached houses and apartment buildings. For detached houses, the design value of the air <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> across the building envelope for moisture convection analysis should be at least 10 Pa. In the most critical cases (airtight building envelope with unbalanced ventilation), the air <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> across the building envelope may rise up to 30 Pa. To control extremely high air <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> in airtight houses, balancing ventilation systems are very important. As in new low-energy houses the airtight building envelope and mechanical supply and exhaust ventilation become the standard solution; the interaction between HVAC systems and building envelope should be carefully designed. Practical application: Based on field measurements and computer simulations the design value of air <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> across the building envelope is determined for Finnish dwellings. Results underline the importance of balancing of ventilation in airtight house otherwise is not possible to control extremely high air <b>pressure</b> <b>differences.</b> If ventilation system should control the air <b>pressure</b> <b>difference,</b> building envelope should be airtight, because in normal and leaky houses (n 5044 1 /h) the differences in ventilation airflows are too small and they have only a minor influence on the air <b>pressure</b> <b>difference.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In summary, {{sustaining}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> that exerts the lift {{force on the}} airfoil surfaces requires sustaining a pattern of non-uniform pressure spread over a wide area around the airfoil. This requires maintaining <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> in both the vertical and horizontal directions, and thus requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed according to Bernoulli's principle. The <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> and the changes in flow direction and speed sustain {{each other in a}} mutual interaction. The <b>pressure</b> <b>differences</b> follow naturally from Newton's second law and {{from the fact that the}} flow along the surface naturally follows the predominantly downward-sloping contours of the airfoil.

50|$|The {{properties}} of the amplitude component that are applicable to the proximity effect are that the contribution to the <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> is small and independent of frequency.

As the source is brought closer to the directional microphone, the amplitude component of the <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> increases and becomes the dominant component at lower frequencies (recall that the phase component is relatively small at the low frequencies). At higher frequencies, the phase component of the <b>pressure</b> <b>difference</b> continues to dominate for all practical distances between source and microphone.|$|R
