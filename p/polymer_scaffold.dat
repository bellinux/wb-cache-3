In tissue engineering, biodegradable polymers can be designed such to approximate tissues, providing a <b>polymer</b> <b>scaffold</b> that can withstand mechanical stresses, provide a suitable surface for cell attachment and growth, and degrade at a rate that allows the load to be transferred to the new tissue.

Encapsulated cells are typically achieved through the generation of controlled-size droplets from a liquid cell suspension which are then rapidly solidified or gelated to provide added stability. The stabilization may be achieved through a change in temperature or via material crosslinking. The microenvironment that a cell sees changes upon encapsulation. It typically goes from being on a monolayer to a suspension in a <b>polymer</b> <b>scaffold</b> within a polymeric membrane. A drawback of the technique is that encapsulating a cell decreases its viability and ability to proliferate and differentiate. Further, after some time within the microcapsule, cells form clusters that inhibit the exchange of oxygen and metabolic waste, leading to apoptosis and necrosis thus limiting {{the efficacy of the}} cells and activating the host's immune system.Artificial cells have been successful for transplanting a number of cells including islets of Langerhans for diabetes treatment, parathyroid cells and adrenal cortex cells.|$|E
5000|$|Biodegradable {{polymers}} and biomaterials {{are also}} of significant interest for tissue engineering and regeneration. Tissue engineering {{is the ability}} to regenerate tissue with the help of artificial materials. The perfection of such systems can be used to grow tissues and cells in vitro or use a biodegradable scaffold to construct new structures and organs in vitro. For these uses, a biodegradable scaffold is obviously preferred as it reduces the risk of immunological reaction and rejection of the foreign object. While many of the more advanced systems are not ready for human therapeutics, there is significant positive research in animal studies. For example, it was possible to successfully grow rat smooth muscle tissue on a polycaprolactone/polylactide scaffold. Further research and development may allow for this technology to be used for tissue replacement, support, or enhancement in humans. One of the ultimate goals of tissue engineering is the creation of organs, such as the kidney, from basic constituents. A scaffolding is necessary to grow the entity into a functioning organ, after which the <b>polymer</b> <b>scaffold</b> would degrade and be safely eliminated from the body.

Three-dimensional poly(lactide- co -glycolide) scaffolds were fabricated by solvent casting/particulate leaching and incubated for 4 – 16 days in six variants of simulated body fluid whose IPs were varied by adjusting ionic concentrations. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated the formation of carbonated apatite with sub-micrometer sized crystals that grew into spherical globules extending out of the scaffold pore surfaces. As IP increased, more mineral grew on the scaffold pore surfaces, but the apatite became less crystalline and the Ca/P molar ratio decreased from 1. 63 ± 0. 005 to 1. 51 ± 0. 002.
