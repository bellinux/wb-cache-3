50|$|Input to {{the machine}} was {{performed}} {{in the form of}} <b>punched</b> paper <b>tape,</b> after experiments with punch cards proved unsatisfactory. The machine was controlled through a console which allowed programs to be stepped through one at a time, and featured CRT displays which showed the contents of registers. Output was through a standard teleprinter or to <b>punch</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early {{microcomputers}} generally used <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> {{for program}} storage, an expensive option. Computer consultant Jerry Ogdin conceived {{the use of}} audio tones on a cassette to replace the paper tapes. He took the idea to Les Solomon, editor of Popular Electronics magazine, who was similarly frustrated by <b>punched</b> <b>tapes.</b> In September 1975 the two co-authored {{an article on the}} HITS (Hobbyists' Interchange Tape System), using two tones to represent 1s and 0s. Soon after a number of manufacturers started using similar approaches, although each of these systems were incompatible.|$|R
50|$|The PDP-1 was {{supplied}} standard with 4096 {{words of}} core memory, 18-bits per word, and ran at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. It was constructed using many System Building Blocks that were packaged into several 19-inch racks. The racks were themselves packaged {{into a single}} large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lay at table-top height {{at one end of}} the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system's standard input/output solution, a <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two peripherals, the Type 30 vector graphics display, and a Soroban Engineering modified IBM Model B Electric typewriter that was used as a printer. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified Friden Flexowriter, which also contained its own <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including magnetic <b>tape</b> systems, <b>punched</b> card readers and punches, and faster <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> and printer systems.|$|R

50|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 33 was {{a machine that}} would fit into a small office space, match with other office equipment {{of the time and}} operate up to two hours per day on average. Since this machine was designed for light duty use, adjustments that Teletype made in previous teleprinters by turning screws were made by bending metal bars and levers. Many Model 33 parts were not heat treated and hardened. However, the base was die cast, but self-tapping screws were used, along with parts that snapped together without bolting. In another cost saving measure, the paper tape equipment was dependent on the keyboard and page printer mechanisms. Earlier Teletype machine designs, such as the Model 28 ASR, allowed the user to operate the keyboard to <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> while transmitting a previously <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> and to <b>punch</b> a <b>tape</b> while printing something else. Independent use of the paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> and reader is not possible with the Model 33 ASR.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1949 in Kent, Washington, United States by Philip Renshaw, {{the company}} was a leading {{manufacturer}} of <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> readers. In 1970 Tally developed line matrix printer technologies and became {{a leader in the}} printer industry.|$|R
50|$|The <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> served {{not only}} for data entry, but also as memory storage. The machine {{executed}} instructions in sequence, as it read them from the tape. It could perform four operations: addition, negation, greater than, and selection.|$|R
5000|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 28 was {{a machine that}} would run at 100 words-per-minute with less maintenance than that required by a contemporary teletypewriter running at 60 words-per-minute. Additional design criteria included the requirements to run quieter and be lighter than previous teleprinters. The Model 28 equipment was also designed to successfully operate in {{a wider range of}} temperatures and operate in moving vehicles. [...] The Model 28 equipment adjustments are made by turning screws and not by bending metal bars and levers as is done in the later Model 32 and Model 33 series of teleprinters. The Model 28 printing unit frame is lighter due to the use of stamped sheet metal instead of cast iron. The Model 28 ASR allowed the user to operate the keyboard to <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> while transmitting a previously <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> and to <b>punch</b> a <b>tape</b> while printing an incoming message.|$|R
5000|$|In the late-18th or early-19th century, as {{the results}} of Industrial Revolution, various {{automatic}} musical instruments were invented, for examples: music box, barrel organ and barrel piano using barrel / cylinder with pins or metal disc with punched holes; or mechanical organ, player piano and orchestrion using book music / music rolls (piano rolls) with punched holes, etc. These instruments were widely spread as the popular entertainment devices before the inventions of phonograph, radio, and sound film.Amongst of all, especially the <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> media had been long lived until the mid-20th century: earliest programmable music synthesizers including RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer in 1957, and Siemens Synthesizer in 1959, were also controlled via <b>punch</b> <b>tapes</b> similar to piano rolls.|$|R
50|$|Backing {{store was}} {{magnetic}} drum and optionally one-inch-, half-inch- or quarter-inch-wide magnetic tape. Input was from 80-column punched cards and optionally 160-column punched cards and <b>punched</b> paper <b>tape.</b> Output was to 80-column punched cards, line printer, and optionally to <b>punched</b> paper <b>tape.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Longevity. Although many {{magnetic}} tapes have deteriorated {{over time to}} the point that the data on them has been irretrievably lost, <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> can be read many decades later, if acid-free paper or Mylar film is used. Some paper can degrade rapidly.|$|R
5000|$|Unix-like {{operating}} systems {{are known to}} use it as [...] control character, i.e. to delete the previous character in the line mode. This, though, differs from its original function where this code replaced (physically) characters on a <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> to be deleted.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1950s {{through the}} 1970s, [...] "RTTY art" [...] {{was a popular}} on-air activity. This {{consisted}} of (sometimes very elaborate and artistic) pictures sent over rtty {{through the use of}} lengthy <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> transmissions and then printed by the receiving station on paper.|$|R
50|$|SKALA was {{the process}} {{computer}} for the RBMK nuclear reactor, as used at Chernobyl {{nuclear power plant}} prior to October 1995. It {{dates back to the}} 1960s; the machine uses magnetic core memory, magnetic tape data storage, and <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> for loading software at booting.|$|R
50|$|Sprockets {{are used}} in the film {{transport}} mechanisms of movie projectors and movie cameras. In this case, the sprocket wheels engage film perforations in the film stock. Sprocket feed was also used for <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> and is used for paper feed to some computer printers.|$|R
