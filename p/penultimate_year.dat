Thereafter, when he visited the Pondicherry Museum and saw more of {{the findings from the}} Arikamedu site, he was impressed and thought that he had found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the <b>penultimate</b> <b>year</b> of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that could establish its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest led him to the Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were trained on the site.|$|E

In the radio station's <b>penultimate</b> <b>year</b> to March 1999, there were on average, per month, 571 radio telegrams, 533 radio telephone calls and 4,001 radio telex calls. In 1998, British Telecom Maritime Radio Services announced its planned closure of Portishead Radio. The long-range services (HF bands 3–30MHz) ceased at midnight on 31 August 1999. The short-range VHF maritime band services (156–174MHz) closed at 12:00 on Sunday 30 April 2000, and the medium-range services (MF maritime band 1.6–3.0MHz) at 12:00 on Friday 30 June. The station closed in April 2000. The Highbridge station has been demolished. Sedgemoor District Council adopted a local development plan in September 2004 that included the site of the receiving station for future housing development. Planning permission was granted in October 2007 for a development of 190houses and flats on the site and shortly afterwards the old radio station buildings were demolished.|$|E

Three hundred and four students {{who were in the}} final and <b>penultimate</b> <b>years</b> of graduation comprised the sample for the study. Six research questions were raised to direct the thrust of the study. Four sets of instruments were used.

The findings from this study indicated that student teachers were elated and had opportunity for professional growth as they practiced reflective teaching. However, they stated that teachers of partnership schools could not provide specific professional support to them during the practice period. Faculty’s perception of trainees’ activities during the practice period was that student teachers had more problems with the application of pedagogy than knowledge of subject matter while mentor teachers rated students’ general performance as very high. Student teachers enumerated the constraints they had to perform effectively during the teaching practicum, as intense pressure for time, inability of school authorities to provide required basic materials and non performance of the role of mentoring by staff of partnership schools...|$|R

The aim of our study {{was to assess the}} level of knowledge on preanalytical phase in population of biomedicine students through a cross-sectional survey. Materials and methods: A survey was sent to students on <b>penultimate</b> and final <b>year</b> of Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry – study of medical biochemistry (FPB), Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (FVM) and School of Medicine (SM), University of Zagreb, Croatia, using the web tool SurveyMonkey. Survey was composed of demographics and 14 statements regarding the preanalytical phase of laboratory testing. Comparison of frequencies and proportions of correct answers was done with Fisher’s exact test and test of comparison of proportions, respectively. Results: Study included 135 participants, median age 24 (23 - 40) years. Students from FPB had higher proportion of correct answers (86 %) compared to students from other biomedical faculties 62 %, P < 0. 001. Students from FPB were more conscious of the importance of specimen mixing (P = 0. 027), prevalence of preanalytical errors (P = 0. 001), impact of hemolysis (P = 0. 032) and lipemia interferences (P = 0. 010), proper choice of anticoagulants (P = 0. 001), transport conditions for ammonia sample (P < 0. 001) and order of draw during blood specimen collection (P < 0. 001), in comparison with students from SM and FVM.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes the}} implementation {{over several years}} of an alternative to ‘recipe-style’ laboratory practicals {{for a group of}} <b>penultimate</b> third <b>year</b> students studying applied chemistry as part of a four year BSc Nutraceuticals degree. The main objectives of the laboratory re-design are to better prepare students for the more independent final year research project which takes place in fourth year, and to integrate key employability skills into the curriculum. The approach retains many of the ‘tried and tested’ food chemistry experiments, but involves using a group peer-teaching methodology which aims to add value to the experience for the students. The anticipated added value includes: improving research skills through trouble-shooting and optimising experiments; academic writing skills through preparing teaching resources; oral communication and presentation skills through peer-teaching; and employability skills through group organising and planning. Student evaluation, focussing on a cohort of students’ perceptions of preparedness for final year projects and placements after the chemistry practicals in third year, and re-visiting the cohort following their final year projects and work placement, will be presented. Finally, the approach has seen several iterations, some of which were due to personal reflection and student feedback, and some enforced through increased class sizes and reduced class contact hours for practicals. The presentation will highlight how various technologies were successfully utilised to overcome some of the barriers to retaining the pedagogy, and consider how resource issues impact on student learning. For the benefit of practitioners, assessment and feedback mechanisms will be discussed. Furthermore, insights into food analysis will be apparent, which may be of interest to those teaching general chemistry courses as a means to add context to chemistry practical work...|$|R

He poured forth during this period such an amount of {{learning}} on the subject, that when men took it up after the lapse of centuries they labelled it all as his philosophy. When he could no longer talk politics, nor act them--when the Forum was no longer open to him, nor the meetings of the people or of the Senate--when he could no longer make himself heard on behalf of the State--then he took to discussions on Carneades. And his discussions are wonderful. How could he lay his mind to work when his daughter was dead, and write in beautiful language four such treatises as came from his pen while he was thinking of the temple which was to be built to her memory? It is a marvel that at such a period, at such an age, he should have been equal to the labor. But it was thus that he amused himself, consoled himself, distracted himself. It is hard to believe that, in the sad evening of his life, such a power should have remained with him; but easier, I think, than to imagine that in that year of his life he had suddenly become philosophical.|$|E

Methods All <b>penultimate</b> and final <b>year</b> students at a large UK medical school were surveyed using the University IT system supplemented by personal approach. A 20 -item anonymous questionnaire was distributed and results were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 15. 0 (Chicago, Illinois, USA). Results Of the 630 clinical students surveyed, 77 responded with details {{of at least one}} near or actual operating theatre syncope (12 %). A statistically significant gender difference existed for syncopal/near-syncopal episodes (male 12 %; female 88 %), p Conclusion Our study shows that operating theatre related syncope among medical students is common, and we establish useful risk factors and practical steps that have been used to prevent its occurrence. Our study also highlights the detrimental effect of this on the career intentions of medical students interested in surgery. Based on these findings, we recommend that dedicated time should be set aside in surgical teaching to address this issue prior to students attending the operating theatre. </p...|$|R
