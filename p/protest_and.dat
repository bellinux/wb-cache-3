5|$|Approximately 15,000 people {{protested the}} fourth {{anniversary of the}} war (March 2007). For the fifth anniversary, the Iraq Body Count Exhibit placed red and white flags in the South Park Blocks, {{signifying}} who had died between the Americans and Iraqis. There was a large fifth-anniversary <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> parade against the Iraq war ("thousands of protesters", March 2008), and {{a high school student}} protest against the war was held in March 2008, with 400 protesters.|$|E
5|$|BLM {{generally}} {{engages in}} direct action tactics that make people uncomfortable {{enough that they}} must address the issue. BLM {{has been known to}} build power through <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> rallies. BLM has also staged die-ins and held one during the 2015 Twin Cities Marathon.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, about 1,000 people <b>protested</b> <b>and</b> {{blocked traffic}} as a {{response}} of the 2008 Tibetan anti-Chinese <b>protests,</b> <b>and</b> forced the temporary closure of the local Carrefour store.|$|R

5|$|In contrast, a Los Angeles Police Department {{officer at}} the Los Angeles protest was widely praised after a video was {{uploaded}} to YouTube showing him acknowledging the demonstrators' right to <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> encouraging them {{to stay on the}} sidewalk for their own safety.|$|E
5|$|King and the SCLC {{put into}} {{practice}} many {{of the principles of}} the Christian Left and applied the tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the method of <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> the places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.|$|E
5|$|The Birmingham {{campaign}} {{was a model}} of nonviolent direct action <b>protest</b> <b>and,</b> through the media, drew the world's attention to racial segregation in the South. It burnished King's reputation, ousted Connor from his job, forced desegregation in Birmingham, and directly {{paved the way for}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited racial discrimination in hiring practices and public services throughout the United States.|$|E

5|$|An {{occupation}} of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier <b>protest,</b> <b>and</b> took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently in any way he could.|$|E
5|$|At the 1967 Interzonal, held at Sousse, Tunisia, Fischer scored 8½ {{points in}} the first 10 games, to lead the field. His {{observance}} of the Worldwide Church of God's seventh-day Sabbath was honored by the organizers, but deprived Fischer of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute, causing Fischer to forfeit two games in <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> later withdraw, eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle. Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers were also a significant factor, since Fischer knew little French and the organizers had very limited English. No one in Tunisian chess had previous experience running an event of this stature.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1763 the Gosport {{has been}} paid off and Jervis {{remained}} unemployed until February 1769 when he {{was appointed to the}} 32-gun , the first coppered warship in the Royal Navy. He was tasked with delivering bullion to the English merchants in Genoa. During his time in Genoa two Turkish slaves escaped a Genoese galley and hid aboard one of Alarm boats. They were forcibly removed; Jervis made an official <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> promised retaliation if they were not handed over. The slaves were produced and Jervis took custody of them.|$|E

5|$|In the match, Zimbabwe batted first, and {{the public}} at the ground {{were not aware of}} the protest until the 22nd over, when Flower came out to bat wearing a black armband. Olonga was also seen wearing a black armband on the Zimbabwe team balcony. The crowd of 4,000 at the ground were {{supportive}} of the <b>protest,</b> <b>and</b> a number of them made their own black armbands during the match. In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs (D/L method).|$|E
5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request for removal of POI status—which entailed among other things {{sleeping}} wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E

5|$|Piłsudski's PPS, {{while not}} {{planning}} for a major uprising then and there, had a policy of supporting the <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> harassing Russian forces. The PPS, {{as well as other}} socialist organizations, such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL, were as surprised by the scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities; PPS forces in Łódź consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and a few dozen semi-enlisted workers. A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek never made it in time to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government.|$|E
5|$|Saturday (2005) is a {{novel by}} Ian McEwan set in Fitzrovia, London, on Saturday, 15 February 2003, as a large {{demonstration}} is taking place against the United States' 2003 invasion of Iraq. The protagonist, Henry Perowne, a 48-year-old neurosurgeon, has planned a series of chores and pleasures culminating in a family dinner in the evening. As he goes about his day, he ponders {{the meaning of the}} <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> the problems that inspired it; however, the day is disrupted by an encounter with a violent, troubled man.|$|E
5|$|The Collections {{include a}} unique proof sheet of 26 Revenue 1765 Newspaper and Pamphlet one penny {{impressions}} showing the registration certificate, {{held in the}} Board of Inland Revenue Stamping Department Archive. These were issued to apply the Stamp Act of 1765 intended to raise taxes to fund the defence of the American Colonies from the French. The tax applied to legal documents, licences, newspapers, pamphlets and almanacs in the American Colonies, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Florida, the Bahamas and the West Indian Islands. The taxes resulted in public <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> rioting. The tax was abandoned {{after a few months}} due to its unpopularity but the political damage contributed to the War of Independence in 1775.|$|E

5|$|The Irascibles or Irascible 18 {{were the}} labels {{given to a}} group of American {{abstract}} artists who put name to an open letter, written in 1950, to the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, rejecting the museum's exhibition American Painting Today - 1950 and boycotting the accompanying competition. The subsequent media coverage of the <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> a now iconic group photograph, that appeared in Life magazine, gave them notoriety, popularised the term Abstract Expressionist and established them as the so-called first generation of the putative movement.|$|E
5|$|The Tlaxcalan {{allies of}} the Spanish who {{accompanied}} them in their invasion of Guatemala wrote their own accounts of the conquest; these included {{a letter to the}} Spanish king protesting at their poor treatment once the campaign was over. Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to <b>protest</b> <b>and</b> register a claim for recompense. Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, which was probably painted in Ciudad Vieja in the 1530s, and the Lienzo de Tlaxcala, painted in Tlaxcala.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{arrangement of}} the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his opulent box; senators and equestrians watching from the advantageous seats reserved for them; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else packed in-between. The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites {{of social and political}} <b>protest,</b> <b>and</b> emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the Nika riots in the year 532, when troops under Justinian slaughtered thousands.|$|E
