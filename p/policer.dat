50|$|Ant colonies exhibit altruistic {{behavior}} {{through the}} suppression of selfish egg-laying behavior on behalf of worker ants by means of “policing;” this is accomplished either through aggression or through direct disposal of the eggs. In a study entitled Policing Effectiveness Depends on Relatedness and Group Size, researchers found the efficacy of colony policing to improve under conditions of decreased relatedness and decreased group size. The effectiveness of policing was shown to decrease {{in the presence of}} increase relatedness, because selfish behavior on behalf of kin increases the inclusive fitness of the policers, which presents a disincentive to intervene. The efficacy of policing is also influenced by the relative costs and benefits to the inclusive fitness of the actor engaging in policing behavior. In large colonies, there is less of an incentive to police selfish behavior because the costs associated with intervention outweigh the benefits to the inclusive fitness of the <b>policer.</b> Policing is therefore most likely to be effective in small colonies where there is low relatedness.|$|E

30|$|Hence, {{we propose}} {{in this work}} a new traffic {{policing}} mechanism, which is completely different from FSA-TB. This new mechanism, JIMC-P, {{is based on the}} Jaccard Index-Infused Markovian Clustering model presented in our recent work on screen mirroring traffic modeling in [15], i.e., it is a token bucket mechanism in which tokens are generated based on the JIMC model instead of being generated based on a mean rate. It should be emphasized that the high accuracy of the model (3 – 4 % prediction error on average for I-frames and P-frames) does not guarantee an equally good performance when the model is incorporated into the <b>policer.</b> For example, if the error is steadily caused by higher predictions, the <b>policer</b> will be too lenient against misbehaving users, whereas if the error is steadily caused by lower predictions, the <b>policer</b> will be too strict, leading to the unnecessary possible packet dropping. Hence, a thorough examination of the potential use of the model within the <b>policer</b> is important.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we will {{compare the}} {{performance}} of a fuzzy logic (FL) based <b>policer</b> with leaky bucket (LB) based <b>policer.</b> The FL based <b>policer</b> continuously computes the instantaneous drop-rate based on a collective evaluation of the compliance/violation level of the two parameters : (a) the ratio of the up-to-date mean burst length to the negotiated burst length, and (b) the ratio of the up-to-date mean bit rate to the negotiated mean bit rate. Compliance/violation of either of the two parameters results in an increase/decrease of the strength of the rules with consequence Pass/Drop. The throughput performance on policing mean bit rate and mean burst length of the FL based policers is compared with that based on LB based policers of different token pool sizes.
