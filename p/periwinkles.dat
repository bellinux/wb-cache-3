5|$|The {{waters of}} {{south-west}} Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks, Atlantic grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion {{in particular are}} recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins, and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins {{in the whole of}} the UK. River fish of note include char, eel, salmon, shad, sparling and Arctic char, whilst the Gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake. Wales is also known for its shellfish, including cockles, limpet, mussels and <b>periwinkles.</b> Herring, mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's seafish.|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of <b>periwinkle</b> shells, a small gastropod sea snail (mollusk), {{as a replacement}} of river gravel in concrete production was investigated. Physical and mechanical properties of the shells and well-graded river gravel were determined and compared. Concrete cubes were prepared using proportions of 1 : 0, 1 : 1, 1 : 3, 3 : 1 and 0 : 1 <b>periwinkle</b> shells to river gravel by weight, as coarse aggregate. Compressive strength tests were carried out on the <b>periwinkle</b> gravel concrete cubes. The bulk density of the <b>periwinkle</b> shells {{was found to be}} 515 kg/m 3 while that for river gravel was 1611 kg/m 3. The aggregate impact values for <b>periwinkle</b> shells and river gravel were 58. 59 % and 27. 1 % respectively. Concrete cubes with <b>periwinkle</b> shells alone as coarse aggregate were lighter and of lower compressive strengths compared to those with other periwinkle: gravel properties. The 28 -day density and compressive strength of <b>periwinkle</b> were 1944 kg/m 3 and 13. 05 N/mm 2 respectively. Density, workability and the compressive strength of <b>periwinkle</b> concrete increased with increasing inclusion of river gravel. From this study, it can be concluded that <b>periwinkle</b> shells can be used as partial replacement for river gravel in normal construction works especially in places where river gravel is in short supply and <b>periwinkle</b> shells are readily available...|$|R

60|$|Donkeys again. I know shy neighbourhoods {{where the}} Donkey goes {{in at the}} street door, and appears to live up-stairs, for I have {{examined}} the back-yard from over the palings, and {{have been unable to}} make him out. Gentility, nobility, Royalty, would appeal to that donkey in vain to do what he does for a costermonger. Feed him with oats at the highest price, put an infant prince and princess in a pair of panniers on his back, adjust his delicate trappings to a nicety, take him to the softest slopes at Windsor, and try what pace you can get out of him. Then, starve him, harness him anyhow to a truck with a flat tray on it, and see him bowl from Whitechapel to Bayswater. There appears to be no particular private understanding between birds and donkeys, in a state of nature; but in the shy neighbourhood state, you shall see them always in the same hands and always developing their very best energies for the very worst company. I have known a donkey--by sight; we were not on speaking terms--who lived over on the Surrey side of London-bridge, among the fastnesses of Jacob's Island and Dockhead. It was the habit of that animal, when his services were not in immediate requisition, to go out alone, idling. I have met him a mile from his place of residence, loitering about the streets; and the expression of his countenance at such times was most degraded. He was attached to the establishment of an elderly lady who sold <b>periwinkles,</b> and he used to stand on Saturday nights with a cartful of those delicacies outside a gin-shop, pricking up his ears when a customer came to the cart, and too evidently deriving satisfaction from the knowledge that they got bad measure. His mistress was sometimes overtaken by inebriety. The last time I ever saw him (about five years ago) he was in circumstances of difficulty, caused by this failing. Having been left alone with the cart of <b>periwinkles,</b> and forgotten, he went off idling. He prowled among his usual low haunts for some time, gratifying his depraved tastes, until, not taking the cart into his calculations, he endeavoured to turn up a narrow alley, and became greatly involved. He was taken into custody by the police, and, the Green Yard of the district being near at hand, was backed into that place of durance. At that crisis, I encountered him; the stubborn sense he evinced of being--not to compromise the expression--a blackguard, I never saw exceeded in the human subject. A flaring candle in a paper shade, stuck in among his <b>periwinkles,</b> showed him, with his ragged harness broken and his cart extensively shattered, twitching his mouth and shaking his hanging head, a picture of disgrace and obduracy. I have seen boys being taken to station-houses, who were as like him as his own brother.|$|E

A model hospital was erected, and each member had accepted an honorable post therein. The paternal P. was chaplain, the maternal P. was matron, and all the youthful P.s filled the pod of futurity with achievements whose brilliancy eclipsed the glories of the present and the past. Arriving at this satisfactory conclusion, the meeting adjourned, and the fact that Miss Tribulation was available as army nurse went abroad on the wings of the wind.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of asbestos-free automotive brake pad using <b>periwinkle</b> shell particles as frictional filler material is presented. This {{was with a}} view to exploiting the characteristics of the <b>periwinkle</b> shell, which is largely deposited as a waste, in replacing asbestos which {{has been found to be}} carcinogenic. Five sets of brake pads with different sieve size (710 – 125 μm) of <b>periwinkle</b> shell particles with 35 % resin were produced using compressive moulding. The physical, mechanical and tribological properties of the <b>periwinkle</b> shell particle-based brake pads were evaluated and compared with the values for the asbestos-based brake pads. The results obtained showed that compressive strength, hardness and density of the developed brake pad samples increased with decreasing the particle size of <b>periwinkle</b> shell from 710 to 125 μm, while the oil soak, water soak and wear rate decreased with decreasing the particle size of <b>periwinkle</b> shell. The results obtained at 125 μm of <b>periwinkle</b> shell particles compared favourably with that of commercial brake pad. The results of this research indicate that <b>periwinkle</b> shell particles can be effectively used as a replacement for asbestos in brake pad manufacture...|$|R

60|$|Next to his {{projects}} for the suppression of poverty may be classed those of William the Testy for increasing the wealth of New Amsterdam. Solomon of whose character for wisdom the little governor was somewhat emulous, had made gold and silver as plenty as the stones {{in the streets of}} Jerusalem. William Kieft could not pretend to vie with him as to the precious metals, but he determined, as an equivalent, to flood the streets of New Amsterdam with Indian money. This was nothing more nor less than strings of beads wrought out of clams, <b>periwinkles,</b> and other shell-fish, and called seawant or wampum. These had formed a native currency among the simple savages, who were content to take them of the Dutchmen in exchange for peltries. In an unlucky moment, William the Testy, seeing this money of easy production, conceived the project of making it the current coin of the province. It is true it had an intrinsic value among the Indians, who used it to ornament their robes and moccasins; but among the honest burghers it had no more intrinsic value than those rags which form the paper currency of modern days. This consideration, however, had no weight with William Kieft. He began by paying all the servants of the company and all the debts of government, in strings of wampum. He sent emissaries to sweep the shores of Long Island, which was the Ophir of this modern Solomon, and abounded in shell-fish. These were transported in loads to New Amsterdam, coined into Indian money, and launched into circulation.|$|E

Neutraceutical treatment of human diseases is gaining popularity; however comparatively few scientific studies support their routine use. This study compares the effects of <b>periwinkle</b> extract as a neutraceutical treatment to determine {{if it has a}} differential impact on cancerous and normal cell lines. <b>Periwinkle,</b> a flower currently used to help treat leukemia and lymphoma, is a prime candidate for study. An exploratory study was conducted to investigate <b>periwinkle’s</b> effect on growth rate and morphology for MCF- 7 human breast cancer and C 2 C 12 mouse myoblast cell lines. Initial studies showed a dose-dependent decrease of MCF- 7 viability as well as dramatic changes in cancer cell morphology; however <b>periwinkle’s</b> effects on normal cells is unknown. Ideally, <b>periwinkle</b> would differentially affect breast cancer but not normal cells. This ongoing study is investigating that question.
