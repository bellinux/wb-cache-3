40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe laparoscopic {{repair of}} a rare diaphragmatic Morgagni hernia using the reduced <b>port</b> <b>approach</b> is described. PRESENTATION OF CASEAn 85 -year-old female {{presented}} with a 2 days history of upper abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite. We diagnosed her condition as a Morgagni hernia by morphological studies and performed laparoscopic mesh placement with a multi-channel port and 12 -mm port. This elderly patient had a rapid postoperative recovery. A 2 -year follow-up CT showed no recurrence of the hernia. DISCUSSIONRecent trends in laparoscopic procedures have been toward minimizing the number of incisions to reduce invasiveness. This case indicated that the reduced <b>port</b> <b>approach</b> {{can be considered a}} suitable and safe procedure for treatment of Morgagni hernia.

5000|$|This was {{in stark}} {{contrast}} to the traditional view of submarine deployment up until then, in which the submarine was seen as a lone ambusher, waiting outside an enemy port to attack ships entering and leaving. This had been a very successful tactic used by British submarines in the Baltic and Bosporus during World War I, but it could not be successful if <b>port</b> <b>approaches</b> were well patrolled. There had also been naval theorists who held submarines should be attached to a fleet and used like destroyers; this had been tried by the Germans at Jutland with poor results, since underwater communications were in their infancy. (Interwar exercises had proven the idea faulty.) The Japanese also adhered to the idea of a fleet submarine, following the doctrine of Mahan, and never used their submarines either for close blockade or convoy interdiction. The submarine was still looked upon by much of the naval world as [...] "dishonourable", compared to the prestige attached to capital ships. This was true in Kriegsmarine as well; Raeder successfully lobbied for the money to be spent on capital ships instead.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of series of offshore bathymetric surveys provides {{insight into the}} morphodynamics of the sea floor. This knowledge helps to improve resurvey policies {{for the maintenance of}} <b>port</b> <b>approaches</b> and nautical charting, and to validate morphodynamic models. We propose a method for such an analysis that is based on statistical testing theory, particularly aimed at the detection of dynamics in areas with tidal sand waves. The method explicitly considers the uncertainty of every measured depth value, resulting in parameter estimates for the sea floor dynamics, and their uncertainty. We apply the method to sea floor representations both with and without a sand wave pattern. A test scenario is set up, consisting of a survey of an existing area in the Southern North Sea, for which dynamics are simulated. The results show that the proposed method successfully detects different types of sea floor dynamics, leading to satisfactory estimates of the corresponding parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|Vessel traffic {{services}} (VTS) are {{maritime traffic}} monitoring systems used in <b>port</b> <b>approaches,</b> confined or congested waters. VTS operators (VTSOs) monitor a specific geographical area and support and direct ships that sail through the area, primarily making the navigating officer or pilot of each ship {{aware of the}} current traffic situation, local weather and geographical conditions. We used an interactive mid-fidelity simulation as a knowledge eliciting tool to explore the work situation of VTSOs. During the simulation, VTSOs from a VTS centre in Sweden ran a scenario based on a normal traffic situation in their local fairway. Results indicate that the VTSOs, {{even though they are}} well aware of crucial events in the fairway, at times choose not to inform navigating officers or pilots of these safety aspects apart from when subject to protocol. The present paper put forward elements behind this form of miscommunication and presents results indicating that the major contributing factor is the VTSOs’ anticipation of negative attitudes between working groups participating in the VTS system and the lack of sufficient regulation with regard to the role and responsibilities of VTSOs...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the most important requirements and recommendations of international organizations for the area of LNG terminal under construction in ĝwinoujĞcie. These recommendations should be considered when planning safe traffic and manoeuvring of ships in <b>port</b> <b>approaches</b> to the Port of ĝwinoujĞcie and to the Outer Port of ĝwinoujĞcie. The approach area to the new terminal is located on shallow waters. Up to the present moment the fairway, anchorages and seamarks have been used by vessels of smaller size. After the construction of the new port with an LNG terminal it will handle the greatest LNG carriers. To ensure their safe entrance to the port, the fairway should be prepared with sufficient width and depth, with navigational aids. It is also necessary to prepare appropriate emergency anchorages and places where the vessels can return in case further voyage is dangerous. Additionally LNG cargo is very dangerous, because of this there is a compulsory to introduce of the highest safety standards, both {{in the design of the}} approach area and the application procedures for ships traffic. In particular, fairways and port canals, Under Keel Allowance, air draft, turning basin, vessel traffic services (VTS), traffic separation schemes (TSS), moving safety zone, and required speed limit are presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of paediatric {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (PIBD) has dramatically increased in the last 20 years. Although first reported in mid 1970 s', diagnostic laparoscopy has started to be routinely adopted in paediatric surgical practice since late 1990 s'. Minimally invasive surgery was first limited to diagnostic purposes. After 2002 it was also applied to the radical treatment of PIBD, either Crohn's disease (CD) or Ulcerative colitis. During the last decade minimally invasive approaches to PIBD have gained popularity and have recently became the "gold standard" {{for the treatment of}} such invalidating and troublesome chronic diseases. The authors describe and track the historical evolution of minimally invasive surgery for PIBD and address all available opportunities, including most recent advancements such as robotic surgery, single <b>port</b> <b>approaches</b> and minimally invasive treatment of perianal fistulising CD.

40|$|Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is a shore-side {{maritime}} assistance service that supports bridge teams in their safe navigation of <b>port</b> <b>approaches</b> {{and other areas}} that present navigational difficulties. The VTS is implemented in national waters and provides vessels with information through transmissions and broadcasts on Very High Frequency (VHF) radio. With a continued growth in the number, size and cargo volumes of merchant vessels, {{the role of the}} VTS has recently become a matter of discussion, and {{it has been argued that}} changes, such as implementing an aviation-like control system, would be of an enormous benefit for stakeholders and guarantee safe and efficient traffic movements in the future. The complexity of processes in safety-critical domains, such as maritime traffic management, is increasing due to continuing technical, organisational and environmental developments. The VTS is currently undergoing drastic changes, primarily driven by strategies and projects focusing on increasing the overall efficiency of the maritime transportation system through advanced technology. To reduce the risk of unforeseen consequences, it is important to study and understand the service and its contribution to traffic management before changes are implemented. The purpose of this thesis has been to increase the overall understanding of everyday performance of the VTS system and identify ways of modelling the performance of the service, as a contribution to the ongoing debate on the future needs of maritime traffic management. The VTS is described as socio-technical system that controls and manages maritime traffic in <b>port</b> <b>approaches</b> and other areas that pose navigational difficulties for bridge teams. Field data collected through semi-structured interviews, observations and focus groups have been analysed with the aid of concepts derived from Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE) and Resilience Engineering (RE) to understand how the VTS actively contributes to safety through monitoring, responding to and anticipating changes in traffic patterns in the VTS area. The data have also been used to model performance variability in everyday operation with the aid of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). Performance variability is necessary for a system to be adaptive, and is therefore essential for the system’s functioning. By using the FRAM, a new angle of the VTS system has been explored to understand how variability in its functional units affects the overall system performance. The thesis demonstrates the importance of understanding how performance in a socio-technical system can vary and the consequences this may have. The FRAM can be used to analyse the functional design of a socio-technical system, and therefore help to identify and assess ways in which performance variability can be monitored and managed. By understanding the functional design of the VTS system and the complexity of everyday operation, stakeholders will be able to identify advantages and disadvantages of current system design and use this to consider how future demands can best be met...|$|E

40|$|Modeling DSP {{applications}} through coarse-grain dataflow graphs {{is popular}} in the DSP design community, and a growing set of rapid prototyping tools support such dataflow semantics. Since different tools may be suitable for different phases or generations of a design, it is often desirable to migrate a dataflow-based application model from one prototyping tool to another. Two critical problems in transferring dataflow-based designs across different prototyping tools are {{the lack of a}} vendor-independent language for DSP-oriented dataflow graphs, and the lack of an efficient porting methodology. In our previous work, the dataflow interchange format (DIF) [5] has been developed as a standard language to specify mixed-grain dataflow models for DSP systems. This paper presents the augmentation of the DIF infrastructure with a systematic <b>porting</b> <b>approach</b> that integrates DIF tightly with the specific exporting and importing mechanisms that interface DIF to specific DSP design tools. In conjunction with this porting mechanism, this paper also introduces a novel language, called the actor interchange format (AIF), for transferring relevant information pertaining to DSP library components across different tools. Through a case study of a synthetic aperture radar application, we demonstrate the high degree of automation offered by our DIF-based <b>porting</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|R
40|$|NATO’s present {{capability}} {{to deal with}} a terrorist threat to our ports is slow, dangerous, and inefficient. Ports are a challenging area within which to conduct MCM operations due to several factors: shipping movements, very shallow water, turbidity, confined space, mine burial due to muddy/silty conditions, and high clutter density. The shortfall in NATO’s ability to deal with this problem has been recognised by NATO Strategic Commanders who gave the highest priority to MCM for Force Protection and Counter-Terrorism. Recent progress in underwater robotics has been aimed at developing small, rapidly deployable Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) to achieve a large spatial sampling for both acoustic and non-acoustic measurements. The vehicles that are now commercially available, have great potential to work in conjunction with existing MCM assets and have several advantages: significantly faster search rate, reduced danger to divers, rapid deployability, and ability to carry out surveys in confined areas. The NATO Undersea Research Centre studies the performance of AUVs equipped with COTS sensors and working in conjunction with conventional assets (Mine Hunters and divers) to carry out MCM operations in ports and <b>port</b> <b>approaches.</b> To measure the effectiveness of this new technology in comparison to current practice, several experiments have been conducted in the ports of La Spezia (Italy), Strenraer (Scotland), Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Olpenitz (Germany).

40|$|The rapid {{economic}} growth of Taiwan has been paralleled {{by an increase in}} marine. traffic in the port of Keelung. The increase has been evolutionary and, prior to this study, has lacked the benefit of supporting research necessary to ensure no loss in navigational efficiency. The study uses eclectic methodologies to: identify the nature of marine traffic at Keelung; assess the associated risks; and identify measures needed to reduce risk and increase navigational efficiency. For contextual purposes the study reviews current marine traffic operations at Keelung against the background of geographical constraint and environmental conditions. Radar survey and extensive sampling of professional opinion indicate that existent traffic control measures are both inadequate and open to contravention. Casualty analysis further identifies areas of concern where navigation risk has been shown to exist In particular the traffic separation scheme, introduced in 1990; has been found inadequate and lack of movement control reduces navigational efficiency. Use of visual simulators, at Taiwan Ocean University and University of Plymouth, provided a unique opportunity to compare present marine traffic operations against a modified model. The modified model incorporated limited vessel traffic service functions and channel markers, neither of which exist at present in the live situation. Most significantly the experiment has enabled evaluation of the difference between Taiwanese and foreign ship masters when handling ships in the <b>port</b> <b>approaches.</b> Analysis of ship's tracks, and subjects' perceptions, concludes that provision of channel markers and sequence control greatly simplifies the operation and reduces risk. The need to widen the traffic lanes by reducing the separation zone between inward and outward lanes is identified. The study shows that navigational safety and efficiency at Keelung can be improved through the introduction of small changes to operation and working practices, The study provides the basis for a programme of continuing work necessary to maintain or further improve standards once the recommendations of the study have been implemented.

40|$|Waterborne {{transport}} infrastructures play {{a crucial}} role in global integration, and ports are key components to materialise this amalgamation. However they are constantly challenged to keep fulfilling their functions in a changing environment. Port of Rotterdam, the largest port in Europe and the Western hemisphere too, faces those challenges on a daily basis. In order to maintain and enhance the future efficiency of the Harbour Industrial Complex, strategic adaptations based on long-term planning are required. This is more relevant on those existing port areas such as Europoort, where basic infrastructure is approaching the end of their life cycle, and fragmentation of original plots led to inefficient use of the land and some waterfront areas. In order to meet these needs, this study presents the application of Adaptive Port Planning framework (Taneja, 2013) to the existing Europoort Masterplan for increasing its robustness while ensuring that the port has the license-to-operate and the license-to-grow in the long-term.
