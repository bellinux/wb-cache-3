5|$|During the Spanish era Rondalya music, where {{traditional}} string orchestra mandolin type {{instruments were}} used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to {{any group of}} stringed instruments that are played using a <b>plectrum</b> or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a <b>plectrum,</b> which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
25|$|In the jack, a <b>plectrum</b> juts {{out almost}} {{horizontally}} (normally the <b>plectrum</b> is angled upwards a tiny amount) and passes {{just under the}} string. Historically, plectra were made of bird quill or leather; many modern harpsichords have plastic (delrin or celcon) plectra.|$|E
5000|$|... "Plectrum" [...] {{has both}} a Latin-based plural, <b>plectra</b> and a native English plural, <b>plectrums.</b> <b>Plectra</b> {{is used in}} formal writing, {{particularly}} in discussing the harpsichord {{as an instrument of}} classical music. However, <b>plectrums</b> is more common in ordinary speech. In vernacular speech the abbreviation pleck or plec is sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plectra</b> for the Japanese biwa and shamisen can {{be quite}} large, and those used for the Arabic oud are longer and narrower, {{replacing}} the formerly used eagle feather. <b>Plectra</b> used for Chinese instruments such as the sanxian were formerly made of animal horn, though many players today use plastic <b>plectra.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{historical}} period of harpsichord construction (up to about 1800) <b>plectra</b> {{were made of}} sturdy feather quills, usually from crows or ravens. In Italy, some makers (including Bartolomeo Cristofori) used vulture quills. Other Italian harpsichords employed <b>plectra</b> of leather. In late French harpsichords by the great builder Pascal Taskin, peau de buffle, a chamois-like material from the hide of the European bison, was used for <b>plectra</b> to produce a delicate pianissimo.|$|R
25|$|Entwistle's playing {{technique}} incorporated fingerstyle, <b>plectrum,</b> tapping, {{and the use}} of harmonics. He {{changed his}} style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from pick-up to the E string and occasionally even positioning his thumb near the pick-up. His <b>plectrum</b> technique involved holding the <b>plectrum</b> between his thumb and forefinger, {{with the rest of his}} fingers outstretched for balance.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} chordophones of the guitar family, the Colombian tiple {{can be played}} either by {{strumming}} with the fingers or with a <b>plectrum</b> {{or a combination of}} both.|$|E
25|$|While five-string banjos are {{traditionally}} played with either fingerpicks or the fingers themselves, tenor banjos and <b>plectrum</b> banjos are {{played with a}} pick, either to strum full chords or, most commonly in Irish Traditional Music, play single note melodies.|$|E
50|$|Fingerstyle players use {{up to four}} (rarely five) {{surfaces}} {{to strike}} string independently. However, that does not equate to four <b>plectrums,</b> since <b>plectrums</b> can more easily strike strings on both up and downstrokes—which {{is much more difficult}} for fingers.|$|R

40|$|The Pizzicato Energy Harvester (EH) {{introduced}} {{the technique of}} frequency up-conversion to piezoelectric EHs wearable on the lateral side of the knee-joint. The operation principle is to pluck the piezoelectric bimorphs with <b>plectra</b> so that they produce electrical energy during the ensuing mechanical vibrations. The device presented in this work is, in some ways, an evolution of the earlier Pizzicato: it is a significantly more compact and lighter device; the central hub holds 16 piezoelectric bimorphs shaped as trapezoids, which permits a sleek design and potentially increased energy output for the same bimorph area. <b>Plectra</b> were formed by Photochemical Machining of a 100 -μm-thick steel sheet. To avoid the risk of short-circuiting, the <b>plectra</b> were electrically passivated by sputtering a 100 nm layer of ZrO 2. Bench tests with the steel <b>plectra</b> showed a very large energy generation. Polyimide <b>plectra</b> were also manufactured with a cutting plotter from a 125 μm-thick film. Besides bench tests, a volunteer wore the device while walking on flat ground or climbing stairs, with a measured energy output of approximately 0. 8 mJ per step. Whereas most of the tests were performed by the traditional method of discharging the rectified output from the EH onto a resistive load, tests were performed also with a circuit offering a stabilised 3. 3 V supply. The circuit produced a stable 0. 1 mA supply during running gait with kapton <b>plectra...</b>|$|R
25|$|The prima balalaika, secunda and alto {{are played}} either with the fingers or a <b>plectrum</b> (pick), {{depending}} on the music being played, and the bass and contrabass (equipped with extension legs that rest on the floor) are played with leather plectra. The rare piccolo instrument is usually played with a pick.|$|E
25|$|The {{band that}} {{eventually}} became the Peninsula Banjo Band {{was formed by}} Chuck Ray, Sr. in 1963. Ray was a music teacher and local musician in the South Bay area. Ray could often be found performing with his <b>plectrum</b> banjo at the Shakey's Pizza and Big Al's pizza parlors in San Jose, California.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to using his home-made guitar {{he prefers to}} use coins (especially a sixpence from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic <b>plectrum,</b> {{on the basis that}} their rigidity gives him more control in playing. He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} part of balalaika technique {{is the use of}} the left thumb to fret notes on the lower string, particularly on the prima, where it is used to form chords. Traditionally, the side of the index finger of the right hand is used to sound notes on the prima, while a <b>plectrum</b> is used on the larger sizes.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of all-fifths tuning {{was used by}} jazz-guitarist Carl Kress. The bottom four strings are tuned in fifths and the top two strings tuned in thirds resulting in Bb-F-C-G-B-D. This results in tenor banjo formations on the bottom four strings and <b>plectrum</b> banjo formations on the top four strings. This tuning is also used by contemporary New York jazz-guitarist Marty Grosz.|$|E
25|$|The Ukrainian kobza was {{traditionally}} gut-strung, lute-like stringed {{musical instrument}} {{with a body}} hewn from a single block of wood. Instruments with a staved assembly also exist. The kobza has a medium length neck {{which may or may}} not have tied-on frets, which were usually made of gut. It was single-strung (sometimes also double-strung) and the strings were played with fingertips or occasionally with a <b>plectrum</b> threaded through a ring placed on the middle finger.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{contemporary}} builders and players [...] have reasserted {{the superiority of}} bird quill for high-level harpsichords. While the difference in sound between acetal and quill is acknowledged to be small, what difference may exist is held to be {{to the advantage of}} quill. In addition, quill <b>plectra</b> are observed to fail gradually, giving warning by the diminishing volume; whereas acetal <b>plectra</b> fail suddenly and completely, sometimes {{in the middle of a}} performance.|$|R
5000|$|Andy Billups, bass guitarist with British rock group, The Hamsters, {{has made}} a partial recovery; he plays by using {{modified}} guitar <b>plectrums.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In British English, guitar picks are {{referred}} to as <b>plectrums</b> reserving the term [...] "pick" [...] to identify the difference between this and finger picks.|$|R
25|$|Medieval lutes were 4- or 5-course instruments, plucked using a quill as a <b>plectrum.</b> There {{were several}} sizes, {{and by the}} end of the Renaissance, seven {{different}} sizes (up to the great octave bass) are documented. Song accompaniment was probably the lute's primary function in the Middle Ages, but very little music securely attributable to the lute survives from the era before 1500. Medieval and early-Renaissance song accompaniments were probably mostly improvised, hence the lack of written records.|$|E
25|$|The Tambur (spelled {{in keeping}} with TDK conventions) is a fretted string {{instrument}} of Turkey and the former lands of the Ottoman Empire. Like the ney, the armudi (lit. pear-shaped) kemençe and the kudüm, it constitutes {{one of the four}} instruments of the basic quartet of Turkish classical music a.k.a. Türk Sanat Müziği (lit. Turkish Artistic Music). Of the two variants, one is played with a <b>plectrum</b> (mızraplı tambur) and the other with a bow (yaylı tambur). The player is called a tamburî.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{cultural}} crossbreeding prevalent during the Ottoman Empire, the bağlama has influenced various cultures in the Eastern Mediterranean, e.g. the Greek baglamas. In Turkish bağlamak means 'to tie' as {{a reference to the}} tied, movable frets of the instrument. Like many other plucked lutes, it can be played with a <b>plectrum</b> (i.e., pick), with a fingerpicking style, or strummed with the backs of fingernails. The zurna and davul duo is also popular in rural areas, and played at weddings and other local celebrations.|$|E
5000|$|Modern harpsichords {{frequently}} employ <b>plectra</b> {{made with}} plastic, specifically the plastic known as acetal. Some <b>plectra</b> {{are of the}} homopolymer variety of acetal, sold by DuPont under the name [...] "Delrin", while others are of the copolymer variety, sold by Ticona as [...] "Celcon". Harpsichord technicians and builders generally use the trade names to refer to these materials. In either of its varieties, acetal is far more durable than quill, which cuts down substantially on the time that must be spent in voicing (see below).|$|R
25|$|In 2009, Gary Lightbody and Nathan Connolly donated <b>plectrums</b> and {{certificates}} to the Music Beats Mines {{project that}} aims to clear unexploded mines/landmines from conflict zones. The items were auctioned on eBay.|$|R
50|$|Plucking is {{a method}} of playing on {{instruments}} such as the veena, banjo, ukulele, guitar, harp, lute, mandolin, oud, and sitar, using either a finger, thumb, or quills (now plastic <b>plectra)</b> to pluck the strings.|$|R
25|$|He {{later became}} {{associated}} with a Fender Telecaster modified to include a Gibson humbucker. He started the Pignose amplification company {{with other members of}} Chicago and decorated his Telecaster with 25 Pignose stickers and a Chicago Blackhawks logo. Kath experimented {{with a wide variety of}} amplification and distortion devices and used a wah-wah pedal frequently. Fascinated by gadgets, Kath was interested in trying to play guitar without using a <b>plectrum.</b> Lamm recalled him attempting to make an auto-picking device using a modified electrical cocktail mixer.|$|E
25|$|Like any plucked instrument, {{mandolin}} notes decay {{to silence}} rather than sound out continuously {{as with a}} bowed note on a violin, and mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed instruments like the guitar. This encourages the use of tremolo (rapid picking {{of one or more}} pairs of strings) to create sustained notes or chords. The mandolin's paired strings facilitate this technique: the <b>plectrum</b> (pick) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately, providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would.|$|E
25|$|The six-string banjo guitar {{basically}} {{consists of}} a six-string guitar neck attached to a bluegrass or <b>plectrum</b> banjo body. This was the instrument of the early jazz great Johnny St. Cyr, jazzmen Django Reinhardt, Danny Barker, Papa Charlie Jackson and Clancy Hayes, {{as well as the}} blues and gospel singer The Reverend Gary Davis. Nowadays, it appears under various names such as guitanjo, guitjoe, ganjo, banjitar, or bantar. Today, musicians as diverse as Keith Urban, Rod Stewart, Taj Mahal, Joe Satriani, David Hidalgo, Larry Lalonde and Doc Watson play the six-string guitar banjo.|$|E
5000|$|The verse is {{crammed with}} specific, vivid {{references}} to the real world; for example, the tools and harpsichord <b>plectra</b> mentioned in the conclusion of [...] "The Farm in Winter," [...] from The Mystery of Meteors (2001): ...|$|R
5000|$|It is more {{suitable}} for playing polyphonically, with separate, independent musical lines, or separate melody, harmony and bass parts, and therefore {{more suitable}} to unaccompanied solo playing, or to very small ensembles, like duos in which a guitarist accompanies a singer. Fingerstyle players have up to four (or five) surfaces (fingernails or picks) striking the strings and/or {{other parts of the}} guitar independently; that does not equate to four <b>plectrums,</b> since <b>plectrums</b> can strike strings on both up and a downstroke easily, while fingers can only achieve alternation with hard practice.
