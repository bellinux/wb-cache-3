5000|$|There are 16 tapered <b>planks</b> per side. The {{garboard}} <b>planks</b> {{are near}} vertical where they {{attach to the}} keel. The garboard <b>planks</b> are narrow and remain only slightly wider to take {{the turn of the}} bilge. The topside <b>planks</b> are progressively wider. Each oak <b>plank</b> is slightly tapered in cross section to allow it to overlap about 30mm the <b>plank</b> above and below in normal clinker (lapstrake) style. Iron rivets are about 180 mm apart where the <b>planks</b> lie straight and about 125 mm apart where the <b>planks</b> turn.|$|R

According to the companion website of the documentary film Conny <b>Plank</b> – The Potential of Noise (but not the film itself), after the meeting, <b>Plank</b> firstly asked for time for a second thought.

50|$|During the 1800s, 202 <b>plank</b> road {{companies}} {{were established in}} Michigan, and 5,802 and 1/2 miles of <b>plank</b> roads were chartered, with roads as long as 220 miles (from Zilwaukee to Mackinaw City, and going through Traverse City) to as short as one mile (in Sault Ste. Marie). The man who signed the law {{was one of the}} major supporters of <b>plank</b> roads in Michigan, governor Epaphroditus Ransom. Ransom signed the general <b>plank</b> road incorporation act, and throughout his governorship viewed <b>plank</b> roads as the solution to increasing Michigan's economy. <b>Plank</b> roads were very popular in rural areas, because, even when it was wet and muddy, people could still travel on <b>plank</b> roads. Properly maintained <b>plank</b> roads were known to cut four to six day trips to as short as ten to fifteen hours.|$|R

5000|$|The canoes were {{typically}} {{made out of}} <b>planks</b> split from redwood (Sequoioideae) or pine driftwood washed up on the shore. This driftwood was usually chosen because it was available and usually knot free and easy to work with. Some of these driftwood logs were selected, cut to length, split, shaped and then their split out <b>planks</b> [...] "sewn" [...] {{together to form a}} canoe. The side <b>planks</b> and canoe bottom were split out of straight knot free logs utilizing whalebone and antler Wedges driven by rock mallets. The <b>planks</b> were then shaped, trimmed and leveled using flint and seashell tools and shark hide sandpaper. Where <b>planks</b> needed to be connected holes were bored in the <b>planks</b> using wood drills tipped with chert or bone. These drilled <b>planks</b> were then connected by [...] "sewing" [...] split and shaped knot free <b>planks</b> together on their ends to get the necessary length. They {{were typically}} fastened together with red milkweed (tok) fiber cords. After the <b>planks</b> had been shaped and sewn together for length they were carefully shaped, bent and mounted six to eight <b>planks</b> vertically to form the canoe's sides around a large split bottom <b>plank</b> that formed the bottom of the canoe. Over 20 pieces of shaped wood are used to make a typical tomol. Once the <b>planks</b> were bent, fitted and lashed together the heart of dry tule rush was forced into the cracks between the <b>planks</b> {{on the outside of the}} canoe hull to act as caulking. All seams between <b>planks,</b> <b>plank</b> ends and holes for cords or thongs were then caulked with 'yop', a mixture of hard tar and pine pitch melted and then boiled. In many respects their boat construction technique mirrored that utilized for making small wooden boats around the world. The lack of metal tools and fasteners forced them to use stone age tools and materials.|$|R

50|$|The balangay was {{basically}} a <b>plank</b> boat put together by joining the carved out <b>planks</b> edge to edge, using pins or dowels. The <b>planks,</b> which were made from a hardwood called doongon in the Philippines (Heritiera littoralis), were fastened together every 12 centimetres, also by hardwood pin measuring some 19 centimetres long, which were driven into holes {{on the edge of}} each <b>plank.</b> On the inner side of the boat the <b>planks</b> were provided, at regular intervals, with raised rectangular lugs, carved from the same <b>plank,</b> through which holes were bored diagonally from the sides to the surface.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The <b>plank</b> {{exercise}} {{is a popular}} and widely used exercise to increase core strength. We previously established normative values for the <b>plank</b> exercise {{that may be used}} for fitness classification to identify gaps in core muscular strength and endurance. Whether the <b>plank</b> exercise can be confidently added to current fitness appraisal protocols will depend on its reliability and validity in the fitness testing environment. This study sought to examine test-retest reliability of the <b>plank</b> exercise and to compare <b>plank</b> performance with established normative values for the curl up test. The role of verbal encouragement cues during <b>plank</b> performance testing was also assessed. Methods: Collegiate male (n= 14) and female participants (n= 19) performed the <b>plank</b> exercise in two separate sessions separated by a minimum of 72 hr. Participants maintained the <b>plank</b> position until complete fatigue was reached. Verbal cues were given to half of the participants in one of the two sessions. Performance on the curl up exercise was measured in a third, separate session. Results: Intraclass correlation showed that mean time held in the <b>plank</b> position was not significantly different between the two <b>plank</b> testing sessions (108. 15 + 49. 38 versus 111. 39 + 56. 87 seconds, p= 0. 556). Verbal encouragement cues did not improve performance time (between group effect, p= 0. 940). The curl up test was not significantly correlated with either <b>plank</b> session (r= 0. 410 and 0. 276 for <b>plank</b> session one and two, respectively). Surprisingly, the curl up test was positively correlated with participant height (r= 0. 578). Conclusion: This study suggests that the <b>plank</b> {{exercise is}} a reliable test; <b>plank</b> performance was comparable across testing sessions and not influenced by verbal encouragement. Further testing is needed to confirm validity of the <b>plank</b> exercise as a measure of core muscular endurance. We show here that <b>plank</b> performance was not correlated with the standard curl up test. However, the curl up test may not adequately measure core strength, given that increased body height was associated with higher curl up completion scores...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to summarize the load and resistance criteria for highway bridge <b>plank</b> decks, and to estimate the reliability of <b>plank</b> decks designed by AASHTO Code. Both transverse and longitudinal <b>planks</b> for a variety of typical stringer spacings and <b>plank</b> sizes are considered. Truck traffic load data is based on the model used to calibrate the 1994 AASHTO LRFD Code. However, for <b>plank</b> decks, wheel load rather than whole vehicle weight is most important, and these statistics are developed for this study. For wood <b>planks,</b> dead load and dynamic load are not significant. The limit state considered is flexural strength, and resistance statistics are presented for wood <b>planks</b> in terms of modulus of rupture. Special flat-wise use data are presented to account for section aspect ratio as well as edge of load application. The reliability analysis is carried out using the procedure developed for calibration of AASHTO LRFD. Reliability indices for both AASHTO Standard and AASHTO LRFD Code are presented for <b>plank</b> decks. The results indicate that there are considerable differences in <b>plank</b> reliabilit...|$|R

50|$|By 1837, the Michigan Road {{had reached}} Logansport. The roadway {{consisted}} of leveled dirt and log bridges, which decayed with every rain and snow fall. By 1850 the state approved funding {{to have the}} road <b>planked.</b> The roadbed was leveled and then covered with a wooden structure. <b>Planking</b> consisted of log sills or sleepers, laid lengthwise along the outer edges. Crosswise, <b>planks</b> were nailed to the sleepers. The <b>planks</b> were 2 or 3 in thick. Each sleeper run could be up to 10 ft in length. When necessary, multiple sleeper sections were linked end to end. Together, these <b>planks</b> provided a road free of dust and mud. With age, mud holes formed under the <b>planks</b> and sprayed outwards and up between the <b>planks,</b> making some sections of roadway impassible during the muddy season.|$|R
