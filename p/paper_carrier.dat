2500|$|Photographic {{film is a}} {{sheet of}} {{material}} coated with a photosensitive emulsion. When the emulsion is sufficiently exposed to light {{or other forms of}} electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays and is developed it forms an image. George Eastman and his company, Eastman Kodak, invented the first flexible photographic film as well as the invention of roll film in 1885. This original [...] "film" [...] used a <b>paper</b> <b>carrier.</b> The first transparent plastic film was produced in 1889. Before this, glass photographic plates were used, which were far more expensive and cumbersome, although of better quality due to their size.

2500|$|An early special type {{of plastic}} film {{capacitors}} were the cellulose acetate film capacitors, also called MKU capacitors. The polar insulating dielectric cellulose acetate was a synthetic resin {{that could be}} made for metallized capacitors in paint film thickness down to about 3µm. [...] A liquid layer of cellulose acetate was first applied to a <b>paper</b> <b>carrier,</b> then covered with wax, dried and then metallized. During winding of the capacitor body, the paper was removed from the metallized film. The remaining thin cellulose acetate layer had a dielectric breakdown of 63V, enough for many of general purpose applications. The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other film capacitors of the time. MKU film capacitors are no longer manufactured, because polyester film capacitors can now be produced in the smaller sizes that were the market niche of the MKU type.|$|E

[...] "His regular clerk, Dick Borden, left yesterday," [...] Dan had continued; [...] "perhaps {{you can get the}} job." [...] And Walter had lost no time in following the small youth to Newell's place of business. Here Dan's story was told, and the lad put in a good word for Walter, with the result that the youth was taken for a week on trial. How well Walter pleased the old naval veteran we have already seen. He had now occupied the place as head clerk for nearly two months, and his salary had been increased from four dollars a week to six. He boarded with Dan's mother, in a little suite of rooms on a modest side street, not a great distance from the Common.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although Non-continuous OFDM (NC-OFDM) has {{the unique}} {{advantage}} of eliminating interference to authorized user in cognitive radio context, it also confronts a difficulty of reducing peak to average power ratio (PAPR) like other OFDM techniques.

Universal (blind) statistical ste-ganalytical methods with learning and classification were improved and adapted to the new types of stego objects and tested under the different conditions. These methods are able to detect stego objects that have been created by publicly available steganography programs. Steganographic and steganalytical software for these methods was developed and nu-merical estimations of the quality main characteristics of a method were obtained. ??????????????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????????? ? ??????????????. ????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????????????? ? ???????????????????? ???????. ????????? ?????????? ?????? ???????????????? ?????????????????? ??????, ???????? ? ???????????????? ??????? ?????????????? ?? ????????. ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ???????????, ??????? ??? ??????????. ???????? ???????????? ????????????? ??????? ??? ??????? ????? ???????????? ?????????????. ??????????? ???????? ??????????????? ???, ???????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ? ?? ???????. ?????????? ????? ? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ??? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ??????? ????? ? ??????? ??????????????, ? ????? ???????????? ??????? ????????????? ?????: ? ????? ? ?????????? ????? ??? ????? ???????????? ????? ????????? ????????-???? ? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????? ????????????; ? ????? ? ???????????? ?????????????? ????? ??? ???????????????? ?????-????? ???????????? ??????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????????; ? ????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????-????????????, ????????????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????; ? ????? ? ?????????????????? ??? ?? ?????? ??????, ???????????? ? ???????-?????????? ??? ?????? ??????? ????????????. ?????????? ????? ?????????? ??????????? ? ?????????????????? ??? ?? ?????? ??????, ???????????? ? ??????? ????????? ????? ???????. ??????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????? ????? ?????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ?????????, ??????? ???????????? ????????? ????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ?? ????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ????? ?????????. ???????? ?????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????? ?? ???????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????????, ???????? ???????, ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ???????????? ?? ??????????? ??? ????????? ?????????????? ???????? ??????????. ????????? ????? ????????? ?????? ? ??????? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ?????????. ? ?????? ????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ????-???, ??????????? ??????????? ??? ????? ?????? ? ???????????? ???????????. ???????????????? ? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????? ????? ?????????????? ?? ???? ??????? ????????? ????????????? ?
