40|$|The {{adsorption}} of aqueous tri-block reverse copolymer polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide, PPO-PEO-PPO with <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> on Ti coated surfaces {{have been}} studied using a neutron reflectometer (NR). It is found that the adsorbed film consists of two layers. The hydrophobic PPO block forms the inner layer and acts as the anchor of the adsorbed film. Copolymer with higher weight percentage of PPO forms a thicker PPO layer. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> affects the adsorbed film structure of PPO-PEO-PPO copolymer by forming a thicker mixed-layer of PPO and <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> on the Ti surface. The tribological performance of the lubricants has also been studied using a ball-on-disc tribometer. The results show that copolymer molecular structure affects lubrication performance. Tr-block copolymer with a higher weight percentage of PPO shows a better performance. The addition of <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> to tri-block copolymer solution not only significantly decreases the coefficient of friction but also increases anti-wear property. The finding indicates that adsorbed film thickness depends {{on the size of}} the PPO block and the presence of <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester,</b> and that adsorbed film thickness correlates with friction...|$|R
40|$|Tribology {{performances}} (friction and anti-wear) of aqueous symmetrical tri-block {{normal and}} reverse copolymer solutions have been investigated. The ball-on-disk experiment {{was carried out}} to measure the coefficient of friction of solutions used at ~ 25 °C and ~ 50 °C. The interaction of alkyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester,</b> an anionic surfactant, and the aqueous copolymer solutions was also investigated. When solution was supplied at ~ 50 °C, high friction and severe wear were found indicated that the solutions {{were not able to}} protect the surface. The friction and the anti-wear was found to improve when solution used at ~ 25 °C. However, adding alkyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> as extreme pressure additive into aqueous solutions produced a stronger adsorbed lubricant film protecting the surface. Low COFs were obtained from solutions below and above the cloud point. For the wear volume, the presence of <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> produced comparable wear with the solution without added alkyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester.</b> The stainless steel was found less reactive to the alkyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> hence the wear not much reduced.

50|$|The -OH {{groups in}} phosphoric acids can also {{condense}} with the hydroxyl groups of alcohols to form <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters.</b> Since orthophosphoric acid has three -OH groups, it can esterify with one, two, or three alcohol molecules {{to form a}} mono-, di-, or triester.

40|$|As {{a result}} of their {{improved}} aqueous solubility, the development of <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrugs is an interesting approach to increase intestinal absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. Absorption of a drug from its <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrug is based on intestinal dephosphorylation of the prodrug which may result in intraluminal supersaturation of the parent drug, followed by an increased absorptive flux across the intestinal mucosa. In this study, we evaluated the behavior of fosamprenavir, a <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrug of amprenavir, in the Caco- 2 system and in aspirated human intestinal fluids (HIF), both showing phosphatase activity. Starting from a solution of fosamprenavir in HIF, a supersaturated solution of amprenavir was generated and maintained during a time period sufficient for absorption. Moreover, supersaturation of amprenavir resulted in an enhanced flux across Caco- 2 monolayers. To our knowledge, this is the first illustration of supersaturation in real intestinal media. Next, we showed an inhibitory effect of inorganic phosphate on the dephosphorylation of fosamprenavir, both in the Caco- 2 model and in HIF. As a consequence, phosphate-buffered media, including fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF), are incompatible with the study of <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrugs and should be replaced with media containing a biorelevant phosphate concentration (0. 4 - 1 mM) and another buffering compound such as 2 -morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES). status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A primary {{technology}} barrier {{preventing the}} operation of gas turbine engines and aircraft gearboxes at higher temperatures is the inability of currently used liquid lubricants to survive at the desired operating conditions over an extended time period. Current state-of-the-art organic liquid lubricants rapidly degrade at temperatures above 300 C; hence, another form of lubrication is necessary. Vapor or mist phase reaction lubrication is a unique, alternative technology for high temperature lubrication. The majority of past studies have employed a liquid <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> that was vaporized or misted, and delivered to bearings or gears where the <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> reacted with the metal surfaces generating a solid lubricious film. This method resulted in acceptable operating temperatures suggesting some good lubrication properties, but the continuous reaction between the <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> and the iron surfaces led to wear rates unacceptable for gas turbine engine or aircraft gearbox applications.
