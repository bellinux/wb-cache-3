50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} is a <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> {{process for}} converting the {{molten pig iron}} into steel by blowing oxygen through a lance over the molten pig iron inside the converter. Exothermic heat is generated by the oxidation reactions during blowing.|$|E

5000|$|A minimill is {{traditionally}} a secondary steel producer; however, Nucor (one of the world's largest steel producers), {{as well as}} one of its competitors, [...] Commercial Metals Company (CMC) use minimills exclusively. Usually it obtains most of its iron from scrap steel, recycled from used automobiles and equipment or byproducts of manufacturing. Direct reduced iron (DRI) is sometimes used with scrap, to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel, though usually DRI is too expensive to use as the <b>primary</b> raw <b>steelmaking</b> material. A typical mini-mill will have an electric arc furnace for scrap melting, a ladle furnace or vacuum furnace for precision control of chemistry, a strip or billet continuous caster for converting molten steel to solid form, a reheat furnace and a rolling mill.|$|R

The objective of this contribution is to review the progress in CFD technologies over {{the last decade or so}} and how this can be brought to bear in advancing the process analysis capability of primary ferrous operations. In particular, progress on key challenges such as compute performance, fluid-structure transformation and interaction, and increasingly complex geometries are highlighted...|$|R
50|$|The HIsarna {{steelmaking}} {{process is a}} process for <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> in which iron ore is processed almost directly into steel. The process is based around {{a new type of}} blast furnace called a Cyclone Converter Furnace, which makes it possible to skip the process of manufacturing pig iron pellets that is necessary for the basic oxygen {{steelmaking process}}. Without the necessity for this preparatory step the HIsarna process is more energy-efficient and has a lower carbon footprint than traditional steelmaking processes.|$|E
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} (BOS, BOP, BOF, and OSM), {{also known}} as Linz-Donawitz-steelmaking or the oxygen converter process is a method of <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> in which carbon-rich molten pig iron is made into steel. Blowing oxygen through molten pig iron lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into low-carbon steel. The process is known as basic because fluxes of burnt lime or dolomite, which are chemical bases, are added to promote the removal of impurities and protect {{the lining of the}} converter.|$|E
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} is {{a method}} of <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> in which carbon-rich molten pig iron is made into steel. Blowing oxygen through molten pig iron lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into steel. The process is known as basic due to the chemical nature of the refractories—calcium oxide and magnesium oxide—that line the vessel to withstand the high temperature and corrosive nature of the molten metal and slag in the vessel. The slag chemistry of the process is also controlled to ensure that impurities such as silicon and phosphorus are removed from the metal.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{steelmaking}} processes can {{be divided}} into two categories: Primary and Secondary steelmaking. <b>Primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> involves converting liquid iron from a blast furnace and steel scrap into steel via basic oxygen steelmaking or melting scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron (DRI) in an electric arc furnace. Secondary steelmaking involves refining of the crude steel before casting and the various operations are normally carried out in ladles. In secondary metallurgy, alloying agents are added, dissolved gases in the steel are lowered, and inclusions are removed or altered chemically to ensure that high-quality steel is produced after casting.|$|E
50|$|The use of EAFs allows steel to be {{made from}} a 100% scrap metal feedstock. This greatly reduces the energy {{required}} to make steel when compared with <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> from ores. Another benefit is flexibility: while blast furnaces cannot vary their production by much and can remain in operation for years at a time, EAFs can be rapidly started and stopped, allowing the steel mill to vary production according to demand. Although steelmaking arc furnaces generally use scrap steel as their primary feedstock, if hot metal from a blast furnace or direct-reduced iron is available economically, these {{can also be used}} as furnace feed. As EAFs require large amounts of electrical power, many companies schedule their operations to take advantage of off peak electricity pricing.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we use a}} predator–prey {{model to}} {{simulate}} intersectoral dynamics, with the global steel sector as the prey that supplies inputs and the automotive sector as the predator that demands its inputs. A further prey, an additional upstream supply sector, namely the iron ore sector, is added to reflect the implications of scarcity and resource limitations for industrial development and economic prospects. We find that capacity constraints in the steel industry could limit the future supply of vehicles, a result exacerbated by the unsustainable use of iron ore reserves. The solution is not for marginal steel industries to close, but for steelmakers to adapt and move to less resource-demanding secondary steelmaking technology {{rather than focusing on}} <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking.</b> The forecasting capabilities of the model are compared with the outputs from a neural-network model. Although the results are comparable over the short term (± 10 years), over the long term, results diverge, showing that forecasting steel-industry dynamics is complex and that further work is required to disentangle the drivers of supply and demand. This study indicates the potential advantages of using predator–prey models in modelling the supply chain in economics. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|During such {{processes}} as hot-metal dephosphorization, BOF <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> and coal gasification (for power production), rapid and complete dissolution of solid lime into molten slags {{is required for}} obtaining an efficient utilization. In this research, an in-situ observation approach was used to investigate the chemical dissolution of lime particles in CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -based slags with and without MgO by using a confocal scanning laser microscope (CSLM) between 1450 °C and 1600 °C. It {{was found that the}} dissolution largely depends on temperature and slag properties. The dissolution accelerates at elevated temperature. A clear double-layer structure was observed at the interface between the lime particles and the slags without MgO addition. Meanwhile, the dissolution mechanisms are discussed in term of the rate controlling steps. The in-situ observations reveal that the mass transfer in the boundary layer controls the dissolution process in the slags containing MgO. For slags without MgO, the dissolution could be divided into three stages when a double-layer structure formed at the interface. The dissolution was limited by chemical reaction during the early stage, a mixed control of product layer and boundary layer diffusion during the intermediate stage and boundary layer diffusion during the final stage. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims at {{explaining}} why large-scale energy-intensive industries - here the German {{iron and steel}} industry - had a period of slow uptake of major energy-efficient technologies from the mid 1990 s to mid 2000 s (Arens and Worrell, 2014) and why from the mid 2000 s onwards these technologies are increasingly implemented again. We analyze the underlying factors and investment/innovation behavior of individual firms in the German {{iron and steel industry}} to better understand barriers and drivers for technological change. The paper gives insights on the decision-making process on energy efficiency in firms and helps to understand how policy affects decision-making. We use a mixed method approach. First, we analyze the diffusion of three energy-efficient technologies (EET) for <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> from their introduction until today (top-pressure recovery turbine (TRT), basic oxygen furnace gas recovery (BOFGR), and pulverized coal injection(PCI)). We derive the uptake of these technologies both at the national level and {{at the level of the}} individual firm. Second, we analyze the impact of drivers and barriers on the decision-making process of individual firms whether or not they want to implement these technologies. Economics and access to capital are the foremost barriers to the uptake of an EET. If the expected payback period exceeds a certain value or if the company lacks capital, investments in EET seem not to happen. But even if an EET is economically viable and the company has access to capital, investments in EET might not be realized. Policy-induced prices might have strengthened the recent diffusion of TRT. We found indications that in a limited number of cases, policy intervention was a driving factor. Technical risks and imperfect information are only marginal factors in our cases. Site-specific factors seem to be important, as site-specific factors shape the economicsof the selected EET...|$|E
40|$|Environmental issues, {{including}} global warming, {{have been}} serious challenges realized worldwide, {{and they have}} become particularly important for the iron and steel manufacturers during the last decades. Many sites has been shut down in developed countries due to environmental regulation and pollution prevention while {{a large number of}} production plants have been established in developing countries which has changed the economy of this business. Sustainable development is a concept, which today affects economic growth, environmental protection, and social progress in setting up the basis for future ecosystem. A sustainable headway may attempt to preserve natural resources, recycle and reuse materials, prevent pollution, enhance yield and increase profitability. To achieve these objectives numerous alternatives should be examined in the sustainable process design. Conventional engineering work cannot address all of these substitutes effectively and efficiently to find an optimal route of processing. A systematic framework is needed as a tool to guide designers to make decisions based on overall concepts of the system, identifying the key bottlenecks and opportunities, which lead to an optimal design and operation of the systems. Since the 1980 s, researchers have made big efforts to develop tools for what today is referred to as Process Integration. Advanced mathematics has been used in simulation models to evaluate various available alternatives considering physical, economic and environmental constraints. Improvements on feed material and operation, competitive energy market, environmental restrictions and the role of Nordic steelworks as energy supplier (electricity and district heat) make a great motivation behind integration among industries toward more sustainable operation, which could increase the overall energy efficiency and decrease environmental impacts. In this study, through different steps a model is developed for <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking,</b> with the Finnish steel sector as a reference, to evaluate future operation concepts of a steelmaking site regarding sustainability. The research started by potential study on increasing energy efficiency and carbon dioxide reduction due to integration of steelworks with chemical plants for possible utilization of available off-gases in the system as chemical products. These off-gases from blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace and coke oven furnace are mainly contained of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrogen and partially methane (in coke oven gas) and have proportionally low heating value but are currently used as fuel within these industries. Nonlinear optimization technique is used to assess integration with methanol plant under novel blast furnace technologies and (partially) substitution of coal with other reducing agents and fuels such as heavy oil, natural gas and biomass in the system. Technical aspect of integration and its effect on blast furnace operation regardless of capital expenditure of new operational units are studied to evaluate feasibility of the idea behind the research. Later on the concept of polygeneration system added and a superstructure generated with alternative routes for off-gases pretreatment and further utilization on a polygeneration system producing electricity, district heat and methanol. (Vacuum) pressure swing adsorption, membrane technology and chemical absorption for gas separation; partial oxidation, carbon dioxide and steam methane reforming for methane gasification; gas and liquid phase methanol synthesis are the main alternative process units considered in the superstructure. Due to high degree of integration in process synthesis, and optimization techniques, equation oriented modeling is chosen as an alternative and effective strategy to previous sequential modelling for process analysis to investigate suggested superstructure. A mixed integer nonlinear programming is developed to study behavior of the integrated system under different economic and environmental scenarios. Net present value and specific carbon dioxide emission is taken to compare economic and environmental aspects of integrated system respectively for different fuel systems, alternative blast furnace reductants, implementation of new blast furnace technologies, and carbon dioxide emission penalties. Sensitivity analysis, carbon distribution and the effect of external seasonal energy demand is investigated with different optimization techniques. This tool can provide useful information concerning techno-environmental and economic aspects for decision-making and estimate optimal operational condition of current and future <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> under alternative scenarios. The results of the work have demonstrated that it is possible in the future to develop steelmaking towards more sustainable operation...|$|E
40|$|The climate {{impact of}} the iron and steel {{industry}} can be mitigated through increased energy efficiency, emission efficiency, material efficiency, and product use efficiency resulting in reduced product demand. For achieving ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation targets in this sector all measures could become necessary. The current paper focuses on one of those four key measures: emission efficiency via innovative <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> technologies. After analysing their techno-economical potential until 2100 in part A of this publication, the current research broadens the evaluation scope for the crucial year 2050, based on a Multicriteria-Analysis (MCA). 12 criteria from five different categories ("technology", "society and politics", "economy", "safety and vulnerability" and "ecology") are used to assess the same four future steelmaking technologies in a systematic and holistic way in Germany, as one possible location. The technologies in focus are the blast furnace route (BF-BOF), blast furnace with carbon capture and storage (BF-CCS), hydrogen direct reduction (H-DR), and iron ore electrolysis (EW). These four technologies have been selected, as explained in part A of this paper, because they are the most commonly discussed technological options under discussion by policymakers and the {{iron and steel industry}}. The results of the current work should provide decision makers in industry and government with a long-term guidance on technological choices. In 2050 the MCA shows significantly higher preference scores for the two innovative routes H-DR and EW compared to the blast furnace based routes. The main reasons being higher scores in the economical and environmental criteria. BF-CCS shows its greatest weakness in the social acceptance and the safety and vulnerability criteria. BF-BOF has the lowest economy and ecology score of all assessed routes, which is due to the projected high cost for carbon dioxide emission and increasing prices for fossil fuels. A first indicative trend assessment from today towards 2050 shows that H-DR is the preferred MCA option from today on. Three exemplary weighting distributions (representing the perspectives of the steel industry, environmental organisations and the government), used to simulate different stakeholder angle of view, don't have a strong influence on the overall evaluation of the steelmaking routes. The results remain very similar, with the highest scores for the innovative routes (H-DR and EW). This leads to the conclusion that EW and in particular H-DR can be identified as the preferred future steelmaking technology across different perspectives. Specific innovation efforts and dedicated programs are necessary to minimize the time until marketability and to share the development burden. The similarity of the MCA results from different perspectives indicates a great opportunity to reach a political consensus and to work together towards a common future goal. Regarding the pressing time horizon a concentrated engagement for one (or few) technological choices would be highly recommended...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} a key {{challenge}} of our time. The {{iron and steel industry}} emits 6. 5 % of global anthropogenic CO 2 that is likely to drive global warming. Greenhouse gases, among these CO 2, are to be reduced to 5 - 20 % of today’s level in industrialised countries. Thus, the steel sector must make significant contributions. The emissions originate from the consumption of fossil fuels and low-carbon alternatives to carbon intensiv iron and steelmaking seem not to be at hand. Thus this thesis analyses in detail past energy intensity trends and derives explanations for the trends, focusing from 1950 to 2035 on the German iron and steel industry as an important representative. It also assesses future pathways to reduce CO 2 emissions in iron and steelmaking. Energy consumption data by energy carrier on the process level are evaluated from 1991 to 2007. The impact of a rising share of secondary (recycled) steel on the energy consumption of the German iron and steel industry is shown. Then diffusion rates for key energy efficient technologies are derived since their introduction and their impact on energy intensity is estimated. Drivers for and barriers to their uptake are assessed using a mixed-method approach. Emerging alternative ironmaking technologies are assessed. Finally, four production pathways are set up estimating energy consumption and CO­ 2 emission levels up to 2035. The thesis finds that the reduction of the specific energy consumption in the German iron and steel industry between 1991 and 2007 was mainly driven by an increase in the share of secondary steel. Energy efficiency improvements only contributed with 0. 1 % per year. Energy intensity on the process level only steadily decreased in rolling. In all other processes altering energy intensity trends were found. The reduction of the specific energy consumption in the past six decades were mainly driven by three technologies, i. e. secondary steelmaking (21 %), basic oxygen furnaces (12 %) and continuous casting machines (6 %). Newer energy efficient technologies only contributed with 4 %. Investments in energy efficient technologies are only undertaken by companies if these pay-off within a maximum of two to three years. No evidence was found that the industry had undertaken exceptional action to reduce the specific energy consumption as it compromised in a voluntary agreement. Low-carbon alternative ironmaking technologies will not be ready on time to reduce the CO 2 emissions from the steel industry until 2035. One promising option would be hydrogen-based direct reduction once the production of hydrogen from renewable energies is available for large industrial applications. Neither a switch to natural gas nor an increase of electricity from renewable energies would lead to strong CO 2 reductions if the current production mix in steelmaking remains. Current climate targets for 2035 – if set as equal proportional targets – could only be fulfilled by the sector if <b>primary</b> <b>steelmaking</b> based on the carbon-intensive blast furnaces expires. The thesis concludes that transforming the iron and steel industry into a low-carbon industry requires large joint efforts from iron and steel companies and governments...|$|E
