40|$|The {{expansion}} of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) into spherical harmonics results in the <b>PN-approximation,</b> consisting of (N + 1) 2 simultaneous, first-order partial differential equations (PDEs). This system of equations is generally solved subject {{to a set of}} so-called Marshak’s boundary condi-tions, although some ambiguity exists in multi-dimensional media, for which the set provides more than the necessary number of conditions. In recent work Modest has shown that the general 3 D <b>PN-approximation</b> can be formulated as a set of N(N + 1) / 2 second-order, elliptic PDEs, using the original set of Marshak’s conditions, and which can be solved with standard PDE solution packages. In this pa-per the Marshak boundary conditions are reexamined {{in the light of the}} elliptic formulation, culminating in a self-consistent set of = N(N + 1) / 2 conditions along the boundary of the enclosure. The elliptic set of PDEs is reformulated and reduced considerably by limiting considerations to isotropic scattering. As an example the 2 D P 3 -approximation is extracted, and sample 2 D P 1, P 3 and P 5 computations are compared with Monte Carlo results...|$|E
40|$|A new {{numerical}} {{method for}} solving the Boltz-mann equations describing bimolecular chemical reac-tions {{in the gas}} phase is introduced. The method aims at governing also strong anisotropies of the distribution function of some species, which might be beyond the range of applicability of the <b>PN-approximation.</b> The de-veloped multicell approximation is based simply on a partition of the phase space of each molecule species into {{a large number of}} cells. The corresponding distri-bution function is assumed to be constant inside a cell. By integrating the Boltzmann equations separately over each cell, a completely determined system of couple...|$|E
40|$|The prior {{knowledge}} of the gravitational waveform from compact binary systems makes matched filtering an attractive detection strategy. This detection method involves the filtering of the detector output {{with a set of}} theoretical waveforms or templates. One of the most important factors in this strategy is knowing how many templates are needed {{in order to reduce the}} loss of possible signals. In this study we calculate the number of templates and computational power needed for a one-step search for gravitational waves from inspiralling binary systems. We build on previous works by firstly expanding the post-Newtonian waveforms to 2. 5 -PN order and secondly, for the first time, calculating the number of templates needed when using P-approximant waveforms. The analysis is carried out for the four main first-generation interferometers, LIGO, GEO 600, VIRGO and TAMA. As well as template number, we also calculate the computational cost of generating banks of templates for filtering GW data. We carry out the calculations for two initial conditions. In the first case we assume a minimum individual mass of 1 M_ and in the second, we assume a minimum individual mass of 5 M_. We find that, in general, we need more P-approximant templates to carry out a search than if we use standard PN templates. This increase varies according to the order of <b>PN-approximation,</b> but can be as high as a factor of 3 and is explained by the smaller span of the P-approximant templates as we go to higher masses. The promising outcome is that for 2 -PN templates the increase is small and is outweighed by the known robustness of the 2 -PN P-approximant templates.
