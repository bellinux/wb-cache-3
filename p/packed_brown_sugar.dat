40|$|CV. Delovry Sukses Gemilang (CV. DSG) is a <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> {{supplier}} from {{manufacturers in}} Maron Village, Blitar, to the warehouse of distributors {{which is located}} in Tambun, Bekasi. In doing the business, CV. DSG provides the working capital to the collectors in Blitar to produce and <b>pack</b> the <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> Fluctuating commodity prices of sugar cane leads CV. DSG {{to be difficult to}} continually maintain the business and shipping costs which is a way further from Blitar to Bekasi. These issues lead CV. DSG to be difficult to compete with the other <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> suppliers from other regions with a closer mileage from Bekasi. To grow and maintain its business, CV. DSG uses the PRIME analysis to identify the existing opportunities. After CV. DSG drafts a business strategy namely short-term strategy (distributors) in 2013, medium-term (factory build), long term (plant cane), the company then invents the scenario analysis on the influential factors that will affect the sugar business generally. The scenario analysis is made on each feasibility study with the proportion of the debt: equity 60 %: 40 %. In addition, CV. DSG also conducts a feasibility study of the alternative funding to 40 % the proportion of equity. From the calculation of the feasibility study by considering the payback period criteria 6 years, NPV IDR 891. 417. 628, IRR 28, 94 %, ROI 18, 35 %, ROE 45, 88 %, BBP 22, 60 % and the capacity 2, 53, it is shown that the business strategy of CV.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, the newly {{consolidated}} refined white sugar industry, {{which did not}} have full control over <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> production, mounted a smear campaign against <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> reproducing microscopic photographs of harmless but repulsive-looking microbes living in <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> The effort was so successful that by 1900, a best-selling cookbook warned that <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> was of inferior quality and was susceptible to infestation by [...] "a minute insect."

5000|$|The Codex Alimentarius {{requires}} <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> {{to contain}} at least 88% of sucrose plus invert <b>sugar.</b> Commercial <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> contains from 4.5% molasses (light <b>brown</b> <b>sugar)</b> to 6.5% molasses (dark <b>brown</b> <b>sugar)</b> based on total volume. Based on total weight, regular commercial <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> contains up to 10% molasses.

[...] The product may undergo processing to give a product that flows better for industrial handling. The addition of dyes or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial products.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> {{has been}} touted as having health {{benefits}} ranging from soothing menstrual cramps to {{serving as an}} anti-aging skin treatment, there is no nutritional basis to support <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> as a healthier alternative to refined sugars despite the negligible amounts of minerals in <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> not found in white sugar.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>sugar</b> is a sucrose {{sugar product}} with a {{distinctive}} brown color {{due to the}} presence of molasses. It is either an unrefined or partially refined soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals with some residual molasses content (natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugar),</b> or it is produced by the addition of molasses to refined white <b>sugar</b> (commercial <b>brown</b> <b>sugar).</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>sugar</b> comes {{either from}} the late stages of cane sugar refining, when sugar forms fine {{crystals}} with significant molasses content, or from coating white refined sugar with a cane molasses syrup (blackstrap molasses). <b>Brown</b> <b>sugar's</b> color and taste becomes stronger with increasing molasses content, as do its moisture-retaining properties. <b>Brown</b> <b>sugars</b> also tend to harden if exposed to the atmosphere, although proper handling can reverse this.|$|R
5000|$|Pet de sœur (French: [...] "(religious) sisters' fart"), euphemistically {{translated}} nun's pastries or <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> rolls, are French-Canadian pastry cakes {{covered with}} butter and <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> which are rolled, sliced and then baked. They are often served during the Christmas season. A variation uses molasses instead of <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> or caramel sauce or maple syrup can also be substituted.

50|$|Natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> {{raw sugar}} or whole cane sugar are sugars that retain a small to {{large amount of}} the {{molasses}} from the mother liquor (the partially evaporated sugar cane juice). Based upon weight, <b>brown</b> cane <b>sugar</b> when fully refined yields up to 70% white sugar, the degree {{depending on how much}} molasses remained in the sugar crystals, which in turn is dependent upon whether the <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> was centrifuged or not. As there is more molasses in natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> it contains minor nutritional value and mineral content. Some natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugars</b> have particular names and characteristics, and are sold as turbinado, demerara or raw sugar if they have been centrifuged to a large degree. <b>Brown</b> <b>sugars</b> that have been only mildly centrifuged or unrefined (non-centrifuged) retain a much higher degree of molasses and are called various names across the globe according to their country of origin: e.g. panela, rapadura, jaggery, muscovado, piloncillo, etc.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>sugar</b> {{is often}} {{produced}} by adding sugarcane molasses to completely refined white sugar crystals to more carefully control {{the ratio of}} molasses to sugar crystals and to reduce manufacturing costs. <b>Brown</b> <b>sugar</b> prepared in this manner is often much coarser than its unrefined equivalent and its molasses may be easily separated from the crystals by simply washing to reveal the underlying white sugar crystals; in contrast, with unrefined <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> washing will reveal underlying crystals which are off-white due to the inclusion of molasses.|$|R

40|$|Jaggery {{and other}} sugars namely white, refined and <b>brown</b> <b>sugars</b> were {{evaluated}} for cytoprotectivity on NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts and erythrocytes, DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power and DNA protection. In addition, total phenol content and phenolic acid composition were also determined. Results indicated a total phenolic content of 26. 5, 31. 5, 372 and 3837 mu g GAE/g for refined, white, brown and jaggery, respectively. The HPLC analysis revealed {{the presence of}} different phenolic acids in <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> and jaggery. On NIH 3 T 3 cells oxidation, at 4 mg/ml concentration, jaggery showed 97 % protection compared to <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> and both Sugars effectively reduced erythrocyte oxidation. A dose dependent reducing power and DPPH radical scavenging activity was also observed for jaggery and <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> An EC(50) of 7. 81 and 59. 38 mu g/ml were observed for jaggery and <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> in the DPPH scavenging assay. In DNA oxidation studies, higher protection was observed in jaggery followed by brown, white and refined sugar treated samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
