In one self-reflexive moment, Vertov even shows cinema-goers watching an earlier piece of the film (‘And you sitting in the audience’). He takes us {{on a tour of the}} vital importance of agricultural production, which generates export revenue (shot of the ship’s nameplate ‘Greenwich’) so that Russia can buy machines to build more machines (shots of a milling machine). This gives him the pretext to take us on a Cook’s tour of the extremities of the Soviet Union: we see the icebreaker Lenin (amazing shot downwards from above the prow) delivering new dogs to the Samoyeds on Novaya Zemlya, and their being invited on board to listen to a gramophone recording of the great man himself. We go to Bukhara where one of the mosques is looking very dingy and crumbled, and to Leningrad where the trams run down the middle of broad empty boulevard as a horse-drawn carriage turns out. We see a Kirghiz with a giant eagle perched on his arm, a bear encircled by yapping dogs, a fox caught in a trap and another one that is a child’s pet, guillemots, gulls, a man shooting a sable in the top of a pine tree, a pine marten, sheep being dragged into the sea for a wash and other sheep being obliged to jump into a stream for the same purpose - the intertitles are surreal: (“You - whether you are washing your sheep in the sea (film) or whether you are washing your sheep in the river (film)…”, We see trappers bringing their furs to the Госторг (Gostorg) trading post in exchange for manufactured goods, everyone contributing to the national economy.

40|$|On 29 January 1981, the Failure Analysis Laboratory at Radian Corporation {{received}} two spider bushings from the State Hospital at Warm Springs, Montana, for metallurgical analysis.

One bushing was originally set {{near the top of}} the well; the other bushing had been set deep in the well. The bushings were reportedly manufactured from bronze sleeve-bearing material. After approximately 50 hours of intermittent operation, the pump began to experience severe vibration. The vibration appeared random in that it sometimes occurred immediately upon start up and other times occurred after several hours of operation. A Worthington service engineer tested the pump and made several recommendations to alleviate the problem. He concluded that excessive <b>packing</b> <b>box</b> friction, overloading, and shaft unscrewing caused the vibration. He also adjusted the vertical shaft and impeller clearances. The purposes of this analysis is to examine the shaft bushings for evidence of mechanical or corrosion damage that might have been related to the vibration problem...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to examine basic properties (anatomical structure, chemical, physical and mechanical) of jabon merah wood (Anthocephalus macrophyllus (Roxb.) Havil) taken from natural forest in Luwu Timur District South Sulawesi Province. Potential uses of wood were determined by considering those properties and wood uses which the local inhabitants have currently employed. Results revealed that jabon merah heartwood is yellowish rather tend to red in colour and not clearly distinct from the sapwood, texture is rather fine and even, grain is straight and sometimes rather interlocked, wood surface is rather glossy, rather smooth to smooth in touch, and moderate in hardness. Fiber is remarkably long with very thin wall thickness. High in cellulose and extractive, moderate in lignin and low in pentose content. Moderate in specific gravity (0. 48), very low in shrinkage and classified in wood strength class III.

40|$|According to the {{analysis}} of the schisandra production structure of 48 farms in Jangsu–gun in Jeollabuk–do, a typical schisandra producing center of Korea, the average size of the farmland was 1. 1 ha and the schisandra cultivation scale was 0. 5 ha. The gross income of farms was 36. 03 million won, and the gross income from schisandra was 14. 96 million won, accounting for 42 % of the gross income of farms. For the major income source for the household economy, 24 out of 48 chose schisandra, and for the scale of schisandra cultivation, 17 out of 29 farms chose to maintain or expand their current scale. However, most schisandra farms cited the dropping price of schisandra and the decrease in income due to the nationwide expansion of cultivation areas, unsold fresh fruits resulting from the lack of markets, and a lack of manpower as future issues. Respondents demanded the purchase of schisandra of local governments for the stabilization of the selling price and increased income, the opening up of the market through connections with pharmaceutical companies and food companies capable of mass selling, the expansion of public relations for Jangsu–gun schisandra, the expansion of processing facilities (syrup, dry schisandra, other processed goods, etc.), the installation of an auction market and a union market, the installation of washers, and the development of <b>packing</b> <b>box</b> design. The study reached the conclusion that farms should consider various ways to secure a stable production of schisandra and expand farm income, such as unifying Jangsu–gun schisandra related organizations, using the Geographical Indication System of the Korea Forest Service, expanding the urban–rural exchange and sales and public relations in connection with local festivals, and developing processed goods that can increase added value compared with the fresh fruit...|$|E
40|$|Stimulus film_packing (divided {{into two}} clips) Setting: room with bookshelves Participants: 2 female, 1 male Props: two bookshelves, packing boxes, books, other items (candles, framed pictures, etc.) Opening scene: The male is {{standing}} in front of the bookshelves The two females are sitting on the ground in front of the bookshelves, each next to a <b>packing</b> <b>box.</b> There are some books on the ground next to one of the boxes, and some newspaper (for wrapping) on the ground next to the other box. Scenario: The man is taking books and other items out of the bookshelves. There are various objects in both of the bookshelves, including books, magazines, framed pictures, candles. The books and magazines are being packed into one of the boxes (by one woman), while everything else is being packed into the other one of the boxes (by the other woman). Depending on what the man takes from the shelf, he passes it to the woman responsible for packing that type of item. As the movie starts, the women are placing items into the boxes. The objects woman is wrapping an item in newspaper, which she then places it into her box. The books woman is arranging books in the box, finding the best fit. The man is facing the bookshelves, reaching into one of the shelves. The man then gives some of the books to the books woman (1), she packs them into the box. The man turns back to the shelf and takes a non-book item, which he gives to the objects woman (2). Then books again to the books woman (3), then object to the objects woman (4), then books to the books woman (5), more books to the books woman (6), and books to the books woman again (7). Now the man reaches back into the shelf and takes an object (non-book), but passes it to the books woman (8) by mistake. The books woman has one hand in the box, holding books in place, and has her other arm outstretched, in expectation of the books (this should be the case for passes 6 and 7, as well). Her eyes should not be on the man and the object while her arm is outstretched now, but rather on the box and the books (also mini-entrained). She looks up as the man is passing the object, when it is close to her hand. The man is also somewhat absent-minded in passing, already looking back at the shelf. As the woman grasps the object, she is surprised, realizing the mistake right away (it's not a book). (Communication of the realization of the mistake through facial expressions between the three participants.)

40|$|On January 27, 2010 the City of North Little Rock, Arkansas {{received}} {{notification of}} {{the awarding of}} a Department of Energy (DOE) grant totaling $ 450, 000 in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) under the Project Title: Recovery Act: Hydroelectric Facility Improvement Project – Automated Intake Clearing Equipment and Materials Management. The purpose of the grant was for improvements to be made at the City’s hydroelectric generating facility located on the Arkansas River. Improvements were to be made through the installation of an intake maintenance device (IMD) and {{the purchase of a}} large capacity wood grinder. The wood grinder was purchased in order to receive the tree limbs, tree trunks, and other organic debris that collects at the intake of the plant during high flow. The wood grinder eliminates the periodic burning of the waste material that is cleared from the intake and reduces any additional air pollution to the area. The resulting organic mulch has been made available to the public at no charge. Design discussion and planning began immediately and the wood grinder was purchased in July of 2010 and immediately put to work mulching debris that was gathered regularly from the intake of the facility. The mulch is currently available to the public for free. A large majority of the design process was spent in discussion with the Corps of Engineers to obtain approval for drawings, documents, and permits that were required in order to make changes to the structure of the powerhouse. In April of 2011, the City’s Project Engineer, who had overseen the application, resigned and left the City’s employ. A new Systems Mechanical Engineer was hired and tasked with overseeing the project. The transfer of responsibility led to a re-examination of the original assumptions and research upon which the grant proposal was based. At that point, the project went under review and a trip was booked for July 2011 to visit facilities that currently had an IMD installed. This further study of facilities revealed that the implementation of the project as originally described, while proving the benefits described in the original grant application, would likely intensify sand intake. Increased sand intake would lead to an increase in required shutdowns for maintenance and more rapid depreciation of key equipment which would result in a loss of generation capacity. A better solution to the problem, one that continued to meet the criteria for the original grant and ARRA standards, was developed. A supporting day trip was planned to visit other facilities located on the Arkansas River to determine how they were coping with the same strong amounts of sand, silt, and debris. Upon returning from the trip to other Arkansas River facilities it was extremely clear what direction to go in order to most efficiently address the issue of generator capacity and efficiency. Of the plants visited on the Arkansas River, every one of them was running what is called a rope packing shaft sealing system as opposed to mechanical shaft seals, which the facility was running. Rope packing is a time proven sealing method that has been around for centuries. It has proved to perform very well in dirty water situations just like that of the Arkansas River. In April of 2012 a scope change proposal was submitted to the DOE for approval. In August of 2012 the City received word that the change of scope had been approved. Plans were immediately set in motion to begin the conversion from mechanical seals to a <b>packing</b> <b>box</b> at the facility. Contractors arrived on October 1 st, 2012 and the project team began unwatering the unit for disassembly. The seal conversion was completed on February 29 th, 2013 with start-up of the unit.
