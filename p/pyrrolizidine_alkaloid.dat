25|$|The bella moth {{presents}} a polyandrous mating system, where females mate with multiple males. On average, females mate with {{four to five}} males over their lifespan of {{three to four weeks}} but can mate with and receive up to thirteen spermatophores. Since spermatophores contain nuptial gifts of <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloid</b> (PA) and nutrients, multiple mating helps the female increase the fitness of her offspring. In addition, multiple mating also benefits the female directly. Since the spermatophores are sizeable and can be digested within the female, multiple mating allows females to accrue the resources necessary to build additional eggs. This is equivalent to a 15% increase in egg production. In addition, multiple mating results in increased transmission of alkaloidal gifts to eggs. However, {{this does not mean that}} there is segregated allocation of these gifts. Instead, the PA obtained from numerous males is allocated in admixture so that eggs tend to receive from more than one male source. In contrast, normally most of the sperm used to fertilize the eggs comes from a single male.|$|E
2500|$|Although most female moths mate multiply, {{very low}} {{instances}} of mixed paternities occur. [...] In fact, most progeny {{in a single}} clutch is sired exclusively by one male. Females of this species do not select based on age, mating order, between-mating interval, or duration of copulation. [...] Instead, female Utetheisa ornatix demonstrate female choice in mate selection that depends on body size, systemic content of defensive <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloid,</b> and glandular content of the courtship pheromone hydroxydanaidal. [...] Selecting for these males provides the females with multiple benefits such as obtaining sperm packages with more defensive pyrrolizidine alkaloids which results in larger offspring. Offspring fathered by larger males are generally less vulnerable to predation because of their higher alkaloid content, allowing the offspring to have higher viability and fitness.|$|E

50|$|Many plants contain <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>{{alkaloids}},</b> {{and in turn}} {{there are}} many insects which consume the plants and build up the alkaloids in their bodies. For example, male Queens utilize <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> to produce pheromones useful for mating.|$|R
40|$|<b>Pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> (PA) are {{secondary}} plant metabolites. In {{certain types}} of honey in particular, increased levels of <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> can occur in dependence of the product’s origin. In {{the opinion of the}} BfR, efforts are required to reduce these levels. In addition, it is recommended that suitable measures are taken to avoid the intake of PA through food supplements, e. g. products that contain pollen of PA-containing plants. On the occasion of the contamination of a salad mix by blossoms and leaves of common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.), the BfR already recommended that special care be taken when harvesting and preparing lettuce, leafy vegetables and herbs. In total, more than 500 different <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> and their N-oxides are known which in turn can be contained in roughly 6, 000 plant species. Given the large variety of individual substances, the available data on the toxicology, oral bioavailability and on the presence of <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> in food and feed must be seen as patchy. What is known, however, is that <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> have a detrimental effect in the liver in both humans and animals. They typically trigger a liver veno occlusive disease (VOD). However, experiments with animals also found <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> to be carcinogenic. On the basis of the existing data, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has conducted a provisional assessment of the health risk posed by <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> in food and especially honey. The study took into account both the acute and chronic toxic effects. Taking into consideration all currently available data, the BfR comes {{to the conclusion that the}} overall exposure of the consumer to 1, 2 -unsaturated <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> with genotoxic and carcinogenic properties found in different foods is to be kept as low as possible. A daily intake of 0. 007 micrograms (μg) 1 of unsaturated <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> per kilogram of bodyweight should possibly not be exceeded...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> are toxins {{present in}} many plants {{belonging}} {{to the families of}} Asteraceae, Boraginaceae and Fabaceae. Particularly notorious are <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> present in ragwort species (Senecio), which are held responsible for hepatic disease in horses and cows and may lead to the death of the affected animals. In addition, these compounds may be transferred to edible products of animal origin and as such be a threat for the health of consumers. To investigate the possible transfer of <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> from contaminated feed to milk, cows were put on a ration for 3 weeks with increasing amounts (50 - 200 g day- 1) of dried ragwort. Milk was collected and sampled twice a day; faeces and urine twice a week. For milk, a dose-related appearance of <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> was found. Jacoline was the major component in milk despite being a minor component in the ragwort material. Practically no N-oxides were observed in milk, notwithstanding the fact that they constituted over 80 % of the <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> in ragwort. The overall carry-over of the <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> was estimated to be only around 0. 1 %, but for jacoline 4 %. Notwithstanding the low overall carry-over, this may be relevant for consumer health considering the genotoxic and carcinogenic properties demonstrated for some of these compounds. Analysis of the faeces and urine samples indicated that substantial metabolism of <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> is taking place. The toxicity and potential transfer of metabolites to milk is unknown and remains to be investigated...|$|R

50|$|In {{the great}} reed warbler, females {{tend to be}} {{attracted}} to males with longer song repertoires since they tend to sire offspring with improved viability. In doing so, they gain indirect benefits for their own young. In the Utetheisa ornatrix, females select males based on body size, systemic content of <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloid,</b> and glandular content of hydroxydanaidal. As a result, these females demonstrate direct and indirect phenotypic benefits: they have offspring that are less vulnerable to predation because of their increased size and higher alkaloid content, increasing viability and fitness.|$|E
50|$|This {{group has}} {{a wide range of}} both {{chemical}} and physical defenses. Among the chemical defenses three types stand out. First, the <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloid</b> sequestration usually present in Arctiinae is also found in a few species of noctuids, including the Spanish moth (Xanthopastis timais). Another chemical defense is formic acid production, which was thought to be present only in Notodontidae, but later was found in caterpillars of Trachosea champa. Finally, the last type of chemical defense is regurgitation of plant compounds, often used by many insects, but the Cabbage Palm Caterpillar (Litoprosopus futilis) produces a toxin called toluquinone that deters predators.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloid</b> {{sequestration}} by insects is {{done for}} defense and mating purposes. Various species of insects {{have been known to}} utilize molecular compounds from plants for their own defense and even as their pheromones or precursors to their pheromones. A few Lepidoptera have been found to sequester chemicals from plants which they retain throughout their life and Arctiidae is no exception to this strategy. Starting in the mid-twentieth century researchers investigated various members of Arctiidae, and how these insects sequester pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) during their life stages, and utilize these chemicals as adults for pheromones or pheromone precursors. PAs are also used by members of the Arctiidae for defense against predators throughout the life of the insect.|$|E
50|$|Riddelliine is a {{naturally}} occurring <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloid,</b> {{a class of}} compounds occurring in rangeland plants of the genera Crotalaria, Amsinckia, and Senecio. It consists of a macrocyclic diester of retronecine (an unsaturated alcohol) (Figure 1) and riddelliic acid (an oxygenated, branched, dicarboxylic acid)(Figure 1). Riddelliine is a colorless to off-white crystalline solid at room temperature and has a melting point of 197° to 198 °C. It is soluble in chloroform, acetone, and ethanol, and is sparingly soluble in water. As a solid, it is stable at room temperature in diffuse light for 12 months or longer. Alcoholic and aqueous solutions of riddelliine are stable at room temperature when protected from light. It emits toxic fumes of nitrogenoxide when heated to decomposition.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> (PAs), {{sometimes}} referred to as necine bases, are a group of naturally occurring alkaloids based on the structure of <b>pyrrolizidine.</b> <b>Pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> are produced by plants as a defense mechanism against insect herbivores. More than 660 PAs and PA N-oxides have been identified in over 6,000 plants, and about half of them exhibit hepatotoxicity. They are found frequently in plants in the Boraginaceae, Asteraceae, Orchidaceae and Fabaceae families; less frequently in the Convolvulaceae and Poaceae, and in at least one species in the Lamiaceae.It has been estimated that 3% of the world’s flowering plants contain <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids.</b> [...] Honey can contain <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> as can grains, milk, offal and eggs.
