50|$|The {{buildings}} of the Zaventem airport were designed in 1956-1958 by Maxime Brunfaut, Georges Bontinck and Jos Moutschen. It was initially estimated {{that it should have}} a maximum capacity of 6 million passagers per year. The 1950s were characterised by an uncurbed belief in technological progress. This was translated into the architecture by using such materials as aluminium, concrete, steel, and glass. The transit hall was intended as a striking feature with a space of a 100m long, 55m wide and 18m high, covered with a curved roof structure out of aluminium. Over the years, expansions and adjustments were made, leading to the loss of much of the original design. In 1994, Pier B was put into use so that 21 million passengers could be handled annually.

50|$|In 1973, {{the airport}} {{accomplished}} a milestone by serving nearly three million <b>passengers</b> and <b>processing</b> nearly 5 million units of luggage. That year {{turned out to}} be one of the most prosperous for the industry of aviation, registering high passenger growth in both domestic and international traffic. Then it became necessary for a second runway at El Dorado with concerns that the explosive growth would lead to over congestion in the future. In 1981, Avianca undertook the construction of the Puente Aéreo Terminal inaugurated by President Julio César Turbay Ayala, to serve its high density flights from Bogotá to Cali, Medellín, Miami and New York City. In 1990, the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics (Aerocivil) moved to the third floor in the main building. During this same year, the Centro de Estudios Aeronáuticos and at the east part of the airport the building for the National Center for Aeronavigation were constructed. In 1998, the second runway was officially opened.|$|R

Many airports try to improve {{the performance of the}} service by company program related to passenger satisfaction. To develop the company program, management of airport should know performance of existing system. In this research, we measure and compare the performance the existing system and new system of airport departure terminal of Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (SHIA). Discrete-event simulation method was developed to measure the system. ProModel simulator software, from ProModel Corporation, was utilized to simulate the existing system and new system of Departure Terminal in the Airport. To measure the performance, authors focus on some indicators i. e. <b>passengers</b> <b>processing</b> time, <b>passengers</b> waiting time, and utilization of each station. The authors make some scenarios based on the increasing of passengers 4. 9 % in 2015, 18. 9 % in 2020, 17. 7 % in 2025 and 1. 5 % in 2030. There is a significant difference in 2020 to 2025 in amount of 25 % in order to the passen-gers' average time. Therefore, the new system will have better performance. Globalization has big impact in the airports all over the world. Many international airports increased in large growth of passengers in recent years. There is 2. 835 billion passengers of the airplane in the world in 2011 and IATA (International Air Transport Association) standard predicts that it will increased at 4. 4 % in 2012, and 4. 5 % in 2013 [1]. Worldwide international and domestic air transport passenger traffic grew 5. 9 % to a new high of 5. 2 trillion kilometers in the year of 2011 [2]. Nowadays, the globalization increases the importance of airports to worldwide connectivity. Passengers growth in the Airport still strong despite economic slow in many region in the world because global business and tourism depend on the air transport industry [2]. Air transport is the fastest, safest, and comfortable public transportation. Low cost airlines become popular in recent years which make prices affordable and inexpensive.

Passengers satisfaction depends on processing time in the system because the less time they spend in the system of the airport, the highe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Processing</b> <b>passengers</b> {{quickly and}} {{efficiently}} {{is one of the}} top goals for airport administrators, and major international gateways have the added challenge of <b>processing</b> <b>passengers</b> representing a variety of cultures and nations. People having diverse cultural backgrounds may interpret signage layouts differently with respect to symbols and text. Consequently, dedicated research into signage perception may provide airport administrators with a more informed sense of how to convey appropriate movement and directional information within their terminals. There are many ways to answer the broad question of what signage encourages passengers to move most efficiently through an airport terminal. This study focused on the different ways in which Chinese and American airline passengers navigated through a terminal using either signs showing text only, symbols only, or both text and symbols. Quantitative in nature, the study used a unique computer simulation to generate paths having signage with English text, common symbols, or a combination of both. Participants clicked on arrows to follow the path to the specified goal for each different variation. Total completion time measurements and completion accuracy (in terms of correct versus incorrect clicks) were gathered. Analysis of the results suggested that there was a statistically significant difference related to cultural differences on a passenger 2 ̆ 7 s ability to wayfind based on the type of signage used. Additionally, within cultural groups there was a statistically significant difference as to which arrangements encouraged better wayfinding and those which did not. Lastly, the results suggested a difference in which sign type produced the best wayfinding performance and which sign type people actually preferred. ...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{transportation}} systems {{should be designed}} {{according to the requirements}} of their passengers, while considering operational costs for the managing organizations,as well as being environmentally friendly. The main objective of this work is to provide a realistic simulation of a transportation system, capable of identifying connections among the road network of operation areas, creating bus lines composedof multiple connected bus stops, simulating travel requests registered by potential passengers, as well as generating routes and timetables for bus vehicles, while taking into consideration factors which could affect the predefined schedule, includingun predictable events (e. g., traffic accidents) or dynamic levels of traffic density. The implemented bus management system is able to generate timetables dynamically,introducing a reasoning mechanism capable of evaluating travel requests based on dynamic clustering techniques, while offering the opportunity to its administrator to make decisions regarding the number of generated timetables, operating bus vehicles,passengers per timetable, waiting time of <b>passengers,</b> and <b>processing</b> time. In addition,the routes of bus lines are generated or updated dynamically, while taking into consideration real-time traffic data and evaluating parameters, such as covered distance or travelling time, in order to identify the most effective connectionsbetween the bus stops of each bus line and make adjustments to the corresponding timetables. Finally, the number of operating bus vehicles that are required in order to transport the passengers of each bus line is estimated, leading to a more efficient distribution of available resources...|$|R
40|$|Recently, ambient {{vibration}} test {{is widely used}} to estimate dynamic characteristics of large civil structures, Dynamic characteristics can be affected by various environmental factors such as humidity, wind, and temperature. Besides these environmental conditions, the mass of vehicles may change the measured values when traffic-induced vibration is used for bridges. The effect of vehicle mass on dynamic characteristics is investigated through traffic-induced vibration tests on three bridges: (1) three-span suspension bridge(128 m+ 404 m+ 128 m), (2) five-span continuous steel box girder bridge(59 m+ 3 @ 95 m+ 59 m). (3) simply supported plate girder bridge(46 m). Vibration signal of each measurement location is recorded for 30 minutes under normal traffic at field test.
