50|$|Much of the tooling {{is made of}} {{hardened}} steel or tool steel to maintain and prolong the tools life. However wherever there is a concern of scratching or gouging the work piece, a softer material such as aluminum or bronze is utilized. For example, the clamping block, rotating form block and <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> are often formed from the {{hardened steel}} because the tubing is not moving past these parts of the machine. On the other hand, the <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> and the wiping die are formed from aluminum or bronze to maintain the shape and surface of the work piece as it slides by.|$|E
5000|$|High <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> cast silicon tombac {{is often}} used as an {{alternative}} for investment cast steel parts, because the mechanical strength is comparable (500 MPa [...] ), but the production process is more efficient. There can be found a break-even-point when comparing both processes, whereas the advantages of high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> casting regularly predominate at high unit numbers (for instance greater than 5000 units [...] ) to produce. This alloy has outstanding casting properties and good strength properties, which {{is required for the}} die casting process. It is often chosen for small to medium size parts in terms of casting metal volume. For large parts often investment casting of steels is applied because of the lower material cost.|$|E

5000|$|Prussian blue {{is widely}} used by tool makers when the core and {{cavity of a mould}} is matched during final assembly. It is also used in other tooling applications—especially during assembly—such as {{stamping}} tools and <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> casting tools. A thin coating of Prussian blue is applied (usually with a paint brush) on the [...] "insert"—regardless of the shape or contour—of the mould or tool before the matching is done with the mating part. If the Prussian blue (generally called as just [...] "blue") appears evenly on the mating area, it is considered—by the tool makers—as [...] "good matching" [...] and thus expecting a good final product from the tool. Usually no tool would be transferred to testing or production without [...] "blue matching", a term generally used by the tool makers in Asia. In other words, Prussian blue is considered {{as an integral part of}} precision tool making.|$|E

50|$|The {{silicon content}} {{leads to a}} {{strengthening}} of the metal matrix. The appearance is similar to ordinary brass. Silicon tombac has good friction bearing characteristics and is corrosion resistant but is not resistant to ammonia atmosphere. The strength properties are largely retained at application temperatures up to 200 °C.It is a special alloy {{in terms of the}} combination of casting process and casting temperature. In most cases, parts made of silicon tombac, are produced through the high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> casting process, which is normally specialized on metals with relatively low melting temperatures. But in this case the temperature melting range of silicon tombac is in the area of 950 to 1000 °C, which is relatively high for casting into permanent moulds. The advantage is the productivity of this highly automated casting process. The disadvantage is the temperature stress of the surface of the permanent mould, so that the lifetime of these moulds is limited.|$|E

5000|$|The F160 is a 60° V6 {{gasoline}} engine that displaces [...] It utilizes a turbocharger for each cylinder bank, twin intercoolers and direct injection. The engine is designed by Ferrari (loosely based on Pentastar engine block) and assembled by Ferrari; specifically, the engine blocks are cast and machined to Ferrari's approved specifications respectively in Chrysler's Kokomo, Indiana and Trenton Engine Plant, then shipped to Modena, Italy for assembly by Ferrari. This engine shares bore and combustion chamber design, the same valves control technology (i.e. roller finger followers and four cam phasers), the same twin turbocharging approach and direct injection-ignition system with Ferrari F154 engine. The engine auxiliaries are identical (alternator, starter motor and power steering pump) or very similar (variable displacement oil pump). The difference of F160 from F154: F160 engine block {{is made by}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> cast (HPDC) process which is extremely suitable for high volume production. However, it is open deck type and can't endure to high specific power in HP/liter. F160 doesn't have an overboost function and is not used in Ferrari cars either (both F136 and F154 engines are used in Ferrari cars as well). Ferrari was responsible for design and bench testing of this engine.|$|E
50|$|Breeden was a Lucas {{employee}} who acquired {{an interest in}} the Wilmot company, a long-established Birmingham silversmiths, which accounts for the name. Wilmot stayed with the company until 1949 at least, and the title was hyphenated until the early fifties. By the time of Breeden's death in 1951 it employed more than 5,000 people. Breeden had brought back from the United States the concept of attached metal bumpers or fenders. Breeden was approached by William Morris, probably in 1928, and asked to supply bumpers for the new Morris Minor. With very {{little in the way of}} facilities he delivered the first batch within three months of commencement. He subsequently began supplying Austin, Wolseley, and eventually almost every UK vehicle maker. The Wilmot part of the business concentrated upon smaller parts, developing new techniques of <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> casting and chromium plating which made them market leaders. By 1931 the company had issued a catalogue which contained many other types of automotive components including door locks. It is one of the direct antecedents of the current Inteva Products international components group. He was well-connected within the automotive industry in other ways too. In 1914, he married Hilda, the daughter of Harry Lucas, son of the founder of Lucas Industries and the head of that company; in 1951, just six months before he died, his younger son married a daughter of Leonard Lord, the head of the Austin Motor Company and the architect of the British Motor Corporation. Before the First World War, Breeden had worked with Oliver Lucas of the Lucas Industries group to develop the dynamo for use on motorcycles, which were a fast-growing industry in Birmingham.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary draw bending (RDB) is {{a precise}} technology, since it bends using tooling or [...] "die sets" [...] {{which have a}} {{constant}} center line radius (CLR), alternatively indicated as Mean Bending Radius (Rm). Rotary draw benders can be programmable to store multiple bend jobs {{with varying degrees of}} bending. Often a positioning index table (IDX) is attached to the bender allowing the operator to reproduce complex bends which can have multiple bends and differing planes.Rotary draw benders are the most popular machines for use in bending tube, pipe and solids for applications like: handrails, frames, motor vehicle roll cages, handles, lines and much more. Rotary draw benders create aesthetically pleasing bends when the right tooling is matched to the application.CNC rotary draw bending machines can be very complex and use sophisticated tooling to produce severe bends with high quality requirements.The complete tooling is required only for high-precision bending of difficult-to-bend tubes with relatively large OD/t (diameter/thickness) ratio and relatively small ratio between the mean bending radius Rm and OD. The use of axial boosting either on the tube free end or on the <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> is useful to prevent excessive thinning and collapse of the extrados of the tube. The mandrel, with or without ball with spherical links, is mostly used to prevent wrinkles and ovalization. For relatively easy bending processes (that is, as the difficulty factor BF decreases), the tooling can be progressively simplified, eliminating the need for the axial assist, the mandrel, and the wiper die (which mostly prevents wrinkling). Furthermore, in some particular cases, the standard tooling must be modified in order to meet specific requirements of the products.|$|E
