A deep understanding of thermoelectric effects may allow a physics-based design of the cell structure and materials to optimize programming speed/energy and reliability. In this work we study the polarity-dependence of PCM characteristics, including crystallization, melting, electrical switching/holding, and ion migration. These characteristics show slower kinetics at negative voltage, which we attribute to thermoelectric effects of electrically-induced heating.

To maintain identical device and measurement conditions we measure both effects in a single Ni 80 Fe 20 /Cu/Ni 80 Fe 20 nanopillar spin valve device subjected to either an electrical or a thermal bias. In the low bias regime, we observe similar spin signals as well as background responses, {{as required by the}} Onsager reciprocity relation. However, at large biases, deviation from reciprocity occurs in the voltage-current relationships, dominated by nonlinear contributions of the temperature-dependent transport coefficients. By systematic modeling of these nonlinear thermoelectric effects and measuring higher-order thermoelectric responses for different applied biases, we identify the transition between the two regimes as the point at which Joule heating starts to dominate over <b>Peltier</b> <b>heating.</b> Our results signify the importance of local equilibrium (linearity) for the validity of this phenomenological reciprocity relation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The metal to {{insulator}} transition (MIT) of strongly correlated {{materials is}} subject to strong lattice coupling, which brings about the unique one-dimensional alignment of metal−insulator (M−I) domains along nanowires or nanobeams. Many studies have investigated the effects of stress on the MIT and hence the phase boundary, but few have directly examined the temperature profile across the metal−insulating interface. Here, we use thermoreflectance microscopy to create two-dimensional temperature maps of single-crystalline VO 2 nanobeams under external bias in the phase coexisting regime. We directly observe highly localized alternating <b>Peltier</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling as well as Joule heating concentrated at the M−I domain boundaries, indicating {{the significance of the}} domain walls and band offsets. Utilizing the thermoreflectance technique, we are able to elucidate strain accumulation along the nanobeam and distinguish between two insulating phases of VO 2 through detection of the opposite polarity of their respective thermoreflectance coefficients.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{effects are}} envisioned to reduce {{programming}} currents in nanopillar phase change memory cells. However, {{due to the}} inherent symmetry in such a structure, the contribution due to thermoelectric effects on programming currents is minimal. In this work, we propose a hybrid phase change memory structure which incorporates a two-fold asymmetry specifically aimed to favorably enhance thermoelectric effects. The first asymmetry is introduced via an interface layer of low thermal conductivity and high negative Seebeck coefficient, such as, polycrystalline SiGe, between the bottom electrode contact and the active region comprising the phase change material. This results in an enhanced <b>Peltier</b> <b>heating</b> of the active material. The second one is introduced structurally via a taper that results in an angle dependent Thomson heating within the active region. Various device geometries are analyzed using 2 D-axis-symmetric simulations to predict the effect on programming currents {{as well as for}} different thicknesses of the interface layer. A programming current reduction of up to 60 % is predicted for specific cell geometries. Remarkably, we find that due to an interplay of Thomson cooling in the electrode and the asymmetric heating profile inside the active region, the predicted programming current reduction is resilient to fabrication variability.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of DNA extraction and amplification performed in microfluidic systems was carried out, {{with the aim}} of integrating the two processes in a single microfluidic device. This integrated device will then be incorporated upstream of capillary gel electrophoresis and fluorescence-based detection for development of a completely integrated genetic analysis system. DNA extraction was performed using a silica substrate with both hydrodynamic and electro-osmotic pumping (EOP), resulting in maximum DNA extraction efficiencies of 82 % and 52 % respectively under optimised conditions. While the DNA extraction efficiency was lower using EOP, this method eliminates the need for external pumps and ensures easier mechanical connection to the microfluidic device. The use of thermally activated silica monoliths as the solid-phase resulted in superior DNA extraction efficiencies compared to when photo-initiated monoliths and silica beads were used. DNA amplification of up to nine forensically relevant loci was successfully achieved on the microfluidic device in volumes as low as 1. 1 microlitres using <b>Peltier</b> <b>heating.</b> A combination of silanisation and dynamic passivation was required to prevent PCR inhibition resulting from DNA polymerase adsorption. A custom-built microwave heating system was also evaluated, which was capable of heating and cooling rates of 65 degC/second and 58 degC/second, respectively. EOP was used in the generation of an integrated microfluidic device, for DNA extraction and amplification. The silica monolith used as the solid-phase for DNA extraction also acted as a pump for electrokinetic movement. All necessary reagents for carrying out both DNA extraction and amplification were encapsulated in agarose gel and pre-loaded onto the microfluidic device creating a self-contained, ready-to-use system.
