5000|$|Here is a {{quote from}} George F.: [...] "To know in the morning that your {{compensation}} is fixed; {{to know that you}} must do the same thing all day long, to know that whether you do a little more or a little less, whether you are more or less interested and more or less efficient, your pay is automatically fixed-creates the most deadly monotony that I can believe possible". Here he describes what was then called the <b>piece</b> <b>worker</b> system, whereas Professor Melvyn Dubovsky calls Johnson's ethic [...] "welfare capitalism". The community of Lestershire was renamed Johnson City, New York in 1916 in honor of Johnson, and Endicott-Johnson workers built two arches over the area’s main road in the early ’20s, one at the entrance to Johnson City and the other in Endicott, New York stating that they were the gateways to the [...] "Square Deal Towns".

He took up an engineering job repairing bridges of the Kowloon Canton Railway damaged by the Japanese, and was involved in constructing the Humen Pearl River Bridge.

5000|$|However, {{his core}} {{responsibility}} at Göppingen was, of course, naturally looking after {{the interests of}} union members in the area. As before, he {{made a name for}} himself as a resolute advocate for the Göppingen workforce, visiting plant after plant and rapidly familiarizing himself with the local situations and gaining the confidence and trust of the membership: at the same time his [...] "no nonsense" [...] approach won him the respect of employers. He was relatively unconcerned by custom and convention, however. At one business meeting he talent spotted the young <b>piece</b> <b>worker,</b> Hilde Kirsamer, whom he backed within the union and who in the end was appointed Work council president at the Märklin company. Within the IG Metall staff women were badly under-represented at the time. That an unskilled female factory worker should end up as a works council president in the early 1950s was little short of sensational. Bleicher was proud of Kirsamer's success, although the issue of gender equality was not then the hot political topic that it became a couple of decades later, and was not something that would have been to the fore in his own political thinking.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: While {{increasing}} {{media attention}} {{is given to}} examining the status of contract faculty on university campuses there is little note made of the pervasiveness of women in these positions. This paper, by drawing on Marxist and feminist theory ties the gender precarity faced by academic contract female workers to the historical practices of industries to use female labour to reduce labour costs. The textile <b>piece</b> <b>worker</b> system of the 19 th century has found a 21 st century form represented in the unlikely position of the female academic contract worker. The argument builds on the autoethnographic narratives of two contract women to demonstrate how the university administration’s “economic pressure ” justification is an economic myth to occlude the exploitation of female workers...|$|E

50|$|Under the Standard, basic hourly {{rates were}} {{guaranteed}} pay rates {{set by the}} Australian Fair Pay Commission.

50|$|Under UK law, <b>piece</b> <b>workers</b> {{must be paid}} {{in either}} at least the minimum wage for every hour worked or {{on the basis of}} a ‘fair rate’ for each task or piece of work they do.

30|$|More recently, Verhoogen (2008) {{finds that}} the peso crisis induced a quality {{upgrading}} mechanism such that more productive plants increased exports, quality and wages relative to less productive plants within the same industry, thus increasing within-industry wage inequality. While, unfortunately, the aggregate analysis in Eqs. (2) and (3) does not allow to control for within-industry wage inequality directly, I can re-estimate Eqs. (2) and (3) by restricting the sample to the workers that are not employed in an industry, so that wage inequality, informality {{and the rest of}} the aggregate variables in Eqs. (2) and (3) do not reflect any within-industry change. As discussed in Section 2, I consider four types of workers: self-employed, employers, wage and <b>piece</b> <b>workers.</b> While employers, wage and <b>piece</b> <b>workers</b> could be employed in an industry, self-employed are individuals working on their own with no employees at their dependency. In the sample, there are 247, 672 individuals that are self-employed. By using the subsample of self-employed to compute the aggregate variables and re-estimate Eqs. (2) and (3), I obtain substantively similar results to the ones presented in Tables 3 and 4, that is, the peso crisis positively affects informality, which has a positive impact on wage inequality.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{occupational}} injury surveillance study (record study {{of five years}} duration) was conducted involving the workers of a fertilizer producing industry in eastern India to assess whether the risk of occupational accidents in temporary <b>piece</b> rated <b>workers</b> was higher {{in comparison to the}} permanent time rated workers. At the same time, to collect the personal details of the workers who have worked in the industry in the study period, an interview was also conducted. Mean age of temporary <b>piece</b> rated <b>workers</b> and permanent time rated workers were (35. 9 ± 12. 5) and (35. 3 ± 11. 4) respectively. Distribution of other variables like nature of work, level of education, experience, habits were also very similar between the two worker groups. Accident incidence rate, accident frequency rate and accident severity rate were found to be significantly higher in temporary <b>piece</b> rated <b>workers.</b> This difference was more prominent in case of time-loss accidents than in no timeloss accidents. Relative risk has varied from 2. 3 to 18. 0 in case of time-loss accidents. In case of no time-loss accidents, it has varied from 1. 1 to 2. 6. When relative risk is considered after taking both types of accidents together, it has ranged from 1. 2 to 3. 5. This study concluded that the temporary <b>piece</b> rated <b>workers</b> are more vulnerable to occupational accidents...|$|R

It uses a unique data set of blue-collar workers in British engineering between 1926 and 1966.

The data consist of cell averages delineated by 15 occupations in 29 engineering districts. Via a firm-union bargaining modelling structure, the question is examined as to likely earnings responses to price shocks under the two payment systems. The empirical work entails testing for cyclical differences in the two payments methods Insights are gained from distinguishing between the relatively tight post-war and slack pre-war labor markets...|$|R

5000|$|The American {{system of}} watch {{manufacturing}} {{is a set}} of manufacturing techniques and best-practices {{to be used in the}} manufacture of watches and timepieces. It is derived from the American system of manufacturing techniques (also called [...] "armory practices"), a set of general techniques and guidelines for manufacturing that was developed in the 19th century. The system calls for using interchangeable parts, which is made possible by a strict system of organization, the extensive use of the machine shop, and quality control systems utilizing gauges to ensure precise and uniform dimensions. It was developed by Aaron Lufkin Dennison, a watch repairman who was inspired by the manufacturing techniques of the United States Armory at Springfield, Massachusetts, which manufactured identical parts, allowing rapid assembly of the final products. He proposed using similar techniques for the manufacture of watches. Before the American system of watch manufacturing was developed, watchmaking was primarily a European business.
