50|$|Most house-built engines were early beam engines. A 'bob wall' in {{the engine}} house {{supported}} the pivot axle of the beam or 'bob'. This wall could be an internal wall, with {{both ends of the}} beam inside the house, but it was commonly the end wall of the house and so the beam projected to the outside. For a heavy beam, the bob wall was required to be extremely substantial. Early engines were used for pumping mines or wells, so as well as the weight of the beam, the house had to also support the weight of the long <b>pump</b> <b>rod,</b> reaching down to the depths of the mine.|$|E
5000|$|In {{previous}} engines {{built by}} Newcomen and Watt, the piston pulled {{one end of}} the walking beam downwards during the power stroke using a chain, and the weight of the pump pulled {{the other end of the}} beam downwards during the recovery stroke using a second chain, the alternating forces producing the rocking motion of the beam. In Watt's new double-acting engine, the piston produced power on both the upward and downward strokes, so a chain could not be used to transmit the force to the beam. Watt designed the parallel motion to transmit force in both directions whilst keeping the piston rod vertical. He called it [...] "parallel motion" [...] because both the piston and the <b>pump</b> <b>rod</b> were required to move vertically, parallel to one another.|$|E

5000|$|The Romeo and Juliet Windmill, is {{a wooden}} {{structure}} designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright {{in the town}} of Wyoming, Wisconsin (Wyoming is south of the town of Spring Green). It was designed in 1896 after being commissioned by Wright's aunts, Jane and Ellen Lloyd Jones, who needed the windmill to provide water for their school, the Hillside Home School. The diamond-shaped portion of the windmill intersects the portion with the balcony that sits on an octagonal structure. The balcony is accessible through an interior stairway. Wright named these two parts of the building [...] "Romeo" [...] and [...] "Juliet". [...] "Romeo" [...] is the lozenge and Juliet, the octagon. Architectural historian, Neil Levine explained the principles behind the lozenge and octagon: Wright gave the tower a bold geometric form as a structural solution to the expression of the tower's role as a landmark. The <b>pump</b> <b>rod</b> and support for the wheel are carried up within an acutely angled lozenge shape pointed southeast to deflect blasts of wind like a [...] "storm prow". This angular element is inserted halfway into a larger octagonal volume that contains and supports it throughout nearly its full height. Wright called the composition Romeo and Juliet, likening its conjugate geometry to an amorous union.|$|E
30|$|Sucker rod pumping is a {{traditional}} and widely used method of artificial lifting in the world’s oil industry. In recent years, on the one hand, as the natural energy has been depleted and working fluid level is going down, most of old oilfields in the late development stage need deep pumping techniques to increase oil production; on the other hand, deep reservoirs are gradually being developed. For example, the average reservoir depth in Tahe oilfield of Northwest China is more than 6000  m. With the complex geological conditions and bad fluid properties, the working fluid level is very low and rapidly dropping to the limit depth of conventional sucker rod pumping system. The limit depth mainly depends on the polished rod load which increases with the pump depth. However, high polished rod load is disadvantageous to the whole system and even tends to exceed the operating range of the pumping unit. At present, aiming at the problem about how to reduce the polished rod load in the deep sucker rod pumping wells, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed. They are side-flow <b>pump,</b> <b>rod</b> load reducer, fiberglass–steel sucker rod and deep pumping with small-diameter pump.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{examples of}} this device were from {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century in the silver mining area of the Harz mountains, Germany, where they were driven by cranks connected to water wheels, although bucket hoists ("Hakenkunst") using the same method of operation had been used in Swedish iron mines since the 17th century. They appear to have evolved from an informal modification to the beam pumps, where the miners used spikes stuck into the wooden <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> to get themselves carried up the shaft. As beam pumps were universal in deep mines, it was a then simple development to make proper platforms to carry the miners. The first formal engine was installed in 1833 at a mine at Clausthal, Lower Saxony, where inspector Wilhelm Albert and manager Georg Dörell (1793–1854) fastened foot platforms and hand-holds to adjacent, reciprocating <b>pump</b> <b>rods,</b> using a waterwheel-driven pump put out of use when a new drainage adit was made at a lower level. The 1837 man engine at the Samson Pit in Sankt Andreasberg in the same region is still in use, although converted from water to electric power in 1922.|$|R
50|$|Early {{immigrants}} to the New World brought with them the technology of windmills from Europe. On US farms, particularly on the Great Plains, wind pumps were used to pump water from farm wells for cattle. In California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system, including a hand-dug well and a redwood water tower supporting a redwood tank and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouse). The self-regulating farm wind pump was invented by Daniel Halladay in 1854. Eventually, steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction, and at their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use, with capacity equivalent to 150 megawatts. Very large lighter wind pumps in Australia directly crank the pump with the rotor of the windmill. Extra back gearing between small rotors for high wind areas and the pump crank prevents trying to push the <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> down on the downstroke faster than they can fall by gravity. Otherwise pumping too fast leads to the <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> buckling, making the seal of the stuffing box leak and wearing through the wall of the rising main (UK) or the drop-pipe (US) so all output is lost.|$|R

40|$|Sprayer is a {{pesticide}} applicator tool {{which is}} used to control pests and plant diseases. The main problem of the hand sprayer is {{that it has to be}} picked up, so that the farmers should deal with the weight. A sprayer, that takes gasoline motor or batteries as power source, will manage the operating and maintenance costs high. Based on these problems, the idea to innovate the hand sprayer arises, by modifying it to be semi-automatic sprayer, which is carry-free and energy saving.

30|$|In deep-rod pumping wells, {{polished}} rod load {{tends to}} be very high and even exceeds the operating range of the pumping unit. To tackle the problem, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed till now. They are side-flow <b>pump,</b> <b>rod</b> load reducer, fiberglass sucker rod and deep pumping with small-diameter pump. However, some of them still cause certain problems when put into use. That indicates the fundamental mechanisms of these techniques {{have not yet been}} fully studied. In this paper, on the basis of conventional polished rod load calculation models, the new calculation models for these techniques are respectively established. The rod load reduction effects are comparatively analyzed by calculation. The results indicate that the differences in mechanisms lead to different reduction effects. Side-flow pump and deep pumping with small-diameter pump can largely reduce the liquid pressure load, but its reduction effect for the polished rod load is very limited. On the contrary, fiberglass sucker rod can greatly reduce the polished rod load by decreasing the weight of the sucker rod. Rod load reducer does not change the previous load; instead, it can create an additional reduction force. The potential disadvantages are also discussed. When using a side-flow pump, the resistance on the plunger caused by the liquid pressure would increase. This resistance may cause the sucker rod to bend when it is moving downwards. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump needs to use very small pump {{in order to get a}} relatively good reduction effect, so its application is limited. These disadvantages should be considered in practical application.|$|E

50|$|The flatrod system {{dates to}} the period before the {{invention}} of the steam engine and electricity. Using flatrods it was possible to operate man engines and pumping systems, even though the water wheel in question had a rotary, not a reciprocal, motion. So that the rods could be made to move in a reciprocal fashion, a change of direction had to be achieved by means of specially shaped components. The components of the system that were mounted in the mining shaft were called shaft <b>rods</b> (Schachtgestänge) or <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> (Hubgestänge). Systems mounted in drift mines were called drift rods (Streckengestänge).|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the flatrods was to {{transfer}} {{the power of the}} motive engine over greater distances to the <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> in the shaft. This was necessary if the motive engine could not be mounted above or immediately next to the mine shaft. A flatrod system had the disadvantage that there were additional efficiency losses due to the greater masses that had to be moved. The reciprocal motion in the joints (Schlösser) of the interconnected flatrods lead to lifting losses of from 25 to 50 percent. In addition the construction of flatrods required additional timber. This was very maintenance-intensive due to the effects of weathering and it needed additional staff to inspect and maintain the flatrods.|$|R
