40|$|A 24 -year-old {{woman who}} had {{sustained}} serious injuries in a road traffic accident required renal dialysis daily and was fed intravenously with a solution containing 25 % dextrose. Subsequently insulin had {{to be added to}} the <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluid</b> to maintain blood glucose concentrations at physiological values. On one occasion parenteral feeding was continued until dialysis was started; she became comatose and the plasma glucose concentration was found to be less than 1 mmol/l (18 mg/ 100 ml). She responded rapidly to a 50 ml intravenous bolus of 50 % dextrose. When parenteral feeding and dialysis are used simultaneously glucose passes across the semi-permeable membrane from the blood to the dialysate so that hypoglycaemia may occur. Insulin added to the <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluid</b> further decreases blood glucose concentrations. Stopping parenteral feeding 30 - 45 minutes before dialysis is started eliminates this danger of hypoglycaemia...|$|E

40|$|Many {{hospital}} pharmacies {{are reluctant}} to store admixed <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluids</b> longer than 24 to 48 h because of concern about possible microbial contamination. We evaluated the safety of prolonged refrigerated storage of admixtures by culturing mixtures in 471 bags prepared routinely in a hospital pharmacy and stored at 4 degrees C for up to 15 days. Low-level contamination (1 CFU per bag) was found in 3 of 253 solutions of saline and/or glucose into which nonantibiotic additives had been injected. None of 171 saline and/or glucose solutions with antibiotic additives or 47 <b>parenteral</b> nutrition <b>fluids</b> was culture positive. The risk of contamination did not increase with duration of storage, and none of 107 bags stored {{greater than or equal}} to 5 days was culture positive. Laboratory studies to measure growth of bacteria and fungi in glucose infusate and parenteral nutrition solutions confirmed that storage at 4 degrees C suppresses growth. Eight of twelve bacterial isolates grew in glucose solutions at 25 degrees C, while none grew at 4 degrees C. Of 13 species of bacteria and fungi inoculated in <b>parenteral</b> nutrition <b>fluids,</b> 8 proliferated at 25 degrees C and none proliferated at 4 degrees C. We conclude that refrigerated storage of <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluids</b> for up to 1 week following admixture, as permitted by Centers for Disease Control guidelines, does not appear to increase the risk of microbial contamination when standard aseptic procedures for admixing and storage are followed...|$|R

40|$|Background Studies amongst {{older people}} with acute dysphagic stroke {{requiring}} thickened fluids have assessed fluid intakes from combinations of beverage, food, enteral and parenteral sources, {{but not all}} sources simultaneously. The study aimed to comprehensively assess total water intake from food, beverages, enteral and parenteral sources amongst dysphagic adult in-patients receiving thickened fluids. Methods Patients requiring thickened fluid following dysphagia diagnosis were recruited consecutively from a tertiary teaching hospital’s medical and neurosurgical wards. Fluid intake from food and beverages was assessed by wastage, direct observation and quantified from enteral and parenteral sources through clinical medical records. Results No patients achieved their calculated fluid requirements unless enteral or parenteral fluids were received. The mean daily fluid intake from food was greater than from beverages whether receiving diet alone (food 807 ± 363 mL, food and beverages 370 ± 179 mL, p< 0. 001) or diet with enteral or <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluid</b> support (food 455 ± 408 mL, food and beverages 263 ± 232 mL, p< 0. 001). Greater daily fluid intakes occurred when receiving enteral and <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluid</b> in addition to oral dietary intake, irrespective of age group, whether assistance was required, diagnosis and whether stage 3 or stage 2 thickened fluids were required (p< 0. 05). After enteral and parenteral sources, food provided the most important contribution to daily fluid intakes. Conclusions The greatest contribution to oral fluid intake was from food, not beverages. Designing menus and food services which promote and encourage the enjoyment of fluid dense foods, in contrast to thickened beverages, may present an important way to improve fluid intakes of those with dysphagia. Supplemental enteral or <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluid</b> {{may be necessary to}} achieve minimum calculated fluid requirements. ...|$|E

40|$|This Guideline is {{intended}} to reiterate the NIH “best Practices ” used to ensure the sterility {{and the integrity of}} preservative-free pharmaceuticals and parenteral fluids administered to laboratory animals. Consideration of shorter storage times after opening a preservative-free pharmaceutical or <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluid</b> is warranted, because of the variety of conditions under which these products are stored and the potential for use of inappropriate aseptic technique 1. The US Pharmacopeia— National Formulary (USP-NF) states that opened containers of preservative-free saline for injection or IV fluids should be used within six (6) hours in an area with few particulates in the air 2. The “best practices ” listed below have been used at the NIH to safeguard the stability and efficacy of preservative-free products used in laboratory animals. 1. Procurement of smaller volume containers of preservative-free pharmaceuticals or parenteral fluids (e. g., saline, Lactated Ringers Solution, water for injection, etc.), that can be handled as a single-use container or discarded within a 24 -hour period is recommended. 2.

The {{objective of this}} study was to propose a practicable mother-friendly childbirth model tailored to Taiwanese women in order to improve the quality of perinatal care and maternal satisfaction. Material and methods: In this study, the guidelines of several countries were systematically reviewed, and a standard set of clinical guidelines were established by a focus group. In addition, a total of 172 Taiwanese obstetricians were visited, and a cross-sectional study of these obstetricians' attitudes toward the practicality and effectiveness of the model was performed using questionnaires. Results: A total of 10 suggestions were developed for this woman-friendly childbirth model, including: (1) intermittent fetal monitoring for low-risk pregnancy, (2) no routine enema, (3) no routine perineal shaving, (4) no routine restricted oral intake, (5) no routine <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluid</b> support, (6) no routine elective amniotomy, (7) nonpharmacological pain management, (8) upright position during childbirth, (9) delayed pushing, and (10) restrictive episiotomy. Taiwanese obstetricians approved of no routine oral intake restriction and providing nonmedical pain relief. The majority of obstetricians disagreed that perineal shaving and routine elective amniotomy were necessary, and agreed to modify their practice according to the suggestions. Suggestions were still being debated, such as no routine <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluid</b> support, using an upright position for childbirth, and delayed pushing. Intermittent fetal monitoring for low-risk pregnancy, no routine enema, and restrictive episiotomy were questioned by many Taiwanese obstetricians. Conclusion: Several suggestions were made in this model. However, there was still no consensus of Taiwanese obstetricians. More evidence for the advantages and disadvantages of the various suggestions was needed to convince Taiwanese obstetrician to modify their routine practice...|$|E

40|$|This {{article will}} provide a pathophysiologic basis for the {{assessment}} of critically ill children who have developed disorders of urine volume. The anatomical and pathophysiologic causes of oliguria and polyuria are considered. The physiologic basis for the use of urinary sodium and osmolarity as a guide to the assessment of patients with disorders of urine volume are discussed in detail. In addition, guidelines for the management of children with acute renal failure, with particular emphasis on the consideration for nutritional support of these patients, is discussed {{as a part of the}} comprehensive approach to this problem. This article emphasizes an understanding of the pathophysiology of salt and water excretion by the kidney as a foundation to the diagnosis and management of patients with oliguria and polyuria. In a critically ill patient, the volume or rate of urine excretion is used, frequently, as an index of cardiovascular stability, cardiac output, and peripheral perfusion.

40|$|The {{parenteral}} kinetics of sulbactam, {{a potent}} synergist with ampicillin against {{a broad range}} of clinically important organisms in humans, {{are similar to those of}} ampicillin. The kinetics of ampicillin were not affected by co-administration of sulbactam, and high levelsof both agents were attained: IS-min infusions of 2 g of ampicillin plus 1 g of sul-bactam produced peak serum concentrations of "-' 120 ug of ampicillin/ml plus 60 ug of sulbactam/ml; intramuscular injections of 1 g of ampicillin plus 0. 5 g of sulbactam produced peak concentrations of 18 ~g of ampicillin/ml plus 13 ug of sulbactam/ml. The drugs had similar half-lives ("-'I hr), and both drugs were excreted primarily in the urine (> 75070). Although the kinetics of sulbactam in postpartem women and in surgical patients were similar to the kinetics in young men, the half-life of sulbactam (like that of ampicillin) was altered in the elderly, during labor, in neonates, and in patients with renal impairment.

40|$|Guidelines on the {{diagnosis}} and management of urinary tract infections in childhood do not {{address the issue of}} abnormalities in Na(+), K(+), Cl(-) and acid-base balance. We have conducted a narrative review of the literature with the aim to describe the underlying mechanisms of these abnormalities and to suggest therapeutic maneuvers. Abnormalities in Na(+), K(+), Cl(-) and acid-base balance are common in newborns and infants and uncommon in children of more than 3  years of age. Such abnormalities may result from factitious laboratory results, from signs and symptoms (such as excessive sweating, poor fluid intake, vomiting and passage of loose stools) of the infection itself, from a renal dysfunction, from improper <b>parenteral</b> <b>fluid</b> management or from the prescribed antimicrobials. In addition, two transient renal tubular dysfunctions may occur in infants with infectious renal parenchymal involvement: a reduced capacity to concentrate urine and pseudohypoaldosteronism secondary to renal tubular unresponsiveness to aldosterone that presents with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and acidosis. In addition to antimicrobials, volume resuscitation with an isotonic solution is required in these children. In secondary pseudohypoaldosteronism, isotonic solutions (such as 0. 9  % saline or lactated Ringer) correct not only the volume depletion but also the hyperkalemia and acidosis. In conclusion, our review suggests that in infants with infectious renal parenchymal involvement, non-renal and renal causes concur to cause fluid volume depletion and abnormalities in electrolyte and acid-base balance, most frequently hyponatremia...|$|E

30|$|The {{mechanism}} by which BMD decreases in intensive care patients is probably multi-factorial. Among the potential culprits are (1) immobilization, which can be extreme under anesthesia or sedation and induced muscle paralysis; (2) metabolic and endocrine disturbances with secretion of stress hormones highly catabolic for bone such as cortisol; (3) use of medications such as steroids, heparin, furosemide, or anticonvulsants; (4) nutritional depletions in patients fed parenterally or unfed at all; and (5) sun deprivation.
