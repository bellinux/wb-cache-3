25|$|Artecoll. Both Artecoll and ArteFill are {{not used}} to inject the body of the lips because the {{substance}} is heavy and would show as white through the thin skin of the lips. Additionally, both products contain tiny microspheres known as PMMA (<b>polymethylmethacrylate)</b> which remain in the face permanently. In cases where Artecoll has been used {{around the edges of the}} lips to remove fine lines and wrinkles, some patients have reported annoying nodules or small lumps. In a few cases, surgery was required to remove the Artecoll.|$|E
500|$|Textile fibers are {{a mixture}} of {{crystalline}} and amorphous substances. Therefore, the measurement {{of the degree of}} crystalline gives useful data in the characterization of ﬁbers using X-ray diffractometry. It has been reported that X-ray diffraction was used to identify of a [...] "crystalline" [...] deposit which was found on a chair. The deposit was found to be amorphous, but the diffraction pattern present matched that of <b>polymethylmethacrylate.</b> Pyrolysis mass spectrometry later identiﬁed the deposit as polymethylcyanoacrylaon of Boin crystal parameters.|$|E

2500|$|The surgery {{involves}} {{exposure of}} {{the front of the}} knee, with detachment of part of the quadriceps muscle (vastus medialis) from the patella. [...] The patella is displaced {{to one side of the}} joint, allowing {{exposure of the}} distal end of the femur and the proximal end of the tibia. The ends of these bones are then accurately cut to shape using cutting guides oriented to the long axis of the bones. The cartilages and the anterior cruciate ligament are removed; the posterior cruciate ligament may also be removed [...] but the tibial and fibular collateral ligaments are preserved. Metal components are then impacted onto the bone or fixed using <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> (PMMA) cement. Alternative techniques exist that affix the implant without cement. [...] These cement-less techniques may involve osseointegration, including porous metal prostheses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{replacement}} joint, {{which was}} known as the Low Friction Arthroplasty, was lubricated with synovial fluid. The small femoral head (...) was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or UHMWPE acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> (PMMA) bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants.|$|E

British ophthalmologist Sir Harold Ridley observed that Royal Air Force pilots who sustained eye injuries during World War II involving PMMA windshield material did not show any rejection or foreign body reaction.

50|$|Interim palatal lift {{prostheses}} retentive clasps {{that engage}} undercuts formed with composite resin or orthodontic brackets are fashioned from custom bent orthodontic wire that {{is embedded in}} the <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> component of the prosthesis. The orthodontic wire extends from the <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> to engage the gingival aspect of the composite resin or orthodontic bracket serving to provide the prosthesis’ retentive undercut. If the orthodontic wire clasp terminated at its approximation with the dental abutment undercut it engages as do conventional removable partial denture clasps, the interim palatal lift prosthesis could be difficult to insert and remove. Thus, the orthodontic wire clasps used to retain interim palatal lift prostheses are sometimes extended in a mesial direction up to two mesiodistal tooth diameters. Clasps designed in this fashion can be flexed laterally by patients or their caregivers to facilitate the insertion and removal of the interim palatal lift prosthesis.|$|E
50|$|An interim palatal lift {{prosthesis}} generally {{consists of}} two or more stainless steel wire retentive clasps embedded in <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> that adapts to the hard palatal and soft palatal mucosal surfaces and the lingual aspects of the maxillary teeth. An interim palatal lift prosthesis carries a current dental terminology code number of D5958. A definitive palatal lift prosthesis generally consists of a thin cast metallic alloy lamina that covers the hard palatal mucosa and the lingual aspects of the maxillary teeth and incorporates retentive clasps that strategically engage undercut dental surfaces to enhance the retentive capacity of the prosthesis. The cast metallic portion of a definitive palatal lift prosthesis typically harbors a posterior cast metal lattice that retains a <b>polymethylmethacrylate</b> oropharyngeal section of the prosthesis responsible for elevating the soft palate. A definitive palatal lift prosthesis carries a current dental terminology code number of D5955. Definitive and interim palatal lift prostheses both carry current procedural terminology code numbers of 21083.|$|E
