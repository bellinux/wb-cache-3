40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} structural disorder {{on the nature}} of force propagation inside three dimen-sional particle packings is systematically studied using computer simulations of model granular assemblies. Starting from a face-centred cubic array, where all contact forces are identical, particles are removed at ran-dom and the system is then allowed to relax into a new mechanically stable state. The probability distribution function of normal contact forces, P (f), quickly deviates from a delta-function, with a dramatic {{increase in the number of}} small forces and becomes increasingly asymmetric. Stress transmission is investigated in the ordered array by applying a <b>perturbative</b> <b>force</b> in the central region of the packing. The propagating stress is mapped and visualised inside the packing. This is repeated for varying magnitudes of the perturbation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{structural}} disorder on the stress response inside three dimensional particle assemblies is studied using computer simulations of frictionless sphere packings. Upon applying a localised, <b>perturbative</b> <b>force</b> within the packings, the resulting Green 2 ̆ 7 s function response is mapped inside the different assemblies, thus providing an explicit {{view as to}} how the imposed perturbation is transmitted through the packing. In weakly disordered arrays, the resulting transmission of forces is of the double-peak variety, but with peak widths scaling linearly with distance from the source of the perturbation. This behaviour is consistent with an anisotropic elasticity response profile. Increasing the disorder distorts the response function until a single-peak response is obtained for fully disordered packings consistent with an isotropic description...|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of Saturn's F Ring {{have been a}} matter of curiosity ever since Voyagers 1 and 2 sent back pictures of the ring's unusual features. Some of these images showed three distinct ringlets with the outer two displaying a kinked and braided appearance. Many models have been proposed to explain the braiding seen in these images; most of these invoke perturbations caused by the shepherding moons or km sized moonlets imbedded in the ring and are purely gravitational in nature. These models also assume that the plasma densities and charges on the grains are small enough that electromagnetic forces can be ignored. However, Saturn's magnetic field exerts a significant <b>perturbative</b> <b>force</b> on even weakly charged micron and sub-micron sized grains causing the grains to travel in epicyclic orbits about a guiding center. This study examines the effect of Saturn's magnetic field on the {{dynamics of}} micron-sized grains along with gravitational interactions between the F Ring's shepherding moons, Prometheus and Pandora. Due to differences in the charge-to-mass ratios of the various sized grains, a phase difference between different size populations is observed in the wavy orbits imposed by passage of the shepherding moons.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{introductory}} Section 1, it is outlined how path-integrals {{have made their}} appearance in quantum mechanics through Feynman's formalism. In Section 2, it is recalled that Gaussian path-integrals, defined as those in which the action is an integral whose integrand is a polynomial of at most the second degree in every dynamical variable involved, can be cast into the form F(tb, ta) exp[iScl(b, a) /ħ] where F(tb, ta) is a coefficient solely depending on the initial time-instant ta and the final time-instant tb, and Scl(b, a) denotes the classical action. Section 3 {{is devoted to the}} calculation of a simple formula for the factor F(tb, ta) {{in the case of a}} single particle in one euclidean dimension whereby the most general quadratic form of the Lagrange function is considered. The method is based upon successive transformations of various related auxiliary Gaussian path-integrals which are introduced. Applying Feynman's theorem and making use of the well-known property K(xb,tb;xa,ta) =∫+∞−∞K(xb,tb;x,t) K(x,t;xa,ta) dx satisfied by quantummechanical Green's functions, constitute important steps in the theoretical development. At the end, F(tb, ta) is expressed solely in terms of two functions which one encounters in the description of the classical particle trajectory.

40|$|International audienceGrip force {{applied to}} an object held between the {{thumb and index}} finger is {{automatically}} and unconsciously adjusted upon perception of an external disturbance to the object. Typically, this adjustment occurs within approximately 100 ms. Here, we investigated the effect of anticipatory vibrotactile cues prior to a <b>perturbative</b> <b>force,</b> which the central nervous system may use for rapid grip re-stabilization. We asked participants to grip and hold an instrumented, actuated handle between the {{thumb and index finger}}. Under computer control, the handle could suddenly be pulled away from a static grip and could independently provide vibration to the gripping fingers. The mean latency of corrective motor action was 139 ms. When vibrotactile stimulation was applied 50 ms before application of tractive force, the latency was reduced to 117 ms, whereas the mean latency of the conscious response to vibrotactile stimuli alone was 229 ms. This suggests that vibrotactile stimulation can influence reflex-like actions. We also examined the effects of anticipatory cues using a set of perturbative loads with different rising rates. As expected, facilitation of grip force adjustment was observed for moderate loads. In contrast, anticipatory cues had an insignificant effect on rapid loads that evoked an adjustment within 60 - 80 ms, which approaches the minimum latency of human grip adjustment. Understanding the facilitative effects of anticipatory cues on human reactive grip can aid the development of human-machine interfaces to enhance human behavior...|$|E

It was found that this mathematical analysis could as well be applied to Star and Planets system and since every star could potentially contain an extra-solar system, hence we have a large ensemble of exoplanets to test our new perspective on the birth and evolution of solar systems. Till date 403 exoplanets have been discovered in 390 extra-solar systems. I have taken 12 single planet systems, 4 Brown Dwarf - Star systems and 2 Brown Dwarf pairs. Following architectural design rules are corroborated through this study of exoplanets. All planets are born at inner Clarke Orbit what we refer to as inner geo-synchronous orbit in case of Earth-Moon System. By any <b>perturbative</b> <b>force</b> such as cosmic particles or radiation pressure, the planet gets tipped long of aG 1 or short of aG 1. Here aG 1 is inner Clarke Orbit. The exoplanet can either be launched on death spiral as CLOSE HOT JUPITERS or can be launched on an expanding spiral path as the planets in our Solar System are. It was also found that if the exo-planet are significant fraction of the host star then those exo-planets rapidly migrate from aG 1 to aG 2 and have very short Time Constant of Evolution as Brown Dwarfs have. This vindicates our basic premise that planets are always born at inner Clarke Orbit.

40|$|The Lorentz force {{acted on}} a charged {{spacecraft}} via interaction with planetary magnetic field provides new means of propellantless electromagnetic propulsion. Active modulation {{of the surface}} charge allows the spacecraft to perform orbital maneuvers. By assuming the Earth’s magnetic field could be modeled as a tilted dipole that co-rotates with Earth, a nonlinear dynamical model describing the orbital motion of Lorentz spacecraft with respect to J 2 -perturbed orbit is developed using Lagrangian mechanics. Two potential applications of the proposed model, J 2 -perturbed Lorentz-aug-mented spacecraft hovering and Lorentz-propelled rendezvous, are considered in this paper. Fuel-optimal control strategies are designed for hovering, and optimal trajectory of the specific charge of Lorentz spacecraft for propellantless rendezvous that minimizes the consumption of control energy is also derived via Gauss pseudospectral method. To capture the interactive effect of J 2 perturbations and Lorentz force on relative motion, comparisons are made between results derived from J 2 -perturbed model and unperturbed model for both applications. Numerical simulations prove {{the validity of the}} proposed relative dynamical model and the applicability of Lorentz force in J 2 -perturbed spacecraft hovering and rendezvous.

40|$|Low Earth Orbit (LEO) {{missions}} {{provide a}} unique means of gathering information about many of Earth s aspects such as climate, atmosphere, and gravitational field. Among {{the greatest challenges}} of LEO missions are designing, predicting, and maintaining the spacecraft orbit. The predominant <b>perturbative</b> <b>forces</b> acting on a spacecraft in LEO are J 2 and higher order gravitational components, the effects of which are fairly easy to predict, and atmospheric drag, which causes the greatest uncertainty in predicting spacecraft ephemeris. The continuously varying atmospheric drag requires increased spacecraft tracking in order to accurately predict spacecraft location. In addition, periodic propulsive maneuvers typically must be planned and performed to counteract the effects of drag on the spacecraft orbit. If the effects of drag could be continuously and autonomously counteracted, the uncertainty in ephemeris due to atmospheric drag would essentially be eliminated from the spacecraft dynamics. One method of autonomous drag compensation that has been implemented on some missions is drag-free control. Drag-free control of a spacecraft was initially proposed in the 1960 's and is discussed extensively by Lange. His drag-free control architecture consists of a free-floating proof mass enclosed within a spacecraft, isolating it from external disturbance forces such as atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure. Under ideal conditions, internal disturbance forces can be ignored or mitigated, and the orbit of the proof mass depends only on gravitational forces. A sensor associated with the proof mass senses {{the movement of the}} spacecraft relative to the proof mass. Using the sensor measurements, the spacecraft is forced to follow the orbit of the proof mass by using low thrust propulsion, thus counteracting any non-gravitational disturbance forces. If the non-gravitational disturbance forces are successfully removed, the spacecraft s orbit will be affected only by well-known gravitational forces and will thus be easier to predict...|$|R
