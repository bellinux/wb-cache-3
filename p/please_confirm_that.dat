5000|$|The Taoiseach's {{speech was}} criticised by some. In the Dáil, Catherine Connolly {{directly}} addressed the speech, stating: [...] "A shocking discovery, according to everyone, and particularly to yourself Taoiseach. But {{this is something}} that Galway has been aware of for a long time, highlighted by Catherine Corless back in 2014, in her painstaking and self-funded research. By the witnesses, the many, many women who went before the commission of inquiry into child abuse which culminated in the Ryan Report, as far back as 2009. They told their stories about their experience in Mother and Baby Homes. It was {{brought to the attention of}} Martin McAleese when he concluded his report on the Magdalene laundries. So none of this is shocking to the survivors. What is shocking to the survivors, and to me, is the carefully crafted words that you’ve come into the chamber with. And, in particular, that you say 'no nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children', 'we gave them up to what we convinced ourselves was the nuns' care' and so on. I don’t doubt your bona fides, a thaoisigh, but I certainly doubt your judgement in reading that out, a carefully crafted speech with a sentence like that in these circumstances. My question: please answer. Where is the interim report that has sat with the minister since September last year? <b>Please</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> the site will be sealed off as any crime scene is sealed off." ...|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of amino acid and nucleotide sequences, especially sequence alignment, {{is one of}} Abstract the most commonly performed tasks in modern molecular biology((Author: <b>please</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> rewording is ok)). However, for many tasks in bioinformatics, the requirement for the features in an alignment to be consecutive is restrictive and `n-grams' {{have been used as}} features instead((Author: <b>please</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> rewording is ok)). N-grams are usually short nucleotide or amino acid sequences of length n, but the unit for a gram may be chosen arbitrarily. The n-gram concept is borrowed from language technologies where n-grams of words form the fundamental units in statistical language models. Despite the demonstrated utility of n-gram statistics for the biology domain, there is currently no publicly accessible generic tool for the efficient calculation of such statistics. Most sequence analysis tools will disregard matches {{because of the lack of}} statistical significance in finding short sequences. This article presents the integrated Biological Language Modeling Toolkit (BLMT) that allows efficient calculation of n-gram statistics for arbitrary sequence datasets...|$|E
