500|$|Differences between prior mercantilists and Cantillon arise {{early in}} Essai, {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} wealth and <b>price</b> <b>formation</b> on the market. Cantillon distinguishes between wealth and money, considering wealth in itself [...] "nothing but the food, conveniences, and pleasures of life." [...] While Cantillon advocated an [...] "intrinsic" [...] theory of value, based on the input of land and labour (cost of production), he is considered to have touched upon a subjective theory of value. Cantillon held that market prices are not immediately decided by intrinsic value, but are derived from supply and demand. He considered market prices to be derived by comparing supply, the quantity of a particular good in a particular market, to demand, the quantity of money brought to be exchanged. Believing market prices to tend towards the intrinsic value of a good, Cantillon may have also originated the uniformity-of-profit principle—changes in the market price of a good may lead to changes in supply, reflecting a rise or fall in profit.|$|E

Long-term panel data of land prices for two major metropolitan areas were first compiled, based on the Public Notifications.

The space-time structure of land price changes within the Tokyo area was studied using one- and two-dimensional diffusion models, where monocentricity of fund supplies to the land market is assumed. It is concluded, regardless of dimensions, that heat conduction provides a good analogy for the space-time behavior of land market: diffusion coefficients suggest that the land price increase has propagated fastest towards north-north-east and south-south-west, and slowest along the orthogonal direction.
