50|$|On 15 May 2000 the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament (CSP), a {{pressure}} group formed in 1974, dispatched <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> <b>to</b> the chief {{officer of the}} Duchy of Cornwall, the Lord Warden of the Stannaries. This <b>invoice</b> demanded <b>a</b> refund of a calculated £20 billion overcharge in taxation on tin production from 1337-1837. This was calculated according to production figures and historic wealth calculation methods (from an unpublished thesis of a Harvard University undergraduate dating from 1908), and The Sunday Times Rich List, March 2000, respectively. Cornwall was charged at over twice the rate levied on the adjacent county of Devon. On 17 May 2000 The Guardian reported that the CSP claimed that the Duchy had levied an excess tax on tin production in Cornwall for five hundred years, and requested repayment within 120 days. The CSP argued that their action demonstrated how Cornwall was treated separately from England in the past, and thus should have special status today. They declared that if they received the money it would be spent on an agency to boost Cornwall's economy.|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} {{on which}} PrimeRevenue’s SCF transactions are done is called OpenSCi, and includes analytical and onboarding tools alongside its SCF platform. The SCF platform allows suppliers to trade their receivables for advance payment. Payment is then {{made to the}} supplier within about a day, {{in exchange for the}} receivable and interest on the payment until the receivable is processed. Instead of waiting for <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> <b>to</b> be paid by the purchaser at 60 to 180 days after purchase, PrimeRevenue fills invoices on-demand for suppliers through the online software suite. This money is charged at an interest rate that is lower than the rate offered by short-term loans from the bank. The financing is done from a range of fifty financiers, from banks to sovereign funds to institutional investors. The company has sales and development offices in Prague, Frankfurt, Paris, Melbourne, London, Atlanta, New Delhi and Hong Kong. Financing can also be done using Electronic Time Drafts in the US, which resolves cross-state transaction issues by making the required jurisdiction Federal instead of state.|$|R
5000|$|Carriers that {{participate}} in airline alliances such as Star Alliance, SkyTeam or oneworld, almost always have interline agreements with each other. However even direct competitors {{can benefit from}} interline agreements. When a ticket is issued for an interline itinerary, one of the airlines in that itinerary will be selected by the ticketing agent as the issuing airline, {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "plating carrier". The plating carrier collects the entire fare from the customer, either via own sales channels (e.g., web site or ticket office), or via travel agents. Travel agent remit collected fare and taxes to the plating carrier via Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) in the US, or Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) in rest of the world. The airline which actually carried the passenger (the operating airline) will send <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> <b>to</b> the issuing/plating carrier, normally via IATA Clearing House, to collect its portion of fare and taxes.

50|$|Electronic <b>Invoicing</b> can be <b>a</b> {{very useful}} {{tool for the}} AP department. Electronic <b>invoicing</b> allows vendors <b>to</b> submit <b>invoices</b> over the {{internet}} and have those invoices automatically routed and processed. Because invoice arrival and presentation is almost immediate invoices are paid sooner; therefore, {{the amount of time}} and money it takes <b>to</b> process these <b>invoices</b> is greatly reduced. (Financial Operations Networks, 2008) These solutions usually involve a third party company that provides and supports an application which allows a supplier <b>to</b> submit <b>an</b> electronic <b>invoice</b> <b>to</b> their customer for immediate routing, approval, and payment. These applications are tied to databases which archive transaction information between trading partners. (US Bank, Scott Hesse, 2010) The invoices may be submitted in a number of ways, including EDI, CSV, or XML uploads. PDF files, or online invoice templates. Because E-invoicing includes so many different technologies and entry options, it is used as an umbrella term to describe any method by which <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> is electronically presented to a customer for payment.|$|R

5000|$|Multipart or {{multi-part}} stationery is {{paper that}} is blank, or preprinted {{as a form}} to be completed, comprising a stack of several copies, either on carbonless paper or plain paper interleaved with carbon paper. The stationery may be bound into books with tear-out sheets to be filled in manually, continuous stationery (fanfold sheet or roll) for use in suitable computer printers, or as individual stacks, usually crimped together. The purpose is to produce multiple simultaneous copies of a document produced by handwriting with a pen that applies pressure, such as a ballpoint pen, or with an impact printer. [...] The pressure of writing or impact printing on the carbon or carbonless paper transfers the content to the copy sheets. Depending upon requirements, up to typically four copies of the original can be made, with the quality and readability decreasing towards the bottom copies.This type of stationery can be used whenever multiple copies are required, of quality adequate for the purpose, usually noticeably inferior to, for example, laser-printed output. Typically a company may need a document such as <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> <b>to</b> give <b>to</b> <b>a</b> customer (original), with a copy for their own accounting department (first copy), and possibly further copies for other purposes. The paper stock used is typically of low weight—thin—to transfer more printing pressure.
