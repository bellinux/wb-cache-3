5|$|The tugs {{took the}} hulk of the Temeraire in tow at 7:30 am on 5 September 1838, taking {{advantage}} of the beginning of the slack water. They had reached Greenhithe by 1:30 pm at the , where they anchored overnight. They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing Woolwich and then Greenwich at noon. They reached Limehouse Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at 2 pm. The Temeraire was hauled up onto the mud, where she lay as she was slowly broken up. The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder <b>pintles</b> and gudgeons, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.|$|E

50|$|The European {{structures}} are typically stucco coated, with a drive type <b>pintle</b> built diagonally into the masonry prior to stucco finish. A lag screw <b>pintle</b> {{can be substituted}} for the drive <b>pintle.</b> Brick structures can employ a similar embedded <b>pintle,</b> or a surface mounted <b>pintle.</b> Storm type strap hinges are typically in Europe, American examples are often tapered.|$|R
50|$|The offset can {{no longer}} be evenly divided between the hinge and the <b>pintle.</b> Lay a hinge or <b>pintle</b> on a flat surface. Call the {{distance}} from that surface {{to the middle of the}} hinge barrel or the <b>pintle</b> pin the Standoff. Each will have a different standoff. The sum of the hinge and <b>pintle</b> standoff will equal the offset.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pintle</b> is a pin or bolt, usually {{inserted}} into a gudgeon, {{which is used}} {{as part of a}} pivot or hinge. Other applications include <b>pintle</b> and lunette ring for towing, and <b>pintle</b> pins securing casters in furniture.|$|R

2500|$|Inside {{the south}} porch is a wicket door, {{the only known}} one in an American colonial church. It {{consists}} of five vertical sections and three horizontal sections each divided by battens. [...] The smaller door is located within the middle three battens vertically and the central one horizontally. Cyma reversa mouldings are used on the battens. In the 1960s, {{the area around the}} doorway’s segmental arch was covered with a layer of plaster. [...] The doorway’s wooden molding is of a cyma reversa, reverse S, curve. On the hinge side is a large wooden peg that keeps the upper hinge from pulling out of the frame. The hinges consist of thick <b>pintles</b> at {{the top and bottom of}} the left side of the door. The door is said to weigh 1,000 pounds.|$|E
2500|$|The English barn (also {{known as}} a three-bay barn, Connecticut barn, Yankee barn, thirty-by-forty and {{sometimes}} confusingly called a New England barn) was built from a very early date in the northeast United States. The defining characteristics are the big, swinging doors on the sidewall with strap hinges mounted on <b>pintles</b> and three or sometimes four bays. The doors being on the side walls creates the spatial arrangement of the bays being the main divisions of these barns. The English barns were built {{during the period of}} using scribe rule framing (the irregular timbers were laid out and scribed to fit together). The framing was raised in sidewall assemblies, made with hewn timbers, in northern New England frequently had common purlin roofs, and often framed with the English tying joint on flared (gunstock) posts although these are not defining characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Standoff - The <b>pintle</b> {{standoff}} is {{the distance}} {{from the face of the}} casement to the mid-line of the <b>pintle</b> pin. The hinge standoff is {{the distance from}} the face of the shutter to the center-line of the hinge barrel. Adding the <b>pintle</b> standoff to the hinge standoff results in the total offset.|$|R
50|$|If {{propellant}} B is {{the fuel}} and A the oxidizer, the <b>pintle</b> arrangement {{can be set}} up to get fuel-film cooling of the inside of the combustion chamber essentially automatically; also, <b>pintle</b> injectors allow deep throttling without large losses in combustion efficiency. <b>Pintle</b> injectors also avoid acoustic combustion instability, and therefore have an excellent safety record.|$|R
50|$|Surface {{mounting}} {{seems the}} simpler approach. We've used a modified jamb <b>pintle</b> on a custom installation where a full board shutter allowed strap hinges {{to be installed}} high enough on the shutter to cover the <b>pintle</b> in the open position. My favorite surface approach {{is to use a}} notched hinge with a matching <b>pintle.</b> A 405 lift-off will work.|$|R
2500|$|The M2 {{had a high}} {{superstructure}}, with a sponson-mounted {{machine gun}} in each corner. In addition, two more machine guns were fixed in the glacis plate and fired by the driver. Surmounting the superstructure was a small revolving turret armed with a 37mm Gun M3 and a coaxial machine gun. The 37mm gun could penetrate 46mm of face-hardened armor sloped 30° at a range of , and 40mm at [...] This armament configuration was a hybrid between the sponson-mounted weapons of the Mark VIII Liberty tank of World War I vintage, and the combination of turreted cannon, coaxial machine gun and glacis-mounted machine gun that was almost universal in World War II medium tanks. (Two additional [...]30-caliber machine guns could be mounted on <b>pintles</b> {{on either side of}} the turret for anti-aircraft use, bringing the total to nine—surely a record for any tank brought into service by any army.) The crew consisted of the tank commander, a driver and four gunners. The vehicle provided internal stowage for 200 rounds of 37mm ammunition and up to 12,250 rounds of [...]30-caliber.|$|E
2500|$|Decatur {{immediately}} {{met with}} disaster. He had ordered gunboats as harbor pilots {{to mark the}} safe passage across the bar with anchored boats {{at the mouth of}} the harbor, but they failed to do so properly. President grounded on the bar and remained stuck there for almost two hours, enduring a pounding from the wind and heavy sea. Decatur claimed that by the time the frigate worked free it was heavily damaged: some copper was stripped away from the hull; the masts were twisted and some of them [...] "sprung," [...] i.e. had developed long cracks; and the hull was twisted and [...] "hogged," [...] i.e. the bow and stern sagged. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of the hogging when's when the ship was surveyed on its arrival in Britain, although damage to the copper and <b>pintles</b> was recorded. Furthermore, President's sailing performance was not hampered by the grounding as she managed to outsail every ship in the squadron including the fast Leda class frigate Tenedos, with the exception of Endymion which was considered the [...] "Fastest ship in the Royal Navy" [...] which logged speeds faster than the clipper ship Rainbow 1845. Furthermore, Endymion excelled in light winds such as those in which the chase was held. Although her accompanying vessels headed for safety, Decatur claimed it impossible for President to return to port as the gale was still blowing. The logs from the British squadron claimed the gale had stopped, though strong winds persisted. It was unlikely that the open [...] gunboats could have been safely put out to mark a passage if the gale had persisted also suggesting the gale had stopped. Decatur claimed was forced to put to sea. Whether he truly could not wait out the storm was not clear, but given the strong westerly winds, what appeared to be the best decision would be to put out to sea. He headed east, keeping close to the Long Island shore before heading southeast.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the modern}} eye, the tank is hardly {{recognizable}} as such and appears as an armoured steel box resting {{on top of}} a caterpillar tractor. [...] It has no turret, and its inconspicuous main armament is a fortification 75mm Blockhaus Schneider, placed in a barbette in the right front corner of the tank. [...] The right side had been chosen because the gunner had to stand {{to the left of the}} barrel to operate the gun. [...] The cannon type was developed from a 75mm trench mortar that had been adapted to fire from a fixed fortification position by adding a recoil compensator and a gun shield; in this configuration it weighed 210 kilogrammes. [...] This short-barrelled cannon had a length of just 9.5 calibres. It fired the standard French HE Model 1915 75mm shell but with a reduced propelling charge, shortening the length of the round from 350 to 241 millimetres, allowing for a muzzle velocity of only two hundred metres per second. This limited the maximum range to 2200 metres, the practical range was six hundred metres and the tank needed to close within two hundred metres of a point target to allow for precision shooting. [...] The gun has a traverse of 60°, a depression of -10° and an elevation of 30°. [...] The ammunition stock is ninety vertically stowed rounds. [...] Two 8mm Hotchkiss Model 1914 machine guns, projecting from the flanks in large hemispherical ballmounts, and resting on <b>pintles,</b> complement the short 75mm gun. The right machine gun is, because of the room needed for the main gun, positioned more to the rear than the left one. [...] The machine guns have a traverse of 106°, a depression of -45° and an elevation of 20°. [...] To the right of the cannon there is a bin for twenty readily accessible 75mm rounds. [...] Three other bins are positioned respectively at the extreme right rear corner (fourteen rounds), to the left of the engine (thirty-two) and at the left rear corner (twenty-four). The latter is situated to the right of a bin, at the extreme left corner, for the stock of four thousand rounds of 8mm ammunition. In 1918, in practice fifty belts with ninety-six rounds were carried, for a total of 4800 rounds.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{surface mounted}} hinge and <b>pintle</b> {{can be used}} - {{assuming}} there is sufficient width to the casing to accept the <b>pintle.</b> The hinge has a minimal standoff, and the <b>pintle</b> would have the same, matching standoff.

50|$|<b>Pintle</b> is also {{a common}} term used {{in the design of}} {{aircraft}} landing gears. It describes the attachment point between the landing gear structure and the aircraft structure. The <b>pintle</b> is the bolt around which the landing gear rotates when it is extended/retracted into/out of the aircraft. The <b>pintle</b> is a highly stressed component during landing manoeuvres and is often made from exotic metal alloys.|$|R
50|$|During the American Civil War, U.S. Army {{equipment}} was identical to Confederate Army equipment, essentially identical to French equipment, and {{similar to that}} of other nations. The field artillery limber assumed its archetypal form - two wheels, an ammunition chest, a <b>pintle</b> hook at the rear, and a central pole with horses harnessed on either side. The artillery piece had an iron ring (lunette) {{at the end of the}} trail. To move the piece, the lunette was dropped over the <b>pintle</b> hook (which resembles a modern trailer hitch). The connection was secured by inserting a <b>pintle</b> hook key into the <b>pintle.</b>|$|R
60|$|The funnel {{had gone}} {{overboard}} {{in one of}} the heavy rolls; two of their three boats had disappeared, washed away in bad weather, and the davits swung to and fro, unsecured, with chafed rope's ends waggling to the roll. Nothing was done on board, and Falk told me how he had often listened to the water washing about the dark engine-room where the engines, stilled for ever, were decaying slowly into a mass of rust, as the stilled heart decays within the lifeless body. At first, after the loss of the motive power, the tiller had been thoroughly secured by lashings. But in course of time these had rotted, chafed, rusted, parting one by one: and the rudder, freed, banged heavily to and fro night and day, sending dull shocks through the whole frame of the vessel. This was dangerous. Nobody cared enough to lift a little finger. He told me that even now sometimes waking up at night, he fancied he could hear the dull vibrating thuds. The <b>pintles</b> carried away, and it dropped off at last.|$|E

50|$|A <b>pintle</b> {{injector}} is a coaxial injector. Propellant stream A (fuel or oxidizer) {{flows through}} an outer tube, coming {{out as a}} cylindrical stream, while propellant stream B (complement of A) flows in an inner tube and impinges on a <b>pintle</b> shaped similarly to a car-engine poppet valve, which causes B to spray outward in a broad cone or flat sheet that intersects the cylindrical stream of propellant A. In some variants the <b>pintle</b> has grooves cut into it to produce radial jets {{in the flow of}} propellant B.|$|R
50|$|The barbette {{carriages}} {{were designed}} to fire over a parapet and {{could be used in}} either permanent or temporary fortifications. The front <b>pintle</b> carriage pivoted {{at the front of the}} chassis. This made the gun mount more compact and allowed the gun and detachment to be better protected by embrasures and traverses. The center <b>pintle</b> carriage gave the gun a 360° traverse and was stronger for guns firing at high angles because the <b>pintle,</b> the strongest part of the carriage, would have been under the breech when the gun was fired at high angles.|$|R
