40|$|Each year, potato late blight [Phytophthora erythroseptica] {{and pink}} rot [PhytolAthora erythroscptica] are {{responsible}} for significant postharvest economic losses. Because of restrictions {{on the use of}} synthetic fungicides on food, there is Currently a need for less toxic, disease-controlling compounds for postharvest application. To address this need, the preventative and curative effects, as well as seed piece phytotoxicity, of various salt compounds were tested using live tubers of the potato 'Superior'. Compounds were tested as dips at the concentrations 0. 002, 0. 02, 0. 2 mol/L and compared with a distilled water dip as a control. Tubers were inoculated with sporangia of P infestans or active zoospores of P. erythroseptica either before or after treatment with the various compounds. When concentration data were pooled and grouped means were tested for significant differences (P < 0. 05). <b>potassium</b> sorbate, sodium <b>metabisulfite,</b> alum, sodium hypochlorite, copper sulfate pentahydrate, acetic acid, and Penncozeb (R) 75 DF applied curatively provided disease inhibition that was significantly greater than that of the control for both late blight and pink rot. When applied as a preventative treatment, all compounds were significantly different (P < 0. 05) from the untreated control in the inhibition of pink rot; however, only sodium metabisulfite, sodium hypochlorite, copper sulfate pentahydrate, and Penncozeb 75 DF significantly reduced the severity of late blight. Phytotoxicity was observed when sodium hypochlorite, sodium metabisuffite, acetic acid, and copper sulfate pentahydrate were applied as seed piece treatments, at a concentration of 0. 2 mol/L. Our studies suggest there is a potential for the use of selected salt compounds for control of postharvest diseases of potato.

50|$|After primary {{fermentation}} {{slows down}} significantly the mead is then racked {{into a second}} container. This is known as secondary fermentation. Some larger commercial fermenters are designed to allow both primary and secondary fermentation to happen inside of the same vessel. Racking is done for two reasons: it lets the mead sit away from {{the remains of the}} yeast cells (lees) that have died during the fermentation process. Second, this lets the mead have time to clear. If the mead maker wishes to backsweeten the product or prevent it from oxidizing, <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulfite</b> and potassium sorbate are added.

5000|$|Small {{amounts of}} sulfur dioxide gas {{addition}} (or equivalent <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulfite</b> addition) to fermented wine to produce traces of sulfurous acid (produced when SO2 reacts with water) and its sulfite salts in the mixture, has been called [...] "the most powerful tool in winemaking." [...] After the yeast-fermentation stage in winemaking, sulfites absorb oxygen and inhibit aerobic bacterial growth that otherwise would turn ethanol into acetic acid, souring the wine. Without this preservative step, indefinite refrigeration of the product before consumption is usually required. Similar methods go back into antiquity but modern historical mentions of the practice go to the fifteenth century. The practice is used by large industrial wine producers and small organic wine producers alike.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "wine stabilizer", {{potassium}} sorbate produces sorbic acid when added to wine. It serves two purposes. When active fermentation has ceased {{and the wine}} is racked for the final time after clearing, potassium sorbate renders any surviving yeast incapable of multiplying. Yeast living at that moment can continue fermenting any residual sugar into CO2 and alcohol, but when they die, no new yeast will be present to cause future fermentation. When a wine is sweetened before bottling, potassium sorbate is used to prevent refermentation when {{used in conjunction with}} <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulfite.</b> It is primarily used with sweet wines, sparkling wines, and some hard ciders, but may be added to table wines, which exhibit difficulty in maintaining clarity after fining.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of white grapes in Australia are machine harvested. Machine harvesting inevitably results in berry breakage as grapes are shaken from vines. Contact between the expressed juice and grape skins prior to winery draining and pressing results in extraction of phenolic compounds from grape skins. These compounds can persist throughout the winemaking process and produce inferior bitter and astringent white wines {{with a greater}} tendency to brown. In this work laboratory studies of phenolic extraction were performed with three different batches of grapes, over a range of relevant temperatures, times, <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulfite</b> additions (an additive commonly used with machine harvested grapes in vineyards) and degrees of berry breakage. Specific experiments were performed using full factorial designs with three levels of temperature, six levels of time, and either three levels of <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulfite</b> addition or berry breakage. Two different juice fractions (corresponding with different yields) were collected for phenolic analysis. Time, temperature, <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulfite</b> addition and berry breakage all significantly increased phenolic extraction. The relationship between phenolic extraction and the explanatory variables differed for the two juice fractions. Plots of phenolic extraction are presented together with results from multiple regression analysis. Simon Nordestgaard, Brian O'Neill[URL]...|$|E

Contrarily, when <b>potassium</b> <b>metabisulfite</b> was used, the changes in color were quite negligible right after the treatment and even lower after the storage period of 6 days under refrigeration.
