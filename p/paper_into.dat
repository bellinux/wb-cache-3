5|$|The {{highest ranking}} {{casualty}} of this engagement was Gen. Heth, who {{was struck by}} a bullet in the head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> a new hat, which was otherwise too large for his head. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive during this phase of the battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.|$|E

25|$|Hill’s {{ideas for}} postage stamps and {{charging}} paid-postage based upon weight soon took hold, and were adopted {{in many countries}} throughout the world.

25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{interest}} in Leonardo's inventions escalated. There {{have been many}} projects which have sought to turn diagrams on <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> working models. One of the factors is the awareness that, although in the 15th and 16th centuries Leonardo had available a limited range of materials, modern technological advancements have made available a number of robust materials of light-weight which might turn Leonardo's designs into reality. This is particularly the case with his designs for flying machines.|$|E
25|$|Taking over as {{editor-in-chief}} following Alexandru Beldiman's {{death in}} 1898, {{he led the}} <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> opposition to the PNL cabinet of Dimitrie Sturdza, whom he argued had betrayed the generoşi in his party by endorsing reactionary policies. During the elections of 1899, the newspaper, through its correspondent Ioan Bacalbaşa, investigated alleged violence by government forces in Slatina. At the time, Mille was proposed as an independent candidate for Teleorman County, running for the Third Electoral College (that of peasants), and came to serve a mandate in the Chamber of Deputies. He was again elected during the 1907 suffrage.|$|E
25|$|Born {{and raised}} in Palazzolo Acreide in the {{province}} of Siracusa in Sicily, he moved to Catania to study law. Graduating in 1947, he soon moved to journalism and became a professional journalist in 1952. He became {{the editor in chief of}} Espresso Sera daily newspaper in Catania — the main city on Sicily's east coast — and in 1980 of Il Giornale del Sud, where he formed a team of young journalists that turned the <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> an independent, investigative journal. At the time, not much was known about the owners, but it became clear that some of them had connections with the Mafia. Fava was fired.|$|E

25|$|The National Guardian evolved {{with these}} changes, but {{nevertheless}} developed {{its own internal}} strife between James Aronson and the publication's Old Left tradition with {{a new generation of}} explicitly revolutionary staffers, who sought to turn the <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> a more radical and activist publication. The break came in February 1968 when Aronson sold his National Guardian stock to the newspaper's staff and the paper was reorganized under new editorial leadership and a new name — The Guardian. Continuity with the earlier incarnation of the paper was limited, with radical foreign correspondents Anna Louise Strong in China and Wilfred Burchett in Southeast Asia continuing in their previous roles. Jack A. Smith began his 13-year stint as editor of the revamped paper as part of the change, stepping down only in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Surviving crewmembers of Bismarck {{state that}} they {{received}} this message in shock. Rather than harden the resolve of the German crew, the tone of Lütjens' speech implied the ship was in some difficulty and {{that they may not}} reach a friendly port. It depressed the mood about the battleship and created uncertainty among all ranks. They interpreted Lütjens' words to mean the Admiral did not believe they would survive. Lindemann recognised the damage it caused and tried to present a more optimistic view of the situation. He spoke of the U-boats and Luftwaffe that were gathering to help them home. The speech, an hour later, only partially succeeded in restoring morale. That afternoon Lütjens received messages of best wishes from Hitler and Raeder. The former was short and curt. Lütjens purportedly stuffed the <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> his pocket without comment.|$|E
25|$|In the 8th century Arabs {{learned the}} arts of {{papermaking}} from the Chinese and were then the first to bind <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> books {{at the start of}} the Islamic Golden Age. Particular skills were developed for Arabic calligraphy, miniatures and bookbinding. The people who worked in making books were called Warraqin or paper professionals. The Arabs made books lighter—sewn with silk and bound with leather covered paste boards, they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed. The production of books became a real industry and cities like Marrakech, Morocco, had a street named Kutubiyyin or book sellers, which contained more than 100 bookshops in the 12th century. The famous Koutoubia Mosque is named so because of its location on this street. Because the Qur'an itself was considered a sacred object, in order to beautify the book containing the holy scripture, a culture of calligraphy and lavish bookbinding developed.|$|E

25|$|The {{diaphragm}} {{is usually}} manufactured with a cone- or dome-shaped profile. A {{variety of different}} materials may be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal. The ideal material would 1) be rigid, to prevent uncontrolled cone motions; 2) have low mass, to minimize starting force requirements and energy storage issues; 3) be well damped, to reduce vibrations continuing after the signal has stopped {{with little or no}} audible ringing due to its resonance frequency as determined by its usage. In practice, all three of these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials; thus, driver design involves trade-offs. For example, paper is light and typically well damped, but is not stiff; metal may be stiff and light, but it usually has poor damping; plastic can be light, but typically, the stiffer it is made, the poorer the damping. As a result, many cones are made of some sort of composite material. For example, a cone might be made of cellulose <b>paper,</b> <b>into</b> which some carbon fiber, Kevlar, glass, hemp or bamboo fibers have been added; or it might use a honeycomb sandwich construction; or a coating might be applied to it so as to provide additional stiffening or damping.|$|E

His conclusion was that [...] "Near the bridges the feculence rolled up in clouds so dense that they were visible at the surface, even in water of this kind.... The smell was very bad, and common to the whole of the water; it was the same as that which now comes up from the gully-holes in the streets; the whole river was for the time a real sewer." [...] The smell from the river was so bad that in 1857 the government poured chalk lime, chloride of lime and carbolic acid into the waterway to ease the stench.|$|E

500|$|Besides copying the Simpsons credits, the Itchy & Scratchy credits also parody the {{sequence}} {{seen at the}} end of the credits of many TV shows produced by Stephen J. Cannell, where Cannell sits at the typewriter in his office and throws a sheet of <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> the air, with it forming of part of his production company's logo. In the episode, Itchy and Scratchy are seen at a desk; Scratchy pulls a sheet from his typewriter and throws it into the air, where it forms an [...] "I & S Productions" [...] logo. Mike Reiss later met Cannell, who was so pleased with the homage that he hugged Reiss. The title of the episode is a reference to The Front, a 1976 film about writers fronting for blacklisted writers in the 1950s. The Simpsons writers considered trying to make the episode plot resemble that of the film, but in the end decided against it.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1944, Robert Oppenheimer persuaded Fermi to {{join his}} Project Y at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Arriving in September, Fermi was {{appointed}} an {{associate director of the}} laboratory, with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics, and was placed in charge of F Division, which was named after him. F Division had four branches: F-1 Super and General Theory under Teller, which investigated the [...] "Super" [...] (thermonuclear) bomb; F-2 Water Boiler under L. D. P. King, which looked after the [...] "water boiler" [...] aqueous homogeneous research reactor; F-3 Super Experimentation under Egon Bretscher; and F-4 Fission Studies under Anderson. Fermi observed the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, and conducted an experiment to estimate the bomb's yield by dropping strips of <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> the blast wave. He paced off how far they were blown by the explosion, and calculated the yield as ten kilotons of TNT; the actual yield was about 18.6 kilotons.|$|E
500|$|After the 1910 cricket season, Fender {{worked in}} a paper mill in Horwich, Lancashire, to {{experience}} paper manufacturing—his father's line of business—at first hand. While feeding <b>paper</b> <b>into</b> a machine, his left hand was trapped in the mechanism and injured. Three of his fingers were crushed at the tips; upon healing, they remained stiff and numb {{for the rest of}} his life. Fender remained in Horwich at the start of the 1911 cricket season and played several times for Manchester Cricket Club. He was on the verge of selection for Lancashire when he had to return to Brighton. That season he played twice for Sussex; the following year, in his second match for the county, he scored his maiden first-class century, against Oxford University. He followed this by taking five for 42 (five wickets taken and 42 runs conceded) against Surrey. After these successes, Fender played [...] regularly for the remainder of the 1912 season. In total, he scored 606 runs at an average of 24.24, and, bowling medium pace, took 16 wickets at an average of 25.50.|$|E
