5|$|Advance voting {{took place}} in 901 <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in the country. Expatriate voting took place between 6 and 9 April at 241 <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> at {{embassies}} and consulates. One national electronic voter list was used for early voting; though for the 17 April poll, voters could only vote at their designated local polling station. The expatriate voter turnout in 91 countries rose by 2.2% to a record-high 10.7%, with 35,000 people casting their votes. In addition, 400 Finns voted on ships at sea.|$|E

5|$|After the election, the Conservatives {{were accused}} of {{cheating}} in the Robocall scandal, mainly suppressing votes by directing voters to bogus <b>polling</b> <b>stations.</b> There were complaints in 247 of Canada's 308 ridings, but only one person was charged; Conservative staffer Michael Sona was convicted and jailed.|$|E
50|$|Australia House {{is usually}} the single largest <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> in Australian federal elections, with more votes being cast at the London <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> than at any <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> {{in any of the}} Australian States or Territories.|$|R
50|$|The {{presiding}} {{officer and}} the poll clerk(s) {{are responsible for}} maintaining order in the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> (this includes ensuring that candidates/agents/tellers {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> do not interfere with the election process and/or impede voters' access to/from the <b>polling</b> <b>station,</b> and removing any campaign literature from inside the <b>polling</b> <b>station)</b> and ensuring the secrecy and security of all ballots cast. They are under a duty to act impartially at all times.|$|R
50|$|The early {{votes are}} {{transported to the}} voter's <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> in double envelopes. On {{election}} day, a voter can vote at the <b>polling</b> <b>station.</b> Before the early vote is counted, officials check if the voter has voted at the <b>polling</b> <b>station.</b> If that is the case, the vote is destroyed, with the inner envelope unopened. Early votes that do not reach the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> in time are transported to the County Administrative Board and counted if the voter has not already voted.|$|R
5|$|<b>Polling</b> <b>stations</b> {{are set up}} {{in public}} {{buildings}} throughout the country; voters may only vote at their assigned polling station (according to their permanent residence), but voters deployed abroad in the armed forces, voters on Croatian-flagged ships and imprisoned voters are allowed to vote elsewhere. Other voters residing in Croatia, but traveling abroad on election day may vote at Croatian diplomatic missions. <b>Polling</b> <b>stations</b> are open from 7:00am until 7:00pm, but all voters present at the <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> at closing time are allowed to vote. <b>Polling</b> <b>stations</b> may be closed early if all registered voters have voted. Presidential election ballots contain a list of candidates verified by the State Electoral Commission, in alphabetical order. This entails the name and PIN of each candidate, {{and the names of}} political parties endorsing the candidate (or a note that the candidate is running as an independent. The names are preceded by ordinal numbers. Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate {{and the name of the}} person heading the list, in addition to candidates, who is not necessarily a candidate on the particular list, but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the list—usually head of the party of coalition at the national level. The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number. Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid. Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus Municipality has 45 electoral wards and <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in four electoral districts for the Folketing (national Parliament). The {{diocese of}} Aarhus has four deaneries {{composed}} of 60 parishes within Aarhus municipality. Aarhus municipality contains 21 postal districts and {{some parts of}} another 9. The urban area of Aarhus and the immediate suburbs are divided into the districts Aarhus C, Aarhus N, Aarhus V, Viby J, Højbjerg and Brabrand.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the threat}} from Iselle, {{lieutenant}} governor candidate Warner Sutton requested that Governor Neil Abercrombie postpone the August9 primary. The governor declined the request, and the primary election occurred as scheduled. However, the storm damaged roads leading to two <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> on the Big Island, prompting officials to decide the election by absentee ballot in those areas. After a close campaign between incumbent Senator Brian Schatz and Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa, the senate primary, held {{on the same day}} as the gubernatorial primary, was too close to call after Schatz led by only 1,635votes. As a result, the election hinged on the two closed <b>polling</b> <b>stations,</b> where more than 8,000people had the option to vote by mail. This was later changed to an in-person vote for August15, despite a challenge from the Hanabusa campaign with regards to storm damage, and Schatz ultimately won. The Hawaii American Civil Liberties Union later sued the state over how they handled the election.|$|E

5000|$|Their {{complaints}} were not prosecuted by the police, {{on the advice}} of the Attorney-General Chan Sek Keong. The Attorney-General, in his letter to the Minister of Law, interpreted the statute as being irrelevant to people within the <b>polling</b> <b>station,</b> and that remaining within a perimeter of 200 meters from the external walls of the <b>polling</b> <b>station,</b> as opposed to being within the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> itself, was not an offence. He added that [...] "the possibility of a person inside a <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> influencing or intimidating voters {{in the presence of the}} presiding officer and his officials, the polling agents etc was considered so remote that it was discounted by the Act." ...|$|R
5|$|If, on {{nomination}} day, {{there are}} two or more candidates nominated for election, the returning officer must immediately adjourn the election so that a poll can be taken. He or she must assign each candidate an approved symbol to be printed on the candidate's ballot paper and announce by publishing a notice of contested election in the Government Gazette with information about the forthcoming poll, including the candidates' names and symbols, the date of polling day (which must be not earlier than the 10th day or later than the 56th day after {{the date of the}} notice) and the locations of <b>polling</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|E
5|$|One {{third of}} the council is elected each year, {{followed}} by one year without elections. At the 2008 election, for example, there were 70 candidates contesting 20 seats. In 2007, turnout at the <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> ranged from 26% in Orton Longueville to 55% in Central ward. At the previous election, voters were required to provide a signature before being issued with a ballot paper. This pilot scheme trialled new procedures which are now included in the Electoral Administration Act 2006.|$|E
5|$|Paid {{promotion}} largely {{followed this}} pattern, as the HDZ and the SDP were two dominant parties {{in that field}} as well. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted in its report that the largest parties reported their advertising spending below their actual value, and the largest proportion of expenditure was for television ads. Election silence is in force {{on the day of}} the elections and the previous day, ending at 7 in the evening as <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> close and exit polls may be published after that time.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian Parliament tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with {{referendum}} voting organization, ballot counting, {{and result}} publication. The committee scheduled the referendum vote for 22 January 2012 starting at 07:00 and lasting until 19:00, at regular <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in Croatia, in Croatian military units, in Croatian diplomatic missions abroad, on Croatian-flagged vessels and in prisons: 6,750polling stations in all. For the referendum, all <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> were grouped {{in a single}} district. Voters traveling abroad were permitted {{to vote in the}} Croatian diplomatic missions as with Croatian presidential elections; however, the initial instructions by the Ministry of Public Administration did not allow voters within Croatia who were away from their place of residence to vote in the referendum, nor did it allow absentee ballots. GONG, the Croatian election supervision NGO, requested that the authorities correct this. One restriction was removed by 3 January, when voters were permitted to register to vote in Croatia away from their legal residence. Registration was possible until 7 January, in person, by fax, or by e-mail. When the registration process completed in early January 2012 ahead of the referendum, there were 4,504,686voters in the voter registry (the same one used in parliamentary and presidential elections).|$|E
5|$|All officers, clerks, interpreters, {{candidates}} and candidates' agents at <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> must maintain the secrecy of voting in stations. Before the poll is closed, {{they must not}} communicate to anyone the name of any elector who has not yet voted or his or her or identification number on the electoral register. They are prohibited from communicating information obtained during the counting of votes as to which candidate has been voted for in any particular ballot paper. Furthermore, no person is allowed {{to try to find}} out from within a polling station who a voter intends to vote for or has voted for, or to communicate with a voter after he has been given a ballot paper but before he has placed it in a ballot box.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{was also}} {{reported}} in Prince Edward Island {{as a result}} of the storm, particularly around Charlottetown, where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to pleasure craft and sea walls, as well as significant damage to the older urban forest in that city's downtown core. Extensive tree damage was also reported across the island, as well as structural damage to weaker buildings, such as barns and silos. The hurricane left portions of the island without power. The narrow path meant that damage was quite localized; little damage was reported in New Brunswick or western Prince Edward Island. Voting in the PEI general election on September29 was also disrupted, though more than 80% of voters made it to <b>polling</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, {{following}} {{the terrorist attacks}} {{that occurred in the}} United States on 11 September 2001 and American military action in Afghanistan on 7 October, the Government decided to temporarily suspend overseas voting at the 2001 general election as having large numbers of Singaporeans congregating at known locations at known times could put them at risk of further terrorist attacks. Therefore, overseas voting first took place at the 2006 general election. The number of Singapore citizens who registered to vote overseas was 1,017, and of these, 553 resided in the 16 constituencies that were contested in the election. Eventually, 335 electors voted at eight <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> around the world.|$|E
5|$|The left-leaning {{politics}} of the area is still reflected to some extent in local political views. The Dunedin South electorate, of which Caversham is a part, tends to return New Zealand Labour Party Members of Parliament and support this and other left-of-centre parties. In the 2008 New Zealand general election, 54.8% of valid party votes cast in Caversham's two <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> were for the Labour Party and 10.4% were for the three other main left-of-centre parties (Green, Alliance, and Progressive). The vote for these parties over the whole Dunedin South electorate was 46.7% and 9.4% respectively. The equivalent figures for New Zealand as a whole were 34.0% and 7.7% respectively.|$|E
5|$|Any Croatian citizen {{over age}} 18 {{may be a}} {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that {{a sufficient number of}} endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a limitation on the number of endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates, or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled to indicate a vote). All votes are counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral commissions during local elections. Decisions of the electoral commissions may be appealed at the Constitutional Court of Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Croatia's county prefects, {{city and}} town mayors are elected to {{four-year}} terms {{by a majority}} of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves, based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council (as required by the constitution), adding further members to the council (who belong to the appropriate minorities) by selecting them from unelected-candidate lists. Election silence, as in all other elections in Croatia, is enforced on the day of the elections and the previous day, ending at 7:00pm when the <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> close and exit polls may be announced.|$|E

This only temporarily placated the VNQDD, which continued its skirmishes against the Vietminh. Eventually, Chinese pressure on the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi saw them accept a coalition government, in which Tam served as foreign minister. For the communists' part, they accused the KMT of intimidating them into sharing power with the VNQDD, and claimed that VNQDD soldiers had tried to attack <b>polling</b> <b>stations.</b> The VNQDD claimed that the communists had engaged in vote fraud and intimidation, citing Vietminh claims that they had received tallies in excess of 80% in areas controlled by French troops.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was later}} {{introduced}} {{to amend the}} type of data collected and stored in the National Register of Electors. On 17 May 2007, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs regarding Bill C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act submitting a letter in which she criticised the proposed changes to the Elections Act. One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of birth in the voter lists sent to <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth year would be sufficient. The second problem she raised was inclusion of the date of birth in the voter lists sent to each candidate for all electoral districts in Canada, and also to all political parties.|$|E
