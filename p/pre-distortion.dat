2500|$|Distortion is {{a feature}} {{available}} on many guitar amplifiers {{that is not}} typically found on keyboard or bass guitar amplifiers. Tube guitar amplifiers can produce distortion through <b>pre-distortion</b> equalization, preamp tube distortion, post-distortion EQ, power-tube distortion, tube rectifier compression, output transformer distortion, guitar speaker distortion, and guitar speaker and cabinet frequency response. Because many factors beyond preamp distortion contribute to a particular guitarist's sound, recording engineers and PA system techs typically put a microphone {{in front of the}} guitar speaker, rather than only use the guitar amp's pre-amp out signal. [...] A sound engineer or music producer may send the DI out signal from the pickups to a separate track at the same time, so they can re-amp the signal later. In contrast, it is fairly common to use a DI box with electric bass.|$|E

In this illustration the compression is shown as the deviation from the ideal 45° line. The amplifier with <b>pre-distortion</b> linearizer (solid line) deviates from the ideal line at a much higher power level.

5000|$|Multidimensional Digital <b>Pre-distortion</b> (MDDPD), often {{referred}} to as multiband digital <b>pre-distortion</b> (MBDPD), is a subset of digital predistortion (DPD) that enables DPD to be applied to signals (channels) that cannot or do not pass through the same digital pre-distorter but do concurrently pass through the same nonlinear system. Its ability to do so comes from the portion of multidimensional signal theory that deals with one dimensional discrete time vector input - 1-D discrete time vector output systems as defined in Multidimensional Digital Signal Processing. [...] The first paper in which it found application was in 1991 as seen here. None of the applications of MDDPD are able {{to make use of the}} linear shift invariant (LSI) system properties as by definition they are nonlinear and not shift-invariant although they are often approximated as shift-invariant (memoryless).|$|E
50|$|Just as {{the digital}} <b>pre-distortion</b> in MDDPD {{is applied to}} the {{channels}} independently, the feedback sampling of the channels may also be done independently. In addition, as was mentioned previously, MDDPD allows the predistortion to be applied to channels that are generated independently. This enables the application of and thereby benefit of predistortion in systems which would not traditionally be able to benefit from one dimensional DPD.|$|E
50|$|Linear chirps with a time-bandwidth {{product of}} less than 2000, say, {{are found to be}} very {{tolerant}} of Doppler frequency shifts, so main pulse width and the time sidelobe levels show little change for Doppler frequencies up to several percent of system bandwidth, In addition, linear chirps which use phase <b>pre-distortion</b> to lower sidelobe levels, as described in an earlier section, are found to be tolerant of Doppler.|$|E
50|$|The Instrument EQ was {{specifically}} designed for use with the Sustainor and Distortion Generator. The EQ frequencies were tailored for use with musical instruments, putting {{an emphasis on the}} mid range frequencies. Its intended place in a Rockmodule lineup is after the Sustainor or Distortion Generator, but before the chorus and echo effects. It can also be used as a <b>pre-distortion</b> EQ, when placed in the Sustainor effects loop.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pre-distortion</b> linearizer {{works by}} {{creating}} signal distortion (amplitude and phase) {{that is the}} complement of the signal distortion inherent in the High-Powered Amplifier. The signal to be amplified is first passed through the linearizer, distorting the signal, with no loss in gain. The distorted signal is then fed to the High-Powered Amplifier to be amplified. The distortion inherent in the High-Powered Amplifier negates the distortion introduced by the linearizer producing a near linear transfer characteristic.|$|E
50|$|Creating {{circuits}} {{with the}} inverted behaviour to the amplifier {{is one way}} to implement this concept. These circuits counteract the non-linearities of the amplifier and minimize the distiortion of the signal. This increases linear operating range up to the saturation (maximum output power) of the amplifier. Linearized amplifiers have a significantly higher efficiency with improved signal quality. There are different concepts to linearize an amplifier, including pre- and post-distortion and feedback linearization. Most commonly used is <b>pre-distortion</b> linearization.|$|E
5000|$|The XP series {{started in}} 1989 as a rack mounted {{programmable}} preamplifier called the XPR that {{was intended for}} direct connection to a full range PA system. There is a three band EQ that allows <b>pre-distortion</b> changes to the EQ. The clean signal can also be mixed with the distorted signal. The distortion {{is followed by a}} second 5 band EQ. The effects follow, including a stereo chorus that has a programmable sweep speed, along with a reverb.|$|E

50|$|The Sustainor {{was first}} {{released}} in 1986. The Sustainor includes a preamp/compressor, a noise gate, distortion and filters, {{along with a}} cabinet simulation. Another feature is the auto-clean circuit that allows controlling the guitar distortion by adjusting the guitar volume knob. The Distortion Generator is a related product that was released in 1987. The Distortion Generator includes compression, distortion and cabinet simulation circuitry. Compared to the Sustainor, the Distortion Generator lacks the noise gate and external loop, but includes a three band <b>pre-distortion</b> EQ.|$|E
50|$|Figure 1 {{shows the}} {{amplification}} (gain) contingent upon input power. The gain compression of the amplifier starts above a certain input power level (red curve).By adding a <b>pre-distortion</b> linearizer (blue curve) {{in front of}} the amplifier, the gain compression effect is compensated up to a certain power level (green curve). The point where the gain of the total system is starting to drop off is pushed to a higher power level thereby increasing the linear operating range. In practice, the linear output power level of an amplifier increases significantly (up to four times).|$|E
50|$|Holt was {{technically}} correct, as the Dynagroove process used tracing compensation, which pre-distorted {{the record}} groove {{to cancel out}} the distortion created by playback with a conical-shaped phonograph stylus, which could not track the record groove accurately in the high frequencies, especially in the inner grooves of an LP. The process worked well with playback via a conical stylus, typical of most phonograph cartridges prior to about 1964. However, if one played a Dynagroove record with an elliptical-shaped stylus, this <b>pre-distortion</b> became audible. As {{the decade of the}} 1960s progressed, high quality playback cartridges increasingly used elliptical styli. This development made tracing compensation obsolete by about 1970, and RCA quietly stopped using the technique.|$|E
50|$|The Fresnel ripples on a chirp {{spectrum}} {{are very}} obtrusive, especially when time-bandwidth products are low (under 50, say) and their presence leads to high time sidelobe levels when chirps {{are subject to}} pulse compression as in radar and sonar systems. They arise because of the sudden discontinuities in the chirp waveform at the commencement and termination of the pulse.Although {{there are a number}} of procedures that can be applied to reduce the ripple levels, they are not all equally effective. Furthermore, some of the methods require amplitude shaping, or amplitude modulation, of the chirp pulse and this makes those methods unsuitable when, for example, the chirp pulses are to be transmitted by a power amplifier operating in a near-limiting condition. For such systems only the methods using frequency (or phase) <b>pre-distortion</b> are appropriate.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of the ability to reduce the ADC sampling rate, groups of channels must have their own down-conversion to baseband for sampling, thereby increasing the number of mixers and local oscillators (LO) or synthesizers. LOs and synthesizers are not trivial components in designs. Also, as will be seen later, the number of coefficients that must be solved for is much larger than the number of coefficients that would need to be solved for in one dimensional DPD. Finally, there must be a high-speed channel between the different channel sources as in order to adapt the digital pre-distorter and apply the <b>pre-distortion</b> as each source must have the channel information from each and every one of the other sources as will be shown in the derivation and approaches sections.|$|E
5000|$|The {{approaches}} seen in, and [...] {{attempt to}} break the problem into two orthogonal problems and deal with each separately {{in order to reduce}} the feedback sampling bandwidth over that of 1D DPD (hopefully to that of MDDPD). They break the application of the <b>pre-distortion</b> and model extraction into in-band and interband systems. It is stated that correction of interband inter-modulation distortion (IMD) generates inband IMD and that if the fully orthogonal polynomials are applied properly this will no longer be the case.

5000|$|A {{number of}} other works, {{with a variety of}} {{approaches}} to pulse compression, are listed below. New methods of generating non linear chirp waveforms and of improving their Doppler tolerance has been investigated by Doerry Further studies of Hyperbolic chirps have been carried out by Kiss, Readhead, Nagajyothi and Rajarajeswari and Yang and Sarkar. Convolution windows have been investigated by Sahoo and Panda who show that they can result in very low sidelobes yet be Doppler tolerant, but may suffer from some pulse broadening. [...] Wen and his co-workers have also discussed convolution windows. Some new window functions have been proposed by Samad and Sinha and Ferreira, which claim improved performance over the familiar functions.
