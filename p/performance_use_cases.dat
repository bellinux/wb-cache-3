Public transport services suffer from all kind of disturbances, varying demand patterns, weather conditions, incidents, road works, et cetera. Current practice uses all kinds of operational measures to ensure the quality of the services despite of these disturbances. In network evaluation and network design, however, reliability is usually not considered. The research presents an extensive overview of phenomena affecting public transport service quality, as well as a framework and instrument to determine the influence of the network on reliability indicators and the total network <b>performance.</b> <b>Using</b> <b>case</b> studies a number of measures is analysed with respect to their effectiveness. This research demonstrates that already at the level of public transport service network design there are possibilities to improve service reliability: for example networks in which travellers have multiple options to travel to their destination and networks in which line lengths are limited. However, it is dependent on the specific situation whether this will lead to an improvement of the overall network performance as well. For rail-bound public transportation, for instance tram, is proves to be possible to implement smart infrastructure measures, for instance turning facilities and shortcuts, to improve both service reliability and total network performance.

As real-time performance requirements begin to emerge, the latency involved in a handover from one access point to another becomes crucial. CAPWAP and HOKEY are two suites of protocols being defined and standardized within the IETF that include support for fast handover. IEEE 802. 11 r is implementing extensions to the IEEE 802. 11 base specification to directly support fast handover in the MAC protocol. This article details all three protocols, and compares their relative security properties, <b>performance,</b> and <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> between APs as a mobile STA transitions {{from one to the other}} [6]. Each of these protocols offers a complementary approach to solving the problem of fast handover. This article describes each, and outlines their relative security properties.

Resource agents in manufacturing {{are members of}} a network whose possible logical topologies and governing interaction protocol influence the scheduling and control in the MAS.

A Java-based MAS was also developed to simulate different scenarios of task allocation and to compare the four models in terms of some scheduling <b>performance</b> indicators, <b>using</b> <b>cases</b> from manufacturing.

Music also continues having to justify its place in many secondary schools (Philpott, 2012).
