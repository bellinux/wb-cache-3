25|$|Very tall {{buildings}} ("skyscrapers"), when built using modern lightweight materials, might sway uncomfortably (but not dangerously) in certain wind conditions. A {{solution to this}} problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, and moving on some sort of bearing system such as an air cushion or hydraulic film. Hydraulic pistons, <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>electric</b> pumps and <b>accumulators,</b> are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion – with or without applied power – in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten story) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake.|$|R

50|$|An {{electric}} supercharger, {{if supplied}} <b>by</b> common stock <b>electric</b> <b>accumulators,</b> runs {{independent of the}} engine to which it provides its boost. However, electrical energy consumed is often higher than what a production-line generator (e.g. alternator) of the engine can supply. Larger alternators are therefore fitted to recharge accumulators during the engine run.|$|R

50|$|Electric motors, in general, produce motion when <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>electric</b> currents. The {{common type}} of {{spacecraft}} ion drive uses electrostatic forces to accelerate ions to generate forces to create motion, and thus {{can be considered as}} unconventional electric motors.|$|R
