5000|$|At low {{frequencies}} (such as AM broadcast), arrays of vertical towers {{are used to}} achieve directionality [...] and they will occupy large areas of land. For reception, a long Beverage antenna can have significant directivity. For non directional portable use, a short <b>vertical</b> <b>antenna</b> or small loop antenna works well, with the main design challenge being that of impedance matching. With a <b>vertical</b> <b>antenna</b> a loading coil {{at the base of}} the antenna may be employed to cancel the reactive component of impedance; small loop antennas are tuned with parallel capacitors for this purpose.|$|R

5000|$|A major {{practical}} {{drawback to}} this band {{is that because}} of the length of the waves, full size resonant antennas (half wave dipole or quarter wave monopole antennas) cannot be built because of their physical height. <b>Vertical</b> <b>antennas</b> must be used because VLF waves propagate in vertical polarization, but a quarter-wave <b>vertical</b> <b>antenna</b> at 30 kHz would be 2.5 kilometers high. So practical transmitting antennas are electrically short, a small fraction of a wavelength long. [...] Due to their low radiation resistance they are inefficient, radiating only 10% to 50% of the transmitter power at most, [...] {{with the rest of the}} power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances. Very high power transmitters (~1 megawatt) are required to radiate enough power for long distance communication.|$|R

[...] The width of the red area perpendicular to the wire at any point is proportional to the current. At resonance the current is the tail part of a sinusoidal standing wave. In the <b>vertical</b> <b>antenna</b> (a), the current must go to zero at the top. In the T (b), the current flows into the horizontal wire, increasing the current in the top part of the vertical wire. The radiation resistance and thus the radiated power in each, is proportional to the square of the area of the vertical part of the current distribution.|$|R

From the measure of transmitted pressure in the lowest velocity media, we want to identify the source signal emitted in the first medium. We show how we can reconstruct the time dependence of the transient source signal by analogy of the simple reconstruction formula of the inverse wavelet transform, due {{to the presence of}} "surface" or "lateral" contribution. We show that this reconstruction involves an integration over depths (dilation paramaters) of the transmitted pressure (wavelet coefficient) along a <b>vertical</b> line (<b>antenna)</b> with a specific analyzing wavelet.
