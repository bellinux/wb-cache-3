30|$|Several unique control banding (CB) {{solutions}} {{have been}} identified [6] that utilize exposure and hazard banding to evaluate occupational risk for nanomaterials. Each CB tool offers alternative methodologies in order to estimate the exposure potential and hazard, and hence classify the prevailing risk within a ranking matrix. For example, NanoSafer [7] combines a hazard evaluation derived from data provided by technical information sheets, with an exposure assessment determined by the occupational setting and production rates to provide case-specific risk assessment of manufactured nanomaterials. Similarly, the Nano-Evaluris [8] CB solution assesses occupational inhalation risk pertaining to nanopowders by combining hazard and exposure band estimates with protective measures taken, process emission evaluation and frequency of use. The <b>physical</b> <b>form</b> (<b>solid,</b> liquid, powder or aerosol) of a manufactured nanomaterial is {{used to determine the}} exposure/emission potential within the French agency for food, environmental, and occupational health and safety (ANSES) [9] CB framework, with the hazard band allocated according to the classification of the bulk or analogous material according to the classification, labelling and packaging (CLP) regulation. While CB tools are effective in classifying risk and establishing risk management protocols 6, current applications have been criticised regarding their inability to produce transparent or easily communicable risk forecasts. Alternative frameworks employ multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and weight of evidence (WoE) approaches, which enable expert judgement and experimental data to be incorporated into the risk assessment [10 – 12]. Indeed, for regulatory purposes, MCDA-based tools may provide a more appropriate way to address issues surrounding data uncertainty [13, 14]. However, the uncertainties underlying the use of expert opinion to interpret the quality of experimental evidence or to establish weights for criterion in MCDA approaches may prove to have a critical effect on the resultant assessment [11]. Finally, methodologies borrowing from the finance industry [15], value of information and portfolio decision analysis can also be employed with some success.|$|E
40|$|Determination of 129 I in {{low-level}} {{radioactive waste}} (LLW) samples from reactors {{can be a}} tedious and time consuming procedure often leading to results with large margins of error. This study used an efficient (approx. 2 - 3 h per sample) and reliable procedure, {{which could be used}} for LLW waste samples in various <b>physical</b> <b>forms</b> (<b>solid,</b> liquid, resin). Samples were processed without pretreatment by distillation of the LLW samples, followed by separation using chemical extraction. The extracted 129 I solution was then irradiated for 5 min in a 2 MW research reactor (neutron flux of about 1013 n/cm 2 -s), and the activation product, 130 I, was analyzed with a high-purity intrinsic germanium detector. A tracer of 127 I was also activated to 128 I to determine radiochemical yield, which was 29 +/- 7 %. The lower limit of detection of the procedure was about 30 pCi/g for 4 g samples, 29 % recovery, and a 1000 s counting time...|$|R

This study compared the relative impact on satiety and energy intakes of the <b>physical</b> <b>form</b> of foods versus the timing of consumption. Thirty-two volunteers (16 men and 16 women), aged 18 – 35 years, consumed equal-energy preloads (1254 kJ, 300 kcal) of regular cola (710 ml, 24 oz) or fat-free raspberry cookies (87 g, 3 oz) on two occasions each. The preloads were presented either 2 h or 20 min before the test meal. Their principal ingredient was sugar. Participants rated motivational states prior to ingestion and at 30 -min intervals. A tray lunch was presented at 12 : 30 p. m., and food consumption was measured. Regular cola and cookies suppressed hunger ratings equally and no temporal difference in satiety was observed. Cola, but not cookies, resulted in lower ratings of thirst. Energy intakes at lunch were lower when the preload was consumed closer to the test meal (20 min) but was not affected by <b>physical</b> <b>form</b> (liquid vs. <b>solid).</b> Cola, but not cookies, reduced water intakes at lunch. There was no satiety deficit following the ingestion of a beverage as compared with a solid food.
