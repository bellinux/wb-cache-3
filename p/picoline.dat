25|$|Though {{crude oil}} is {{predominantly}} composed of various hydrocarbons, certain nitrogen heterocylic compounds, such as pyridine, <b>picoline,</b> and quinoline are reported as contaminants associated with crude oil, {{as well as}} facilities processing oil shale or coal, and have also been found at legacy wood treatment sites. These compounds {{have a very high}} water solubility, and thus tend to dissolve and move with water.

25|$|The Chichibabin {{pyridine}} synthesis {{was reported}} in 1924 and is still in use in industry. In its general form, the reaction {{can be described as}} a condensation reaction of aldehydes, ketones, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia derivatives. In particular, unsubstituted pyridine is produced from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are inexpensive and widely available. First, acrolein is formed in a Knoevenagel condensation from the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. It is then condensed with acetaldehyde and ammonia into dihydropyridine, and then oxidized with a solid-state catalyst to pyridine. This process is carried out in a gas phase at 400–450°C. The product consists of a mixture of pyridine, simple methylated pyridines (<b>picoline),</b> and lutidine; its composition depends on the catalyst used and can be adapted {{to the needs of the}} manufacturer. The catalyst is usually a transition metal salt such as cadmium(II) fluoride or manganese(II) fluoride, but cobalt and thallium compounds can also be used. The recovered pyridine is separated from byproducts in a multistage process.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{might also}} have minor neurotoxic, genotoxic, and clastogenic effects. Exposure to {{pyridine}} would normally lead to its inhalation and absorption in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, where it either remains unchanged or is metabolized. The major products of pyridine metabolism are N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide, which are formed by N-methyltransferases (e.g., pyridine N-methyltransferase), as well as pyridine N-oxide, and 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxypyridine, which are generated {{by the action of}} monooxygenase. In humans, pyridine is metabolized only into N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide. Pyridine is readily degraded by bacteria to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The unsubstituted pyridine ring degrades more rapidly than <b>picoline,</b> lutidine, chloropyridine, or aminopyridines, and a number of pyridine degraders have been shown to overproduce riboflavin in the presence of pyridine. Ionizable N-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, interact with environmental surfaces (such as soils and sediments) via multiple pH-dependent mechanisms, including partitioning to soil organic matter, cation exchange, and surface complexation. Such adsorption to surfaces reduces bioavailability of pyridines for microbial degraders and other organisms, thus slowing degradation rates and reducing ecotoxicity.|$|E

[...] 2-Pyridone degradation is commonly initiated by mono-oxygenase attack, resulting in a diol, such as 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, which is metabolized via the maleamate pathway.

[...] In the case of Arthrobacter crystallopoietes, {{at least part of the}} degradative pathway is plasmid-borne. [...] Pyridine diols undergo chemical transformation in solution to form intensely colored pigments. [...] Similar pigments have been observed in quinoline degradation, also owing to transformation of metabolites, however the yellow pigments often reported in degradation of many pyridine solvents, such as unsubstituted pyridine or <b>picoline,</b> generally result from overproduction of riboflavin in the presence of these solvents.

Solutions of the dimeric 1 : 1 adducts with pyridine, β- and γ-picoline in their respective ligands have spectral and magnetic properties identical to those of the monomers, while traces of the dimer persist in solutions of the α-picoline analog. This is discussed in terms of the steric requirements of the ligands. The large nmr isotropic shift of the acetate-methyl protons in solutions of the dimeric complexes suggests a greater contribution from superexchange mechanism to the magnetic coupling.

Both newly synthesized complexes have been characterized {{on the basis}} of elemental analyses, spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, UV–Vis, EPR) and single crystal X-ray structure determination (complex 1). The structural analysis of complex 1 revealed the existence of unusual coordination behavior of arylsulfonate towards copper(II) center in presence of heterocyclic N-donor ligands resulting in elongated octahedral geometry around the metal.

2500|$|Following the {{invention}} of coal gas early in the 19th century, {{it was discovered that}} numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of road tar, products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, pyridine bases, creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, ammonium sulphate and ammonia solution, sulphuric acid, <b>picolines,</b> quinoline, quinaldine, acenaphthene, anthracene and dicyclopentadiene.
