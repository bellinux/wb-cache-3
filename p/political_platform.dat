5|$|Both {{men were}} incarcerated in Landsberg Prison, where Hitler soon {{began work on}} his memoir, Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"), which he {{dictated}} to fellow prisoners Hess and Emil Maurice. Edited by publisher Max Amann, Hess and others, the work was published in two parts in 1925 and 1926. It was later released in a single volume, which became a best-seller after 1930. This book, with its message of violent antisemitism, became {{the foundation of the}} <b>political</b> <b>platform</b> of the NSDAP.|$|E

5|$|The {{trials of}} the central {{committee}} of the Fasci, {{that took place in}} Palermo in April and May 1894, were the final blow to the movement. In spite of an eloquent defence, which turned the Court into a <b>political</b> <b>platform</b> and thrilled every socialist in the country, they were condemned to heavy sentences of imprisonment.

Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July 1920, and was at Hitler's side on 8 November 1923 for the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed Nazi attempt to seize control of the government of Bavaria. Whilst serving time in jail for this attempted coup, Hess helped Hitler write his book, Mein Kampf, which became a foundation of the <b>political</b> <b>platform</b> of the NSDAP.|$|E
5|$|The Party for Freedom's <b>political</b> <b>platform</b> often {{overlaps}} {{those of}} the assassinated Rotterdam politician Pim Fortuyn and his Pim Fortuyn List. After his death, Fortuyn's impact remained, {{as more and more}} politicians sought to gain political mileage by directly confronting topics such as a ban on immigration that were, from a politically correct point of view, considered unmentionable in the Netherlands until Fortuyn came on the scene and upended the Dutch tradition of consensus politics with an anti-immigration stance. Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn's constituency. The Party for Freedom called for a €16billion tax reduction, a far stricter policy toward recreational drug use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution. In the 2006 Dutch parliamentary election, their first parliamentary election, the Party for Freedom won 9 out of the 150 open seats.|$|E

5|$|Boganda {{was born}} into a family of {{subsistence}} farmers, and was adopted and educated by Roman Catholic Church missionaries. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During World War II, Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of Bangui to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the French National Assembly, where he maintained a <b>political</b> <b>platform</b> against racism and the colonial regime. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a grassroots movement in opposition of French colonialism. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the working class. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was laicized from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{many western}} democracies, {{political}} parties with extreme platforms challenge more moderate incumbents. This paper analyses {{the impact of}} economic growth on the support for extreme <b>political</b> <b>platforms.</b> We provide a theoretical {{argument in favor of}} growth e ects (as opposed to level e ects) on the support for extreme political parties and we empirically investigate the relationship between growth and extremist votes. Lower growth rates bene t right-wing and nationalist parties, but do not have a robust positive e ect on the support for communist parties. Our estimates indicate that extreme <b>political</b> <b>platforms</b> are unlikely to gain majorities in OECD countries, unless there is an extreme drop in the GDP per capita growth rate...|$|R
