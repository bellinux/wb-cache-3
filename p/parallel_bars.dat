5|$|A {{total of}} 609 medals (202 gold, 199 silver and 208 bronze) were awarded. The {{total number of}} bronze medals {{is greater than the}} total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in boxing (except men's light heavyweight and heavyweight categories). In +100kg {{category}} of freestyle wrestling, a tie for the first position in between the wrestlers of Iran and Japan meant that no silver medal was awarded. In gymnastics, a tie for second place in the <b>parallel</b> <b>bars</b> event resulted in two silver medals and thus no bronze was awarded, similarly a tie for first place in the uneven bars event meant that no silver medal was awarded.|$|E
5|$|Four Egyptian gymnasts, three {{artistic and}} one rhythmic, {{qualified}} for the Olympics. Mohamed El-Saharty, the lone male, was invited to London as the highest-ranked African in the individual all-around at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. He was individual all-around Arab Champion in 2011 and 2012, African Champion in 2010 and 2012, and Pan Arab Champion in 2011. At the latter tournament, he had also taken gold in the horizontal bar, the pommel horse, the vault, and the team event. In London his best event was the vault, where he finished 12th. He was 52nd in the horizontal bar, 56th in the floor, 57th in the pommel horse, 61st in the rings, and 65th in the <b>parallel</b> <b>bars.</b> His final rank in the individual all-around was 37th.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven <b>parallel</b> <b>bars,</b> a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E

5|$|In {{swimming}} {{there was}} a three-way tie in the men's 100m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a tie for {{second place in the}} women's 100m freestyle event meant that no bronze was awarded. In athletics, two bronze medals were awarded in the men's high jump event. In wushu, a tie for the silver-medal position in the men's changquan event (taolu discipline) resulted in no bronze being awarded; a three-way tie in the men's nanquan event (also taolu discipline) resulted in three bronze medals being awarded. In gymnastics, many shared medals were awarded. A tie for first place in the pommel horse resulted in two gold medals, and thus no silver was awarded; a tie for third place in the horizontal bar, pommel horse, rings, women's vault and women's floor exercises meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. A four-way tie for second position in the <b>parallel</b> <b>bars</b> meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
5|$|Luis Rivera {{represented}} Puerto Rico in artistic gymnastics, and was {{the only}} Puerto Rican gymnast to appear at the Beijing Olympics. Born in Humacao, a city on Puerto Rico's southeastern coast, Rivera has been affiliated with the Federación Puertorriqueña de Gimnasia (English: Puerto Rican Federation of Gymnastics) and participated in Beijing at age 21. He had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the preliminary round, which took place on August 9, Rivera competed against 97 other athletes. During the floor exercise, Rivera scored 15.125 points, placing 24th of the 98 athletes in this event. During the horse vault, Rivera ranked 13th after scoring 16.225 (this was on his first jump; his second jump scored 15.200). Next, during the <b>parallel</b> <b>bars</b> event, Luis Rivera ranked 61st after earning 14.575 points, and later earned 14.675 points in the horizontal bar. Rivera ranked 22nd in the still rings event after earning 15.250 points and placing 22nd, and finished out the qualification round on the pommel horse by ranking 20th with a score of 14.750. Overall, the Puerto Rican gymnast ranked 13th of the 27 advancing athletes, ending with a total score of 90.600 points. He placed ahead of Russia's Maxim Devyatovskiy (90.350 points) and behind Belarus' Dmitry Savitski (90.650 points). He advanced to the final round.|$|E
5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie {{for the gold}} medal in the horizontal bar meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and <b>parallel</b> <b>bars</b> ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a tie for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided by the results of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E

A total of 6 male university level subjects were selected (aged 19. 66 ± 1. 63) from gymnastic match practice group of Laxshmibai National Institute of Physical Education by using consecutive sampling. The biomechanical and anthropometric variables included were angles at hip joint, stature, weight and BMI. Angles were determined by using dartfish software. Videography method was used to biomechanically analysis the selected moments. For measuring performance in each of the three different holding positions subjective evaluation was used. Descriptive statistics and correlation were used as a statistical technique for the present study. A descriptive profile was made by using EXCEL graphic functionality on selected parameters.

25|$|In a {{press conference}} on November 10, 2008, Tomita {{announced}} his retirement from the sport.
