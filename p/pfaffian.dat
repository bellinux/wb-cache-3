2500|$|The work of Levi-Civita focused {{exclusively}} on regarding connections {{as a kind}} of differential operator whose parallel displacements were then the solutions of differential equations. [...] As the twentieth century progressed, Élie Cartan developed a new notion of connection. [...] He sought to apply the techniques of <b>Pfaffian</b> systems to the geometries of Felix Klein's Erlangen program. [...] In these investigations, he found that a certain infinitesimal notion of connection (a Cartan connection) could be applied to these geometries and more: his connection concept allowed for the presence of curvature which would otherwise be absent in a classical Klein geometry. [...] (See, for example, [...] and [...]) [...] Furthermore, using the dynamics of Gaston Darboux, Cartan was able to generalize the notion of parallel transport for his class of infinitesimal connections. [...] This established another major thread in the theory of connections: that a connection is a certain kind of differential form.|$|E

Moreover, we demonstrate that the <b>Pfaffians</b> of the 2 r by 2 r skew-symmetric submatrices form a Gröbner basis for the given term order.

5000|$|The main insight is {{that every}} non-zero term in the <b>Pfaffian</b> of the {{adjacency}} matrix of a graph G corresponds to a perfect matching. Thus, if one can find an orientation of G to align all signs of the terms in <b>Pfaffian</b> (no matter + or - [...] ), then the absolute value of the <b>Pfaffian</b> is just the number of perfect matchings in G. The FKT algorithm does such a task for a planar graph G.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT.

Further in Appendix we give another proof of a minor summation formula of <b>Pfaffians</b> {{by means of the}} lattice path method from a combinatorial aspect. Our minor summation formula of <b>pfaffians</b> is viewed as a formula for providing some sort of Fourier transforms for discrete type as well as the Cauchy-Binet formula for matrices. In this situation, the kernel functions of Fourier transforms are represented by a certain series of minor-determinants or subpfaffian indexed by partitions of a suitable matrix instead of the usual exponential functions as well as test functions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we give a {{sufficient}} condition {{for a set}} G of polynomials to be a Gröbner basis {{with respect to a}} given term-order for the ideal I that it generates. Our criterion depends on the linkage pattern of the ideal I and of the ideal generated by the initial terms of the elements of G. We then apply this criterion to ideals generated by minors and <b>pfaffians.</b> More precisely, we consider large families of ideals generated by minors or <b>pfaffians</b> in a matrix or a ladder, where the size of the minors or <b>pfaffians</b> is allowed to vary in different regions of the matrix or the ladder. We use the sufficient condition that we established to prove that the minors or <b>pfaffians</b> form a reduced Gröbner basis for the ideal that they generate, with respect to any diagonal or anti-diagonal term-order. We also show that the corresponding initial ideal is Cohen-Macaulay and squarefree, and that the simplicial complex associated to it is vertex decomposable, hence shellable.
