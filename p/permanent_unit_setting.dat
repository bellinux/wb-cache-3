40|$|In unit {{selection}} based speech synthesizer, {{defining a}} good <b>unit</b> <b>set</b> {{is crucial to}} the speech quality. In this paper, a method of customizing the TTS base <b>unit</b> <b>set</b> with a specific speech corpus is proposed. Multi-phoneme units are boosted from the initial phoneme-sized unit. A new multi-phoneme unit is added to the inventory based upon its own frequency count and the affected frequency count of other units. As a result, a large base <b>unit</b> <b>set,</b> which contains many multi-phoneme units, is formed when the speech corpus is large. While, for a small speech corpus, only a few bi-phoneme or tri-phoneme are found. Such a scalable base <b>unit</b> <b>set</b> makes it possible to achieve better smoothness in concatenation while maintain the naturalness of prosody. Evaluation results show that, after replacing the phone-sized base <b>unit</b> <b>set</b> with the customized set, the search speed is improved by 5 times and 59 % preference score is obtained. 1...|$|R
