5000|$|The size of Mexico City's {{population}} and its demographic contours have been enduring questions for crown officials {{as well as}} modern scholars. There were major epidemics that affected the population, starting with the smallpox epidemic of 1520 that {{was a factor in}} the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire, but there were other major epidemics throughout the colonial period. There were estimates taken in the late seventeenth century, with the largest and most detailed census mandated by Viceroy Revillagigedo in 1790. [...] In 1689, there was an estimate of 57,000 residents. [...] An estimate for 1753 based on a <b>partial</b> <b>census</b> mandated by the Audiencia put the population at 70,000. [...] In the period between 1689 and 1753, there were at least nine epidemics. The Revillagigedo census of 1790 counts 112,926 residents, a significant increase. [...] This might be due to migration to the city accelerating. An 1811 census done by the ‘’Juzgado de Policía’’ put the number even higher, at 168,811, which might well reflect displacement from the countryside from the insurgency of Miguel Hidalgo and his successors. [...] The census of 1813 done by the city government (Ayuntamiento) shows a significant decrease to 123,907, perhaps showing the return of short-term migrants to their home communities following the waning of the insurgency, but also possibly “fevers” that affected the population.|$|E

Difficulties arise because {{it is impossible to}} count the entire population, due to the huge number of observers needed to cover all the observable area (i. e. open lands) in any managed district. In three study areas, representative of the most common habitat situation found in the hunting districts of the province of Forlì-Cesena, we compared the results of exhaustive countings with the results obtained by taking into account only about a half of the points (and therefore of the observers) required for the complete count. The average roe deer's density obtained was 21. 8 /km² from complete censuses and 20. 8 /km² from <b>partial</b> <b>censuses,</b> suggesting that this method remains highly reliable which allows a simplification of censusing...|$|R
5000|$|The {{city was}} captured, {{after a long}} siege, by the Ottoman Turks in 1331. The long {{resistance}} of the city, {{as well as the}} exodus of its Greek Orthodox population to still Byzantine-controlled lands and the rapid Islamization that followed the conquest (the phenomenon of crypto-Christianity notwithstanding) quickly diminished the Greek Orthodox element in the population. Already in 1354, when Gregory Palamas visited the city, he found the local Christian population much depleted, and in a <b>partial</b> <b>census</b> of Nicaea itself dating to 1454/5, only seven Christian households are recorded. Although the entire region of Bithynia suffered a sharp decline in the numbers of its Christian element during and after the Ottoman conquest, throughout the early Ottoman period the Patriarchate retained active all of its Byzantine-era metropolises—apart from Nicaea also Nicomedia, Chalcedon and Prussa—a number totally disproportionate to the demographic realities on the ground. Apart from the desire to maintain in existence historical and prestigious sees like Nicaea, this practice was most likely the result of their proximity to the seat of the Patriarchate in Constantinople, which allowed their bishops to both administer their dioceses and play {{an active role in the}} central administration of the Church. This practice became formalized in the 18th century, when the bishops of the dioceses closest to Constantinople (i.e. Bithynia and Eastern Thrace), who typically resided in the Ottoman capital and were members of the Patriarchate's permanent synod, were elevated to [...] "Elder" [...] (γέροντες) metropolitans and formed a group with the power to check and counsel the Patriarchs.|$|E

50|$|Although {{quantitative}} data {{does not exist}} for the eighteenth century, some <b>partial</b> <b>censuses</b> {{carried out in the}} middle of the nineteenth century allow some approximate conclusions about the number of slaves throughout the country. Lucette Valensi offered an estimate of around 7,000 slaves or descendants of slaves in Tunisian in the year 1861, using registers which include lists of manumissions. However, such systematic records of the black population are not effective for several reasons: the abolition of slavery had occurred ten years before the first records of the subject population were taken for the mejba (a tax instituted in 1856), and therefore a good part of these groups, scattered through the various layers of society had escaped the system of control. The frequency of collective manumissions of black slaves at the death of a prince or princess reveals some important comparative numbers. In 1823, 177 slaves were manumitted at the death of a princess. Based on the figures provided by travellers, Ralph Austin established some averages, leading to a total estimate of 100,000 slaves. For his part, Louis Ferrière in a letter to Thomas Reade, the British consul in Tunis, estimated there were 167,000 slaves and freed slaves in 1848. Concerning European slaves, the number of women is difficult to determine. Some historians, like Robert C. Davis, estimate their number at around 10%, but these numbers are based on the redemption of slaves; it may simply indicate that women were rarely redeemed. This figure of 10% is especially dubious since the slaves acquired in coastal razzias were more numerous and in these razzias women constituted an average of five out of every eight people taken captive.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{complexity}} of the high levels of the exponential hierarchy [HY 84,HIS 85]: Are they hard, and if so why are they hard? We show that P^NE = NP^NE. From this we conclude that the strong exponential hierarchy collapses: P^NE = NP^NE NP^NP^NE NP^NP^NP^NE [...] ., where NE is nondeterministic exponential time. This suprising result, a nontrivial hierarchy collapse, is based on P^NE overmastering the NP^NE computation tree by computing better and better <b>partial</b> <b>census</b> information. We note why the combinatorics involved prevents us from similarly proving that the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Next we look at the exponential hierarchy, which is NE given a rich database: NE NE^NP NE^NP^NP [...] We show that if the exponential hierarchy's Δ_i and Σ_i levels do separate, this is due not {{to the power of the}} database but to the extravagant number of queries NE makes to the database. Thus the high levels of the strong exponential hierarchy are no harder than the low levels. The high levels of the exponential hierarchy separate completely only if NE floods its database with queries. Extending our techniques, we derive sufficient conditions for collapsing complexity classes, and use them to generate strong new quantitative relativization results...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of venoms {{is the story}} of how toxins arise and of the processes that generate and maintain their diversity. For animal venoms these processes include recruitment for expression in the venom gland, neofunctionalization, paralogous expansions, and functional divergence. The systematic study of these processes requires the reliable identification of the venom components involved in antagonistic interactions. High-throughput sequencing has the potential of uncovering the entire set of toxins in a given organism, yet the existence of non-venom toxin paralogs and the misleading effects of <b>partial</b> <b>census</b> of the molecular diversity of toxins make necessary to collect complementary evidence to distinguish true toxins from their non-venom paralogs. Here we analyzed the whole genomes of two scorpions, one spider and one snake, aiming at the identification of the full repertoires of genes encoding toxin-like proteins. We classified the entire set of protein-coding genes into paralogous groups and monotypic genes, identified genes encoding toxin-like proteins based on known toxin families, and quantified their expression in both venom-glands and pooled tissues. Our results confirm that genes encoding toxin-like proteins are part of multigene families, and that these families arise by recruitment events from non-toxin genes followed by expansions of the toxin-like protein coding genes. We also show that failing to account for sequence similarity with non-toxin proteins has a considerable misleading effect that can be greatly reduced by comparative transcriptomics. Our study overall contributes {{to the understanding of the}} evolutionary dynamics of proteins involved in antagonistic interactions...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the project of}} an aggregative reconstruction {{of the population of}} Ger-many from the sixteenth century to 1840, when official statistics began to provide complete coverage of all German states. The creation of estimates of population size and of annual series of the crude birth, marriage and death rates rests on three types of sources: First, pairs of <b>partial</b> <b>censuses</b> of hearths, taxpayers, communicants, etc. for the same regional aggregate at two different points in time are used to derive annual growth rates of popula-tion. This information is used to derive approximate estimates of total population size in ten-year intervals. Second, to develop aggregate series of vital events the project aims to analyse approximately 450 to 600 parish registers. Third, the project makes use of proto-statistical material on population size and the number of vital events that states began to collect selectively from c. 1740. On the basis of material from Gehrmann (2000), from published studies on c. 140 parishes and from selected other sources we construct a pre-liminary dataset for the period 1730 – 1840. Our cumulative rates of natural increase are broadly consistent with independent estimates of population growth. We use these series for two explorative analyses: First, on the basis of inverse projection we generate tentative estimates of the gross reproduction rate, of life expectancy and the dependency ratio. The results suggest an increase of the life expectancy and of the dependency ratio, the latter being the result of persistent population growth. Second, by adding a real wage series we study Malthusian adaptation with two methods, namely, VAR and time varying cumulated lag regression. The results consistently suggest the presence of both the preventive and the positive check during the eighteenth century. Whereas the preventive check persisted into the nineteenth century, mortality became exogenous in the early nineteenth century. Par-ticularly the 1810 s turn out as a period of major change in at least three dimensions: real wages increased, life expectancies rose, and the positive check disappeared. Thus, Germany became a non-Malthusian economy well before the advent of industrialisation. Additional information suggests that market integration was a driving force behind this process.

Under what conditions do these perceptions change? These questions have led us to determine four synthetic variables of residential space: the socio-residential status of housing types (symbolic links between the characteristics of the housing unit and the position of its occupant in society); the " housing zones " (impact of the composition of the housing stock on the social markers defining a residential area); the residential areas (actual " social marker "); and the local impact (social markers that are not directly linked {{to the nature of the}} housing stock). This article describes the methods and models used to construct these variables. They are used to understand the links between residential movements and changes in the population make-up in the area of Douai (in Northern France), located in a former coal-mining field which was gradually closed, beginning in the 1970 s. We used secondary processing of the 1990 <b>partial</b> <b>census</b> surveys of one-quarter of the French population, and we carried out 1, 344 surveys with households which had moved in 1994.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, {{homelessness}} has persisted as a serious problem {{in the city of}} Chicago. However, throughout that time, {{there has never been a}} comprehensive, reliable figure for the number of people who do not have a home. This is a significant gap in not only our public records, but in our public policy. By not adequately accounting for the city's homeless population, we are unable to understand the true scope of the problem and therefore are ill equipped to come up with realistic strategies and adequate resources to address it. Estimating the number of homeless people is a distinct challenge to do as they are a transient and often invisible population. The city of Chicago conducts a <b>partial</b> <b>census</b> of the city's single-night homeless population. That count includes those who are officially reported as being served in the city's homeless shelters that night and any homeless people that can be counted on the streets or other locations outside of shelters that night. This method has limitations because it is very difficult to locate every homeless person outside, particularly on a cold winter night. Also it does not include people living temporarily with others because they cannot afford housing. This is often referred to as "doubled-up. " Counting those not served in shelters or on the street may be difficult, but it is imperative to do so. To meet this challenge, the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, in collaboration with the University of Illinois at Chicago Survey Research Laboratory, developed a methodology that is designed to count both those served in shelters and those who never access shelters. The Survey Research Laboratory helped shape the methodology and reviewed the findings of the analysis. Every effort has been made to make this a conservative effort and to avoid duplication...|$|E

However, only a <b>partial</b> <b>census</b> of this population exists because of the flux limits and restricted sky coverage of existing Galactic surveys. We combine the sample of satellites recently discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) survey with the satellites found in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9 (together these surveys cover nearly half the sky) to estimate the total luminosity function of satellites down to M_ V= 0. We apply a new Bayesian inference method in which we assume that the radial distribution of satellites follows that of subhaloes selected according to their peak maximum circular velocity. We find that there should be at least 142 ^+ 53 _- 34 (1 σ CL) satellites brighter than M_ V= 0 within 300 kpc of the Sun. As a result of our use of new data and better simulations, and a more robust statistical method, we infer a much smaller population of satellites than reported in previous studies using earlier SDSS data only; we also address an underestimation of the uncertainties in earlier work by accounting for discreteness effects. We find that the inferred number of faint satellites depends only weakly on the assumed mass of the MW halo and we provide scaling relations to extend our results to different assumed halo masses and outer radii. We predict that half of our estimated total satellite population of the MW should be detected by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Comment: 17 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, 4 appendices.

Procjenjuje se da je Dubrovačka Republika imala 1500. godine 70 % ostvarenog BDP Mletačke Republike, a obalne dalmatinske komune 60 %. Ruralno zaleđe Dalmacije i Istre, kao i Hrvatska i Slavonija, ostvarivali su znatno niži BDP po stanovniku. Ponderiranjem tih veličina autor izračunava BDP po stanovniku za Hrvatsku u cjelini. Na sličan način, polazeći od regionalnih razlika i ostvarenog napretka ili nazatka, procjenjuje se i stanje 1700., 1820. i 1913. godine. Usporedbom tih rezultata s Maddisonovim nalazima, zaključuje se da se Hrvatska oko 1500. godine po stupnju gospodarskog razvoja nalazila 2 % iznad svjetskog, a 25 % ispod zapadnoeuropskog prosjeka, a 1913. godine 9 % ispod svjetskog, a čak 60 % ispod zapadnoeuropskog prosjeka. The author {{underlines the}} {{significance}} of Angus Maddison’s latest book and his macroeconomic approach to the world economic history of the second millennium. He brings to the attention some of Maddison’s most valuable results, particularly those {{closely related to the}} assessment of economic development of Croatia’s neighbouring countries. On the basis of Maddison’s quantitative data on the gross domestic product per capita of Italy, Venetian Republic, Austria, and Eastern Europe, the author calculates an estimate GDP per capita of Croatia in the period 1500 - 1913. The fact that today’s territory of Croatia was, at certain points in the past, divided among as many as five separate states (apart from the Republic of Dubrovnik, parts of the Croatian territory were under the rule of Venetian Republic, Hungary, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire), and that some regions had their first censuses made {{at the end of the}} 17 th century further hindered the analysis. The results of other authors have been used in order to establish the population estimate between 1700 and 1820, while more recent periods are covered with accurate statistical data. The author provides his own population estimate of Croatia for the year 1500 on the basis of <b>partial</b> <b>census</b> data (Dubrovnik, Venetian Dalmatia, and Istria) or other sources (tax censuses taken in Croatia and Slavonia and Turkish registers relating to Croatian territories under the Empire at the time). Thus the author has established a distribution of Croatian population, ordered chronologically from 1500 to 1913. According to his estimate, in 1500, the Republic of Dubrovnik had 70 percent of Venice’s gross domestic product in real terms, whereas Dalmatian cities had around 60 percent. Growth rates of GDP per capita in the rural inland regions of Dalmatia and Istria as well as those of Croatia and Slavonia were much lower, and by comparing these values the author has calculated GDP per capita of Croatia as a whole. Similarly, taking into account the regional differences and the changes in economic growth, he has also provided an economic estimate for the years 1700, 1820, and 1913. By comparing these results with the ones Maddison submitted on the European countries, the author concludes that in terms of economic growth Croatia was probably 2 percent above the world’s average and 25 percent below the west-European average around 1500, while in 1913, it lagged 9 percent behind the world’s and as much as 60 percent behind the west-European average...|$|E
