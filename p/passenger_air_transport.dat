40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{quantitative}} model of <b>passenger</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> markets. <b>Passenger</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> demand is not a fixed model-exogenous input parameter but is determined model-endogenously and therefore depends among other factors on the supply of flights and their various characteristics. Competitive relationships between airlines are modelled within a game-theoretic framework. The model assumes that airlines have incomplete information about the characteristics of each other (e. g. high-cost vs. low-cost airline). Individual beliefs about the nature of different competitors are adjusted by a dynamic learning process over time. One of the central objectives of the model is to explain the dynamic developments of air transport markets and their competitive forces, i. e. temporary disequilibria and the long-run market equilibrium. Some interesting questions to examine include e. g. an analysis of entry deterrence strategies of incumbent carriers and market entry strategies of new carriers. In this context incomplete information plays a critical role with regard to the profitability of such strategies and thus influences market developments. The model is of interest especially with regard to the evaluation of business strategies on the part of airlines and for public institutions that wish to analyse various market scenarios and evaluate politico-economic actions...|$|E

The definition of the relevant market is an essential step in order to establish a breach under European competition law. The relevant market includes the relevant product market and the relevant geographic market. The fundamental issue in the relevant product market is whether products are considered to be substitutable and can constitute the same market. The Commission has set a notice which includes methods and criterias and serves as guidelines to courts and companies to define the relevant market. The notice is however not binding for courts. The CJ have developed implementation of the criterias which it tends to refer to even if it is a different branch, however a case-by-case based definition is needed. The definition of the relevant market is based on three main criterias: demand substitutability, supply substitutability and potential competition.
