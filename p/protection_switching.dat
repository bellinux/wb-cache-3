50|$|Ceiling <b>protection</b> <b>switches</b> are {{installed}} in secondary condensate drain pan in split system HVAC applications. The switch has a buoyant component that floats when the secondary condensate drain pan fills {{with water from}} the primary drain pan and shuts down the HVAC system to avoid overflowing. The ceiling <b>protection</b> <b>switch</b> is mainly used in applications where a piece of HVAC equipment is located in an attic or interior space where water damage is likely to occur. The switch does not guarantee the prevention of overflow, but may reduce the amount. Overflow water occurs when the condensate drain line becomes clogged restricting the flow of condensation from the interior to {{the exterior of the}} space. Overflow also occurs when an indoor HVAC coil becomes frozen, which when thaws creates excess water.|$|R

40|$|Atlas is a pulsed-power {{facility}} {{under development}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory to drive high-energy density experiments. Design {{has been completed}} for this new generation pulsed-power machine consisting of an azimuthal array of 24, 240 -kV Marx modules and transmission lines supplying current to the load region at the machine center. The transmission line consists of a cable header, load <b>protection</b> <b>switch,</b> and tri-plate assembly interfacing to the center transition section. The cable header interface to the Marx module provides a mechanism to remove the Marx module for maintenance without removing other components of the transmission line. The load <b>protection</b> <b>switch</b> provides a mechanism for protecting the load during charging of the Marx {{in the event of}} a pre-fire condition. The aluminum tri-plate is a low-inductance transmission line carries radial current flow from the Marx energy storage system at the machine periphery toward the load. All transmission line components are oil insulated except the solid-dielectric insulated power flow channel connected directly to the load. The transition region at the machine center consists of several components that enable the radial converging vertical transmission lines to interface to a horizontal disk/conical power flow channel delivering current to the load. The current carrying transition components include the high-voltage and ground conductors interfacing to the tri-plate transmission lines. The tri-plate tank attachment ring interfaces to the tri-plate tanks and the base-plate. The base-plate supports the transition components and interfaces to the center support structure of the machine. The bottom insulator also attaches to the base-plate and to the high-voltage conductor, providing an oil containment seal between the transition and vacuum vessel. Design has been completed for all Atlas components. Some prototype hardware fabrication has been completed and first article hardware is in various stages of completion. The first article is a single line of the machine and includes a Marx module, cable header, load <b>protection</b> <b>switch,</b> tri-plate transmission line, and a dump load for testing. Testing is in progress on some prototype and first article components to verify performance before production begins on critical system components. Production will soon begin for much of the overall system, including the Marx tanks, tri-plate tanks, support structure, some transition components, and the personnel platform. These components will be fabricated and installed while the remaining internal components are being fabricated...|$|R

During stable operation the modules can be raised individually to be aligned with the beam orbit. The horizontal clearance between ZDC modules and beam pipe will be only about 3 mm. Anti-collision switches are therefore installed to protect the beam pipes against accidental damage.

40|$|This article {{surveys the}} {{restoration}} architectures for {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (ATM) network survivability that have been actively studied in this decade. Network reliability is critical for recent and future networks that will advance the information era. Moreover, {{it is one of}} the biggest factors in designing and managing networks. Since the early telecom network era, many restoration systems have been developed for plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH), synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH), synchronous optical network (SONET), leased lines and so on; and they were surveyed in many papers and books.

50|$|Linear Automatic <b>Protection</b> <b>Switching</b> (APS), {{also known}} as 1+1, {{involves}} four fibers: two working fibers (one in each direction), and two protection fibers.
