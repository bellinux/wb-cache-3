60|$|Standing up on {{his feet}} against the {{background}} of Mrs Bowater's ink-black flounces, with his rather humped shoulders and straight hair, he had looked an eccentric, and, even to my view, a stunted figure. Now the whole scene around us seemed to be sorting itself into a different proportion before my eyes. He it was who was become the unit of space, the yard-stick of the universe. The flowers, their roots glintily netted with spider-webs, nodded serenely over his long hands. A <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> with folded colours sipped of the sunshine on a tuft nearly at evens with his cheek. The very birds sang to his size, and every rift between the woodlands awaited the cuckoo. Only his clothes were grotesque, but less so than in my parlour Mr Crimble's skirts, or even Lady Pollacke's treacherous bonnet.|$|E

60|$|For the millionth time, perhaps, {{she looked}} at the sea. A <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> now spread himself upon the teasle, fresh and newly emerged, as the blue and {{chocolate}} down on his wings testified. Mrs. Pascoe went indoors, fetched a cream pan, came out, and stood scouring it. Her face was assuredly not soft, sensual, or lecherous, but hard, wise, wholesome rather, signifying {{in a room full of}} sophisticated people the flesh and blood of life. She would tell a lie, though, as soon as the truth. Behind her on the wall hung a large dried skate. Shut up in the parlour she prized mats, china mugs, and photographs, though the mouldy little room was saved from the salt breeze only by the depth of a brick, and between lace curtains you saw the gannet drop like a stone, and on stormy days the gulls came shuddering through the air, and the steamers' lights were now high, now deep. Melancholy were the sounds on a winter's night.|$|E
6000|$|We {{had to walk}} {{about half}} a mile along the beach, the ground behind the village being mostly swampy, and then turned into the forest along a path which leads to the native village of Wamma, about three miles off {{on the other side of}} the island. The path was a narrow one, and very little used, often swampy and {{obstructed}} by fallen trees, so that after about a mile we lost it altogether, our guide having turned back, and we were obliged to follow his example. In the meantime, however, I had not been idle, and my day's captures determined the success of my journey in an entomological point of view. I had taken about thirty species of butterflies, more than I had ever captured in a day since leaving the prolific banks of the Amazon, and among them were many most rare and beautiful insects, hitherto only known by a few specimens from New Guinea. The large and handsome spectre butterfly, Hestia durvillei; the pale-winged <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Drusilla catops; and the most brilliant and wonderful of the clear-winged moths, Cocytia durvillei, were especially interesting, as well, as several little [...] "blues," [...] equalling in brilliancy and beauty anything the butterfly world can produce. In the other groups of insects I was not so successful, but this was not to be wondered at in a mere exploring ramble, when only what is most conspicuous and novel attracts the attention. Several pretty beetles, a superb [...] "bug," [...] and a few nice land-shells were obtained, and I returned in the afternoon well satisfied with my first trial of the promised land.|$|E

5000|$|Aglais io, the European peacock, more {{commonly}} {{known simply as}} the <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly,</b> is a colourful butterfly, found in Europe and temperate Asia as far east as Japan. Formerly classified as {{the only member of}} the genus Inachis (the name is derived from Greek mythology, meaning Io, the daughter of Inachus). It should not be confused or classified with the [...] "American peacocks" [...] in the genus Anartia; these are not close relatives of the Eurasian species. The <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> is resident in much of its range, often wintering in buildings or trees. It therefore often appears quite early in spring. The <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> has figured in research in which the role of eyespots as an anti-predator mechanism has been investigated.

50|$|In one experiment, {{observed}} {{responses of}} the avian predators to the eyespots included increased vigilance, a delay in their return to the <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly,</b> {{and the production of}} alarm calls associated with ground-based predators. These responses to the eyespot stimuli lend support to the eye mimicry hypothesis as they indicated that the avian predator sensed that the eyespots belonged to a potential enemy. When faced with avian predators like the blue tit, the <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> makes a hissing noise as well as threateningly displaying its eyespots. However, it is the eyespots that protect the butterfly the most; peacock butterflies that have had their sound production capability removed still defend themselves extremely well against avian predators if their eyespots are present.|$|E

60|$|In March, 1869, Mr. J. Jenner Weir communicated a {{valuable}} {{series of observations}} made during many years, but more especially in the two preceding summers, in his aviary, containing the following birds of more or less insectivorous habits:--Robin, Yellow-Hammer, Reed-bunting, Bullfinch, Chaffinch, Crossbill, Thrush, Tree-Pipit, Siskin, and Redpoll. He found that hairy caterpillars were uniformly rejected; five distinct species were quite unnoticed by all his birds, and were allowed to crawl about the aviary for days with impunity. The spiny caterpillars of the Tortoiseshell and <b>Peacock</b> <b>butterflies</b> were equally rejected; but in both these cases Mr. Weir thinks it is the taste, not the hairs or spines, that are disagreeable, because some very young caterpillars of a hairy species were rejected although no hairs were developed, and the smooth pupæ of the above-named butterflies were refused as persistently as the spined larvæ. In these cases, then, both hairs and spines {{would seem to be}} mere signs of uneatableness.|$|R
40|$|Sport {{fishing for}} peacock bass Cichla spp. in the Brazilian Amazon has {{increased}} in popularity and attracts anglers who generate significant economic benefits in rural regions. The sustainability of this fishery is partly dependent on the survival of fish caught through catch-and-release fishing. The objective of this work was to investigate, hooking mortality of Cichla spp., including speckled peacock bass (C. temensis Humbolt), <b>butterfly</b> <b>peacock</b> bass (C. orinocensis Humbolt), and popoca peacock bass (C. monoculus Agassiz) in the basin of the Negro River, the largest tributary of the Amazon River. Fish were caught at two different sites using artificial lures, transported to pens anchored in the river and monitored for 72 hours. A total of 162 individual peacock bass were captured and hooking mortality (mean % ± 95 % confidence intervals) was calculated. Mean mortality was 3. 5 % (± 5. 0), 2. 3 % (± 3. 5) and 5. 2 % (± 10. 2) for speckled <b>peacock</b> bass, <b>butterfly</b> <b>peacock</b> bass, and popoca peacock bass, respectively. Lengths of captured fish ranged from 26 to 79 cm (standard length), however, only fish under 42 cm died. This research suggests that catch-and-release sport fishing of peacock bass does not result in substantial mortality in the Negro River basin...|$|R

50|$|The peacock butterfly's main anti-predator defence {{mechanism}} {{comes from the}} four large eyespots that it has on its wings. These eyespots are brilliantly coloured concentric circles. Like many other butterflies that hibernate, the <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> exhibits many lines of defence against would-be predators. Avian predators of the butterfly include blue tits, pied flycatchers and other small passerine birds. The first line of defence against these predators for many hibernating butterflies is crypsis, {{a process in which}} the butterflies blend into their environment by mimicking a leaf and staying immobile. Some hibernating butterflies such as the peacock have a second line of defence: when attacked, they open their wings, expose their eyespots and perform an intimidating display of threat. The intimidating visual display shown by the <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> gives it a much better chance at escaping predators than butterflies that rely solely on leaf mimicry. While the main targets of these anti-predation measures are small passerine birds, even larger birds such as chickens have been shown to react to the stimuli and avoid the butterfly when exposed to eyespots.|$|E

50|$|The ample heaths on {{the eastern}} side of the island provide {{habitats}} for many rare species of plants and animals which are adapted to the extreme conditions such as drought, warmth, wind. About 2,500 animal species and 150 species of plants have so far been recorded. 45% of those plants are on the IUCN Red List. Especially notable are the 600 species of butterflies that live in the heaths, small tortoiseshell, brimstone, painted lady and <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> among them.|$|E
50|$|While hibernating in dark {{wintering}} areas, the <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> frequently encounters rodent predators such {{as small}} mice. Against these predators, however, the visual display of eyespots is ineffective {{due to the}} darkness of the environment. Instead, these rodent predators show a much stronger adverse reaction to the butterfly when it is producing its auditory hissing signal. This indicates that for rodent predators, it is the auditory signal produced by the butterfly that serves as a deterrent.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that avian predators {{attempting}} to attack a butterfly hesitate for a much longer time if they encounter butterflies that display their eyespots than if they encounter butterflies whose eyespots are covered. In addition, the predators delay their return to the butterfly if it displays eyespots and some predators even flee before attacking the butterfly. By intimidating the predator so that it delays or gives up its attack, the <b>peacock</b> <b>butterfly</b> has a much greater chance of escaping predation.|$|E
5000|$|Black bass {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a multitude of unrelated fish species found around the world and called [...] "bass", such as the <b>butterfly</b> <b>peacock</b> bass (Cichla ocellaris), speckled peacock bass (Cichla temensis), Papuan black bass (Lutjanus goldiei) (also called Niugini bass), Australian bass, rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), American striped bass, and British sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax).|$|R
50|$|And, when {{a colored}} object has both diffuse and {{specular}} reflection, usually only the diffuse component is colored. A cherry reflects diffusely red light, absorbs all other colors {{and has a}} specular reflection which is essentially white (if the incident light is white light). This is quite general, because, except for metals, the reflectivity of most materials depends on their refractive index, which varies little with the wavelength (though it is this variation that causes the chromatic dispersion in a prism), so that all colors are reflected nearly with the same intensity. Reflections from different origin, instead, may be colored: metallic reflections, such as in gold or copper, or interferential reflections: iridescences, <b>peacock</b> feathers, <b>butterfly</b> wings, beetle elytra, or the antireflection coating of a lens.|$|R
40|$|Stable isotope {{analyses}} of tissues {{have been used}} to help delineate natal regions and routes of migratory animals. The foundations of such studies are isotopic gradients or differences representing geographic regions and habitat used by the organism that are retained in selected tissues. We sampled <b>peacock</b> <b>butterflies</b> Inachis io on a regional level in southern Sweden to study natural variation and the resolving power of the stable isotope method to delineate individuals from known areas on a smaller scale than has typically been used in previous studies. Hydrogen (delta D), carbon (delta C- 13) and nitrogen (delta N- 15) isotopes were obtained from butterflies at seven different locations in an area of 250 x 250 km over three years (2002 - 2004). We found sufficient isotopic differences on this regional scale to delineate approximate origins. Of the three isotopes, deuterium showed good discrimination between sites, carbon isotopes showed weaker differentiation, whereas nitrogen isotopes proved unsuitable for small scale studies in this region due to high and unpredictable variation. We found there was enough variation in delta D between years to prevent a general application of the technique to resolve sub-regional variation. Substantial part of this variation was probably caused by seasonal changes in delta D of precipitation. These differences produce significant variation in delta D between years in animals having short and variable tissue development times, and are difficult to estimate in natural situations. We conclude that stable isotopes are potentially powerful predictors for studies of migratory butterflies in Europe. However, without good knowledge about the sampled individuals' previous life-history, a lot of the natural environmental variation in tissue delta D cannot be controlled for. In the case of migratory species, this information is difficult to obtain, making the confidence intervals for prediction of natal areas fairly wide and probably only suitable for longer distance migration...|$|R
