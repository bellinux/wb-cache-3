RESULTS: We identified four fields of action: 1) availability of resources for carrying out the trials in time and in quality; 2) feasibility of the clinical trials, in their design and for the recruitment which depends on both of the investigation centers and patients (what is the image of human testing in the society?); 3) skills and motivation of all the elements of staffs in charge of clinical trials (MD; nurses; and the new jobs in medical research); 4) promptness and efficiency of the administrative organisation for a fast starting up of the trials.

40|$|We {{study the}} role <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> in {{explaining}} the decline in U. S. output volatility observed in recent years. Our analysis is motivated by two striking features in the data. First, as is commonly noted, output growth was more volatile than sales growth before 1984 {{but in recent years}} they have both become less volatile and about equally as volatile as each other. Second, the forecasting role <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> has altered. Prior to 1984, accumulation <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> predicted a decline in future output growth, with little predicted change in future sales. In recent years, however, the predicted adjustment of future output has diminished and instead an accumulation <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> predicts higher growth in future sales. Using an unobserved components model to disentangle the role <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> from that <b>of</b> sales {{in explaining the}} decline in output volatility, we find that inventories can explain about half of the overall decline, with reduced volatility of sales shocks explaining the other half. However, we find it is the disappearance <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> mistakes, and not changes in inventory dynamics, that is responsible for output stabilization and has also altered the forecasting role <b>of</b> <b>inventories.</b> Furthermore, we find no evidence of a change in inventory behavior towards increased production smoothing...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> investment in South Africa and to investigate the factors that have an influence on it. Although the size <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> investment relative to gross domestic product is very small, the contribution <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> investment to the growth in gross domestic product is significant. This study has found that, although the cyclical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> investment in South Africa is similar to that in developed countries, the relationship <b>of</b> <b>inventories,</b> production and sales differ. The variance of sales exceeds the variance of production and there is a negative correlation between inventory investment and sales. This difference with developed countries is also found in other developing countries. On this basis the production-smoothing hypothesis is accepted as relevant to describe inventory investment in South Africa. Furthermore, inventory data are only available on a quarterly basis. The features <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> investment were therefore investigated with an inventory adjustment approach. The econometric model describes how the level <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> adjusts when it deviates from the desired level. The desired inventory level is a function of the ratio between inventories and sales, which can change during the business cycle. The ratio between sales and prices, unfilled orders, interest rates and production has an influence on this ratio. In addition, the model describes the adjustment <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> when actual sales deviate from expected sales. The results of the model confirm that unfilled orders, the level of prices, current interest rates, production, actual sales and expected sales have an influence on the development <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> investment. <b>Of</b> significant importance is the ability to identify unplanned inventory investment and the finding that interest rates have an impact on inventory investment. The contribution of this study is the identification of factors that have an impact on the development <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> investment in South Africa. With this it is possible to improve the explanation <b>of</b> changes in <b>inventories</b> and its impact on the gross domestic product, therefore helping to improve economic policy formulation.

This paper provides empirical background to the thesis, which says that the role <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> in the "Golden Era" <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> research, which was in the 1950 s, was significantly different from that of today because of fundamental changes in business. This development requires new approaches in research as well. After a summary of the antecedents, the results of a survey are analysed, and they support the above thesis. The lack of difference between the inventory performance measured by the turnover rate of those companies, whose managers accept and those who deny the birth of the new paradigm calls attention to the need for the elaboration of a more complex inventory performance measurement.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the analysis <b>of</b> changes in <b>inventory</b> management and the results of verification of cause and effect relationships between the results <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> management and the financial performance of enterprises. The research was conducted on the branches (subsectors) of the food industry in Poland in 2005 - 2010. The research is based on the econometric analysis of the influence of the length <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> cycles (in total, materials, production in progress, finished goods, commodities) on financial performance of branches measured with return on sales, assets and equity. The research proved that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> management measured with the length <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> cycles is strongly diversified in the system of branches of the food industry. However, in general in 2005 - 2010 the inventory cycles were significantly reduced, which points to higher effectiveness of management of those assets. Moreover, on the basis of regression models the improvement in the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> management measured with the length <b>of</b> total <b>inventory</b> cycles and discrete cycles was found to be positively correlated with profitability.
