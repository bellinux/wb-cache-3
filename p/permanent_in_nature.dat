25|$|If {{there is}} the {{potential}} for a substantial harm to occur that is <b>permanent</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature,</b> such as the execution of a death penalty or the deportation of a person who could face torture, then the author of the complaint can request that it be greeted with Urgency.

Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur on New Communications can issue 'interim measures' in order to prevent the harm occurring while the complaint is being considered. The Committee views any failure by the State to adhere by these interim measures a breach of their obligations under the First Optional Protocol.|$|E

The events themselves are immaterial, otherwise than as the clothing and manifestation of the spirit that is working within. In this mode, the unity resulting from succession is destroyed, but is supplied by a unity of a higher order, which connects the events by reference to the workers, gives a reason for them in the motives, and presents men in their causative character. It takes, therefore, that part of real history which is the least known, and infuses a principle of life and organization into the naked facts, and makes them all the framework of an animated whole.|$|R

But with the rise of protest politics on the left and right alike, the people often seem more interested in constraining power than they are in giving politicians a clear mandate. According to French political philosopher Pierre Rosanvallon, these are all signals that we are now living in an age of negative sovereignty, in which broad-based coalitions can effectively block legislation and deselect governments at elections, while being increasingly incapable of garnering widespread support for necessary reforms.

The main objective is to provide an exegesis of Sigmund Freud’s views on war in the history of civilisation with regard to his vision of human nature. The fundamental element in the author’s reconstruction of Freud’s thought is the essay Civilisation and Its Discontents. In it Freud demonstrates the inevitability of war, which has its <b>permanent</b> source <b>in</b> human <b>nature,</b> more specifically, <b>in</b> the Thanatos drive - drive of death, aggression and destruction.

50|$|The Homestead Act 1862 {{opened up}} great expanses of virgin prairie {{in the west}} to early settlers. By 1905 about 41 million {{hectares}} of the west had been homesteaded (Olsen 1997). Much of this land was in semi-arid rangelands with sub-marginal precipitation to support crop production (Olsen 1997). The plowing of this land represented a <b>permanent</b> change <b>in</b> the <b>nature</b> of the land. Another contributor to habitat fragmentation for grouse is unmonitored and excessive cattle grazing (Kirsch et al. 1973; Giesen and Connelly 1993; Kirby and Grosz 1995; Reece et al. 2001; Sidle 2005). Cattle can be an important tool to manage habitat structure for sharp-tailed grouse when managed properly (Evens 1968; Kirby and Grosz 1995; Sidle 2005). The habitat of sharp-tailed grouse was severely affected by early settlers before cattle grazers understood the impact to the environment from overgrazing.|$|R
6000|$|The {{dear old}} lady, {{after a little}} anecdote or two {{on the subject of}} her son, did the one thing wanting to secure the perfect felicity of her two {{youthful}} companions: she became considerately blind for the occasion, as well as deaf. A quarter of an hour after the carriage left the major's cottage, the poor old soul, reposing on snug cushions, and fanned by a fine summer air, fell peaceably asleep. Allan made love, and Miss Milroy sanctioned the manufacture of that occasionally precious article of human commerce, sublimely indifferent on both sides to a solemn bass accompaniment on two notes, played by the curate's mother's unsuspecting nose. The only interruption to the love-making (the snoring, being a thing more grave and <b>permanent</b> <b>in</b> its <b>nature,</b> was not interrupted at all) came at intervals from the carriage ahead. Not satisfied with having the major's Roman encampment and the curate's Infant Schools on his mind, Pedgift Junior rose erect {{from time to time in}} his place, and, respectfully hailing the hindmost vehicle, directed Allan's attention, in a shrill tenor voice, and with an excellent choice of language, to objects of interest on the road. The only way to quiet him was to answer, which Allan invariably did by shouting back, [...] "Yes, beautiful," [...] upon which young Pedgift disappeared again in the recesses of the leading carriage, and took up the Romans and the Infants where he had left them last.|$|R

40|$|Species Huperzia selago and Lycopodium annotinum {{occur in}} cold and humid {{habitats}} with acid substrate. These are mainly mountain {{areas in the}} Czech Republic, but also sand gorges, where the temperature inversion is common. The temperature inversion causes the fact, that temperature conditions in ravines {{are different from the}} climatic conditions of surroundings, which causes high rate of species variety among the habitats. In these places, Montane and Boreal species grow in low altitudes and in the proximity of thermophile species. The presence of montane and boreal species in sand ravines is largely influenced by inherence of temperature inversion, which is determined by features of ravine (depth, breadth, orientation) and by weather conditions. Other important agents (excepting microclimatic conditions), which influence the prevalence of these kinds, are microelement availability and the rate of competition. In Czech Republic, both species Huperzia selago and Lycopodium annotinum fall into C 3 category, which means that they indicate <b>permanent</b> regression <b>in</b> our <b>nature.</b> <b>In</b> the case of my field survey {{in the area of the}} Bohemian Switzerland National Park I confirmed this tendency for species Huperzia selago...|$|R
50|$|Clarke was consecrated as Bishop of Melbourne in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 1 November 1902. He {{arrived in}} Melbourne in February 1903. Since the {{resignation}} of Bishop Goe {{the area of the}} Diocese of Melbourne had been greatly reduced by the formation of new dioceses based in Bendigo, Wangaratta and Gippsland. When Clarke began his ministry he appointed a commission to document the present position and future needs of the diocese and later {{came to the conclusion that}} certain parishes had become too large and needed subdividing, that means must be found for a more complete training of the clergy, and that there must be an extension of secondary education by means of church schools. In 1905 Clarke became first Archbishop of Melbourne and Metropolitan of Victoria. He ruled his diocese firmly and refused to allow himself to be allied to any party. Recognising that what may be called the puritanical and the aesthetic types of mind are <b>permanent</b> <b>in</b> human <b>nature,</b> he felt that the safest approach would be found in a middle course, and that no good would be done by straining for uniformity in minor issues. The question of the reunion of the churches was given some consideration, but little progress was made. There was, however, much expansion in the social work of the church, and several successful secondary schools were established, including the Melbourne Church of England Girls' Grammar School and Trinity Grammar School in Kew. In 1910 Clarke persuaded the Parliament of Victoria to establish the Melbourne College of Divinity to examine for and grant degrees. He married Alice Lovell in 1876. The daughter of the Revd Canon Kemp, she died suddenly in 1918. In March 1920 Clarke went to London to attend the Lambeth Conference and in November resigned as Archbishop of Melbourne.|$|R

The role of education in economic change of society through human resource development is very much significant in the developing countries. Development cannot be sustainable unless it is equitable.

Woman {{is the key to}} this development and empowerment of women is pre-requisite for creating an egalitarian society. Education can create a new outlook. It is a powerful device to change human <b>nature</b> <b>in</b> a desirable way. The process of education helps individual to know the self. It is education, which prepares them for full membership in the society. Changes brought about by education are <b>permanent</b> and transcendent <b>in</b> <b>nature.</b> Education determines the levels and well-being of people. Gender discrimination and patriarchal attitude which are being practiced for so many years have incapacitated women {{in such a way that}} they cannot stand alone unless a strong support is provided to them. Women of both urban and rural areas have realised the significance and importance of education to challenge the age-old domination and exploitation of patriarchal society. They have found education as a means towards empowerment which would ensure their participation in the decision-making in all walks of life.
