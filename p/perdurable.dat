60|$|Those {{who try to}} be artists use, {{time after}} time, the matter of their recollections, setting and {{resetting}} little coloured memories of men and scenes, rigging up (it may be) some especial friend in the attire of a buccaneer, and decreeing armies to manoeuvre, or murder to be done, on the playground of their youth. But the memories are a fairy gift which cannot be worn out in using. After a dozen services in various tales, the little sun-bright pictures of the past still shine in the mind's eye with not a lineament defaced, not a tint impaired. Glück und unglück wird gesang, if Goethe pleases; yet only by endless avatars, the original re-embodying after each. So that a writer, in time, begins to wonder at the <b>perdurable</b> life of these impressions; begins, perhaps, to fancy that he wrongs them when he weaves them in with fiction; and looking back on them with ever-growing kindness, puts them at last, substantive jewels, in a setting of their own.|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt this}} is a common experience: no sooner has the {{inquirer}} been driven to accept a new doctrine than it takes complete possession of his mind, and has not then the appearance of a strange and unwelcome guest, but rather that of a familiar friendly one, and is like a long- established housemate. I suppose the explanation is that when we throw open the doors to the new importunate visitor, it is virtually a ceremony, since the real event has been already accomplished, the guest having stolen in by some other way and made himself at home in the sub-conscious mind. Insensibly and inevitably I had become an evolutionist, albeit never wholly satisfied with natural selection as the only and sufficient explanation of the change in the forms of life. And again, insensibly and inevitably, the new doctrine has led to modifications of the old religious ideas and eventually to a new and simplified philosophy of life. A good enough one so far as this life is concerned, but unhappily it takes no account of another, a second and <b>perdurable</b> life without change of personality.|$|E

60|$|We {{passed out}} of the city by a gate where in a little coign of vantage a cobbler was thoughtfully {{hammering}} away in the tumult at a shoe-sole, and then suddenly on our right we had the Julian wall: not a mere fragment, but a good long stretch of it. The Moors had built upon it and characterized it, but had not so masked it as to hide the <b>perdurable</b> physiognomy of the Roman work. It was vastly more Roman wall than you see at Rome; but far better than this heroic image of war and waste was the beautiful old aqueduct, perfectly Roman still, with no visible touch from Moor, or from Christian, before or after the Moor, and performing its beneficent use after two thousand years as effectively as in the years before Christ came to bless the peacemakers. Nine miles from its mountain source the graceful arches bring the water on their shoulders; and though there is now an English company that pipes other streams to the city through its underground mains, the Roman aqueduct, eternally sublime in its usefulness, is constant to the purpose of the forgotten men who imagined it. The outer surfaces of the channel which it lifted to the light and air were tagged with weeds and immemorial mosses, and dripped as with the sweat of its twenty-centuried toil.|$|E
60|$|The scenery of the Campagna was not varied. Once {{we came to}} a battlemented tomb, of mighty girth and height, as <b>perdurable</b> in its masonry as the naked, stony {{hills that}} in the {{distance}} propped the mountains fainting along the horizon under their burden of snow. But as we drew nearer Tivoli the hills drew nearer us, and now they were no longer naked, but densely covered with the gray, interminable stretch of the olive forests. The olive is the tree which, of all others, is the friend of civilized man; it is older and kinder even than the apple, which is its next rival in beneficence; but these two kinds are so like each other, in the mass, that this boundless forest of olives around Tivoli offered an image of all the aggregated apple-orchards in the world. Where the trees came closest to the road they seemed to watch our passing, each with its trunk aslant and its branches akimbo, in a humorous make-believe of being in some joke with us, like so many gnarled and twisted apple-trees, used to children's play-fellowship. You felt a racial intimacy with the whimsical and antic shapes which your brief personal consciousness denied in vain; and you rose among the slopes around Tivoli with a sense of home-coming from the desert of the Campagna. But in the distance to which the olive forests stretched they lost this effect of tricksy familiarity. They looked like a gray sea against the horizon; more fantastically yet, they seemed a vast hoar silence, full of mystery and loneliness.|$|E
60|$|Pass on, thou {{spectral}} constable, and betake thee to thine {{own place}} of torment. Meanwhile, by the silent {{operation of the}} mechanism behind the scenes, a considerable space of time {{would seem to have}} lapsed over the street. The older dwellings now begin to look weather-beaten, through the effect of the many eastern storms that have moistened their unpainted shingles and clapboards, for not less than forty years. Such is the age we would assign to the town, judging by the aspect of John Massey, the first town-born child, whom his neighbors now call Goodman Massey, and whom we see yonder, a grave, almost autumnal-looking man, with children of his own about him. To the patriarchs of the settlement, no doubt, the Main Street is still but an affair of yesterday, hardly more antique, even if destined to be more permanent, than a path shovelled through the snow. But to the middle-aged and elderly men who came hither in childhood or early youth, it presents the aspect of a long and well-established work, on which they have expended the strength and ardor of their life. And the younger people, native to the street, whose earliest recollections are of creeping over the paternal threshold, and rolling on the grassy margin of the track, look at it as one of the <b>perdurable</b> things of our mortal state,--as old as the hills of the great pasture, or the headland at the harbor's mouth. Their fathers and grandsires tell them how, within a few years past, the forest stood here, with but a lonely track beneath its tangled shade. Vain legend! They cannot make it true and real to their conceptions. With them, moreover, the Main Street is a street indeed, worthy to hold its way with the thronged and stately avenues of cities beyond the sea. The old Puritans tell them of the crowds that hurry along Cheapside and Fleet Street and the Strand, and of the rush of tumultuous life at Temple Bar. They describe London Bridge, itself a street, with a row of houses on each side. They speak of the vast structure of the Tower, and the solemn grandeur of Westminster Abbey. The children listen, and still inquire if the streets of London are longer and broader than the one before their father's door; if the Tower is bigger than the jail in Prison Lane; if the old Abbey will hold a larger congregation than our meeting-house. Nothing impresses them, except their own experience.|$|E
60|$|The sort of type {{which would}} {{represent}} this condition would be vainly sought in any exceptionally opulent citizen of that world. He would have, if nothing else, {{the distinction of}} his unmeasured millions, which would form a poetry, however sordid; the note of the world we mean is indistinction, and the protagonist of the fiction seeking to portray its fads and characters must not have {{more than two or}} three millions at the most. He, or better she, were better perhaps with only a million, or a million and a half, or enough to live handsomely in eminent inns, either at home or abroad, with that sort of insolent half-knowledge to which culture is contemptible; which can feel the theatre, but not literature; which has passed from the horse to the automobile; which has its moral and material yacht, cruising all social coasts and making port in none where there is not a hotel or cottage life as empty and exclusive as its own. Even in trying to understate the sort, one overstates it. Nothing could be more untrue to its reality than the accentuation of traits which in the arrivals of society elsewhere and elsewhen have marked the ultimation of the bourgeois spirit. Say that the Puritan, the Pilgrim, the Cavalier, and the Merchant Adventurer have come and gone; say that the Revolutionist Patriot, the Pioneer and the Backwoodsman and the Noble Savage have come and gone; say that the Slaveholder and the Slave and the Abolitionist and the Civil Warrior have come and gone; say that the Miner, the Rancher, the Cowboy, and the sardonically humorous Frontiersman have come and gone; say that the simple-hearted, hard-working, modest, genial Homemakers have come and gone; say that the Captain of Industry has come and gone, and the world-wide Financier is going: what remains for actuality-loving art to mould into shapes of <b>perdurable</b> beauty? Obviously, only the immeasurable mass of a prosperity sunken in a self-satisfaction unstirred by conscience and unmoved by desire. But is that a reason why art should despair? Rather it is a reason why it should rejoice in an opportunity occurring not more than once in the ages to seize the likeness and express the significance of Arrival, the arrival of a whole civilization. To do this, art must refine and re-refine upon itself; it must use methods of unapproached delicacy, of unimagined subtlety and celerity. It is easy enough to catch the look of the patrician in the upper air, of the plebeian underfoot, but to render the image of a world-bourgeoisie, compacted in characters of undeniable verisimilitude, that will be difficult, but it will be possible, and the success will be of an effulgence such as has never yet taken the eyes of wonder.|$|E

Beyond this disappointment, I remember nothing of that drive. It is a road I have often travelled, and of not one of these journeys do I remember any single trait. The fact has not been suffered to encroach on the truth of the imagination. I still see Magus Muir two hundred years ago: a desert place, quite unenclosed; in the midst, the primate's carriage fleeing at the gallop; the assassins loose-reined in pursuit, Burley Balfour, pistol in hand, among the first. No scene of history has ever written itself so deeply on my mind; not because Balfour, that questionable zealot, was an ancestral cousin of my own; not because of the pleadings of the victim and his daughter; not even because of the live bum-bee that flew out of Sharpe's 'bacco-box, thus clearly indicating his complicity with Satan; nor merely because, as it was after all a crime of a fine religious flavour, it figured in Sunday books and afforded a grateful relief from [...] "Ministering Children" [...] or the [...] "Memoirs of Mrs. Katherine Winslowe." [...] The figure that always fixed my attention is that of Hackston of Rathillet, sitting in the saddle with his cloak about his mouth, and through all that long, bungling, vociferous hurly-burly, revolving privately a case of conscience.

[...] "You are a gentleman--you will protect me!" [...] cried the wounded old man, crawling towards him. [...] "I will never lay a hand on you," [...] said Hackston, and put his cloak about his mouth. It is an old temptation with me to pluck away that cloak and see the face--to open that bosom and to read the heart. With incomplete romances about Hackston, the drawers of my youth were lumbered. I read him up in every printed book that I could lay my hands on. I even dug among the Wodrow manuscripts, sitting shame-faced in the very room where my hero had been tortured two centuries before, and keenly conscious of my youth in the midst of other and (as I fondly thought) more gifted students. All was vain: that he had passed a riotous nonage, that he was a zealot, that he twice displayed (compared with his grotesque companions) some tincture of soldierly resolution and even of military common sense, and that he figured memorably in the scene on Magus Muir, so much and no more could I make out. But whenever I cast my eyes backward, it is to see him like a landmark on the plains of history, sitting with his cloak about his mouth, inscrutable. How small a thing creates an immortality! I do not think he can have been a man entirely commonplace; but had he not thrown his cloak about his mouth, or had the witnesses forgot to chronicle the action, he would not thus have haunted the imagination of my boyhood, and to-day he would scarce delay me for a paragraph. An incident, at once romantic and dramatic, which at once awakes the judgment and makes a picture for the eye, how little do we realise its <b>perdurable</b> power! Perhaps no one does so but the author, just as none but he appreciates the influence of jingling words; so that he looks on upon life, with something of a covert smile, seeing people led by what they fancy to be thoughts and what are really the accustomed artifices of his own trade, or roused by what they take to be principles and are really picturesque effects. In a pleasant book about a school-class club, Colonel Fergusson has recently told a little anecdote. A [...] "Philosophical Society" [...] was formed by some Academy boys--among them, Colonel Fergusson himself, Fleeming Jenkin, and Andrew Wilson, the Christian Buddhist and author of [...] "The Abode of Snow." [...] Before these learned pundits, one member laid the following ingenious problem: [...] "What would be the result of putting a pound of potassium in a pot of porter?" [...] "I should think there would be a number of interesting bi-products," [...] said a smatterer at my elbow; but for me the tale itself has a bi-product, and stands as a type of much that is most human. For this inquirer, who conceived himself to burn with a zeal entirely chemical, was really immersed in a design of a quite different nature: unconsciously to his own recently breeched intelligence, he was engaged in literature. Putting, pound, potassium, pot, porter; initial p, mediant t--that was his idea, poor little boy! So with politics and that which excites men in the present, so with history and that which rouses them in the past: there lie, at the root of what appears, most serious unsuspected elements.|$|E

It is no exaggeration to say that by the time I reached Stephen-street the encampment was a heap of ruins, and the owners of the tents were surveying their blackened ite with such a look of incredulity and amazement that there was quite as much of the ludicrous as of the pathetic in the incident.After this, I think, no more tents were suffered to be erected; but hay and corn factors set up their sentry-boxes on the scene of the fire; and then stall keepers were permitted to utilise the vacant ground; and there might be found the strangest assortment of damaged provisions to be met with outside of the New Cut, the Whitechapel-road or the High-street, Shoreditch. There were cheeses strong enough to waft their odour to Carlton, dried fruits that had been honeycombed by insects, salt fish of <b>perdurable</b> toughness, tins of jam and bottles of pickles with the shabbiest of anonymous labels, sides of bacon of wonderful antiquity, and a conglomerate of so-called dates which appeared to have been cemented together with paste blacking. Who bought those things? And, oh! by whom were they consumed? Sometimes I fancy that the vendors, finding no market for such unconsidered trifles, were driven to consume them themselves, and so perished miserably." ...|$|E

A quasi-experimental design was utilized with 78 volunteer female participants aged 8 - 12 who were attending a volleyball school. Education materials were given to education group to study at homes with their families during 1. 5 months in order to support the education. The increase in nutrition knowledge was significant comparing to control group (p< 0. 005). As a result, the nutrition education and the educational material induced positive changes in nutrition knowledge and behaviours...|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{complications}} of obesity {{is proportional to}} body mass index and is higher in severe or morbid obesities and when abdominal or visceral fat is predominant. In Chile the prevalence of obesity is increasing. According to the World Health Organization, obese subjects must reduce at least a 5 % of their weight {{to reduce the risk}} {{of complications}}. Although this amount of reduction is seldom achieved with non pharmacological treatments, better results are obtained with multidisciplinary/ approaches that include a medical, psychosocial and laboratory assessment, to determine obesity level and different factors involved and the associated complications. In a second stage, goals of treatment are set and a personalized treatment is designed including dietary changes and physical activity.

40|$|Cell {{culture is}} one of the main tools that {{researches}} use to answer questions in the field of biology. It represents a simplified in vivo model of the subject, and the human body is certainly the principle topic under investigation. For this reason, cell cultures from various model organisms such as rodents are widely available, but this is not the case for cell cultures of non-classical model animals. In this work we focused on model species of reptiles, promoted by the research work in our laboratory, on which we tested different protocols for the isolation of primary cells, fibroblasts, in order to find a viable and <b>perdurable</b> way to establish primary cell cultures. Tests were done using different organ samples collected from the various species of snakes and lizards and by evaluating the proprieties of different culture media and enzyme digestions...|$|E

In this guide, Nikos Salingaros, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Texas, offers a succinct summary of his extensive course focusing on how to intelligently approach architectural design by aid of scientific evidence. Unified Architectural Theory seeks to establish a clear articulation of the <b>perdurable</b> framework behind “all of architecture” through centuries that is based on hard scientific facts rather than personal sentiments. The book contains 44 sections and is organised in two parts that respectively give an overview of the course lectures and assignments. The concise format of the sections as well as the apprehensible writing tailored to meet students’ needs make it a great companion for anyone who wants to learn...|$|E

It focuses its attention in the Charrua etnia that, even was quite insignificant in demographical numbers, it left a deep track that can be still watched in the Uruguayan country. The indigenous heritage {{can be observed in}} their courage, the defense of their cultural values and in their passion for freedom. The confrontation between the Charrua and the Creole culture lasted three centuries, and it had a <b>perdurable</b> effect in their culture and in their own lives. The relationship that was established can be described as one of big tension and a latent huge violence. The fighting had a terrible end and unfortunately, including the unavoidable acculturation, in Uruguay was reaffirmed definitively that there were no place for aboriginal cultures...|$|E
40|$|A <b>Perdurable</b> Defence to Weyl?s Unified Theory is a {{published}} article of the Applied Physics department. Einstein dealt a lethal blow to Weyl?s unified theory {{by arguing that}} Weyl?s theory was at the very best ? beautiful, {{and at the very}} least, un-physical, because its concept of variation of the length of a vector from one point of space to the other meant that certain absolute quantities, such as the ?fixed? spacing of atomic spectral lines and the Compton wavelength of an Electron for example, would change arbitrarily as they would have to depend on their prehistories. This venomous criticism of Einstein to Weyl?s theory remains much alive today as it was on the first day Einstein pronounced it. We demonstrate herein that one can overcome Einstein?s criticism by recasting Weyl?s theory into a new Weyl-kind of theory were the length of vectors are preserved {{as is the case in}} Riemann geometry. In this New Weyl Theory, the Weyl gauge transformation of the Riemann metric g and the Maxwellian electromagnetic field A are preserved...|$|E
40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} {{are linked to}} the accumulation of specific protein aggregates, suggesting an intimate connection between injured brain and loss of proteostasis. Proteostasis refers to all the processes by which cells control the abundance and folding of the proteome thanks to a wide network that integrates the regulation of signaling pathways, gene expression and protein degradation systems. This review attempts to summarize the most relevant findings about the transcriptional modulation of proteostasis exerted by the transcription factor NRF 2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2). NRF 2 has been classically considered as the master regulator of the antioxidant cell response, although it is currently emerging as a key component of the transduction machinery to maintain proteostasis. As we will discuss, NRF 2 could be envisioned as a hub that compiles emergency signals derived from misfolded protein accumulation in order to build a coordinated and <b>perdurable</b> transcriptional response. This is achieved by functions of NRF 2 related to the control of genes involved in the maintenance of the endoplasmic reticulum physiology, the proteasome and autophagy.

40|$|Inhibition of gene {{expression}} through siRNAs {{is a tool}} increasingly used {{for the study of}} gene function in model systems, including transgenic mice. To achieve <b>perdurable</b> effects, the stable expression of siRNAs by an integrated transgenic construct is necessary. For transgenic siRNA expression, promoters transcribed by either RNApol II or III (such as U 6 or H 1 promoters) can be used. Relatively large amounts of small RNAs synthesis are achieved when using RNApol III promoters, which can be advantageous in knockdown experiments. To study the feasibility of H 1 promoter-driven RNAi-expressing constructs for protein knockdown in transgenic mice, we chose IKK 1 as the target gene. Our results indicate that constructs containing the H 1 promoter are sensitive to the presence of prokaryotic sequences and to transgene position effects, similar to RNApol II promoters-driven constructs. We observed variable expression levels of transgenic siRNA among different tissues and animals and a reduction of up to 80 % in IKK 1 expression. Furthermore, IKK 1 knockdown led to hair follicle alterations. In summary, we show that constructs directed by the H 1 promoter can be used for knockdown of genes of interest in different organs and for the generation of animal models complementary to knockout and overexpression models...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{studies the}} {{foundation}} of Saint Anthony´s hospital of Segovia during the XVth century. The foundation was an initiative of Diego Arias de Ávila, {{one of the most}} influential personalities of the reign of Henry IV of Castila. The foundation was determined on very varied reasons, not only charitative and religious reasons. Among these reasons, the use of the hospital as an instrument of the family strategies. These family strategies tried to hidden the hebrew origins of the lineage. They also tried to guarantee the perennity of the lineage, and to leave an endurable memory behind. Lasdy, these family strategies tried to consolidate the domination that the lineage had on Segovia. El presente trabajo estudia la fundación del hospital de San Antonio de Segovia en el siglo XV.

40|$|In 1953, the Mexican State {{implemented}} {{a public policy}} of support for financing small and medium-sized industrial enterprises (SMIE), the FOGAIN. This device was aimed at correcting some market failures, specifically the rationing of credit that affected these types of enterprise. Previously, {{in the aftermath of}} the Revolution of 1910, a specific link had been established between the State and the economic agents. This probably altered the modality and scope of this public policy. This device proved to be ad hoc instrument in order to establish an implicit and <b>perdurable</b> agreement between the State?by means of its technocrac? and the business community within the model of imports substitution industrialization (ISI). The existence of this type of devices was only possible within the frame of a policy of indebtedness which was simultaneously a condition and a consequence. The incompatibility of the governance of this device and the logics of banking regarding the mechanisms of credit granting, combined with the structural adjustment policies, resulted in the suppression of FOGAIN in 1989. En 1953, l’Etat mexicain met en place une politique d’appui au financement des petites et moyennes entreprises industrielles (PMEI), le FOGAIN. Ce dispositif visait à combler les défaillances de marché, en particulier celles relevant du rationnement de crédit dont faisaient l’objet ce type d’entreprises. Or, la nature de la relation qui s’était forgée entre l’Etat et les agents économiques après la révolution de 1910 aura probablement déterminé les modalités et la portée des résultats de cette politique publique...|$|E
