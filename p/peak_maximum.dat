5|$|After forming, the {{depression}} moved slowly southeastward for about 24  hours {{before turning to}} the northeast, slowly organizing in the process. On September 10, {{the depression}} turned eastward, and later that day intensified into Tropical Storm Ginger, the seventh named storm {{of the year in}} the Atlantic, about 325 mi (525 km) south of Bermuda. The storm quickly intensified, and within 24 hours reached winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a hurricane. It turned to the northeast, passing well to the east of Bermuda. Late on September 13, Ginger attained its minimum barometric pressure of 959 mbar (28.32 inHg), and early the next day reached <b>peak</b> <b>maximum</b> sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). After reaching a position about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores, the hurricane's eastward movement halted due to a building ridge to its north and east. It turned sharply southward before turning and beginning a westerly drift, during which Ginger weakened to minimal hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|In May 2003, a {{tropical}} cyclone officially called Very Severe Cyclonic Storm BOB 01 produced the worst flooding in Sri Lanka in 56years. The first storm of the 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it {{developed over the}} Bay of Bengal on May10. Favorable environmental conditions allowed the system to intensify steadily while moving northwestward. The storm reached <b>peak</b> <b>maximum</b> sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) on May13, making it a very severe cyclonic storm according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin. The cyclone drifted north over the central Bay of Bengal, gradually weakening due to heightened wind shear. Turning eastward, the storm deteriorated to a deep depression on May 16 before it curved northeastward and re-intensified into a cyclonic storm. It came ashore in western Myanmar and dissipated over land the following day.|$|E
5|$|With a {{subtropical}} ridge {{in the vicinity}} of the Marianas Islands, the nascent depression moved to the northwest. On August3, the JMA upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, naming it Etau. An upper-level low to the northeast improved northerly outflow, allowing the storm to strengthen quickly. On August4 the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the region, naming it Kabayan. Late on August4, the JMA upgraded Etau to typhoon status, with the storm later developing an eye. An approaching shortwave trough weakened the ridge, causing Etau to turn more to the north. At around 0030UTC on August7, the typhoon made its closest approach to Okinawa, passing within 120km (75mi), and close enough for the 100km (60mi) wide eye to cross over the island. Later that day, the JMA estimated <b>peak</b> <b>maximum</b> sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph), sustained over a duration of 10minutes; the JTWC estimated 1minute winds of 205km/h (125mph).|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Bejisa was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that affected the islands of Réunion and Mauritius in early January 2014. In late December 2013, a tropical disturbance developed {{to the north of}} Madagascar. With favorable conditions, the low developed into a disturbance and soon into a depression on December28. The system continued to develop and intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Bejisa on December29, with rapid intensification occurring. It developed into an Intense Tropical Cyclone on December30, reaching <b>peak</b> <b>maximum</b> sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph). Due to an eyewall replacement cycle, Bejisa weakened, but re-intensified to a secondary peak of 160km/h (100mph) on January1. Increased wind shear weakened the eyewall, which passed within 15km (9mi) of Réunion. After having moved generally south-southeastward for much of its duration, Bejisa turned to the southwest on January3, by which time it had weakened to tropical storm status. It became a post-tropical cyclone on January5 after the convection weakened over the center, and Bejisa became extratropical the next day as it meandered southwest of Madagascar.|$|E

The interference function is modulated by the angle dependent instrumental factors (Lorentz-polarization, diffraction geometry) and physical factors (structural factor, volume absorption, surface roughness absorption) which lead to profile distortions and to the shift of the <b>peak</b> <b>maxima.</b> This effect is especially significant at low diffraction angles and for broadened diffraction lines (FWHM> 1 degrees).

5|$|Typhoon Chanchu, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Caloy, was the most intense typhoon in the South China Sea {{in the month of}} May {{according}} to the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). The first named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Chanchu formed on May8 {{in the vicinity of the}} Federated States of Micronesia and progressed westward. It gradually intensified into a tropical storm and later severe tropical storm before moving through the Philippines. On May13, Chanchu entered the South China Sea and became a typhoon, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Warm waters and favorable outflow allowed the storm to quickly intensify to <b>peak</b> <b>maximum</b> sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph) on May15. Around that time, the typhoon turned sharply to the north toward southeastern China. Chanchu weakened as it curved to the northeast, making landfall near Shantou, Guangdong on May17 as a severe tropical storm. The government of China considered Chanchu the earliest typhoon to make landfall in the province. On the next day, the storm emerged into the East China Sea, becoming extratropical on May19 before dissipating west of Kyushu.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of a dynamic simple shear strain test system which is the latest generation of GCTS made in USA {{as well as its}} features is presented. The input method for primarily real seismic loading is analyzed. And the validity of the method is verified. Based on the US Filter clean sand, the preparation process of the sand samples is explained. Two shock types of seismic waves and two vibration types of seismic waves are selected for input loading in tests. Considering the relative density and overlying loading, the test conditions are planned, and 202 dynamic simple shear tests controlled by strain are carried out. The test results show that the seismic compression in sands due to the vibration-type seismic waves is larger than that induced by the shock-type seismic waves under the same relative density of sands and the same overlying loading. The seismic compression is mainly caused by several seismic waves with relatively high peak prior to the <b>maximum</b> <b>peak.</b> And the <b>maximum</b> vertical shear strains in sands are corresponding to the <b>maximum</b> <b>peak</b> seismic waves. For the seismic waves after the <b>maximum</b> <b>peak,</b> the waves whose peak reaches 80 % of the <b>maximum</b> <b>peak</b> approximately in the seismic waves have more significant effectiveness on deformations of sands. For the shock-type seismic waves, various waves after the <b>maximum</b> <b>peak</b> have no obvious effect on deformations of sands. However, for the vibration-type seismic waves, the seismic compressions in sands are determined by the waves both prior to the <b>maximum</b> <b>peak</b> and that in a certain range after the <b>maximum</b> <b>peak</b> together...|$|R
500|$|Typhoon Maemi (...) , {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Pogi, was the most {{powerful}} typhoon to strike South Korea since record-keeping began {{in the country in}} 1904. Maemi formed on September4, 2003 from a disturbance in a monsoon trough in the western Pacific Ocean. It slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Maemi while moving northwestward, becoming a typhoon on September8. That day, favorable conditions facilitated more rapid strengthening; the storm developed a well-defined eye and reached <b>peak</b> <b>maximum</b> sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). While near peak intensity, Maemi decelerated and began turning to the north-northeast. Soon after, the eyewall passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima on September10 and produced an air pressure reading of , the fourth-lowest recorded in the nation. Due to warm waters, Maemi was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of Busan, South Korea, on September12. The typhoon became extratropical in the East Sea the next day, although its remnants persisted for several days, lashing northern Japan with strong winds.|$|E
