50|$|To achieve {{improvement}} in PHE's, two important factors namely {{amount of heat}} transfer and pressure drop {{have to be considered}} such that amount of heat transfer needs to be increased and pressure drops need to be decreased. In <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers due to presence of corrugated plate, there is a significant resistance to flow with high friction loss. Thus to design <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers, one should consider both factors. For various range of Reynolds numbers, many correlations and chevron angles for <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers exist. The plate geometry {{is one of the most}} important factor in heat transfer and pressure drop in <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers, however such a feature is not accurately prescribed. In the corrugated <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers, because of narrow path between the plates, there is a large pressure capacity and the flow becomes turbulent along the path. Therefore, it requires more pumping power than the other types of heat exchangers. Therefore, higher heat transfer and less pressure drop are targeted. The shape of <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger is very important for industrial applications that are affected by pressure drop.|$|R

The main purpose of this paper was to devise a methodology that is capable of calculating optimum number of plates in the design of a <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. To obtain the appropriate number of plates, typically several iterations must be made before a final acceptable design is completed, since plate amount depends on many factors such as, flow velocities, physical properties of the streams, flow channel geometry, allowable pressure drop, plate dimensions, and the gap between the plates.

The effects of SiO 2, the most common inorganic particles in the treated sewage, on the biofouling of the heat exchanger surface were studied. The results showed that the SiO 2 particles influenced the biofilm development, further impacting the resulting heat transfer degradation. An increased biofouling mass was observed with increasing SiO 2 concentration; however, the highest organic substance level in the biofouling and the highest biofouling heat transfer resistance were achieved at intermediate SiO 2 particle concentrations. The inorganic particles led to expansion of the biofouling layer structure, which further affected the rate of biofouling buildup. Filaments and net biofouling structures were observed with the SiO 2 particles, leading to increased heat transfer resistance. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
