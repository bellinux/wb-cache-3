5|$|Organ <b>pipes</b> {{are divided}} into flue <b>pipes</b> and reed <b>pipes</b> {{according}} to their design and timbre. Flue <b>pipes</b> produce sound by forcing air through a fipple, {{like that of a}} recorder, whereas reed <b>pipes</b> produce sound via a beating reed, like that of a clarinet or saxophone.|$|E
5|$|A {{pipe organ}} {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets of <b>pipes,</b> a wind system, and one or more keyboards. The <b>pipes</b> produce sound when pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to the <b>pipes.</b> Stops allow the organist to control which ranks of <b>pipes</b> sound at a given time. The organist operates the stops and the keyboards from the console.|$|E
5|$|Diamond-bearing rock {{is carried}} from the mantle to the Earth's surface by deep-origin {{volcanic}} eruptions. The magma {{for such a}} volcano must originate at a depth where diamonds can be formed— or more (three times or more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes). This is a relatively rare occurrence. These typically small surface volcanic craters extend downward in formations known as volcanic <b>pipes.</b> The <b>pipes</b> contain material that was transported toward the surface by volcanic action, but was not ejected before the volcanic activity ceased. During eruption these <b>pipes</b> {{are open to the}} surface, resulting in open circulation; many xenoliths of surface rock and even wood and fossils are found in volcanic <b>pipes.</b> Diamond-bearing volcanic <b>pipes</b> are closely related to the oldest, coolest regions of continental crust (cratons). This is because cratons are very thick, and their lithospheric mantle extends to great enough depth that diamonds are stable. Not all <b>pipes</b> contain diamonds, and even fewer contain enough diamonds to make mining economically viable.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pipe</b> {{support or}} <b>pipe</b> hanger is a {{designed}} element that transfer the load from a <b>pipe</b> to the supporting structures. The load includes {{the weight of}} the <b>pipe</b> proper, the content that the <b>pipe</b> carries, all the <b>pipe</b> fittings attached to <b>pipe,</b> and the <b>pipe</b> covering such as insulation. The four main functions of a <b>pipe</b> support are to anchor, guide, absorb shock, and support a specified load. <b>Pipe</b> supports used in high or low temperature applications may contain insulation materials. The overall design configuration of a <b>pipe</b> support assembly is dependent on the loading and operating conditions.|$|R
50|$|AMERICAN Steel <b>Pipe,</b> {{based in}} Birmingham, Alabama, {{produces}} electric-resistance-welded steel <b>pipe.</b> Applications include high pressure {{oil and gas}} transmission lines, distribution main lines, offshore gathering systems, steel <b>pipe</b> pilings, abrasive-resistance <b>pipe,</b> HIC resistant <b>pipe</b> for sour service, dredge <b>pipe,</b> and product pipelines.|$|R
25|$|The <b>pipe</b> band {{is another}} common format for {{highland}} piping, with top competitive bands including the Victoria Police <b>Pipe</b> Band from Australia (formerly), Northern Ireland's Field Marshal Montgomery, the Republic of Ireland's Laurence O'Toole <b>pipe</b> band, Canada's 78th Fraser Highlanders <b>Pipe</b> Band and Simon Fraser University <b>Pipe</b> Band, and Scottish bands like Shotts and Dykehead <b>Pipe</b> Band and Strathclyde Police <b>Pipe</b> Band. These bands, {{as well as}} many others, compete in numerous <b>pipe</b> band competitions, often the World <b>Pipe</b> Band Championships, and sometimes perform in public concerts.|$|R
5|$|Organ cases {{occasionally}} {{feature a}} few ranks of <b>pipes</b> protruding horizontally {{from the case}} {{in the manner of a}} row of trumpets. These are referred to as <b>pipes</b> en chamade and are particularly common in organs of the Iberian peninsula and large 20th-century instruments.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of <b>pipes</b> {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two <b>pipes</b> of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough <b>pipes</b> to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of <b>pipes</b> used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of <b>pipes</b> (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ <b>pipes</b> selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the <b>pipes</b> are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of <b>pipes</b> of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E
50|$|Currently the College {{has three}} {{competitive}} <b>pipe</b> bands. These bands are registered with The Atlantic Canada <b>Pipe</b> Band Association (ACPBA) as grades 2, 4, and 5. The College of <b>Piping</b> <b>Pipe</b> Bands {{are under the}} direction of <b>Pipe</b> Major James MacHattie, <b>Pipe</b> Sgt. Kylie MacHattie and Drum Sgt. Chris Coleman. In 2014 The College of <b>Piping</b> will be sending their grade 3 and 4 to Scotland to compete at The World <b>Pipe</b> Band Championships.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pipe</b> rams close {{around a}} drill <b>pipe,</b> restricting {{flow in the}} annulus (ring-shaped space between {{concentric}} objects) between {{the outside of the}} drill <b>pipe</b> and the wellbore, but do not obstruct flow within the drill <b>pipe.</b> Variable-bore <b>pipe</b> rams can accommodate tubing in a wider range of outside diameters than standard <b>pipe</b> rams, but typically with some loss of pressure capacity and longevity. <b>Pipe</b> ram should not be closed if there is no <b>pipe</b> in the hole.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pipe</b> clamp {{can also}} be used to connect a <b>pipe</b> to the {{remainder}} of a <b>pipe</b> hanger assembly. <b>Pipe</b> clamps are recommended for suspension for cold <b>pipe</b> lines that may or may not be insulated.|$|R
5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water <b>pipes</b> is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the <b>pipes</b> whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead <b>pipes.</b> Dissolved {{carbon dioxide in the}} carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the <b>pipes</b> will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E
5|$|According to officials, the {{sinkhole}} had similarities {{with another}} Guatemalan sinkhole which collapsed in 2007, which {{may also have}} been formed by ruptured sewage <b>pipes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} May 1965 and NTNF {{planned to use}} {{as much of the}} mining company Kings Bay's {{facilities}} as they could. NTNF was allowed to use buildings as needed for free. In exchange, NTNF maintained the entire village and paid insurance on the buildings they used. Movable property used by NTNF was bought for a moderate price. NTNF had to build several new buildings in addition to utilities such as power cables and water, sewer and heating <b>pipes.</b> The new <b>pipes</b> had to be installed after the previous <b>pipes,</b> installed in 1956, had been subject to frost burst. Instead of building the <b>pipes</b> in a culvert, they were instead placed in wooded boxes above ground. During the summer of 1965, 65 people were working on construction, although it fell to between 40 and 45 during the winter. The following winter, only five people overwintered.|$|E
50|$|A double-walled <b>pipe</b> is a {{secondary}} contained piping system. It is a <b>pipe</b> within a <b>pipe,</b> or encased in an outer covering, with an annulus (interstitial space) {{between the two}} diameters. The inner <b>pipe</b> is the primary or carrier <b>pipe</b> and the outer <b>pipe</b> is called the secondary or containment <b>pipe.</b> The great majority of double-walled piping applications involve wastewater, groundwater, and process safety.|$|R
50|$|Liddell {{lives in}} Inveraray and is <b>Pipe</b> Major of the Grade 1 Inveraray & District <b>Pipe</b> Band—a band he helped found. For ten years (1998-2008), {{he played with}} the Simon Fraser University <b>Pipe</b> Band in Burnaby, British Columbia. With the SFU <b>Pipe</b> band he won three World <b>Pipe</b> Band Championship titles, in 1999, 2001, and 2008. Before joining the SFU <b>Pipe</b> Band, he played with ScottishPower <b>Pipe</b> Band.|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to a conventional cylindrical <b>pipe,</b> a textured <b>pipe</b> is proposed for deep subsea operations. The basic geometric parameters, the stiffness properties and the stress distribution in the textured <b>pipe</b> are presented. The propagation buckling response of the textured <b>pipe</b> is analysed and compared to equivalent cylindrical <b>pipe.</b> The effects of geometric imperfection and the basic geometric parameters defining the textured <b>pipe</b> on the propagation response are evaluated. The textured <b>pipe</b> offers {{a substantial increase in}} propagation buckling capacity when compared to equivalent cylindrical <b>pipe...</b>|$|R

5|$|However, recent {{research}} {{supports the idea}} that the lead found in the water came from the supply <b>pipes,</b> rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the <b>pipes</b> to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Eddy Creek lacked culm {{deposits}} at its mouth. However, its water was colored yellow by sulfur at that location. Further upstream, two <b>pipes</b> discharged mine {{water into the}} creek. One of these <b>pipes</b> had reddish water. However, upstream of an ash dump on the creek, the water was clear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pipe</b> to <b>Pipe</b> {{typically}} {{consists of}} a series of contests spread throughout July and August, however in 2010 Bonfire compiled the series into one day of skateboarding and snowboarding. The format has varied throughout the 13 <b>Pipe</b> to <b>Pipe</b> contests, featuring a half <b>pipe</b> contest in the early years and adopting a rail contest format in recent years. In 2010, <b>Pipe</b> to <b>Pipe</b> returned to its roots and featured a 150 ft, 15 ft mini <b>pipe</b> filled with a mix of features and jibs.|$|R

50|$|Segmental {{sliplining}} is {{very similar}} to continuous sliplining. The difference is primarily based on the <b>pipe</b> material used as the new carrier <b>pipe.</b> When using any bell and spigot <b>pipe</b> such as FRP, PVC, HDPE or Spirally Welded Steel <b>Pipe,</b> the individual pieces of <b>pipe</b> are lowered into place, pushed together, and pushed along the existing <b>pipe</b> corridor.|$|R
5|$|<b>Pipes</b> are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of <b>pipes</b> of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of <b>pipes</b> are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E
5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the <b>pipes</b> at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc <b>pipes</b> and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E
5|$|Despite similar {{deaths in}} {{vehicles}} with clogged exhaust <b>pipes</b> (for {{example in the}} Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978 and February 2013 nor'easter) and the commercial availability of the equipment, there is no legal requirement for automotive CO detectors.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>pipe</b> clamp {{is a type}} of clamp often {{employed}} in woodworking, piping or cabinet shops. When referring to woodwork or cabinet shops, <b>pipe</b> clamps are usually composed of commercially manufactured clamp heads or [...] "jaws" [...] and a length of common threaded <b>pipe.</b> The capacity of the clamp is determined by the length of the <b>pipe</b> used. When referring to piping, <b>pipe</b> clamps are used to connect the <b>pipe</b> to the <b>pipe</b> hanger assembly.|$|R

5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 <b>pipes</b> that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the <b>pipes</b> and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Base on indoor model {{tests of}} three {{variable}} section <b>pipe</b> piles and two constant section <b>pipe</b> piles performed in foundation pit,the load transfer mechanism of {{two kinds of}} close-ended <b>pipe</b> piles are studied by comparing horizontal load-displacement curves, critical load and bending moment of piles. Results show that horizontal load-displacement curves change slowly and horizontal bearing capacity of valiable section <b>pipe</b> piles will be higher than constant section <b>pipe</b> piles with equal average diameters. Comparing with constant section <b>pipe</b> piles 1 # and 2 # with equal average diameters, unit volume horizontal critical bearing capacity of 3 # and 4 # are improved 8. 7 % and 34. 2 % respectively and which have different degrees of increse with improvement of valiable section ratio. Moreover,there are two maximum bending moment to valialble section <b>pipe</b> piles insteard of one to constant section <b>pipe</b> piles. To <b>pipe</b> piles 3 #, 4 # and 5 #, maximum bending moment ratio of big diameter <b>pipe</b> to small diameter <b>pipe</b> of valiable section <b>pipe</b> pile are 3. 13, 2. 33 and 1. 89 respectively. To <b>pipe</b> piles 3 # and 4 #, maximum bending moments of big diameter <b>pipe</b> are improved 26. 8 % and 28. 4 %. Howeverm,maximum bending moment of small diameter <b>pipe</b> are improved 54. 1 % and 111. 8 %. So,it is very clear that valiable section <b>pipe</b> pile is more reasonable than constant section <b>pipe</b> pile in bearing characteristics...|$|R
