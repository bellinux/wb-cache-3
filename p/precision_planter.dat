40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} carried out to analyze the dynamic {{characteristics}} of the seed plate which is {{the main part of}} the vacuum <b>precision</b> <b>planter.</b> The vacuum <b>precision</b> <b>planter</b> is a working machine which is attached to a tractor. The vacuum pump is operated by PTO-shaft which rotates in three types; 540 rpm (9 Hz), 750 rpm(12. 5 Hz) and 1, 000 rpm(16 Hz). Seeds are sucked into the holes of the seed plate by vacuum, and then they are transported by rotation. At that time, the mode shape of seed plate is important because dynamic characteristics of the seed plate decide seeding rates. If the natural frequency of seed plate corresponds with the frequency of PTO-shaft, the resonance occurs. For this reason, modal analysis of the seed plate was made with FlexPDE(PDE solutions, inc) and ANSYS(ANSYS, inc). Mode shape was observed for 5 th mode. First, modal analysis of the seed plate was performed by FlexPDE. According to the result of FlexPDE, natural frequency of each mode was obtained 35. 7 Hz, 35. 8 Hz, 45. 3 Hz, 60. 8 Hz and 61. 0 Hz respectively. The other modal analysis of the seed plate was performed by ANSYS. As a result of the ANSYS analysis, natural frequency of each mode was obtained 35. 6 Hz, 36. 0 Hz, 45. 6 Hz, 60. 9 Hz and 61. 1 Hz respectively. The results of the FlexPDE and ANSYS were similar. Natural frequency of the seed plate was confirmed by the above results. So, it was confirmed that the resonance didn't happen by comparing the frequency of PTO-shaft and natural frequency of seed plate. In conclusion, the vacuum <b>precision</b> <b>planter</b> is expected to efficiently sow...|$|E

40|$|Direct seeding {{in fields}} with high amounts of residue {{has always been}} a problem for producers. Excess residue causes hair-pining of the straw which results in {{decreased}} penetration of disk openers. Hair-pinning also results in poor seed placement which decreases the crop establishment. In the past, residue managers have commonly been used in the United States to clear residue for precision planters in high value crops. The <b>precision</b> <b>planter</b> residue managers are costly and therefore are not commonly used to seed other types of crops. Manufacturers have recently designed universal cheaper types of residue managers. The new residue managers are designed for cereal, pulse and oilseed type crops to clear the residue away from the path of the opener to allow for good soil penetration, residue clearance and seed placement. The AgTech Centre was approached by the Alberta Reduced Tillage Linkages (ARTL) to test the performance of several different residue managers. The ARTL wanted to increase the exposure of residue managers in Alberta with hopes of more producers direct seeding in heavy residue conditions. The AgTech Centre performed an experiment to test various types of residue managers while seeding with disk openers under different conditions. Measurements were made and analyzed. Residue managers did increase the crop emergence of wheat and canola but results were not significant. Further testing and data is needed to conclude the study...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringAjay ShardaIn recent years, the {{technology}} employed on <b>precision</b> row-crop <b>planters</b> has rapidly advanced. These new technologies include automatic downforce control systems and electronic drive singulation seed meters. These new technologies offer producers higher productivity through high speed planting and increased yield potentials through accurate seed spacing and placement. To {{begin to understand}} the benefits and performance of these new technologies, research must be conducted that specifically targets these new systems. With this research, producers would be able to better select equipment for their operation and have a deeper understanding of proper system operation and settings. A test stand, of a scissor-lift type design, was developed to evaluate row crop planter automatic downforce systems. Evaluation of a planter’s automatic downforce system is important for understanding the planter’s capability of maintaining target seeding depth throughout varying field conditions. The test stand consists of a horizontal platform that can raise and lower to simulate terrain changes as well as a mechanism to load the planter row unit’s opening discs to simulate varying soil texture. The vertical height of the test stand and the disc load can be varied in real-time based on utilizing real-world scenarios under simulated conditions to evaluate downforce system response. The stand incorporated several sensors to obtain the overall applied downforce, applied disc load, applied gauge wheel load, and hydraulic pressure. The test stand’s capabilities were evaluated and found to be satisfactory for planter downforce system testing. The test stand was then used to evaluate a commercial automatic downforce system when operating under simulated field conditions. Field data was used to create simulations representing soil type changes, planter operating speed changes, and extreme conditions such as a hard, packed clay or rocky soil type. It was found that the evaluated downforce system was able to maintain target gauge wheel load to within ± 223 N for at least 94 % of the time during all simulations. This would suggest that the planter would be able to maintain target seeding depth for at least 94 % of field operations. Another key aspect for <b>precision</b> agricultural <b>planters</b> is to achieve accurate seed spacing at varying speeds. An electronic drive singulation seed metering system was evaluated to gather the meter’s effectiveness for high speed planting during straight and contour farming mode using simulated field conditions. The simulated conditions were used to gather the meter’s response when encountering high planting speeds, accelerations, decelerations, point-rows, and contours. These meters were found to be highly accurate, with less than 1. 5 % error in target seed meter speed during all simulated conditions. The meters were also found to have a response time that was always 0. 34 seconds or less for all simulated conditions...|$|R

In the experiment, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of the field area was tilled respectively with the strips in 22. 5, 30 and 37. 5 cm widths, which were obtained by changing the positions of flanges and blade connections of the rotary hoe.

40|$|Miscanthus giganteus is a seed sterile crop {{that has}} shown {{potential}} in the US and Europe as a bioenergy crop. In European trials, M. giganteus yields have ranged from 10 - 30 Mg dry matter (DM) ha- 1 and from 25 - 38 Mg DM ha- 1 in limited US trials. Due to its sterility, M. giganteus is principally propagated by rhizome division. However, limited {{research has been conducted}} on the mechanization of the propagation system. ^ Vegetatively propagated crops, planting procedures and commercially available production equipment were reviewed to gain perspective on how to potentially mechanize the process of planting M. giganteus rhizomes. Typical procedures and equipment used for rhizome harvesting were also examined. The review of available technology shows that there are aspects of horticultural equipment that are adaptable for use with M. giganteus. In addition, examination of specialty equipment for M. giganteus shows aspects that are improvable such as uniformity of spacing in row and rhizome singulation. Current equipment for propagation of rhizomes relies on bulk metering of rhizomes into furrows, the key disadvantage of which is non-uniform spacing. ^ Based upon the review and recommendations that were developed, a prototype <b>precision</b> miscanthus rhizome <b>planter</b> was developed from Lockwood Air Cup® row units. The planter uses nozzles under vacuum to singulate rhizomes from a hopper. The planter plants miscanthus rhizomes at fixed in-row spacing of 46, 51, 56, 61 or 76 cm. ^ Based upon the recommendations of previous research a prototype <b>precision</b> miscanthus rhizome <b>planter</b> was developed from Lockwood Air Cup® row units. The planter utilizes vacuum to singulate and plant rhizomes at target in-row spacing. Two field tests were performed where planter performance was quantified by quality of feed, multiple, miss and precision indices. The quality of feed index is the percentage of one or two rhizomes recorded. The multiple index is the percentage of three or more rhizomes recorded. The miss index is the percentage of skips recorded and the precision is the variation in spacing of single and double rhizomes {{as a percentage of the}} nominal spacing. ^ The initial field test used rhizome material 0. 6 - 1. 3 cm in diameter and 7. 0 - 13. 0 cm long. The quality of feed was 61. 0 % with a multiple index of 17. 0 % and miss index of 22. 0 %. The second field test used rhizome material 1. 0 - 1. 4 cm in diameter and 7. 0 - 13. 0 cm long and tested nominal spacings of 56, 61 and 76 cm. The quality of feed indices were 48. 0 %, 48. 0 % and 52. 0 %, the multiple indices were 1. 3 %, 1. 3 % and 6. 7 % respectively and the miss indices were 50. 7 %, 50. 7 % and 41. 3 % respectively. The precision was 7. 8 %, 9. 3 % and 8. 3 % respectively. ^ Cup designs were tested to determine if there was a significant difference in the requirements to hold a rhizome. The first design tested was the original conical cup used for potatoes on Lockwood AirCup planters. The second cup was a modified version of the original cup with notches cut into it to help orient rhizomes in the cup and allow the rhizomes to be closer to the nozzle inlet. Testing showed that the modified design required 584 Pa less static pressure, 2. 65 m 3 hr- 1 less flow and an inlet velocity 2. 16 m s- 1 lower than the original design. ^ The requirements to hold a rhizome against an orifice were investigated for pipe inside diameters of 0. 87, 1. 20, 1. 56, 2. 04, 2. 62 and 3. 64 cm. Models were developed to predict the requirements to hold a rhizome for the diameters tested. Testing showed that flow is positively correlated to pipe diameter according to Q = 3. 44 D 1. 94, where Q is the flow (m 3 hr- 1) and D is pipe inside diameter (cm). Static pressure was found to be negatively correlated to pipe diameter according to Pr = 2200 D - 2. 05 where Pr is static pressure (Pa). The power required was positively correlated to P = 1. 70 D 0. 54 where P is power (W). The force exerted on the rhizome is negatively correlated to F = 0. 187 D- 0. 74 where F is force (N). ...|$|R
