25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) is a <b>psychosocial</b> <b>intervention</b> that is {{the most}} widely used evidence-based practice for improving mental health. Guided by empirical research, CBT focuses on the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing unhelpful patterns in cognitions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes), behaviors, and emotional regulation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{effectiveness}} of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> in treating people with dementia and their carers is increasingly emphasised in the literature. Dementia guidelines should summarise {{the scientific evidence}} and best practice that is currently available, therefore, it should include recommendations for <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions.</b> The aims of our study were (1) to collate dementia guidelines from countries across Europe and to check whether they included sections about <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions,</b> and (2) to compare the methodological quality and the recommendations for specific <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> in these guidelines. METHODS: The European dementia guidelines were inventoried. The methodological quality of the guideline sections for <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> was assessed with the (AGREE) Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument. The recommendations for specific <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> were extracted from each of these guidelines and compared. RESULTS: Guidelines for <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> were found in five of 12 countries. Guideline developers, methodological quality and appreciation of available evidence influenced the inclusion of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> in dementia guidelines from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. The UK NICE SCIE guideline had the best methodological quality and included the most recommendations for <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions.</b> Physical activity and carer interventions were recommended the most across all guidelines. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> in dementia guidelines is limited across Europe. High-quality guidelines that include <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> and are {{kept up to date}} with the emerging evidence are needed. Throughout Europe, special attention to the implementation of evidence-based psychosocial care is needed in the next few years...|$|R

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of the relevant literature, to investigate the effectiveness of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> focused on improvements in cognition, behavior, mood and quality of life. To select the 10 studies included in the meta-analysis, we conducted an extensive search in the following databases: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EBSCO, WEB OF SCIENCE.

25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in parkinsonian syndromes {{for a variety of}} reasons. An overlap exists between PD and Lewy body dementia, so that where Lewy bodies are present in the visual cortex, {{hallucinations}} may result. Hallucinations can also be brought about by excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Most hallucinations are visual in nature, often formed as familiar people or animals, and are generally not threatening in nature. Some patients find them comforting; however, their caregivers often find this part of the disease most disturbing, and the occurrence of hallucinations is a major risk factor for hospitalisation. Treatment options consist of modifying the dosage of dopaminergic drugs taken each day, adding an antipsychotic drug such as quetiapine, or offering caregivers a <b>psychosocial</b> <b>intervention</b> to help them cope with the hallucinations.|$|E

40|$|Objective Insight {{into the}} {{characteristics}} of caregivers for whom <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> are effective is important for care practice. Until now no systematic reviews were conducted into the effectiveness of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> for caregiver subgroups. Methods To gain insight into this relationship between caregiver subgroups and intervention outcomes, a first review study was done. This study reviews the personal characteristics of caregivers of people with dementia for whom <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> were effective. Results Electronic databases and key articles were searched for reviews on <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> for caregivers studies published between January 1990 and February 2008. Based on these reviews, twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria (i. e. having positive outcomes described in subgroups). Most positive effects were found in caregivers of people with a diagnosis of 'dementia not otherwise specified' and in the subgroup of female caregivers. Examples of outcomes were decreased depression and improved self-efficacy. Conclusions This study gives a first overview of successful <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> in subgroups of caregivers of people with dementia. It makes clear that until now, relatively {{little research has been}} done into subgroups of these caregivers. It also suggests that {{more research is needed to}} better understand which <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> are effective for specific subgroups of caregivers of people with dementia. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} increase in <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> in the aftermath of ethno-political violence. Rwanda after genocide received sustained psychological attention and this paper critically examines the contribution of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> to the broader development agenda of reconstruction and rehabilitation. We undertake a brief psychologically informed analysis of the factors that contributed to genocide as a means of outlining the political and cultural context in which <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> operate. During the violence, ethnicity was politically mobilised, communities polarised, social networks fragmented. An analysis of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> for children highlights that programmes have not examined implications of social power and status before reintegration and community based <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> have been slow to develop. An examination of how psychological knowledge has been utilised in post-genocide re-constructive efforts shows that ‘trauma’ {{has been a}} dominant discourse. We explore the potential impact of a narrow focus on victims and survivors on societal rehabilitation, and reflect on the implications of how ‘trauma’ may be appropriated and politicised as a symbol of genocide and political legitimacy. This leads to reflection on groups that have been marginalised from psychosocial support and the potential implications of this. The paper concludes with an analysis of what a rights framework can contribute to <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> in linking <b>psychosocial</b> work more centrally to broader political and development analysis...|$|R
50|$|The clinician’s {{comprehension}} and set of {{judgments about the}} client situation, the assessment through a theory of each case, predicts the intervention. Hence a good psychosocial assessment leads to a good <b>psychosocial</b> <b>intervention</b> that aims to reduce complaints and improve functioning related to mental disorders and/or social problems (e.g., problems with personal relationships, work, or school) by addressing the different psychological and social factors influencing the individual. For example, a <b>psychosocial</b> <b>intervention</b> for an older adult client with a mental disorder might include psychotherapy and a referral to a psychiatrist while also addressing the caregiver's needs {{in an effort to}} reduce stress for the entire family system as a method of improving the client's quality of life. Treatment for psychosocial disorders in a medical model usually only involve using drugs and talk therapy.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Although {{previous}} research has evaluated the effectiveness of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> for men with prostate cancer, no previous review has investigated the effects of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> on both sexual and relationship functioning. Aim. To review the effectiveness of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> that focus on sexual and/or relationship functioning for men with prostate cancer and their partners. Method. A systematic literature review of research reported in the Medline, PsychINFO, PsychArticles databases from January 1990 to September 10, 2011. Main Outcome Measure. The review focused on the evaluation of interventions that aimed to improve the sexual and/or relationship functioning of men and their partners. Results. There was evidence that <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> can improve men's sexual functioning, particularly when delivered face-to-face and when using more complex strategies to target sexuality in men and in relationships. There was inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>interventions</b> in improving men's relationship functioning or the sexual or relationship functioning of their partners. Conclusions. There {{is a need for}} further research to target improving and measuring men and their partner's sexual and relationship functioning in the context of prostate cancer. The effectiveness of tailoring interventions to the specific needs of men and to their stage of cancer also needs to be further examined...|$|R
