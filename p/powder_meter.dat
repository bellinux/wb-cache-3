The device makes use of vertical open tubes through which the flow rate of dry powder {{is controlled by the}} characteristics of acoustic vibration in the 20 – 200 Hz region. Flow is initiated by high amplitude ‘attack’ waveforms and stops when vibration ceases. This simple but effective device raises many questions about the factors that cause flow arrest. The effects of tube diameter, amplitude, mechanical damping and particle size distribution are investigated.

It is designed to make use of the same commercial powders that are used in powder metallurgy and, therefore, to produce samples that are faithful to the microstructure of finished products. The particle assemblies produced by the device could be consolidated by die pressing, isostatic pressing, laser sintering, or direct melting. The <b>powder</b> <b>metering</b> valve provides both on/off and flow rate control of dry powders in open capillaries using acoustic vibration. The valve is simple and involves no relative movement, avoiding seizure with fine powders. An orchestra of such valves can be arranged on a building platform to prepare multicomponent combinatorial libraries. As with many combinatorial devices, identification and evaluation of sources of mixing error as a function of sample size is mandatory. Such an analysis is presented. <br/...|$|R
2500|$|The {{quantity}} of gunpowder is specified by weight, but almost always measured by volume, especially in larger scale operations. A powder scale {{is needed to}} determine the correct mass thrown by the powder measure, as loads are specified with a precision of 0.10 grain (6.5mg). One grain is 1/7000 of a pound. Competition shooters will generally throw a slightly underweight charge, and use a powder trickler to add few s of powder at a time to the charge to bring it to the exact weight desired for maximum consistency. Special care is needed when charging large capacity cases with fast burning, low volume powders. In this instance, it is possible to put two charges of powder in a case without overflowing the case, which can lead to dangerously high pressures and a significant chance of bursting the chamber of the firearm. Non-magnum revolver cartridges are the easiest to do this with, as they generally have relatively large cases, and tend to perform well with small charges of fast powders. [...] Some <b>powders</b> <b>meter</b> (measure by volume) better than others due to the shape of each granule. [...] When using volume to meter each charge, it is important to regularly check the charge weight on a scale throughout the process.|$|R

40|$|The {{flow rate}} of powder {{in an open}} {{vertical}} capillary subject to transverse acoustic vibration is predicted using an explicit equation by considering the intermittent arrest and stasis of particles subject to acceleration in a field. The analysis rests solely on physical quantities that are easily measured by experiment. The calculation is supported by measured flow rate and by direct observation using high speed photography. Increasing the horizontal component of acceleration of a particle should not influence rate of descent but the overall time of flight is increased both by re-initiation of descent after collision at the wall and by fixed stationary periods on each cycle. Since flow stops when acoustic vibration stops, the vibrating tube is a valve that provides computer-controlled <b>powder</b> flow <b>metering,</b> mixing and dispensing.

40|$|Abstract: Powder {{metallurgy}} is {{a conventional}} technique for making engineering articles from powders. Main {{objective is to}} produce final products with the highest possible uniform density, which depends on the initial loose powder characteristics. Producing, handling, characterizing and compacting materials in loose powder form {{are part of the}} manufacturing processes. Density of loose metallic or ceramic powder is an important parameter for die design. Loose powder density is required for calculating the exact mass of powder to fill the die cavity for producing intended green density of the powder compact. To fulfill this requirement of powder metallurgical processing, a loose <b>powder</b> density <b>meter</b> as per ASTM standards is designed and fabricated for measurement of density. The density of free flowing metallic powders can be determined using Hall flow meter funnel and density cup of 25 cm 3 volume.

40|$|Objectives: This review {{focuses on}} the key {{findings}} and developments in the rapidly expanding research area of pharmaceutical aerosol electrostatics. Key findings: Data from limited in-vivo and computational studies suggest that charges may potentially affect particle deposition in the airways. Charging occurs naturally {{in the absence of}} electric fields through triboelectrification, that is contact or friction for solids and flowing or spraying for liquids. Thus, particles and droplets emitted from pulmonary drug delivery devices (dry <b>powder</b> inhalers, <b>metered</b> dose inhalers with or without spacers, and nebulisers) are inherently charged. Apparatus with various operation principles have been employed in the measurement of pharmaceutical charges. Aerosol charges are dependent on many physicochemical parameters, such as formulation composition, device construction, relative humidity and solid-state properties. In some devices, electrification has been purposefully applied to facilitate powder dispersion and liquid atomisation. Summary: Currently, there are no regulatory requirements on characterising electrostatic properties of inhalation aerosols. As research in this area progresses, the new knowledge gained may become valuable for the development and regulation of inhalation aerosol products. © 2009 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|New {{opportunities}} for solid freeforming (SFF) will emerge when {{not just the}} shape but the spatial arrangement of composition can be rendered from a computer file. This paper describes a method for dispensing programmed mixtures of dry powders. It provides both on/off and flow rate control in open capillaries using acoustic vibration. In a glass capillary attached to an electromagnetic transducer, the wave characteristics of the forced vibration control both flow rate and switching of powder flow. The flow rate of powder can be predicted by an explicit model {{on the basis of}} intermittent arrest and stasis of particles in the gravitational field. Forced vibration can reduce the flow rate by a factor of 0. 1. Since flow stops when acoustic vibration stops, the vibrating tube is a valve that provides computer controlled <b>powder</b> flow <b>metering,</b> mixing and dispensing. The effects of acoustic frequency, amplitude, tube diameter, mechanical damping and particle size distribution have been investigated. The overflow (discharge from the open tube after vibration stops) was brought below 1 mg.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the competitive adsorption behavior of multiple components on sorbents (silica sand with limestone) at different operating conditions (temperature, additives of chloride, operating time). Moreover, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Process (TCLP) analyzed the leaching rates of metals from the spent sorbents. The results show that the adsorption capacities of Pb and Cd are better among those four metals on the sorbents. At 850 degreesC, the adsorption of Pb and Cd can reach the adsorption saturation points. However, the adsorption amounts on the sorbents will increase as the operating temperature increases. X-ray <b>powder</b> diffract <b>meter</b> (XRD) analysis revealed the adsorption components on the sorbents had metal fusion formations. The TCLP tests show that the leaching rate of metals are significantly lower at 600 degreesC, however, as the operating temperature increases (700 degreesC and 850 degreesC), the sorbents became more stable. At the same temperature, increasing the operating time on the incinerator shows a decreasing leaching rate on the sorbent. Adding PVC or NaCl will decrease the adsorption amounts of Pb and Cd, but increase the leaching rates of all metals on the sorbent. Competitive effects were analyzed by comparing single-component adsorption and multiple-component adsorption cases. The result shows that a multiple-component case has a better adsorption capacity than that of a single-component case...|$|R

Patients and methods: This retrospective database study analyzed the direct health care costs and proportion of patients (aged 5 &ndash; 60 years) achieving asthma control over 1 year in two population groups: those starting ICS (initiation population) and those receiving a first increase in ICS dose (step-up population). Asthma control was defined as no unplanned asthma visits, oral corticosteroids, or antibiotics for lower respiratory infection; outcomes were adjusted for confounding variables. Cost-effectiveness of BAI and DPI were compared with MDI. Results: For the initiation population (n = 56, 347), average annual health care costs per person (adjusted results), as compared with MDIs, were &pound; 9 higher (95 % CI: - 1. 65 to 19. 71) for BAIs and &pound; 32 higher (95 % CI: 19. 51 to 43. 66) for DPIs. The probability of BAIs being the dominant strategy (more effective and less costly than MDIs) was 5 % and of BAIs being more effective and more costly than MDIs was 94 %. DPIs were consistently more effective and more costly than MDIs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of &pound; 1711 (95 % CI: 760 to 3, 576) per additional controlled patient per year. For the step-up population (n = 9169), mean total health care costs per person, (adjusted) as compared with MDIs, were &pound; 1 higher (95 % CI: - 27. 28 to 31. 55) for BAIs and &pound; 73 higher (95 % CI: 44. 48 to 103. 29) for DPIs. The probability of BAIs being dominant was 48 % and of BAIs being more effective but more costly than MDIs was 52 %; the probability of DPIs being more effective but more costly than MDIs was 96 %. Conclusion: The real world effectiveness of ICS inhalers may vary, and inhaler device selection for patients with asthma should take into consideration not only initial device cost but also the subsequent health care resource costs.

40|$|Nebulizers {{are widely}} used for the {{inhalation}} of drug solutions {{in a variety of}} respiratory diseases. The efficacy of nebulizer therapy is influenced by a great number of factors, including the design of the device and the characteristics of the drug solution. Incorrect cleaning, maintenance and disinfection procedures may change the nebulizer performance in time, whereas patient factors can influence the lung deposition of the generated aerosol. In this review the technical aspects of nebulization of drug solutions will be discussed. Two main parameters are generally used to evaluate the performance of nebulizers: the droplet size distribution of the aerosol and the drug output rate. The droplet size distribution and the drug output rate are basically determined by the design and user conditions of the nebulizer. A higher gas flow of the compressor in a jet nebulizer or a higher vibration frequency of the piezo electric crystal in an ultrasonic nebulizer, decreases the droplet size. The choice of the type of nebulizer for nebulization of a certain drug solution may initially be based on laboratory evaluation. The major part of the mass or volume distribution should preferably correspond with aerodynamic particle diameters in the range of 1 to 5 micrometer. The intended drug output must be realized within a reasonable nebulization time (less than 30 min). From the drug output only a minor fraction will be deposited in the lung. The relation between in vitro and in vivo deposition is only partly understood and to date it has not been possible to predict drug delivery only from in vitro studies on nebulizers. Therefore, studies in patients should be performed before a drug solution for nebulization can be recommended for clinical practice. The mechanical properties of nebulizers are likely to change during use. An average utilization time of nebulizers is not available. Therefore, the performance of nebulizers should be checked periodically. Patient compliance in nebulizer therapy is relatively low. This is partly due to the fact that, at present, drug solutions for nebulizers cannot be administered efficiently within a short period of time. More efficient systems should be developed. If possible, nebulizers should be substituted to more efficient systems, e. g. dry <b>powder</b> inhalers or <b>metered</b> dose inhalers...|$|R
40|$|Outokumpu Stainless Oy Tornio works {{produces}} {{in close}} future around 1. 7 million tonnes steel slabs annually. As {{all in the}} metallurgical processes the production of stainless steel is producing by-products as slags. The different kinds of processes produce about 300 000 tonnes slags annually, almost the whole amount {{of this has been}} deposited after the metal separation up to recent days. The project to utilize the steel slag started during 2001 with the aim {{to increase the amount of}} recycled by-products and to develop new slag-products. By-products are produced from the different process part as Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF 1, EAF 2), Argon Oxygen Decarburization converters (AOD 1, AOD 2), ladle stations and Chromium Converter (CRC). The chemical composition of slags from a process has a slight variation, but between the different processes the variations in analyses are greater. The chemical composition of the slags is dependent to the characters of the slag, as volume stability by basicity of the material. The aim of this work was to investigate the quality control of chromium containing steel slags during cooling into solid phase. The product should be an aggregate with sufficient hardness and low leaching behaviors. The investigation started when the slag was poured into a slag pot at melting shop, any addition of stabilizers or other chemical components has not been done. The aim was to investigate the dependence of different cooling methods to spinel forming. The physical properties of the product of the tests were tested by Nordic ball mill test (prEN 1097 - 9). The chemical analyses were: total analyses (XRF), and leaching test (Shaking test prEN 12457 - 3). A <b>powder</b> X-ray diffraction <b>meter</b> analyses (XRD) was used to estimate the mineralogy of the samples. The solid aggregate samples were studied with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Simulations with respective chemical analysis of the slags were done by the data program FactSage. The slags, included in this work, were mainly EAF 2 and CRC slags because of less variation in chemical analysis of these slags. These slags contain chromium, a minor part of chromium is not bound in spinels, which is a reason for leaching. During the first tests, which were carried out by water-cooling, no significant decreasing of leaching of chromium was observed. When pouring out the slag as a thin bed the leaching of chromium was lower compared to the massive bed of the same slag part. Lower leaching of chromium from the massive material from the thin bed can be caused by the smaller active surface of material. Reference test with semi-quenched slag were made and they showed low leaching values compared with the slags from normally pouring practices. Semi-quenched slag is porous and cannot be analyzed in SEM and was hence milled as powder and analyzed in XRD. The mineralogy of semi-quenched slag is varying in some degree from the mineralogy of normally poured slag. The semi-quenched slag, pumice, is partly amorphous which can be the reason for lower leaching values of chromium. Granulation tests have been made earlier with all of the three types of slag, but all of these showed higher leaching values than those of pumice. During granulation material may come in contact with air and become oxidized and chromium oxides leach more than other compounds of chromium. The lowest leaching values of slag can be attained by semi-quenching of material but the product is not an aggregate and cannot be used in all of the civil engineering applications. Aggregates can be produced by cooling on the slabs, but the slag bed should be maximum 10 cm thick, so that the gases can flow out before solidification of material.
