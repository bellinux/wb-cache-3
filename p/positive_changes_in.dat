The following week, however, it dropped to number three, with a 62-percent sales decrease—consequently reaching platinum. Cornell admitted to writing his most personal songs ever on this album, influenced by the <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> his life since 2002. He also described the album as more varied than the debut and relying less on heavy guitar riffs.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{a review}} of {{permanent}} supportive housing and case management on health found that interventions using “housing-first models” can improve health outcomes among chronically homeless individuals, many of whom suffer from substance use disorders and severe mental illness. Improvements include <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> self-reported mental health status, substance use, and overall well-being. These models can also help reduce hospital admissions, length of stay in inpatient psychiatric units, and emergency room visits.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1888, Charlotte and Katharine spent time in Bristol, Rhode Island, away from Walter, {{and it was there}} where her {{depression}} began to lift.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Data on quit {{rates among}} {{diabetes}} patients are limited. PURPOSE: To find whether <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> knowledge on smoking-related complications {{is associated with}} increased quit rates among diabetes patients. METHODS: We randomized 224 male diabetes patients into intervention groups 1 and 2. Both groups received a standard diabetic-specific smoking cessation message from a doctor. Intervention group 2 additionally received counseling. We compared the <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> knowledge and the quit rates {{between the two groups}} at 6 months. RESULTS: <b>Positive</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> knowledge in group 2 was two times higher than that in group 1. The odds of quitting among patients who reported a posi-tive <b>change</b> <b>in</b> knowledge was 2. 65 times higher compared to those who reported no <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the knowledge of persons with diabetes about the risks of developing severe complications if they continue smoking lead...|$|R

25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use {{to adjust to the}} changes that occur in your life. The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform {{to the best of their}} ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E
25|$|The University of Essex {{conducted}} a study to evaluate the efficacy of including the Wii in an established falls prevention training program to improve balance, mobility, and educate recovery from the instance of a fall. After a 7-week falls prevention training, {{the results indicated that}} Wii can positively support a standard rehabilitation, although the use of the game alone would not be encouraged. On the other hand, participants found the experience of Wii game as enjoyable, which can support patients engagement to training. A follow up longitudinal study would be needed to conclude if the incidence of falls can be reduced along time. Extending this study, another research conducted by the same University of Essex found that training with Wii can imply on mood and self-esteem. This behavior was observed in women who participated in this last mentioned research for fall prevention. As said by investigators, it would not be appropriate to generalize, however one participant who had the biggest improvement on the functional measures had the largest <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> well-being, which may indicate that the use of the Wii as an adjunct to standard falls prevention training can improve not only functional but also psychological outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Anger treatments' {{success rates}} can be {{difficult}} to estimate because excessive, severe anger is not a recognized disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This manual is used as a reference for mental health professionals. Some research does exist on comparing various treatments for anger, but they also describe methodological difficulties in making accurate comparisons. The most concrete evidence for anger treatment is that multiple techniques have proven to be more successful than a single technique. The relaxation approach had the highest success rate as a standalone treatment. The effectiveness of the CBT-based anger management therapies has been evaluated by a number of meta-analyses. In a 1998 meta-analysis with 50 studies and 1640 individuals, measures of anger and aggression were used to compare the effects of the anger management intervention with no treatment. A significant effect for anger management was found with a 67% chance of improvement for individuals having received the anger management as compared to the individuals without the therapy. In addition, a 2009 meta-analysis compared psychological treatments for anger across 96 studies. After an average of 8 sessions, a significant improvement in anger reduction resulted. Overall, the completion of an anger management program is likely to result in long lasting <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> behavior. Successful interventions can result in not only a reduction of the outward display of aggression, but also a decrease in the internal level of anger.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Griffiths {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{the results of}} further studies designed {{to learn more about}} the optimum psilocybin doses needed for positive life-changing experiences, while minimizing the chance of negative reactions. In a 14-month followup, the researchers found that 94% of the volunteers rated their experiences with the drug as one of the top five most spiritually significant of their lives (44% said it was the single most significant). None of the 90 sessions that took place throughout the study were rated as decreasing well-being or life satisfaction. Moreover, 89% reported <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> their behaviors as a result of the experiences. The conditions of the experimental design included a single drug experience a month, on a couch, in a living-room-like setting, with eye shades and carefully chosen music (classical and world music). As an additional precaution to guide the experience, as with the 2006 study, the 2011 study included a [...] "monitor" [...] or [...] "guide" [...] whom the volunteers supposedly trusted.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, {{he has been able to}} put them in the back of his mind when {{involved}} in case work. His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was always happy as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window-washer, Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> his personality.|$|E
