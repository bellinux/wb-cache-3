40|$|The plane {{problem of}} load {{transfer}} from an elastic interference or clearance fit pin {{to a large}} elastic sheet with a perfectly smooth interface is solved. As the load on the pin is monotonically increased, the pin-hole interface is in partial contact above certain critical load in interference fit and throughout the loading range in clearance fit. Such situations result in mixed boundary-value problems with moving boundaries and the arc of contact varies nonlinearly with applied load. These problems are analyzed by an inverse technique in which the arcs of contact/separation are prescribed and the causative loads are evaluated. A direct method of analysis is adopted using biharmonic polar trigonometric stress functions and a simple collocation method for satisfying the boundary conditions. A unified analytical formulation is achieved for interference and clearance fits. The solutions for the linear problem of <b>push</b> <b>fits</b> are inherent in the unified analysis.

40|$|Photovoltaic modules have no {{moving parts}} and last upwards of 25 years with no {{maintenance}} aside from occasional cleaning. The installation of modules in building facades and other structures has necessitated {{the use of}} <b>push</b> <b>fit</b> connectors to enable quick and easy inter-module DC electrical connection. New applications for photovoltaics such as roof shingles (tiles) place further performance demands on connectors. The day-night variation in temperature within a PV roof for example, creates component expansion. This paper details the behaviour of a tin plated copper photovoltaic connector under small amplitude fretting tests (10 - 100 ?m) using a specially developed accelerated lifetime test rig. The mated connector creates a high force, multiple point contact between {{the male and female}} components by the use of a prestressed spring collar. The study shows that a transition amplitude exists (~ 13 ?m) above which gross slip at the connector interface appears to occur. This causes a gradual linear increase in contact resistance, followed by a sudden change to rapid wearing of the tin plating on both the connector surfaces and spring collar, leading to connector failure. Below the transition amplitude, partial slip at the connector interface is observed which creates a stable, low contact resistance. The paper highlights the need to maintain a partial slip/stick condition within a PV connector for long term contact resistance stability. The implication of this requirement for photovoltaic connector design and application is discussed, considering the benefits of flexible connector housings and lubricants in particular...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, designs were {{developed}} and implemented for separating plasma from a droplet of whole blood in {{an active and}} passive Lab-on-Chip (LOC) device. Nine filters were tested and compared to establish a process of elimination based on the filtration properties and performance. An Asymmetric Polysulfone filter (Vivid Plasma Membrane) was selected over other filters for the highest yield of extracted plasma in both active and passive LOC devices. The plasma filtrates extracted from the VP filter were characterized and evaluated using techniques of quantification, Giemsa Staining, an Enzyme-Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA), and Blood Cell Count. Results were concluded with a passable detection for a specific analyte, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in plasma filtrates from EDTA whole blood. ^ Active designs were fabricated using methods of PDMS soft-lithography; however, contrary to the conventional SU- 8 photo mask, aluminum molds were designed in Solid Works and created via a rapid prototyping machine. Using this approach, the dimensions of LOC components were customized entirely to control fluid flow and volumes. In addition to the customized layered designs for active LOC devices, a <b>push</b> <b>fit</b> frame was developed to integrate a VP filter to the inlet of any LOC device. Similar to active designs, a passive design was developed conceptually as a three-piece rapid proto-type model made of ABS material.

40|$|Recently {{introduced}} plastic swivel connectors (both autoclavable and disposable) {{were examined}} under laboratory conditions for gas leakage. The leak from the autoclavable connectors before autoclaving nearly always exceeded 5 %. Although this leak was diminished after autoclaving, the swivelling property was greatly decreased. The position of maximal leakage {{was found to}} vary with {{the position of the}} connector on the tracheal or tracheostomy tube adaptor. The magnitude of the leaks obtained varied, only the disposable connectors complying with our own criteria. Comparison of the plastic connectors was made with one type of metal swivel connector which was also found to be acceptable for clinical use. Lightweight plastic connectors capable of rotating through 360 ° are available for connecting tracheal or tracheostomy tube adaptors to a catheter mount. Their swivelling property allows repositioning of ventilator tubing without disconnecting the patient and reduces torsion forces and drag on the tracheal or tracheostomy tube. This could diminish the occurrence of uneven pressure areas, ulceration of surrounding tissues and possible displacement of the tube. Because such connectors are so mobile there is a danger of gas leakage. The present study was de-signed to investigate this possibility. Two types of plastic swivel connectors were tested; one was suit-able for sterilization in an autoclave and the other was disposable. The results were compared with those from a metal connector possessing similar properties. DESIGN OF CONNECTORS Autoclavable plastic connector.

40|$|This article answers three questions. To {{what extent}} do Dutch workers voluntarily change {{employers}} or positions within the firm, do objective and subjectively experienced job characteristics influence voluntary mobility, and does voluntary mobility result in changes in these job characteristics? Analyses show that voluntary mobility occurs quite often. Objective job characteristics do not predict the odds of voluntary mobility. The subjective evaluation of aspects of the job, such as for instance the job in general, the income, the job content and colleagues, and workload, however, do. The stronger this mismatch of persons and jobs, the more likely one is to be voluntarily mobile. Panel analyses furthermore show that this voluntary mobility improves objective job characteristics such as income and status, and reduces an unfavourable evaluation of the person–job fit. Clearly, an unfavourably experienced person–job <b>fit</b> <b>pushes</b> workers out of their jobs, and on average this step brings positive returns. ...|$|R
40|$|Accurate, {{reliable}} and economical methods of determining stress distributions {{are important for}} fastener joints. In the past the contact stress problems in these mechanically fastened joints using interference or <b>push</b> or clearance <b>fit</b> pins were solved using both inverse and iterative techniques.

Iterative techniques based on the finite element method of analysis have wider applications, but they have the major drawbacks of being expensive and time-consuming. In this paper an improved finite element technique for iteration is presented to overcome these drawbacks. The improved iterative technique employs a frontal solver for elimination of variables not requiring iteration, by creation of a dummy element. This automatically results in a large reduction in computer time and {{in the size of the}} problem to be handled during iteration. Numerical results are compared with those available in the literature. The method is used to study an eccentrically located pin in a quasi-isotropic laminated plate under uniform tension...|$|R
50|$|The {{conceptual}} {{ideology of}} a Strong black woman identifies {{women of color}} as victims of intersectionality within a patriarchal society {{in which they are}} <b>pushed</b> to <b>fit</b> the standard mold of a traditional strong black woman versus {{what it means to be}} a woman to themselves. Used interchangeably, the” Black Superwomen Syndrome” is the pressure & expectation of a woman of color to manage multiple roles of the mother, worker, homemaker, student and any other roles that usually inclusive to one person or sex. Keep in mind, this is different then a career woman because rather than sacrifice the role that supports her family in order to excel in her career, the superwoman is forced to support both the traditional Suzy homemaker role and a career woman. This mold of being self-reliant & self-contained is damaging in a sense because if you are unable to be self-reliant (i.e. needing extra help with the electric bill) and/or self-contained (i.e. feeling overwhelmed by the extra workload but being proud of being trusted to perform well under pressure) then culturally you aren’t a true strong black woman and you aren’t to be depended on. This arrangement of social paradoxes creates a deadly environment that is damned if you, damned if you don’t stigma for black women across the diaspora. Historical this stigma is what held black families together because of the systemic lack of strong balanced male authority is the same thing that is killing our women. When a woman has no choice to be strong all the time without a chance to breathe, anything that isn’t related to fulfilling all the roles that are needed are suppressed such as sadness or pain because of its deemed weakness.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuum}} {{method of}} analysis is {{presented in this paper}} for the problem of a smooth rigid pin in a finite composite plate subjected to uniaxial loading. The pin could be of interference, <b>push</b> or clearance <b>fit.</b> The plate is idealized to an orthotropic sheet. As the load on the plate is progressively increased, the contact along the pin-hole interface is partial above certain load levels in all three types of fit. In misfit pins (interference or clearance), such situations result in mixed boundary value problems with moving boundaries and in all of them the arc of contact and the stress and displacement fields vary nonlinearly with the applied load. In infinite domains similar problems were analysed earlier by ‘inverse formulation’ and, now, the same approach is selected for finite plates. Finite outer domains introduce analytical complexities in the satisfaction of boundary conditions. These problems are circumvented by adopting a method in which the successive integrals of boundary error functions are equated to zero. Numerical results are presented which bring out the effects of the rectangular geometry and the orthotropic property of the plate. The present solutions are the first step towards the development of special finite elements for fastener joints...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} and long-standing puzzle {{in the history}} of modern physics is the gross inconsistency between theoretical expectations and cosmological observations of the vacuum energy density, by at least 60 orders of magnitude, otherwise known as the cosmological constant problem. A characteristic feature of vacuum energy is that it has a pressure with the same amplitude, but opposite sign to its energy density, while all the precision tests of General Relativity are either in vacuum, or for media with negligible pressure. Therefore, one may wonder whether an anomalous coupling to pressure might be responsible for decoupling vacuum from gravity. We test this possibility {{in the context of the}} Gravitational Aether proposal, using current cosmological observations, which probe the gravity of relativistic pressure in the radiation era. Interestingly, we find that the best fit for anomalous pressure coupling is about half-way between General Relativity (GR), and Gravitational Aether (GA), if we include Planck together with WMAP and BICEP 2 polarization cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. Taken at face value, this data combination excludes both GR and GA at around the 3 -sigma level. However, including higher resolution CMB observations ("highL") or baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) <b>pushes</b> the best <b>fit</b> closer to GR, excluding the Gravitational Aether solution to the cosmological constant problem at the 4 [...] 5 -sigma level. This constraint effectively places a limit on the anomalous coupling to pressure in the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) expansion, ζ_ 4 = 0. 105 ± 0. 049 (+highL CMB), or ζ_ 4 = 0. 066 ± 0. 039 (+BAO). These represent the most precise measurement of this parameter to date, indicating a mild tension with GR (for ΛCDM including tensors, with ζ_ 4 = 0), and also among different data sets.

40|$|We {{report on}} a method, PUSH, for {{triggering}} core-collapse supernova explosions of massive stars in spherical symmetry. We explore basic explosion properties and calibrate PUSH such that the observables of SN 1987 A are reproduced. Our simulations {{are based on the}} general relativistic hydrodynamics code AGILE combined with the detailed neutrino transport scheme IDSA for electron neutrinos and ALS for the muon and tau neutrinos. To trigger explosions in the otherwise non-exploding simulations, we rely on the neutrino-driven mechanism. The PUSH method locally increases the energy deposition in the gain region through energy deposition by the heavy neutrino flavors. Our setup allows us to model the explosion for several seconds after core bounce. We explore the progenitor range 18 - 21 M_. Our studies reveal a distinction between high compactness (HC) and low compactness (LC) progenitor models, where LC models tend to explore earlier, with a lower explosion energy, and with a lower remnant mass. HC models are needed to obtain explosion energies around 1 Bethe, as observed for SN 1987 A. However, all the models with sufficiently high explosion energy overproduce ^ 56 Ni. We conclude that fallback is needed to reproduce the observed nucleosynthesis yields. The nucleosynthesis yields of ^ 57 - 58 Ni depend sensitively on the electron fraction and on the location of the mass cut with respect to the initial shell structure of the progenitor star. We identify a progenitor and a suitable set of <b>PUSH</b> parameters that <b>fit</b> the explosion properties of SN 1987 A when assuming 0. 1 M_ of fallback. We predict a neutron star with a gravitational mass of 1. 50 M_. We find correlations between explosion properties and the compactness of the progenitor model in the explored progenitors. However, a more complete analysis will require the exploration of a larger set of progenitors with PUSH.
