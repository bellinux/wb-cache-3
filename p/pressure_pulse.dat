5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>pulse,</b> respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with an earlier and different invention with the same name, a polygraph, popularly referred to as a lie detector, is an instrument that measures and records several physiological indices such as blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>pulse,</b> respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions, in the belief that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. The polygraph was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson, a medical student at the University of California at Berkeley and a police officer of the Berkeley Police Department in Berkeley, California. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the polygraph was on its 2003 list of the 325 greatest inventions.|$|E

2500|$|The hull {{below the}} waterline, {{along the main}} armour belt, formed the Side Protection System (SPS). It was {{subdivided}} {{into a series of}} longitudinal compartments in a void-liquid-void layout; the outer and inner were filled with air, and the middle compartment with liquid (fuel or water). The outer hull plating in the region of the SPS was thin to reduce potential splinter damage from a torpedo. The outer compartment of the SPS was normally an empty or void space (containing only air) and this allowed the initial explosion from a torpedo to expand while minimizing damage to the ship. The centre compartment was filled with oil or seawater and this spread the <b>pressure</b> <b>pulse</b> over a larger area while the liquid contained any metal splinters that were created from the torpedo explosion. The inboard compartment was another void space and served to contain any liquid leaking from the liquid layer and any remaining <b>pressure</b> <b>pulse</b> from the torpedo explosion. Inboard of the final void space was an armoured bulkhead which varied in thickness from 1.5 in (37mm) over the machinery spaces to 1.75inch (44mm) abreast of the magazines. This bulkhead formed the [...] "holding bulkhead" [...] and it was designed to resist the residual blast effects from the torpedo hit. If this final inner bulkhead was penetrated a further set of subdivided compartments would contain any leaks; inboard of the holding bulkhead the ship was highly subdivided into small compartments containing auxiliary machinery spaces.|$|E

[...] In the 1930s, physicians started to augment inhaled general anesthetics with intravenous general anesthetics. [...] The drugs used in combination offered a better risk profile {{to the person}} under anesthesia and a quicker recovery. [...] A combination of drugs was later shown to result in lower odds of dying in the first 7 days after anesthetic. For instance, propofol (injection) {{might be used to}} start the anesthetic, fentanyl (injection) used to blunt the stress response, midazolam (injection) given to ensure amnesia and sevoflurane (inhaled) during the procedure to maintain the effects. [...] More recently, several intravenous drugs have been developed which, if desired, allow inhaled general anesthetics to be avoided completely.|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on an {{experimental}} investigation of <b>pressure</b> <b>pulses</b> and radiated noise for two alternative designs of a propeller of a high-speed craft. The propellers have been designed {{in the context of}} a research project starting from two different rake distributions (forward rake to increase thrust and efficiency, backward rake to reduce cavitation), using different techniques (traditional lifting line / lifting surface and optimization algorithm coupled with a panel code), leading thus to rather different geometries. Propellers have been tested through cavitation tunnel experiments. The activity represents an interesting case study for this kind of measurement in presence of rather large cavitation extensions. The effects of cavitation on different components of <b>pressure</b> <b>pulses</b> and noise are investigated for the different rake distributions adopted. Results clearly shows the effects of this geometrical characteristic on cavitation and <b>pressure</b> <b>pulses</b> pointing out that, in some cases, propeller hydrodynamic performances may determine <b>pressure</b> <b>pulses</b> intensity more than cavitation extensions.
