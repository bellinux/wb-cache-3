5|$|The {{scene in}} which Terrell kills Jedda, a Regula scientist, by {{vaporizing}} him with a <b>phaser</b> was filmed in two takes. Winfield and the related actors first played out the scene; this footage became the background plate. A blue screen was wheeled onto the set and actor John Vargas, {{the recipient of the}} <b>phaser</b> blast, acted out his response to being hit with the energy weapon. A <b>phaser</b> beam element was placed on top of the background plate, and Vargas' shots were optically dissolved into an airbrushed disintegration effect which matched Vargas' position in every frame.|$|E
5|$|For {{the zero}} gravity sequences, the ILM team matched Visual Concepts Engineering's <b>phaser</b> blasts by hand-painting the effect in Photoshop. ILM also did minor touchup to the scenes as required, adding {{clothing}} tears where the <b>phaser</b> blasts hit {{the actors and}} adding the hazy Klingon atmosphere to the computer-rendered objects. These zero gravity scenes were the most expensive sequences to complete.|$|E
5|$|Elite Force {{includes}} {{an arsenal of}} Star Trek–themed weapons, such as phasers and disruptors. The weapons vary in power, ammunition consumption and effectiveness in given situations. Usually, the player {{is equipped with a}} hand <b>phaser,</b> a low-damage weapon that automatically recharges ammunition, and a <b>phaser</b> compression rifle, a more powerful weapon with an optional sniper mode for long distance kills. Other weapons, acquired as the game progresses, include grenade launchers, stasis weaponry and pulse energy weapons. The player can restock on ammunition by using wall-mounted terminals that dispense weapon energy, or by picking up certain items in the game environment.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern <b>phasers</b> {{are a part}} of {{a digital}} signal processor, often trying to emulate analog <b>phasers.</b> <b>Phasers</b> are mostly found as plugins for sound editing software, {{as a part of a}} {{monolithic}} rackmount sound effect unit, or as [...] "stompbox" [...] guitar effects.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Phasers</b> {{are common}} and {{versatile}} phased array pulsed energy projectile weapons, first {{seen in the}} original Star Trek series and later seen or referenced in almost all subsequent films and television spin-offs. <b>Phasers</b> come {{in a wide range}} of sizes, ranging from small arms to starship-mounted weaponry. There are several specific types of <b>phasers</b> used by the United Federation of Planets' Starfleet.|$|R
50|$|Enemies {{automatically}} {{engage the}} player's ship with <b>phasers.</b> While the player's ship outmatches Krellan starships, several can prove dangerous. Zaldron ships {{may also be}} present, but cloaked. The Zaldron ships must de-cloak before engaging the player, also using <b>phasers</b> as a primary weapon.|$|R
5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the <b>phaser</b> blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his <b>phaser</b> sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
5|$|Kirk follows {{and appeals}} to Dr. Dehner's {{humanity}} for help. Before Mitchell can kill Kirk, the doctor attacks and weakens him. Mitchell fatally injures Dehner, {{but before he}} can recover from the effort, Kirk uses a <b>phaser</b> rifle to create a rock slide, killing Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|Additional optical {{effects were}} {{provided}} by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back. VCE provided effects including <b>phaser</b> beams, the Enterprise reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect. Meyer and the production staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter, as had {{been done in the}} original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, although much of the matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} develop {{reliable}} applications for parallel machines, programming languages and systems need to provide for flexible parallel programming coordination techniques. Barriers, clocks and <b>phasers</b> constitute promising synchronisation mechanisms, but they exhibit intricate semantics and allow writing programs that can easily deadlock. We present an operational semantics and a type system for a fork/join programming model equipped with a flexible variant of <b>phasers.</b> Our proposal allows for a precise control over {{the maximum number of}} synchronisation steps each task can be ahead of others. A type system ensures that programs do not deadlock, even when they use multiple <b>phasers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} SNR {{enhancement}} in impulse radio transceivers based on <b>phasers</b> of opposite chirping slopes is introduced. It is shown that signal to-noise radio (SNR) enhancements by factors M 2 and M are achieved for burst noise and Gaussian noise, respectively, where M is the stretching factor of the <b>phasers.</b> An experimental demonstration is presented, using stripline cascaded C-section <b>phasers,</b> where SNR enhancements {{in agreement with}} theory are obtained. The proposed radio analog signal processing transceiver system is simple, low-cost and frequency scalable, and may therefore be suitable for broadband impulse radio ranging and communication applications...|$|R

5|$|Jarre's 1976 low budget {{solo album}} Oxygène, {{recorded}} {{at his home}} studio, made him internationally famous. It comprises six numbered synthesiser tracks that make strong use of melody, rather than rhythm or dissonance. A Scully eight-track recorder was used to record instruments like the Eminent 310 (with an Electro-Harmonix Small Stone <b>phaser</b> on its string pads) and the Korg Minipops drum machine. Liberal use of echo was used on the various sound effects generated by the VCS3 synthesiser. Jarre's ARP 2600 synthesiser, previously used on his collaborations with Christophe, also featured, as did his EMS VCS 3.|$|E
5|$|The two {{characters}} show different gameplay techniques, with Kirk being the more typical shooter while Spock has stealth techniques and {{can use the}} Vulcan nerve pinch and mind meld. Each character is equipped with weapons to reflect their gameplay style, with Kirk armed with a <b>phaser</b> equipped with a stun setting, while Spock's weapon is quieter to reflect his stealthier style of play and freezes enemies instead. As players progress through the game, they gain experience allowing them to unlock additional settings for those weapons. In addition to the weapons, the player characters are also equipped with tricorders, which are used {{to interact with the}} environment and progress plot points.|$|E
5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it. The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her <b>phaser</b> set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E

40|$|Coordination and {{synchronization}} {{of parallel}} tasks is a ma-jor source of complexity in parallel programming. These constructs {{take many forms}} in practice including mutual exclusion in accesses to shared resources, termination detec-tion of child tasks, collective barrier synchronization, and point-to-point synchronization. In this paper, we introduce <b>phasers,</b> a new coordination construct that unifies collec-tive and point-to-point synchronizations. We establish two safety properties for phasers: deadlock-freedom and phase-ordering. Performance results obtained from a portable im-plementation of <b>phasers</b> on three different SMP platforms demonstrate that <b>phasers</b> can deliver superior performance to existing barrier implementations, {{in addition to the}} pro-ductivity benefits that result from their generality and safety properties...|$|R
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new <b>phaser</b> was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the <b>phaser</b> by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the zero}} gravity scenes were handled by Pacific Data Images, while <b>phaser</b> beams and {{transporter}} effects were generated by Visual Concept Engineering, {{an offshoot of}} ILM that had contributed to The Wrath of Khan and The Final Frontier. Despite the overall count of effects shots being dropped from over 100 to 51, the project was still large, and required virtually the entire ILM staff to complete. Farrar's goal was to economize the remaining effects; if three shots were similar, {{they would try to}} tell the story with only one. Cheap animatics provided Meyer with placeholders to cut into the film and avoid costly surprises. Stock footage from previous films were used whenever possible, but it was often unfeasible to do so; as the original USS Enterprise had been destroyed in , all shots of the USS Enterprise-A had to feature the updated ship registry.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by <b>phaser</b> blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E

50|$|Enemy ships can be {{destroyed}} using two main weapons systems: <b>phasers</b> and photon torpedoes. <b>Phasers</b> are instantaneous beam weapons which cannot be dodged, while torpedoes {{take time to}} travel to the target and thus can be dodged. Other shipboard combat systems include shields, and tractor and pressor beams. When a ship is destroyed, the player chooses a new ship and reappears next to their team's homeworld.|$|R
40|$|Generalized coupled-line all-pass <b>phasers,</b> {{based on}} transversally-cascaded (TC), longitudinally-cascaded (LC) and hybrid-cascaded (HC) coupled {{transmission}} line sections, are presented and demonstrated using analytical, full-wave and experimental results. It is shown that for N commensurate coupled-line sections, LC and TC <b>phasers</b> exhibit N group delay peaks per coupled-line section harmonic frequency band, {{in contrast to}} the TC configuration, which exhibits only one peak within this band. It is also shown that for a given maximum achievable coupling-coefficient, the HC configuration provides the largest group delay swing. A wave-interference analysis is finally applied to the various coupled-line <b>phasers,</b> explaining their unique group delay characteristics based on physical wave-propagation mechanisms.

The Orions escape and travel to the Bridge, as do T'Pol and Tucker. Navaar tells Archer to arrest T'Pol, but Tucker stuns all the male crew-members with his <b>phaser,</b> and T'Pol disables the Orion ship with a pulse sent from Enterprise deflector dish. They send the Orions back to their ship, and T'Pol finally admits she would personally like Tucker to return, and he replies that he has already requested a transfer back to Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Waters' primary {{instrument}} in Pink Floyd was the electric bass guitar. He briefly played a Höfner bass but {{replaced it with}} a Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S, until 1970 when it was stolen {{along with the rest of}} the band's equipment in New Orleans. He began using Fender Precision Basses in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker 4001, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972 when it became his main stage guitar and as of 2 October 2010, the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model. Waters endorses RotoSound Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings. Throughout his career he has used Selmer, WEM, Hiwatt and Ashdown amplifiers but has used Ampeg for the last few tours, also employing delay, tremolo, chorus, stereo panning and <b>phaser</b> effects in his bass playing.|$|E

When the others see a prosthetic protrusion on the back of Riker's neck, he is accepted as one of them and allowed to dine. They reveal that the parasites are seeking to take over Starfleet, using humanoids as hosts. When he is about to put a handful of the larvae in his mouth, Riker suddenly produces a <b>phaser</b> and fires on one of the Admirals. Picard picks up a fallen weapon and the two Enterprise officers subdue the infected, causing parasites to leave the hosts and flee. One of the parasites scurries under a closed door and Picard and Riker follow it. They find Remmick ingesting the parasite to join several others inside him. Picard and Riker fire upon Remmick, destroying his body but freeing a giant parasite; the two continue to fire until it is destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Ocean Software ported {{the game}} to home gaming systems, {{including}} the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Due to the hardware limitations of the various systems, the graphics and sounds of the ports differ from the original arcade version. Some home versions use a light gun peripheral to simulate the control scheme of the arcade format. The Sega Master System port uses the Sega Light <b>Phaser</b> accessory. The Amiga and Atari ST versions {{are one of the}} few games to use the Trojan Light Gun. In developing the Amiga conversion, the team video taped the arcade machine in operation as a reference for the graphics, pausing the video at relevant spots to take notes before recreating them. Programmer Damien Stones spent four months on the ZX Spectrum version. He kept the graphical detail of the backgrounds simple to allow for more action in the foreground. Taking into account the system's lower capabilities compared to the arcade hardware, Stones designed {{the game to}} handle a large number of on-screen sprites. In 2005, Space Gun was included in the compilation title Taito Legends for the PlayStation 2, personal computer and Xbox.|$|E

Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a <b>phaser</b> at her, demanding to know who she is.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 9, 1981, and ended on January 29, 1982. The Wrath of Khan was more action-oriented than its predecessor, but less costly to make. The project was supervised by Paramount's television unit {{rather than its}} theatrical division. Bennett, a respected television veteran, made The Wrath of Khan on a budget of $11million—far less than The Motion Pictures $46million. The budget was initially lower at $8.5 million, but it rose when the producers were impressed by {{the first two weeks}} of footage. Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy, a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger than it really was. To present the illusion that the Enterprises elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed. Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned <b>phaser</b> and communicator, were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture.|$|E
