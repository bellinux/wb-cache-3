5|$|Zoo or {{laboratory}} rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self-harm in higher mammals, e.g., macaque monkeys. Non-primate mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs. For example, <b>pemoline,</b> clonidine, amphetamine, and very high (toxic) doses of caffeine or theophylline {{are known to}} precipitate self-harm in lab animals.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine <b>pemoline</b> (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E

25|$|During 1974, {{a number}} of riders were tested {{positive}} for amphetamines, including Claude Tollet at the Tour. In 1977, a test for amphetamine-like drug <b>Pemoline</b> was perfected, catching five-time Tour de France winner Eddy Merckx among others. Far from abandoning drugs, riders and their helpers concentrated on finding alternatives {{that could not be}} detected. Five-time Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil argued that stopping riders using amphetamine would not stop doping, but merely lead riders to use more dangerous drugs. In the 1970s, cycling moved into the steroid era. According to Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, steroids were not used to build muscle bulk, but rather to improve recovery and thereby let competitors train harder and longer and with less rest. There is also a secondary stimulant effect.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, <b>pemoline</b> (Cylert) was {{approved}} by the U.S. FDA for use in the treatment of ADHD. While an effective agent for managing the symptoms, the development of liver failure in 14 cases over the next 27 years would result in the manufacturer withdrawing this medication from the market. New delivery systems for medications were invented in 1999 that eliminated the need for multiple doses across the day or taking medication at school. These new systems include pellets of medication coated with various time-release substances to permit medications to dissolve hourly across an 8–12 hour period (Metadate CD, Adderall XR, Focalin XR) and an osmotic pump that extrudes a liquid methylphenidate sludge across an 8–12 hour period after ingestion (Concerta).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pemoline</b> is Schedule IV Non-Narcotic (Stimulant) {{controlled}} substance with a DEA ACSCN of 1530 {{and is not}} subject to annual manufacturing quotas. The salts in use are <b>pemoline</b> magnesium (free base conversion ratio [...]751), <b>pemoline</b> iron (.578), <b>pemoline</b> copper (.644), <b>pemoline</b> nickel (.578), <b>pemoline</b> rubidium, <b>pemoline</b> calcium, <b>pemoline</b> chromium, and chelates of the above which are identical in weight to the salt mentioned. <b>Pemoline</b> free base and <b>pemoline</b> cobalt, strontium, silver, barium, lithium, sodium, potassium, zinc, manganese, and caesium are research chemicals which can be produced in situ for experiments. [...] Others such as lanthanide <b>pemoline</b> salts such as <b>pemoline</b> cerium can be prepared; <b>pemoline</b> beryllium would presumably be toxic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pemoline</b> is {{generally}} considered dopaminergic, but its precise method of action hasn't yet been definitively determined. <b>Pemoline</b> passes the blood-brain barrier and acts as a surrogate for dopamine, not affecting endogenous intracellular dopamine. For this reason, {{and the fact that}} it has little or no affinity for adrenaline receptors, <b>pemoline</b> has minimal sympathomimetic side effects such as: dry mouth, reduction in appetite, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, constriction of smooth muscle, cardiac stress, dilated pupils and insomnia. There is some data to suggest that <b>pemoline</b> is a nootropic acting as a catalyst conductor in the synapses of the brain's memory centers, raising the efficiency of memory and assisting RNA formation in the brain. While drugs like dexamphetamine and methylphenidate are classified as Schedule II, <b>pemoline</b> is listed as Schedule IV (non-narcotic). In studies conducted on primates, <b>pemoline</b> fails to demonstrate a potential for self-administration.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pemoline</b> is a {{stimulant}} drug of the 4-oxazolidinone class. It {{was first}} synthesized in 1913 but its activity was not discovered until the 1930s. Under the names Betanamin, Cylert, Tradon, and Ceractiv {{it was used}} as a medication to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it is a Schedule IV drug. It is no longer generally available in the United States {{as a result of the}} FDA withdrawing approval of <b>pemoline</b> as an indicated treatment for ADHD, due to its implication in liver failures among children who were receiving the medication. An FDA Alert warned against prescribing <b>pemoline</b> for ADHD. This spurred Abbott Laboratories, the patent owner of Cylert, to cease manufacturing Cylert. Manufacturers of the generic equivalents followed suit.|$|E

5000|$|Thozalinone (USAN) (brand name Stimsen; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} CL-39808) is a psychostimulant {{that has been}} used as an antidepressant in Europe.

50|$|Drug {{testing of}} racehorse urine {{has led to}} the revelation that among {{levamisole}} equine metabolites are both <b>pemoline</b> and aminorex, stimulants that are forbidden by racing authorities. Further testing confirmed aminorex in human and canine urine, meaning that both humans and dogs also metabolize levamisole into aminorex. The stimulant properties of aminorex contribute to the use of levamisole as a cocaine adulterant, potentiating the reinforcing effects of cocaine.|$|E
