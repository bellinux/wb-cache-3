In April he spoke with an aide of Colorado congresswoman <b>Pat</b> <b>Schroeder,</b> who encouraged him {{to go public with}} his story to build popular support for a bill to overturn the ban on gay service members. Thorne agreed to do so, and completed the process of coming out to family members, including his father and brother. On May 19, 1992, during a presidential campaign in which Democratic candidate Bill Clinton was proposing an end to the military's exclusion of homosexuals, Thorne openly identified as homosexual during an interview with Ted Koppel on the ABC television news program Nightline. Thorne later appeared on NBC's Today Show and CNN's Sonya Live.|$|E
2500|$|The gay {{and lesbian}} rights {{movement}} in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay service members. Sgt. Leonard Matlovich appeared {{on the cover of}} Time in 1975. In 1982 the Department of Defense issued a policy stating that, [...] "Homosexuality is incompatible with military service." [...] It cited the military's need [...] "to maintain discipline, good order, and morale" [...] and [...] "to prevent breaches of security". In 1988, in response to a campaign against lesbians at the Marines' Parris Island Depot, activists launched the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project (MFP) to advocate {{for an end to the}} exclusion of gays and lesbians from the armed forces. In 1989, reports commissioned by the Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), an arm of the Pentagon, were discovered in the process of Joseph Steffan's lawsuit fighting his forced resignation from the U.S. Naval Academy. One report said that [...] "having a same-gender or an opposite-gender orientation is unrelated to job performance in the same way as is being left- or right-handed." [...] Other lawsuits fighting discharges highlighted the service record of service members like Tracey Thorne and Margarethe (Grethe) Cammermeyer. The MFP began lobbying Congress in 1990, and in 1991 Senator Brock Adams (D-Washington) and Rep. Barbara Boxer introduced the Military Freedom Act, legislation to end the ban completely. Adams and Rep. <b>Pat</b> <b>Schroeder</b> (D-Colorado) re-introduced it the next year. In July 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, in the context of the outing of his press aide Pete Williams, dismissed the idea that gays posed a security risk as [...] "a bit of an old chestnut" [...] in testimony before the House Budget Committee. In response to his comment, several major newspapers endorsed ending the ban, including USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, and the Detroit Free Press. In June 1992, the General Accounting Office released a report that members of Congress had requested two years earlier estimating the costs associated with the ban on gays and lesbians in the military at $27 million annually.|$|E

According to Schroeder, Hoagland felt that conflicts of interest could arise if both a husband and wife practiced law in the same city; the firm did not make an offer for either of the Schroeders.|$|E
50|$|McKevitt {{was elected}} as a Republican to the Ninety-second Congress (January 3, 1971 - January 3, 1973). That year, 20-year {{incumbent}} Democrat Byron Rogers had been {{defeated in the}} primary by a considerably more liberal Democrat, attorney Craig Barnes, and the division combined with McKevitt's popularity to produce a Republican pickup. However, McKevitt was a conservative Republican in a strongly Democratic district, and he was defeated for reelection to the Ninety-third Congress in 1972 by liberal Democrat <b>Pat</b> <b>Schroeder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During {{the fall}} of 1987, Rep. <b>Pat</b> <b>Schroeder</b> briefly entered the race, which brought the number of {{candidates}} to eight and led to them being lampooned as [...] "Snow White and the seven dwarfs". [...] In December 1987, Hart surprised many political pundits by resuming his presidential campaign. He again led in the polls for the Democratic nomination, both nationally and in Iowa, However, the allegations of adultery and reports of irregularities in his campaign financing, had delivered a fatal blow to his candidacy, and he did poorly in the primaries before dropping out again.|$|E

[...] Congresswoman <b>Pat</b> <b>Schroeder</b> asked if he would yield the floor, but Cunningham told her, [...] "No, I will not." [...] When then-Congressman Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, attempted to object, Cunningham said, [...] "Sit down, you socialist." [...] He later apologized for his comments. After Cunningham yielded, Schroeder asked if she had [...] "to call the gentleman a gentleman if he's not one." ...|$|E
50|$|Longtime First District Congresswoman <b>Pat</b> <b>Schroeder</b> {{chose not}} to run for a 13th term in 1996, which {{prompted}} DeGette to run. Her principal opponent in the 1996 primary election was former City Council member Tim Sandos, whom Denver Mayor Wellington Webb endorsed shortly before the primary. DeGette won the primary with 55 percent of the vote, all but assuring her of election in the heavily Democratic district (the 1st District has been in Democratic hands for all but six years since 1933). Schroeder, who stayed neutral during the primary, endorsed DeGette once DeGette became the Democratic nominee. DeGette won with 57 percent and has been reelected seven times since.|$|E
50|$|Inside Picture BooksInside Picture Books {{poses the}} {{question}} as to why stories and images shown to us as children linger in our minds. How is it that some children's books survive while others fade? Using her psychological acumen, Spitz reveals how classic children's books transmit wisdom, shape tastes, implant subtle biases, and stimulate moral reflection. She advocates for conversational reading between adults and children and addresses powerful topics such as curiosity, identity and self-acceptance, separation and loss, as well as disobedience. Inside Picture Books has been acclaimed as a classic in the field and praised by such notables as Quentin Blake, Marina Warner, Judith Wallerstein, <b>Pat</b> <b>Schroeder,</b> Maria Tatar, and Pamela Paul.|$|E

5000|$|The {{aftermath}} of the scandal was not without controversy. Many conservatives and retired officers alleged that in ending the careers of over 300 officers, the Clinton administration had gone far beyond punishing wrongdoers and had used the scandal as a pretext for carrying out a purge of the officer corps. Former Navy Secretary Jim Webb, speaking at the Naval Academy said, [...] "When the Tailhook investigation began, and certain political elements used the incident to bring discredit on naval aviation as a whole, {{and then on the}} Navy writ large, one is entitled to ask... Who fought this? Who condemned it? When a whole generation of officers is asked to accept ... the destruction of the careers of some of the finest aviators in the Navy based on hearsay, unsubstantiated allegations, in some cases after a full repudiation of anonymous charges that resemble the worst elements of McCarthyism ... what admiral has had the courage to risk his own career by putting his stars on the table, and defending the integrity of the process and of its people?" [...] Another former Secretary of the Navy, John Lehman, [...] "condemned the Clinton White House for imposing policies of 'political correctness' on the navy and the Senate Armed Services Committee for impeding the career advancements of officers linked to the 1991 Tailhook sexual assault scandal. It is 'terribly damaging to the very fiber of the Navy as an institution, this continuing attack from so many quarters'... Officers were victims of media 'character assassination.' Following {{what should have been a}} minor story, he said, '14 admirals have been cashiered, 300 naval aviators have been driven out of the Navy or their careers terminated.'" [...] Lehman also wrote that [...] "Of course there are many journalists, armchair strategists and think-tankers who applaud the victory of those like Rep. <b>Pat</b> <b>Schroeder</b> who vowed to 'break the culture' after Tailhook '91." [...] Many officers raised the case of decorated Blue Angels commanding officer Bob Stumpf, who was denied promotion and retired simply for having gone to Tailhook '91 to receive an award. Stumpf himself has decried the post-Tailhook climate and its effect on morale and readiness: [...] "The essence of that warrior culture has been severely diluted in this decade. Politically inspired social edicts enforced since Tailhook '91 have rendered a ready room atmosphere so different now that it is nearly unrecognizable... Pilots are hampered in their ability to train as warriors by the policies of their senior leaders. They are faced with social experimentation and double standards in training. Experienced pilots are forced to qualify certain trainees who may or may not demonstrate established quality standards. This leads to distrust and resentment, two powerfully harmful factors in terms of unit morale, and thus military effectiveness." ...|$|E
