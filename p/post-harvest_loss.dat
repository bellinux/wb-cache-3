5000|$|Food waste {{continues}} in the post-harvest stage, but the amounts of <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss</b> involved are relatively unknown and difficult to estimate. Regardless, the variety of {{factors that contribute to}} food waste, both biological/environmental and socio-economical, would limit the usefulness and reliability of general figures. In storage, considerable quantitative losses can be attributed to pests and micro-organisms. This is a particular problem for countries that experience a combination of heat (around 30 Â°C) and ambient humidity (between 70 and 90 per cent), as such conditions encourage the reproduction of insect pests and micro-organisms. Losses in the nutritional value, caloric value and edibility of crops, by extremes of temperature, humidity or the action of micro-organisms, also account for food waste; these [...] "qualitative losses" [...] are more difficult to assess than quantitative ones. Further losses are generated in the handling of food and by shrinkage in weight or volume.|$|E

40|$|The <b>post-harvest</b> <b>losses</b> {{have been}} {{estimated}} {{at different stages}} in two major food grains, viz. rice and wheat in India. The time series data from 1982 - 83 to 2001 - 02 on area, production and productivity of the selected food grains {{have been subjected to}} growth rate analysis. The <b>post-harvest</b> <b>losses</b> have been estimated using the survey data collected from 100 farmers, 20 wholesalers, 20 processors and 20 retailers in each crop in Karnataka for the year 2003 - 04. Tabular analysis has been used to estimate the <b>post-harvest</b> <b>losses</b> at different stages, and functional analysis has been used to assess the influence of socio-economic factors on <b>post-harvest</b> <b>losses</b> at the farm level. The increase in rice production in the study district of Shimoga has been mainly from increased area under rice. The increased rice output at the state level is the result of increased productivity and area, while at the national level it is the rise in productivity. The increased wheat output in the country has been due to increased wheat productivity. The <b>post-harvest</b> <b>losses</b> at the farm level have been estimated to be 3. 82 kg / q for rice and 3. 28 kg/q for wheat. The losses have been highest during storage in both the crops.

5000|$|The {{main cause}} of loss during drying is the {{cracking}} of grain kernels that are eaten whole, such as rice. Some grains may also be lost during the drying process. However, failure to dry crops adequately can lead to much higher levels of loss than poor-quality drying, and may result in the entire harvest becoming inedible. Adequate drying by farmers is essential if grains are to be stored on-farm and poorly dried grains for the market need to be sold quickly to enable the marketing-processing chain to carry out adequate drying before the grains become spoilt. With a high moisture content, grain is susceptible to mould, heating, discoloration {{and a variety of}} chemical changes. Ideally, most grains should be dried to acceptable levels within 2-3 days of harvest. One of the problems in assessing levels of <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss</b> is in separating weight loss caused by the very necessary drying operations from weight loss caused by other, controllable, factors.|$|E

Stratified and multi stage random sampling techniques were used to sample representative Peasant Associations and respondents (n= 296). Both qualitative and quantitative data were gathered through questionnaire, focus group discussions, interview and observations. Data were analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistics. Climate and weather conditions, harvesting and handling techniques, packaging, storage and transportation facility, market situation, dust from cement factory, disease and pest animals were recorded as major causes for <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss.</b> The severe <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss</b> and quality deterioration of horticultural crops mainly occurred during harvesting followed by marketing, transporting and storage. Poor quality equipment and materials usage caused tremendous mechanical, physiological and pathological damages on horticultural crops. To minimize losses, different traditional methods were practiced by the local community. The highest <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss</b> was recorded for tomato (45. 32 %) followed by mango (43. 53 %), whereas the least <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss</b> was recorded for coffee (15. 75 %). <b>Post-harvest</b> <b>loss</b> ranging from 20 % to 50 % was recorded in between marketing and consumption.

The fishery supports a major artisanal fishery in the country, ranking second to the Nile perch in Tanzania.

The overall objective {{of this study was}} to propose cost effective management strategy to reduce dagaa <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss</b> in Tanzania. To meet this objective a cost and benefit analysis was done, to determine whether adopting drying dagaa on racks project will reduce <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss,</b> and hold positive public value in the future. Two categories of analysis were set i. e. private (individual) and public (Government) for a pilot district (500 fishers), the analyses were divided into five parts: 1).

40|$|Based on {{a unique}} {{large-scale}} data set on teff production and marketing, Ethiopiaâs most important cash crop, we study <b>post-harvest</b> <b>losses</b> in rural-urban value chains, specifically between producers and urban retailers in the capital, Addis Ababa. We analyze {{the structure of}} the value chain and rely on self-reported losses by different value chain agents (farmers, wholesale traders, and retailers). We estimate that <b>post-harvest</b> <b>losses</b> in the most prevalent pathway in the rural-urban value chain, amount to between 2. 2 and 3. 3 percent of total harvested quantities. The variation in this figure depends on the storage facilities used and on assumed losses during transport at the farm. These losses are significantly lower than is commonly assumed for staple foods, possibly because of the rather good storage characteristics of teff due to its low moisture content.

Using the data from Ethiopia, {{the objective is to}} disentangle factors that induce or relate to post-harvest losses in cereals. The data of approximately 2500 households and 5500 cereal records were analysed. Cereal <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss</b> was reported by only 10 % of these households. The average self-reported <b>post-harvest</b> <b>loss</b> was 24 %. Rodents and other pests were most frequently reported to cause these losses. Adoption of improved storage methods was limited and most cereals were stored inside the house in bags. Random Forests (RF) was applied to gain insight into factors and conditions favouring post-harvest losses. Application of RF explained 31 % of the variation in post-harvest losses reported by farmers. Three major factors associated with post-harvest losses were the distance of the household dwelling to the nearest market, the distance of the household dwelling to the main road, and average annual rainfall. Losses increased the further households were located from a market or main road, and losses also tended to decrease with higher rainfall. The standardized and nationally representative survey data from Ethiopia used were a good starting point for modelling post-harvest losses but the finally available information appeared to be partial.
