50|$|Counting the Hs and Ls is {{straightforward}} <b>price</b> <b>action</b> trading of pull-backs, relying for further signs of strength or weakness from {{the occurrence of}} all or any <b>price</b> <b>action</b> signals, e.g. the action around the moving average, double tops or bottoms, ii or iii patterns, outside bars, reversal bars, microtrend line breaks, or at its simplest, the size of bull or bear trend bars in amongst the other action. The <b>price</b> <b>action</b> trader picks and chooses which signals to specialise in and how to combine them.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{evidence}} that these explanations are correct even if the <b>price</b> <b>action</b> trader who makes such statements is profitable and appears to be correct. Since the disappearance of most pit-based financial exchanges, the financial markets have become anonymous, buyers do not meet sellers, and so the feasibility of verifying any proposed explanation for the other market participants' actions during the occurrence of a particular <b>price</b> <b>action</b> pattern is tiny. Also, <b>price</b> <b>action</b> analysis can be subject to survivorship bias for failed traders do not gain visibility. Hence, for these reasons, the explanations should only be viewed as subjective rationalisations and may quite possibly be wrong, but at any point in time they offer the only available logical analysis with which the <b>price</b> <b>action</b> trader can work.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his first}} years, <b>Price's</b> <b>actions</b> were staunchly {{supported}} by Governor Denison, but by 1852 he expressed regret at {{the extent to}} which corporal punishment was used. <b>Price</b> justified his <b>actions</b> by pointing out that he was responsible for the worst convicts, those of most dangerous and vicious character, who being [...] "reckless of future consequences", mocked persuasion and advice, and laughed at sentences in irons. As Price did not have sufficient cells for solitary confinement, [...] "what then remains but to have recourse to the scourge?" [...] Having been driven to corporal punishment, he claimed [...] "that it has had a beneficial effect I have no hesitation in asserting".|$|R
50|$|The trader {{observes the}} {{relative}} size, shape, position, growth (when watching the current real-time price) and volume (optionally) {{of the bars}} on an OHLC bar or candlestick chart, starting {{as simple as a}} single bar, most often combined with chart formations found in broader technical analysis such as moving averages, trend lines or trading ranges. The use of <b>price</b> <b>action</b> analysis for financial speculation doesn't exclude the simultaneous use of other techniques of analysis, and on the other hand, a minimalist <b>price</b> <b>action</b> trader can rely completely on the behavioural interpretation of <b>price</b> <b>action</b> to build a trading strategy.|$|E

50|$|This article {{attempts}} to outline most major candlestick bars, patterns, chart formations, behavioural observations and trade setups {{that are used}} in <b>price</b> <b>action</b> trading. It covers the way that they are interpreted by <b>price</b> <b>action</b> traders, whether they signal likely future market direction, and how the trader would place orders correspondingly to profit from that (and where protective exit orders would be placed to minimise losses when wrong). Since <b>price</b> <b>action</b> traders combine bars, patterns, formations, behaviours and setups together with other bars, patterns, formations etc. to create further setups, many of the descriptions here will refer to other descriptions in the article. The layout of descriptions here is linear, but there is no one perfect sequence - they appear here loosely in the sequence: behavioural observations, trends, reversals and trading ranges. This editing approach reflects the nature of <b>price</b> <b>action,</b> sub-optimal as it might appear.|$|E

50|$|At {{its most}} simplistic, it {{attempts}} to describe the human thought processes invoked by experienced, non-disciplinary traders as they observe and trade their markets. <b>Price</b> <b>action</b> is simply how prices change - the action of price. It is readily observed in markets where liquidity and price volatility are highest, but anything that is bought or sold freely in a market will per se demonstrate <b>price</b> <b>action.</b> <b>Price</b> <b>action</b> trading can be included {{under the umbrella of}} technical analysis but is covered here in a separate article because it incorporates the behavioural analysis of market participants as a crowd from evidence displayed in <b>price</b> <b>action</b> - a type of analysis whose academic coverage isn't focused in any one area, rather is widely described and commented on in the literature on trading, speculation, gambling and competition generally. It includes {{a large part of the}} methodology employed by floor traders and tape readers. It can also optionally include analysis of volume and level 2 quotes.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the strongest}} trends start {{in the middle of}} the day after a {{reversal}} or a break-out from a trading range. The pull-backs are weak and offer little chance for <b>price</b> <b>action</b> traders to enter with-trend. <b>Price</b> <b>action</b> traders or in fact any traders can enter the market in what appears to be a run-away rally or sell-off, but <b>price</b> <b>action</b> trading involves waiting for an entry point with reduced risk - pull-backs, or better, pull-backs that turn into failed trend line break-outs. The risk is that the 'run-away' trend doesn't continue, but becomes a blow-off climactic reversal where the last traders to enter in desperation end up in losing positions on the market's reversal. As stated the market often only offers seemingly weak-looking entries during strong phases but <b>price</b> <b>action</b> traders will take these rather than make indiscriminate entries. Without practice and experienceenough to recognise the weaker signals, traders will wait, even if it turns out that they miss a large move.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} approaches to investing. Many strategies can be classified as either fundamental analysis or technical analysis. Fundamental analysis refers to analyzing companies by their financial statements found in SEC filings, business trends, general economic conditions, etc. Technical analysis studies <b>price</b> <b>actions</b> in markets {{through the use of}} charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the Trend following method, used by John W. Henry and Ed Seykota, which uses price patterns and is also rooted in risk control and diversification.|$|R
5000|$|Since many traders place {{protective}} stop orders to exit from positions that go wrong, all the stop orders placed by trapped traders {{will provide the}} orders that boost {{the market in the}} direction that the more patient traders bet on. The phrase [...] "the stops were run" [...] refers to the execution of these stop orders. Since 2009, {{the use of the term}} “trapped traders” has grown in popularity and is now a generic term used by <b>price</b> <b>actions</b> traders and applied in different markets - stocks, futures, forex, commodities, etc. All trapped trader strategies are essentially variations of Brooks pioneering work.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Pricing {{is one of}} the key {{drivers of}} firm profits. Revenue {{management}} (RM) is predicated on variable and responsive <b>pricing</b> <b>actions</b> in an effort to optimally match supply with demand. Historically, the matching of supply and demand via RM has been a process of rejecting lower valued demand or reserving capacity for higher yielding demand in the face of excess demand. More recently, RM has been taking a more active pricing role as supply has exceeded demand. The following is a commentary on the four chapters comprising Part VI, with some extensions and discussion of the future role of integrated pricing and marketing within an RM framework—more succinctly referred to as demand management (Anderson 2 ̆ 6 Carroll, 2007) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} and empirical macroeconomic literature suggests that price rigidity in industrialized countries is substantial and its causes are manifold. This article provides empirical evidence {{on the importance of}} price rigidity in the grocery-retailing sector and on the role of some major determinants of food price rigidity. The analysis is based on a comprehensive weekly dataset of 20 branded foods in German food stores. The statistical analysis shows that food price rigidity is strong in spite of the widespread use of retail sales. Moreover, the importance of psychological pricing in grocery retailing is overwhelming. Econometric results indicate that food prices get more sticky as the number of <b>price</b> <b>actions</b> declines and as psychological pricing becomes more concentrated on a few important price barriers. Firms pricing strategies are crucial for food price rigidity, too. ...|$|R
