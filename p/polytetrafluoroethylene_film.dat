40|$|A {{window for}} a high-sensitivity {{microwave}} receiving system allows microwave radiation {{to pass through}} to a cryogenically cooled microwave feed system in a vacuum chamber, while keeping ambient {{air out of the}} chamber and helping to keep the interior of the chamber cold. The microwave feed system comprises a feed horn and a low-noise amplifier, both of which are required to be cooled to a temperature of 15 K during operation. The window is designed to exhibit very little microwave attenuation in two frequency bands: 8 to 9 GHz and 30 to 40 GHz. The window is 15 cm in diameter. It includes three layers (see figure) : 1) The outer layer is made of a <b>poly(tetrafluoroethylene)</b> <b>film</b> 0. 025 mm thick. This layer serves primarily to reflect and absorb solar ultraviolet radiation to prolong the life of the underlying main window layer, which is made of a polyimide that becomes weakened when exposed to ultraviolet. The poly(tetrafluoroethylene) layer also protects the main window layer against abrasion. Moreover, the inherent hydrophobicity of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) helps to prevent the highly undesirable accumulation of water on the outer surface. 2) The polyimide main window layer is 0. 08 mm thick. This layer provides the vacuum seal for the window. 3) A 20 -mm-thick layer of ethylene/ propylene copolymer foam underlies the main polyimide window layer. This foam layer acts partly as a thermal insulator: it limits radiational heating of the microwave feed horn and, concomitantly, limits radiational cooling of the window. This layer has high compressive strength and provides some mechanical support for the main window layer, reducing the strength required of the main window layer. The ethylene/propylene copolymer foam layer is attached to an aluminum window ring by means of epoxy.

Cyclic voltammetry was utilized to characterize the sensor response over 30 minutes while the overlying tissue was subjected to either triiodothyronine or verapamil, drugs known to upregulate or downregulate, respectively, the metabolic activity of myocardial cells.

40|$|Harnessing random micro-meso scale ambient energy (M 2 SAE), {{which is}} widely {{available}} in human motions, wind driven vibrations, water surface fluctuations, etc., is not only clean and sustainable, but it also enables self-powered sensors and devices to be realized. In my research, I have fabricated a case-encapsulated triboelectric generator (cTENG) based {{on the principles of}} sliding electrification for harvesting M 2 SAE from reciprocating motions. Patterned with multiple sets of grating electrodes and lubricated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticles, cTENG generated an average effective output power of 12. 2 mW over a 140 kΩ external load and a power density of 1. 36 W/m 2 at a sliding speed of 1 m/s. The cTENG can also be triggered by direct-applied forces, as well as, inertia forces to effectively capture ambient energy from vibrations of large amplitudes and low frequencies such as those arising in human motions and water surface fluctuations. Based on the success of the patterned cTENG, I have built a self-powered velocity sensor for either rectified linear or rotary motion by sourcing the energy from the triboelectric generator. Employing alternating Kapton-copper strips arranged in a spiral configuration wrapped on the inner and outer surfaces of two concentric cylinders, voltage assays for linear and rotary motions can be measured without the need for an external power source. The triboelectric generated output signals when integrated with a digital circuit and a microcontroller unit can be directly processed into remarkably stable, macro-scale output signals for measurements of (0. 1 - 0. 6) ms- 1 +_ 0. 5 % for linear velocities and (300 - 700) rpm +_ 0. 9 % for rotary velocities. I have also fabricated a self-powered, thin-film motion direction sensor by harvesting the operational energy from a close-proximity triboelectrification of two surfaces in relative reciprocation. The mover made by coating a thin <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> <b>film</b> with a 2 -column, specially arranged array of copper electrodes and the stator is made by coating the top and bottom surfaces of a thin polyimide film with a 2 -column aligned array of copper electrodes placed in an alternating pattern. As the mover traverses over the stator, the electrodes in the mover actively generate electric signals of ± 5 V to attain a peak power density of ≥ 65 mW/m 2 at speeds of 0. 3 ms- 1. The prototype can be extend for 2 -D motion direction sensing. The highly pliable sensor can be easily bent to spread over curved and uneven surfaces. Finally, I have demonstrated a quasi-static angular positioning sensor based on 4 -channel encoded pattern on the electrification surface. The sensor consists of a rotator designed with 4 -channel coding Cu foil material and a stator including electrodes covered with FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) ﬁlm. Due to coupling effect of triboelectriﬁcation and electrostatic induction, the sensor generates electric output signals in response to mechanical rotating motion of an object mounted with the sensor. The sensor can read and remember the absolute angular position regardless being continuously monitored or segmented monitored. Velocity and acceleration can be calculated as well. Under a rotation speed of 100 rad min- 1, the output voltage of the sensor reaches as high as 60 V. Angular resolution of 22. 5 ° is achieved and can be further improved by increasing the number of channels. Triggered by the output voltage signal, the rotating characteristics of the steering wheel can be real-time monitored and mapped by being mounted to the sensor. My work represents the first successful attempt in harvesting M 2 SAE using a patterned triboelectric generator and then, using the harvested ambient energy to drive a kinematic sensor that is integrated with a commercial digital circuit for a dual-mode speed and direction sensing. I believe my pioneering demonstration of the applied triboelectric technology will have a huge impact in the industrial commercialization of self-powered devices and sensors. Ph. D...|$|E
