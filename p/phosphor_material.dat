40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the development of}} inorganic <b>phosphor</b> <b>materials</b> capable of converting the near UV or blue radiation emitted by a light emitting diode to visible radiation that can be suitably combined to yield white light. These materials are {{at the core of}} the new generation of solid-state lighting devices that are emerging as a crucial clean and energy saving technology. The chapter introduces the problem of white light generation using inorganic phosphors and the structure-property relationships in the broad class of <b>phosphor</b> <b>materials,</b> normally containing lanthanide or transition metal ions as dopants. Radiative and non-radiative relaxation mechanisms are briefly described. Phosphors emitting light of different colors (yellow, blue, green, and red) are described and reviewed, classifying them in different chemical families of the host (silicates, phosphates, aluminates, borates, and non-oxide hosts). This research field has grown rapidly and is still growing, but the discovery of new <b>phosphor</b> <b>materials</b> with optimized properties (in terms of emission efficiency, chemical and thermal stability, color, purity, and cost of fabrication) would still be of the utmost importance...|$|R
50|$|Phosphor {{thermometry}} is {{an optical}} method for surface temperature measurement. The method exploits luminescence emitted by <b>phosphor</b> <b>material.</b> Phosphors are fine white or pastel-colored inorganic powders {{which may be}} stimulated by any {{of a variety of}} means to luminesce, i.e. emit light. Certain characteristics of the emitted light change with temperature, including brightness, color, and afterglow duration. The latter is most commonly used for temperature measurement.|$|E
50|$|Tritium lumination {{is the use}} of gaseous tritium, a {{radioactive}} isotope of hydrogen, to create visible light. Tritium emits electrons through beta decay and, when they interact with a <b>phosphor</b> <b>material,</b> fluorescent light is created, a process called radioluminescence. As tritium illumination requires no electrical energy, it found wide use in applications such as emergency exit signs and illumination of wristwatches. More recently, many applications using radioactive materials have been replaced with photoluminescent materials.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two primary}} ways of {{producing}} white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs), LEDs that generate high-intensity white light. One {{is to use}} individual LEDs that emit three primary colors—red, green, and blue—and then mix all the colors to form white light. The other {{is to use a}} <b>phosphor</b> <b>material</b> to convert monochromatic light from a blue or UV LED to broad-spectrum white light, much in the same way a fluorescent light bulb works. It {{is important to note that}} the 'whiteness' of the light produced is essentially engineered to suit the human eye, and depending on the situation it may not always be appropriate to think of it as white light.|$|E

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} had two main aims. The first aim was to study {{the use of a}} number of {{precipitation}} methods to control the size and morphology of precursor <b>phosphor</b> <b>materials</b> for potential applications in a new generation of high definition and field emission displays. The morphological and luminescent characteristics of these precursor <b>phosphor</b> <b>materials</b> were studied after they were annealed to form their respective luminescent oxides using electron microscopy and light measuring techniques. The first set of experiments presented describes the development of a range of spherical submicron europium-doped yttrium oxide phosphor particles and their optimisation for use in the aforementioned applications. A homogeneous precipitation technique exploiting a hydrothermal decomposition of urea that provides hydroxycarbonate phosphor precursor ligands is at the centre of this work. In the presence of rare earth element nitrates the hydroxycarbonate ligands form spherical phosphor precursor particles that after annealing yield the luminescent oxides. This is followed by the presentation of a novel synthetic method using a micellar phase of rare earth element chlorides, after annealing, yielding europium-doped yttrium oxide. This method produces a variety of morphologies with crystallites as small as a few nanometres and up to hundreds of nanometres. Next is described a new precipitation method using ammonia and carbon dioxide gases that are introduced in a controlled manner into a solution of rare earth element chlorides at room temperature. Rare earth element hydroxycarbonates rapidly precipitate upon supersaturation, yielding a range of morphologies and particles sizes.

50|$|Phosphor plate {{radiography}} is {{a method}} of recording X-rays using photostimulated luminescence (PSL), pioneered by Fuji in the 1980s. A photostimulable phosphor plate (PSP) is used {{in place of the}} photographic plate. After the plate is X-rayed, excited electrons in the <b>phosphor</b> <b>material</b> remain 'trapped' in 'colour centres' in the crystal lattice until stimulated by a laser beam passed over the plate surface. The light given off during laser stimulation is collected by a photomultiplier tube, and the resulting signal is converted into a digital image by computer technology. The PSP plate can be reused, and existing X-ray equipment requires no modification to use them. The technique may also be known as computed radiography (CR).|$|E

5000|$|On photostimulable {{phosphor}} (PSP) plates, the phosphor {{layer is}} typically 0.1 to 0.3 mm thick. After the initial exposure by short-wavelength (typically, X-ray) electromagnetic radiation, excited electrons in the <b>phosphor</b> <b>material</b> remain 'trapped' in 'colour centres' ("F-centers") in the crystal lattice until {{stimulated by the}} second illumination. For example, Fuji's photostimulable phosphor is deposited on a flexible polyester film support with grain size about 5 micrometers, and is described as [...] "barium fluorobromide containing a trace amount of bivalent europium as a luminescence center". Europium is a divalent cation that replaces barium to create a solid solution. When Eu2+ ions are struck by ionizing radiation, they lose an additional electron to become Eu3+ ions. These electrons enter the conduction band of the crystal and become trapped in the bromine ion empty lattice of the crystal, resulting in a metastable state that is higher in energy than the original condition.|$|E

50|$|To {{illuminate}} {{a particular}} cell, the electrodes that intersect at the cell are charged by control circuitry and electric current {{flows through the}} cell, stimulating the gas (typically xenon and neon) atoms inside the cell. These ionized gas atoms, or plasmas, then release ultraviolet photons that interact with a <b>phosphor</b> <b>material</b> on the inside wall of the cell. The phosphor atoms are stimulated and electrons jump to higher energy levels. When these electrons return to their natural state, energy is released {{in the form of}} visible light. Every pixel on the display is made up of three subpixel cells. One subpixel cell is coated with red phosphor, another is coated with green phosphor, and the third cell is coated with blue phosphor. Light emitted from the subpixel cells is blended together to create an overall color for the pixel.

The PXRD and SEM results reveals cubic fluorite phase with flaky structure. The crystallite size obtained from TEM {{was found to be}} similar to 20 - 25 nm, which was comparable to W-H plots and Scherrer's method. Photoluminescence (PL) emission of all the Eu 3 + doped samples shows characteristic bands arising from the transitions of D- 5 (0) -> F- 5 (J) (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) manifolds under excitation at 373 and 467 nm excitation. The D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (2) (613 nm) transition often dominate the emission spectra, indicating that the Eu 3 + cations occupy a site without inversion center. The highest PL intensity was recorded for 9 mol% Eu 3 + ions with 5 ml latex. PL quenching was observed upon further increase in Eu 3 + concentration. The international commission on illumination (CIE) chromaticity co-ordinates were calculated from emission spectra, the values (x, y) were very close to national television system committee (NTSC) standard values of pure red emission. The results demonstrate that the synthesized <b>phosphor</b> <b>material</b> could be very useful for display applications.
