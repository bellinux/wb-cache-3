40|$|There is {{a general}} demand {{in the market for}} BlowOut Preventers (BOP), which are capable of cutting tougher {{materials}} and cutting them faster than what is available today. This will give better safety and a more efficient use of the equipment. Better cutting capabilities are directly related to the pressures available to the cutting actuator. Normal accumulators loose pressure while it is drained. To avoid this a gas tank with high pressure nitrogen is proposed to boost the pressures during the cutting operation. A boost tank will however contain pressures which are much higher then the allowed pressure in the BOP circuit. It is therefore necessary with a governor which controls the <b>pressure.</b> Normal <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>valves</b> tend to have difficulties maintaining a constant pressure while the pressure in the boost tank drops. Therefore is a PI-governor proposed, which may increase the stability and reliability of the BOP.

The results are promising and the solution shows a more stable pressure than both the old accumulator solution and normal <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>valves.</b> There are however a few flaws with the design. First; may even very small leakages and changes in material properties severely reduce and/or destroy the efficiency of the governor. Small leakages may quickly increase the system pressures and empty the boost tank. Another problem is the overlap in normal proportional directional valves. This severely reduces the efficiency of the integrator in the governor. A mechanism for refilling the boost tank using a high pressure supply line from the rig is found to work quite well in simulations.

40|$|As amethod to {{mitigate}} greenhouse gas emissions, electric vehicles (EVs) {{are regarded as}} an alternative to conventional cars. TheHVAC system is the most energy-consuming auxiliary systems in EVs. The HVAC system is made up of three functions, heating, cooling, and dehumidification, providing a comfortable driving environment. To be more specific, the AC system aims for cooling and dehumidifying the airflow to the passenger compartment. The heating system takes care of the heating demand in car by circulating hot coolant. In winter time, the cold outside air is heated up to high supply temperature, which consumes large amounts of energy and accelerates batteries depleting. Cabin air can be recirculated to increase the driving range, but the high moisture in it is the main issue. Therefore, alternative dehumidification methods having good performance at lower ambient temperatures are required. Meanwhile, energy consumption in AC system should also be as small as possible to extend driving range. For fully recirculating cabin air, an alternative dehumidification should have a capability of removing the moisture from human respiration and other internal moisture loads. In literature review, several methods of dehumidification have been introduced based on their mechanisms and characteristics. Due to the high requirements of compact and compatibility of automotive HVAC system, the scope of study narrows down to two technologies, AC system with head <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>valve</b> and desiccant wheel system. The AC system can usually be operated above 0 Â±C. With a head <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>valve</b> implemented, the modified AC system can also work in winter time as a dehumidifier. When the ambient temperature goes down to - 20 Â±C, the new system can reduce heating power by 34. 5 %. The additional cooling power depends on the different level of moisture load. High moisture load can increase the energy consumption in the AC system. Recirculated air can mix with cold outside air with variable recirculation ratio, to cut down energy consumption further. A desiccant wheel gives better performance in term of reducing energy consumption than mechanical dehumidification. The heating power is reduced by 50 % after implementing a desiccant wheel, when the ambient temperature is - 20 Â±C. Instead ofmechanical dehumidification gaining benefit only under an extreme cold weather, a desiccant wheel reduces power consumption in HVAC system on a wider scale...|$|E

Since these two are totally independent dynamical systems with their own time contrants, proper matching of the two is necessary for efficient handling and operation of the complete wind tunnel. Mach number in the VMFN is controlled by a single hydraulic jack, which outputs a voltage proportional to its displacement (Temposonic sensor).

Modeling of systems containing combinations of pressure reducing valves (PRVs), pressure sustaining valves (PSVs) and flow control valves (FCVs) {{can sometimes be}} problematical. The status of PRVs, PSVs and FCVs is usually solved for based on a heuristic approach. Starting from an assumed state of the control device, a check is performed during the next step of the iteration procedure, {{as to whether the}} original assumption of each particular assumed valve status still holds. If the assumption proves to be no longer true, a correction {{of the state of the}} control device is made. It has been observed in the past that this approach may sometimes fail to converge at all, or even worse may converge to incorrect solutions when simulating networks that include <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> devices. In the majority of cases for which no correct solution was obtained, the solver converged quickly to an incorrect solution. Hence, no warning message was generated to indicate there was a problem with the solution. Some simple networks incorporating PRVs and FCVs have been considered in this research. The networks have multiple <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> and flow regulating devices that are placed in series and separated by substantial lengths of pipe. Even for simple networks comprising two <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> devices (one <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> device and one flow regulating device) in series, current hydraulic modeling software fails to converge to the correct solution for particular configurations and settings. This paper aims to consider the circumstances in which such difficulties occur and the reasons for the failure to solve. In 2002, Deuerlein in his PhD thesis proposed a new method to ensure that the correct solution for water distribution systems containing multiple <b>pressure</b> and flow <b>regulating</b> <b>valves</b> is obtained. He used Nash equilibrium. The application of this approach enables all simple networks (as described above) to be correctly solved that previously could not be solved or those that converged to the wrong solution in EPANET. Details of the Nash equilibrium algorithm and the specific application to some example networks that converged to the wrong solution in EPANET are presented in this paper.

Pressure control ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) of 20 or 25 cm H(2) O was applied and air leakage was assessed spirometrically as the ratio of expiratory to inspiratory tidal volumes. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare the air leakage with and without Lanz system for both cuff types at each cuff pressure and PIP (P <. 05). Results: The PVC tube cuffs with Lanz system resulted in significant air leakage at both 20 and 25 cm H(2) O PIP as compared to those without the Lanz system, especially at cuff pressures lower than the preset PIP (P <. 05). Although PU tube cuffs with Lanz system showed reduced air sealing when compared with cuffs without Lanz, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Cuff pressure compensation with the Lanz system during cyclic respiratory pressure changes interferes with the self-sealing mechanism in HVLP tube cuffs at cuff pressures lower than PIP level.

40|$|Hydraulic {{simulation}} of water distribution systems using computer software {{appears to have}} reached a very mature level of practice. There {{does not appear to}} be many other improvements that can be made to the basic underlying solution algorithms. While this statement is mostly true, there still remains one area that results in problems when developing simulation models. In discussions with water distribution modeling practitioners, the most commonly mentioned remaining problem is stability of computers programs in the presence of pressure regulating devices. The three most common pressure regulating devices are pressure reducing valves, flow control valves and pressure sustaining valves. The difficulty in computer codes is that the status of the device is not known a priori. Consider a pressure reducing valve (PRV) â€” it may have one of three states. For the first state, the valve operates normally - such that the valve is in a partially closed or throttling position to maintain the set pressure on the downstream side of the valve. The second state occurs when the pressure downstream of the valve cannot be maintained and drops below the set pressure. In this case the valve moves to a fully open position. For the third state, the PRV acts as check valve. If there is more than one <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>valve</b> in a water distribution system then each device may be in one of three states. In computer codes, a guess is made to the status of each of the pressure regulating devices and the system is solved for to determine the flows and pressures. A check is then made to determine if the guesses of status are consistent with the results. If the assumed status of the device is inconsistent with the results the status is altered and the hydraulic solver is re-run. This paper demonstrates with a simple example that has a combination of a pressure reducing valve and a flow control valve that many commonly available commercial programs and Government programs cannot properly model even the simplest of systems.

40|$|Cycle life {{tests have}} been carried out to {{evaluate}} the influence of safety <b>valve</b> <b>pressure</b> on <b>valve</b> <b>regulated</b> lead/ acid batteries under deep cycling applications. Batteries were cycled at 5 hour rates at 100 % DOD, and safety valve pressure was set to 1. 08 and 2. 00 bar, respectively. The batteries lost 248. 3 g and 235. 3 g of water for each case after about 1, 200 cycles, but the cyclic performances of the batteries were comparable. Most of the gas of the battery during discharging was hydrogen, and the oxygen concentration increased to 18 % after 3 hours of charging. The micro structure of the positive active materials was completely changed and the corrosion layer of the positive grid was less than 50 Âµm, regardless of the pressure of the safety valve after cycle life tests. The cause of discharge capacity decrease was found to be water loss and the shedding of the positive active materials. The pressure of safety valve does not give little effect to the cyclic performances and the failure modes of the gelled electrolyte valve-regulated lead acid batteries...|$|R
