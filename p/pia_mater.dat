40|$|International audienceThe brain, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the circumventricular organs (CVOs), is partially protected from the invasion of blood-borne chemicals by the tight junctions that link adjacent cerebral endothelial cells and form the structural basis of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In addition to the BBB, the epithelial layer of the choroid plexuses and the barrier layer of the arachnoid membrane complex comprise a second system for protecting the brain, a system often referred to as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. In the past several years, several enzymes that are involved in hepatic drug metabolism have been found in the small microvessels from brain, the choroid plexuses, and the leptomeninges (<b>pia</b> plus arachnoid <b>mater)</b> as well as in some CVOs. These drug-metabolizing systems are inducible and may act at these various interfaces as ‘enzymatic barriers' to influx. In particular, the activities of these enzymes in choroidal tissue are so high that the choroid plexuses can well be the major site of drug metabolism in the brain. The fate of intracerebrally formed polar metabolites and the potential of the blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers as sites for metabolic activation-induced neurotoxicity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{propensity}} of {{canine distemper virus}} (CDV) to spread to {{the central nervous system}} is one of the primary features of distemper. Therefore, we developed a reverse genetics system based on the neurovirulent Snyder Hill (SH) strain of CDV (CDVSH) and show that this virus rapidly circumvents the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers to spread into the subarachnoid space to induce dramatic viral meningoencephalitis. The use of recombinant CDVSH(rCDVSH) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or red fluorescent protein (dTomato) facilitated the sensitive pathological assessment of routes of virus spread in vivo. Infection of ferrets with these viruses led to the full spectrum of clinical signs typically associated with distemper in dogs during a rapid, fatal disease course of approximately 2 weeks. Comparison with the ferret-adapted CDV 5804 Pand the prototypic wild-type CDVR 252 showed that hematogenous infection of the choroid plexus is not a significant route of virus spread into the CSF. Instead, viral spread into the subarachnoid space in rCDVSH-infected animals was triggered by infection of vascular endothelial cells and the hematogenous spread of virus-infected leukocytes from meningeal blood vessels into the subarachnoid space. This resulted in widespread infection of cells of the <b>pia</b> and arachnoid <b>mater</b> of the leptomeninges over large areas of the cerebral hemispheres. The ability to sensitively assess the in vivo spread of a neurovirulent strain of CDV provides a novel model system to study the mechanisms of virus spread into the CSF and the pathogenesis of acute viral meningitis...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Retinoids play an {{important}} role in tissue patterning during development as well as in epithelial formation and health. In the mammalian central nervous system, the meninges are a source of retinoids for brain tissue. Retinoid production has been described in juvenile Axolotl ependymal cells. Retinoid effects may possess a significant role in the regeneration-permissive interaction of the meninges and ependyma of the Axolotl spinal cord after penetrating injury. During spinal cord regeneration in urodele amphibians, the pattern of retinoid production changes as the meninges interact with the injury-reactive ependymal cells reconstructing the injured spinal cord. In order to determine which components of the retinoid metabolism and intracellular signaling pathway act in Urodele spinal cord regeneration, we employed antibody/horseradish peroxidase staining of both intact and regenerating Axolotl spinal cord tissues obtained from adult animals as well as cell culture techniques to determine expression of three retinoid pathway components: Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein II (CRABP 2), Cellular Retinol Binding Protein I (CRBP 1), and Retinaldehyde Dehydrogenase II (RALDH 2). Current results demonstrate the following in the intact cord: 1) CRBP 1 is expressed in the <b>pia</b> and dura <b>mater</b> meningeal layers, in gray matter neurons (including their axonal processes), and the ependymal cell radial processes that produce the glia limitans, 2) CRABP 2 is expressed in the arachnoid and/or dura mater meningeal layers surrounding the spinal cord, and 3) RALDH 2 is expressed in the meninges as well as cytoplasm of grey matter neurons and some ependymal/sub-ependymal cells. In the regenerating cord, CRBP 1 is expressed in ependymal cells that are undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as is CRABP 2. RALDH 2 staining is very strong in the reactive meninges; in addition, expression is also upregulated in the cytoplasmic and perinuclear regions of reactive grey matter neurons, including motor neurons and in the apical region of ependymal. Preliminary studies culturing reactive meninges and ependymal cells together suggested that the meninges could drive re-epithelialization of the reactive ependymal cells. Experiments to characterize this interaction show an unusual proliferation pattern: Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) labeling is present in intact and regenerating cord ependymal cells. However, in culture, the presence of meninges results in no proliferation proximal to the explant, but extensive proliferation in leading cell outgrowth; also, the cultured meninges is positive for RALDH 2. In summary, the intact adult cord shows meningeal production of RA, which is upregulated following injury; in addition, during this time, RA production is upregulated in the adult ependymal cells as well. In culture, the reactive meninges appears to modulate the behavior of reactive ependymal cells...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Noel Derecki & Jonathan Kipnis ### Abstract Presented is {{a method}} for removal of {{meninges}} from the brain and interior skull of the mouse yielding tissue suitable for preparing a single-cell suspension amenable to downstream applications such as flow cytometric analysis or short-term cell culture. ### Materials 1. Nembutal (or similar, as approved by your governing body) - Perfusion apparatus suitable for transcardial mouse perfusion - Perfusion Buffer (0. 1 M PBS/ 5 u/ml sodium heparin) - FACS Buffer (0. 1 M PBS (pH 7. 4) / 2 mM EDTA/ 1 % BSA) ### Equipment 1. Ice bucket - Ice - Dumont # 5 Forceps - Dumont # 7 Forceps - Angled Dissector Scissors - 10 mm Petri dish - Dissecting microscope - 50 ml Falcon tubes - 70 um nylon cell strainer - Centrifuge ### Procedure 1. Mouse preparation - a. Anesthetize mouse with lethal dose of appropriate pharmacological agent (e. g. Nembutal) to render amenable to surgical manipulation. - b. Perfuse transcardially with ice-cold Perfusion Buffer until mouse is exsanguinated. - Skull preparation and brain removal - a. Using large scissors, sever mouse head just above shoulders. - b. Using angled dissection scissors, beginning at caudal aspect, carefully detatch skin and flesh from skull, working rostrally until all skin is removed. - c. Sever eyes at the optic nerve and remove. - d. Turn head over so that ventral aspect of the jaw is facing up. Slide angled dissection scissors through the oral cavity until you feel {{the resistance of the}} mandibular junction. Sever the large muscles connecting the lower jaw to the skull; remove. - e. Using angled dissection scissors, remove the lower orbits {{on each side of the}} skull (the squamosae, zygomatic and maxillae). - f. Working quickly, use scissors to all clean flesh from all aspects of skull. - g. With large scissors, remove the nasal bone with a coronal cut along the suture that defines its most caudal point, thus preserving the olfactory lobes. - h. With the tips of the angled dissection scissors, carefully cut shallowly around the skull, being careful to leave the brain within undamaged. Begin and end superior to the external acoustic meatus (the “earholes”). - i. Remove the lower portion of the skull; discard. Scoop the brain out of the upper half of the skull, and place both brain and skull-cap in a 50 mL falcon tube with 10 mL ice-cold FACS buffer (or suitable cell culture medium, e. g. DMEM- 10, RPMI 1640). - Removal of meninges - a. Place brain and skull-cap, with medium, in petri dish under a dissecting microscope. With a scalpel, separate brainstem/cerebellum from cerebrum. - b. Hemisect the cerebrum with scalpel along the longitudinal fissure. Working from medial to lateral, peel meninges (<b>pia</b> and arachnoid <b>mater)</b> from the surface of the brain. - Pay special attention to the ventral aspect of the brain, as it is a rich source of meningeal tissue. Choroid plexus epithelium and associated leukocytes also lie within the lateral and third ventricles, and can be removed easily if so desired. When the cerebral hemispheres are fully stripped of meninges and choroid plexus, remove from the petri dish, leaving dissected material in the medium. - c. Separate the cerebellum from the brainstem; the space between houses the fourth ventricle, another source of meningeal tissue. The ventral aspect of the brainstem can generally be peeled off in a single section. The dorsal cerebellar meninges must be removed piecewise, as with the cerebral meninges. When the cerebellum and brainstem are fully stripped of meninges and choroid plexus, remove from the petri dish, leaving dissected material in the medium. - d. Beginning at the rostral-most interior point of the skull-cap, carefully score meninges with the tip of a Dumont # 5 forceps, moving along the edge of the interior of the skull-cap until meninges (dura and arachnoid mater) are scored 360 º. If meninges have been completely scored, they can then be peeled whole from the inside of the skull. Remove skull from media and discard - Single cell suspension - a. Place a nylon cell screen (70 μm) atop a 50 mL Falcon tube in ice. Pipette dissected tissue and media directly onto screen. With the wide tip a plastic plunger (from a 1 ml syringe), gently but firmly press meningeal tissue with a circular motion (~ 40 x) through the screen. Connective tissue will not pass through the screen well and will remain; lymphocytes, any glial cells or neurons, and debris will pass through. Do not mash too quickly or heat will be generated by friction of the plunger against the screen. With a clean pipette, pass 20 mL additional media through the screen while continuing to mash with plunger; this will dislodge any cells caught in the screen. - b. Centrifuge at 300 RCF for 10 m at 4 ºC. Decant supernatant and resuspend in desired medium for downstream applications. Triturate gently to break up pellet. Yield should be ~ 5 X 105 viable nucleated cells including T lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and granulocytes per meninges, with ~ 10 % purity for leukocytes (CD 45 -high cells). Non-leukocytes can be easily gated out in FACS by scatter properties and/or negativity for CD 45 -high labeling and a viability dye; further purity for cell culture can be achieved by benchtop (e. g. magnetic columns) or flow cytometric sorting or by ficoll paque gradient. However, we routinely label crude preparations with excellent success–CD 45 and live/dead labeling is sufficient to gate out unwanted debris and ensures that as few cells are lost between dissection and analysis as possible. ### Timing - Perfusion: 3 - 5 minutes - Skull-cap and brain removal: 5 minutes - Meninges removal: 10 - 15 minutes ### Troubleshooting Be careful to thoroughly exsanguinate mouse prior to dissection. If this is not done, peripheral immune cells will contaminate the preparation. ### References This protocol has been used in the following primary research papers: 1.

The following fact, for which I am also indebted to Prof. Turner, shews how closely the os coccyx corresponds with the true tail in the lower animals: Luschka has recently discovered at the extremity of the coccygeal bones a very peculiar convoluted body, which is continuous with the middle sacral artery; and this discovery led Krause and Meyer to examine the tail of a monkey (Macacus) and of a cat, in both of which they found, though not at the extremity, a similarly convoluted body.|$|E

Both the pia and arachnoid mater are derivatives of the neural crest while the dura is derived from embryonic mesoderm. <b>Pia</b> <b>mater</b> is a thin fibrous tissue that is impermeable to fluid. This allows the <b>pia</b> <b>mater</b> to enclose cerebrospinal fluid. By containing this fluid the <b>pia</b> <b>mater</b> works with the other meningeal layers to protect and cushion the brain. The <b>pia</b> <b>mater</b> allows blood vessels to pass through and nourish the brain.

50|$|<b>Pia</b> <b>mater</b> {{allows for}} the {{formation}} of perivascular spaces that help serve as the brain’s lymphatic system. Blood vessels that penetrate the brain first pass across the surface and then go inwards toward the brain. This direction of flow leads to a layer of the <b>pia</b> <b>mater</b> being carried inwards and loosely adhering to the vessels, leading to the production of a space, namely a perivascular space, between the <b>pia</b> <b>mater</b> and each blood vessel. This is critical because the brain lacks a true lymphatic system. In the remainder of the body, small amounts of protein are able to leak from the parenchymal capillaries through the lymphatic system. In the brain, this ends up in the interstitial space. The protein portions are able to leave through the very permeable <b>pia</b> <b>mater</b> and enter the subarachnoid space in order to flow in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), eventually ending up in the cerebral veins.
