5|$|After Hitler and the NSDAP came {{to power}} on 30 January 1933, the SS were {{considered}} a state organization and {{a branch of the}} government. Law enforcement gradually became the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> the SS, and many SS organizations became de facto government agencies.|$|E
5|$|After Singapore gained {{independence}} in 1965, the school {{came under the}} <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> the Ministry of Education and was accorded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) status in 1979. Later, in 1988 the school achieved the status of an independent school, under a scheme that the ministry perceived as proven successful and which was extended to other top schools in Singapore. On 19 March 1999, the school's clock tower was gazetted as a national monument.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sport of}} curling was {{introduced}} to the Boston area in the 1800s, and the first indoor curling club in the United States was opened in Boston, MA in 1881. The Boston area was home to the first ever curling game held on purpose built artificial ice, in the Boston Arena, on January 18, 1911 [...] A large number of curling clubs formed in the late 1800s and early 1900s, either curling on outdoor ice, or indoors within the <b>purviews</b> <b>of</b> a Country Club or other sporting organization. Some clubs did not have their own ice, but instead rented access from others.|$|R
5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a complex}} {{judicial}} organisation, {{as a consequence}} of its status of county capital. The Cluj-Napoca Court of Justice is the local judicial institution and is under the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> the Cluj County Tribunal, which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of Dej, Gherla, Turda and Huedin. Appeals from these tribunals' verdicts, and more serious cases, are directed to the Cluj Court of Appeals. The city also hosts the county's commercial and military tribunals.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{years passed}} {{between the first}} {{publication}} of Scouting for Boys {{and the creation of}} the current largest supranational Scout organization, WOSM, and millions of copies had been sold in dozens of languages. By that point, Scouting was the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> the world's youth, and several Scout associations had already formed in many countries.|$|E
5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> judicial review.|$|E

5|$|With her rival {{for power}} dead, Nuou Jin {{declared}} herself the regent and began personally conducting duties normally within the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> the emperor. When {{it became clear}} that Emperor Xingzong was unhappy with his mother's grab for power, Nuou Jin plotted to replace the emperor with another of her sons, Zhong Yuan, whom Nuou Jin raised herself. Zhong Yuan informed the emperor of their mother's plans, however, and the emperor promptly exiled Nuou Jin.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|According to Article 142 of the Turkish Constitution, the organisation, {{duties and}} {{jurisdiction}} of the courts, their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law. In line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws, the court system in Turkey can be classified under three main categories; which are the Judicial Courts, Administrative Courts and Military Courts. Each category includes first instance courts and high courts. In addition, the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes rules on cases that cannot be classified readily as falling within the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> one court system.|$|E

5|$|Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, {{the capital}} was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway {{over most of}} the capital, and the City of London Police, who were {{responsible}} for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 1936, all {{police forces}} {{throughout}} Germany were united under the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> Himmler and the SS. Himmler and Heydrich thus became {{two of the}} most powerful men in the country's administration. Police and intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; regular uniformed police). In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. This further increased the collective authority of the SS.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{producers}} {{have used a}} wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used. More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, the Department of Regulatory Agencies {{was created}} {{pursuant}} to the [...] "Administrative Organization Act of 1968".

The act also created the Division of Registrations (now known as the Division of Professions and Occupations) and moved many existing boards under its <b>purview,</b> some <b>of</b> which had been in existence for over a century.|$|R
40|$|Understood as {{a search}} for "the {{abstract}} principles embodied in music {{and the sounds of}} which it consists,"l music theory casts a wide net: it calls for a comparative sample and insists on a systematic methodology. As "the scholarly study of music, wherever it is found historically or geographically," musicology casts an even wider net. In practice, however, it has not been possible to transcend historical and geographical boundaries. (How often have you read an article on contemporary rock in JAMS or on Asian music in 19 th-Century Music?) Obviously, any attempt to explore the juncture between music theory and music history-my particular brief from the editors of Current Musicology will not get very far on definitions alone. Are not disciplinary boundaries convenient tags sanctioned by a certain distribution of economic, political, and intellectual power? Better, then, to focus on what some theorists and some historians do than to dwell abstractly on the <b>purviews</b> <b>of</b> music theory and music history. Agawu asks these questions and more as he explains the relationship between musicology and music theory...|$|R

5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the Brady bill loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and transfers of firearms require records and or background checks, such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, as long as the sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} the Deputy Führer had final {{approval}} over civil service appointments, and Bormann reviewed the personnel files and made the decisions regarding appointments. This power impinged on the <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, and {{was an example of}} the overlapping responsibilities typical of the Nazi regime. Bormann travelled everywhere with Hitler, including trips to Austria in 1938 after the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany), and to the Sudetenland after the signing of the Munich Agreement later that year. Bormann was placed in charge of organising the 1938 Nuremberg Rally, a major annual party event.|$|E
5|$|The {{reorganisation}} of {{the corps}} boundaries in December 1962 created a fourth region.

As a key supporter of Diệm, Đính was named commander of the III Corps, because the Ngô family trusted him to defend them in the face of any coup attempts. Under the III Corps were the 5th and the 25th Divisions.|$|E
40|$|Amputated {{from the}} term cybernetics, the prefix cyber- vaguely {{indicates}} that a thing is in some way digital or computer-mediated. The term cybercities is used broadly to indicate that cities have become a different order of thing {{by virtue of the}} insertion of digital communications networks and other computer technology into the urban fabric. In this paper I endeavor to contribute to a reclaiming of the cyber- prefix to propose a more appropriate and useful interpretation of the mediated city more akin to the ethos of cybernetic theory. I put forward a model of an urban cycle by which a city is instantiated and sustained. This cycle is divided into four phases [...] design, build, inhabit, and reflect [...] which also correspond to the <b>purviews</b> <b>of</b> different groups of professional or grassroots urban actors in conventional urban contexts. Using the above-mentioned urban cycle as a mapping convention, I visualize the ways in which these ideas work on and in the urban cycle and identify a subset that represent a transgression of ingrained divisions and blockages in the urban cycle, hinting at potential future developments of the mediated city.

40|$|Dreams and {{architecture}} may {{come across as}} seemingly unlikely associates. The dreams and desires of the city dwellers is something unregistered in the <b>purviews</b> <b>of</b> maps, plans, elevations and statistical analysis. Perhaps it is registered through the commotion of the crowds, slipping through the streets. The “come and go” may behold {{the key to the}} vitality of the city. The Ethiopian District of Johannesburg is a small yet bustling fragment of the city. Informal and uncontrolled trade is a reality that cannot be stifled. The journey of arrival, waiting and departure not only of people, but of objects, contribute to the cacophony of stubborn urbanity and the mental life of the city. Spontaneity, risk and wilderness in the city are symptoms of freedom and rebellion within the Ethiopian district that act against the bound and rational layer of systems, control and planning. A thriving cosmopolis – Johannesburg can be identified to possess the cultural capacity that supports the potential of rich urban interventions in an already existing setting of trade – formal and informal, legal and illegal, that extends beyond the physicality of city planning {{and architecture}}. The city of Johannesburg is a network of cultures, a system, which {{is in a state of}} continual becoming. It is a place which enshrines physical and cultural pluralism as well as the anxiety of difference as indispensable qualities of urbanis...|$|R

The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.|$|E

40|$|Disputes {{between those}} holding differing {{political}} views are ubiquitous and deep-seated, {{and they often}} follow common, recognizable lines. The supporters of tradition and stability, {{sometimes referred to as}} conservatives, do battle with the supporters of innovation and reform, sometimes referred to as liberals. Understanding the correlates of those distinct political orientations is probably a prerequisite for managing political disputes, which are a source of social conflict that can lead to frustration and even bloodshed. A rapidly growing body of empirical evidence documents a multitude of ways in which liberals and conservatives differ from each other in <b>purviews</b> <b>of</b> life with little direct connection to politics, from tastes in art to desire for closure and from disgust sensitivity to the tendency to pursue new information, but the central theme of the differences is a matter of debate. In this article, we argue that one organizing element of the many differences between liberals and conservatives is the nature of their physiological and psychological responses to features of the environment that are negative. Compared with liberals, conservatives tend to register greater physiological responses to such stimuli and also to devote more psychological resources to them. Operating from this point of departure, we suggest approaches for refining understanding of the broad relationship between political views and response to the negative. We conclude with a discussion of normative implications, stressing that identifying differences across ideological groups is not tantamount to declaring one ideology superior to another...|$|R
