One fruitful way to accomplish this is to regard coins both as texts and material culture. Coins comprise textual qualities which in certain respects remind of the written sources. From this angle coins can be associated with their original monetary context. On the other hand, coins are also material objects reappearing in different contexts carrying with them earlier monetary ideas and concepts. Coin finds also reveal the ongoing strife between coin issuers trying to establish their authority and coin users who react on the legislation of coin use imposed on them.

40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{this paper}} is two-fold: 1. We review {{classical}} and recent measures of serial extremal dependence in a strictly stationary time series as well as their estimation. 2. We discuss recent concepts of heavy-tailed time series, including regular variation and max-stable processes. Serial extremal dependence is typically characterized by clusters of exceedances of high thresholds in the series. We start by discussing the notion of extremal index of a univariate sequence, i. e. the reciprocal of the expected cluster size, which has attracted major attention in the extremal value literature. Then we continue by introducing the extremogram which is an asymptotic autocorrelation function for sequences of extremal events in a time series. In this context, we discuss regular variation of a time series. This notion has been useful for describing serial extremal dependence and heavy tails in a strictly stationary sequence. We briefly discuss the tail <b>process</b> <b>coined</b> by Basrak and Segers to describe the dependence structure of regularly varying sequences in a probabilistic way. Max-stable processes with Fréchet marginals are an important class of regularly varying sequences. Recently, this class has attracted attention for modeling and statistical purposes. We apply the extremogram to max-stable processes. Finally, we discuss estimation of the extremogram both in the time and frequency domains. 1...|$|R
40|$|SummaryInduced {{pluripotent}} stem (iPS) {{cells have}} been derived from fibroblast, stomach, and liver cultures at extremely low frequencies by ectopic {{expression of the}} transcription factors Oct 4, Sox 2, c-myc, and Klf 4, a <b>process</b> <b>coined</b> direct or in vitro reprogramming [1 – 8]. iPS cells are molecularly and functionally highly similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs), including their ability to contribute to all tissues {{as well as the}} germline in mice. The heterogeneity of the starting cell populations and the low efficiency of reprogramming suggested that a rare cell type, such as an adult stem cell, might be the cell of origin for iPS cells and that differentiated cells are refractory to reprogramming. Here, we used inducible lentiviruses [9] to express Oct 4, Sox 2, c-myc, and Klf 4 in pancreatic β cells to assess whether a defined terminally differentiated cell type remains amenable to reprogramming. Genetically marked β cells gave rise to iPS cells that expressed pluripotency markers, formed teratomas, and contributed to cell types of all germ layers in chimeric animals. Our results provide genetic proof that terminally differentiated cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent cells, suggesting that in vitro reprogramming is not restricted to certain cell types or differentiation stages...|$|R
