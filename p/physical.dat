5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states {{do not have any}} influence on <b>physical</b> states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of <b>physical</b> phenomena. <b>Physical</b> events can cause other <b>physical</b> events and <b>physical</b> events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the <b>physical</b> world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E

5|$|Any true <b>physical</b> color can be {{represented}} {{by a combination of}} pure spectral colors. As <b>physical</b> colors can be composed of any number of <b>physical</b> colors, the space of <b>physical</b> colors may aptly {{be represented}} by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of <b>physical</b> colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct <b>physical</b> colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E
5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving <b>physical</b> strain and risk of <b>physical</b> injury or death. Research on <b>physical</b> risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a <b>physical</b> risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E

5|$|Fates was {{announced}} for all regions via a Nintendo Direct broadcast in January 2015. It {{was announced}} in Japan as Fire Emblem if. Its English title was revealed during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015. Fates was released in multiple versions. Birthright and Conquest both received a <b>physical</b> release on June 25, 2015 in Japan, which was announced for a 2016 release in the west. Players who purchase a <b>physical</b> copy of either version can download the other version as DLC for a smaller price. Revelation was released exclusively as downloadable content on July 9, {{two weeks after the}} <b>physical</b> release of Fates. In addition to the standard releases was a special edition giving access to Conquest, Birthright and Revelation. The western release also follows the release pattern used in Japan. In North America, the <b>physical</b> versions were released first in February, with the third storyline coming later as DLC in March. In Europe, the <b>physical</b> editions were released on May 20, with Revelation following as DLC on June 9. A special edition, containing all three storylines and an art book, was made available in both regions alongside the initial <b>physical</b> releases. In Australia, the <b>physical</b> versions launched on May 21, while Revelation launched on June 10.|$|E
5|$|For illustration, if a <b>physical</b> system behaves the same, {{regardless}} of how it is oriented in space, the <b>physical</b> laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The <b>physical</b> system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the <b>physical</b> laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if a <b>physical</b> experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E
5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of <b>physical</b> reality (the brain), one must explain how <b>physical</b> memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects <b>physical</b> reality. One {{possible explanation is}} that of a miracle, proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.|$|E

5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a <b>physical</b> system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a <b>physical</b> system based on classes of hypothetical <b>physical</b> laws. For illustration, suppose that a new <b>physical</b> phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E
5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between <b>physical</b> events, or between <b>physical</b> and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or <b>physical)</b> are related to their effects {{by an act of}} God's intervention on each specific occasion.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{anthropology}} in the forensic investigation of remains {{grew out of}} the recognition {{of anthropology}} as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of <b>physical</b> anthropology. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century. Earnest Hooton pioneered the field of <b>physical</b> anthropology and became the first <b>physical</b> anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States. He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of <b>Physical</b> Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš Hrdlička. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in <b>physical</b> anthropology during the early 20th century. In addition to <b>physical</b> anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of criminal anthropology. Now considered a pseudoscience, criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and physiognomy could link a person's behavior to specific <b>physical</b> characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement, popular at the time. It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of anthropometry and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.|$|E
