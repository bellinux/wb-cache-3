40|$|As {{a result}} of the recent years {{financial}} instability, governments have developed new regulatory frameworks for bank capital adequacy. Authorities have become more aware of keeping capital as a buffer to absorb potential losses. Due to this, a new financial instrument, so-called Contingent convertibles (CoCos) have become more interesting. A CoCo bond converts automatically or suffers a write-down when the financial institution is facing a though time and can therefore strength the banks capital structure before the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-viability</b> is reached. Currently, only a few CoCos have been issued but at the moment, several financial institutions are waiting for regulatory frameworks to be implemented, in order to issue CoCos. As CoCos are relatively new there is naturally an interest of how to price CoCos. We will in this thesis analyze one pricing model, namely the Credit Derivative approach on how to price CoCos. Further, applications with fictive data and real data from Swedish banks will be made...|$|E

40|$|The {{path between}} {{financial}} meltdown and moral hazard in banking is, at best, narrow and impervious. During the financial crisis, public support became the standard response {{to save the}} banks in difficulty, heightening and broadening the moral hazard issue: subordinated/senior debt holders and large depositors were bailed out and equity holders were partially sheltered. In the Eurozone, the implicit promise to bail-out governments in difficulty has encouraged SIFIs and other financial operators to speculate on the yield differential between sovereigns and the ECB money market interest rates. The policy framework proposed here is two-pronged: the EFSF should evolve to permit more flexible and wide-ranging interventions, {{and be able to}} manage sovereign debt restructuring; with respect to SIFIs, very early corporate, market and supervisory responses are suggested.

40|$|AGAP : équipe Génomique évolutive et gestion des populations (GE²pop) Dioscorea alata is a {{polyploid}} {{species with}} a ploidy level ranging from diploid (2 n 2 x 40) to tetraploid (2 n 4 x 80). Ploidy increase is correlated with better agronomic performance. The {{lack of knowledge}} about the origin of D. alata spontaneous polyploids (triploids and tetraploids) limits the efficiency of polyploid breeding. The objective {{of the present study was}} to use flow cytometry and microsatellite markers to understand the origin of D. alata polyploids. Different progeny generated by intracytotype crosses (2 x 2 x) and intercytotype crosses (2 x 4 x and 3 x 2 x) were analysed in order to understand endosperm incompatibility phenomena and gamete origins via the heterozygosity rate transmitted to progeny. This work shows that in a 2 x 2 x cross, triploids with viable seeds are obtained only via a phenomenon of diploid female non-gametic reduction. The study of the transmission of heterozygosity made it possible to exclude polyspermy and polyembryony as the mechanisms at the origin of triploids. The fact that no seedlings were obtained by a 3 x 2 x cross made it possible to confirm the sterility of triploid females. Flow cytometry analyses carried out on the endosperm of seeds resulting from 2 x 4 x crosses revealed endosperm incompatibility phenomena. The major conclusion is that the polyploids of D. alata would have appeared through the formation of unreduced gametes. The triploid pool would have been built and diversified through the formation of 2 n gametes in diploid females as the result <b>of</b> the <b>non-viability</b> <b>of</b> seeds resulting from the formation of 2 n sperm and <b>of</b> the <b>non-viability</b> <b>of</b> intercytotype crosses.

40|$|Parts I and II of {{this paper}} are aimed at {{providing}} a comprehensive overview of, and responses to, four very vital components of the consultative processes which {{have contributed to the}} new framework known as Basel III. The papers will approach these components in the order of the consultative processes, namely, the capital proposals, the liquidity proposals and the Proposal to ensure the loss absorbency of regulatory capital at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-viability.</b> The capital proposals comprise proposals aimed at strengthening the resilience of the banking sector, the proposal relating to international framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring and, the countercyclical capital buffer proposal. Whilst the capital proposals have been welcomed, there has been growing realization since the aftermath of the recent Financial Crisis that banks which have been complying with capital adequacy requirements could still face severe liquidity problems. As well as highlighting the importance of introducing counter cyclical capital buffers, the response to the countercyclical proposal draws attention to the need for greater focus on more forward looking provisions, as well as provisions which are aimed at addressing losses and unforeseen problems attributed to “maturity transformation of short-term deposits into long term loans. ” The Committee's acknowledgement of negative incentives arising from the use of external ratings to determine regulatory capital requirements and proposals to mitigate these incentives is well - founded – however, regulators will also be able to manage, with greater ability, systemic risks to the financial system during such periods when firms which are highly leveraged become reluctant to lend where more market participants such as credit rating agencies, could be engaged in the supervisory process. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} agency costs and moral hazard {{associated}} with the new capital regulation for banks {{in the event of}} balance-sheet losses. The recent introduction of "Bail-in" provisions, under which unsecured creditors must contribute to banks’ rescue through recapitalisation, and the regulatory stipulation of higher equity requirements, will have profound effects on the traditional agency relationships between shareholders and bondholders of banks. These Bail-in provisions imply, "Deviations from the Absolute Priority Rule" (DAPR). This dissertation undertakes quantitative and qualitative analyses of the new Bail-In structures, focusing on their microeconomic consequences that lead to perverse incentives of the equityholders and subsequently propose practical solutions to the identified problems. The first main result reveals that Bail-in could actually aggravate the agency costs by intensifying the "wealth transfer" from bondholders to equityholders. The second main result is to demonstrate that enforcing higher monitoring costs to the bondholders reduces equityholders’ incentive for moral hazard via higher cost of capital. The use of financial and non-financial covenants within the "Bail-In-Able Debt" indenture has been proposed as practical solutions to facilitate bondholders’ monitoring efforts. However, close to the <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Non-Viability</b> covenants are no longer effective as the risk of DAPR looms, and the equityholders are tempted to attempt "gamble-for-resurrection". To attenuate this distortion of shareholder incentives, Bail-in provision must impose some cost on shareholders. They could be made to face significant dilution, through a fair debt-to-equity swap with bondholders at market prices, or face full dilution via private expropriation by a new shareholder base that we term "Contingent Equity Base". This is the third main result. Overall, this dissertation makes a significant step forward into the understanding of the microeconomic consequences of the new bank’s capital regulation in general and the Contingent Convertibles in particular whilst offering practical solutions to the problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{difficulty}} in running a self-managed firm {{has been one}} of the arguments used in economics literature to prove the <b>non-viability</b> <b>of</b> the model. People who are sufficiently talented and willing both to manage worker-owners and to assume processes of collective decision-making are a scant resource, one which would involve unsustainable incentives for these companies with their own peculiar characteristics. However, the development of self-managed firms has demonstrated that such a task is possible, a fact with gives the lie to the argument <b>of</b> <b>non-viability.</b> This work systematically draws together the findings of empirical studies from a range of disciplines on managerial work and its peculiarities with regard to other kinds of businesses, in a European Community country with a significant presence of self-run firms. The work is structured into four parts, the first being a delimitation of the subject, object and theoretical framework. The second part sets out the conclusions obtained on the figure of the manager at a level of values, knowledge and management style. The third section goes into detail on the context in which managers must carry out their work and collaborate in the governance of associated work firms. The fourth part deals with findings concerning how managers of this type of firm promote action, either directly or indirectly, by delegating to other people. Finally, the scope of the ideas set out is evaluated, and possible lines of interest are formulated. Direction, management, manager, associated work, Spain. ...|$|R

Among various approaches for the purpose, policy makers have paid far {{more attention to}} biotechnological alternatives. The first transgenic variety was approved for commercial trials in cotton. However, some companies incorporate the Bt gene from the approved varieties in other varieties and released such hybrids to the farmers. It so happened that these hybrids though illegal and released unethically proved more remunerative to the farmers. As if this was not enough, farmers made crosses of this hybrid developed by NABARD seed company and developed their own locally suited varieties. The paper describes the ethical, business and political dimensions of agriculture biotechnology in India with specific reference {{to the experience of}} Bt cotton in Gujarat. The neglect of IPM, herbal pesticides and bio control methods becomes even less justified when state not only tolerates but also encourages widespread experimentation of Bt cotton without any regulation or monitoring.

40|$|The {{financial}} sustainability of the South African {{urban public transport}} systems has been brought into question. The primary determinant <b>of</b> <b>non-viability</b> is the unique spatial structure of South African cities and the associated lack of public transport supportive land use environments. Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is being mooted as a potential method to improve inefficient urban forms and {{the viability of the}} public transport systems. Prior studies on density articulation have illustrated that the ability of TOD to decrease feeder service reliance has a significant positive impact on the viability of the public transport system as a whole. However, TOD is confined to the Station Influence Area (SIA) of each trunk service station. Therefore, the reach of TOD and its effect on public transport viability is dependent upon the population density within each SIA {{and the size of the}} SIAs. Conventionally, an SIA is measured as the walking catchment area of a station. If sufficient cycling infrastructure is provided, bicycle-based TOD (B-TOD) could develop a considerably larger SIA, however, with all the associated benefits of conventional pedestrian-based TOD. This presentation will illustrate that the positive effects of B-TOD on the viability of a public transport service, through decreased feeder service reliance, could far outweigh the costs of the cycling infrastructure. The study utilises a simplified public transport corridor operating cost model to test the effects of varying degrees of B-TOD in a generic South African urban context.
