40|$|Abstract. A {{constructive}} {{proof of}} the Gödel-Rosser incompleteness theorem [9] has been completed using the Coq proof assistant. Some theory of classical first-order logic over an arbitrary language is formalized. A development of primitive recursive functions is given, and all primitive recursive functions are <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be representable in a weak axiom system. Formulas and proofs are encoded as natural numbers, and functions operating on these codes are <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be primitive recursive. The weak axiom system is <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be essentially incomplete. In particular, Peano arithmetic is <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be consistent in Coq’s type theory and therefore is incomplete. ...|$|R
