5|$|Initially Los Alamos was {{supposed}} to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army. He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army <b>physical</b> <b>test,</b> which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at , diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral joint pain. The plan to commission scientists fell through when Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department. It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project; Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.|$|E

25|$|The Para Training School was {{established}} at the PAF Academy Risalpur in 2003. It is the second parachute school in Pakistan after the Pakistan Army Para School located at Peshawar. Before its establishment, PAF personnel were trained at the Pakistan Army Para School. The school conducts various basic and advanced courses, including free fall training. It also trains cadets to fly para motor gliders. The Special Service Wing of the PAF also receives parachute training at this school. After a rigorous <b>physical</b> <b>test</b> the top cadets are selected to do the paragliding and para-trooping courses. Paragliding involves wearing a parachute and after jumping from a height, glide and land. Cadets who successfully complete the paragliding course are entitled to wear the paragliding (PG) badge on their uniforms and they further {{get a chance to}} now fly para motor gliders which gets them to wear them the PMG badge on their uniforms.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it would}} be quite {{difficult}} to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a psychophysical approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them S, M, and L. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (I'S, I'M, I'L) for the S, M, and L lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (I'S, I'M, I'L) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of S, M, L would have to be added with some intensity to the <b>physical</b> <b>test</b> color, and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.|$|E
40|$|Although {{testing is}} a value adding {{activity}} and improves confidence in design, lengthy <b>physical</b> <b>testing</b> in one phase can delay the product development process, because testing and design processes are closely intertwined. This study identifies that, due to long procurement times and lengthy <b>physical</b> <b>tests,</b> companies {{may have no}} choice but to redesign tasks before testing results are available in order to meet product delivery deadlines. This increases uncertainties therefore reduces confidence in design.

25|$|Einstein's {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry. For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do {{not add up to}} 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now {{an integral part of the}} software that runs the GPS system. It is possible to object to this interpretation {{of general relativity}} on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible <b>physical</b> <b>test</b> that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.|$|E
25|$|Over 75% of Red Army {{divisions}} {{were listed}} rifle divisions, as infantry divisions were {{known in the}} Red Army. In the Imperial Russian Army, the strelkovye (rifle) divisions were considered more prestigious than pekhotnye (infantry) divisions, and in the Red Army, all infantry divisions were labeled strelkovye divisions. The Soviet riflemen were known as a peshkom ("on foot") or more frequently as a frontovik (front fighter). The term frontovik was not equivalent to the German term Landser, the American G.I Joe or the British Tommy Atkins, all of which referred to soldiers in general, as the term frontovik was used only to describe those infantrymen who fought at the front. All able-bodied males in the Soviet Union were eligible for conscription {{at the age of}} 19 and those attending university or a technical school were able to escape conscription, and even then could defer military service for a period ranging from 3 months to a year. Deferments could be only offered three times. The Soviet Union was divided into 20 military districts, which corresponded with the borders of the oblasts, and were further divided into raions (counties). It was from the raions that quotas were assigned to the number of men that had been produced for the Red Army every year. The vast majority of the frontoviks had been born in the 1920s and grown up knowing nothing other than the Soviet system. Every year, men received draft notices in the mail informing to report at a collection, usually a local school, and customarily reported to duty with a bag or suitcase carrying some spare clothes, underwear, and tobacco. The conscripts then boarded a train to take to a military reception center where they were issued uniforms, underwent a <b>physical</b> <b>test,</b> had their heads shaven and were given a steam bath to rid them of lice. A typical soldier was given ammo pouches, shelter-cape, ration bag, cooking pot, water bottle and an identity tube containing papers listing pertinent personal information.|$|E

Slackers received negative responses from critics, including one who found that the characters [...] "are not so strikingly original as to elevate the slack material", while Four Faces of God and Lone Star State of Mind did not have wide theatrical releases. 2003 saw King in the film Bulletproof Monk, alongside Chow Yun-fat and Seann William Scott, an adaptation of a comic book by Michael Avon Oeming. After five auditions, a screen test, and a <b>physical</b> <b>test,</b> she landed the role of Jade, a character skilled in martial arts. This was King's first leading action film role. Bulletproof Monk received mostly negative reviews from critics, who cited that the fight scenes were not as well choreographed or directed as those other genre films, and that the alternating comedic and action scenes were jarring. Regardless, Bulletproof Monk was nominated for Choice Movie in a Drama/Action Adventure award at the Teen Choice Awards. In late 2003, King appeared in the music video for the Robbie Williams song, [...] "Sexed Up", and on the cover artwork for the single's release. In 2004, {{she appeared}} in the comedy White Chicks, playing Heather Vandergeld, with actress Brittany Daniel as her sister Megan Vandergeld, a parody on socialites Paris and Nicky Hilton. White Chicks was negatively reviewed by critics, receiving five nominations at the Razzie Awards in the categories for Worst Actress, Worst Director, Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple and Worst Screenplay.
