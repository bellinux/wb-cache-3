40|$|The OH {{oxidation}} of α-pinene {{under both}} low- and high-NO x environments was {{studied in the}} Caltech atmospheric chambers. Ozone was kept low to ensure OH was the oxidant.

Here we present the gas-phase results observed. Under low-NO x conditions the main first generation oxidation products are α-pinene hydroxy hydroperoxide and pinonaldehyde, accounting for over 40 % of the yield. In all, 65 – 75 % of the carbon can be accounted for in the gas phase; this excludes first-generation products that enter the particle phase. We suggest that pinonaldehyde forms from RO 2 + HO 2 through an alkoxy radical channel that regenerates OH, a mechanism typically associated with acyl peroxy radicals, not alkyl peroxy radicals. The OH oxidation and photolysis of α-pinene hydroxy hydroperoxides leads to further production of pinonaldehyde, resulting in total pinonaldehyde yield from low-NO x OH oxidation of ~ 33 %. The low-NO x OH oxidation of pinonaldehyde produces a number of carboxylic acids and <b>peroxyacids</b> known to be important secondary organic aerosol components.
