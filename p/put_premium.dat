Their prices normally align with each other within a limited window. When they do not, arbitrage opportunities arise: an investor who spots the misalignment {{will be able to}} buy (sell) options on one hand, and sell (buy) futures on the other and make risk-free profits. In this paper, we focus on put-callfutures parity arbitrage opportunities. The upper bound of a futures bid price, denoted by Fbt, is given by: Fbte –ra(T–t) ≤ Cat – Pbt + Xe –rb(T–t) + TC (1) Here, T is the expiration date and t is today, i. e. T–t is the remaining time to maturity; Cat is the option’s call premium at the ask, Pbt is the option’s <b>put</b> <b>premium</b> at the bid. X is the exercise price for the option.

In particular, {{there have been}} a growing number of OGD establishments in the developed world, sparking expectations of similar trends in growing democracies. To understand the readiness of OGD stakeholders in Africa especially the media, this paper (1) reviews current infrastructure at OGD web portals in Africa and (2) conducts a preference elicitation analysis among media practitioners in 5 out of the 7 OGD country centers in Africa regarding desired structure of OGD in developing countries. The analysis gives a view of the relative importance media practitioners ascribe to a selected set of OGD attributes in anticipation of a more functional OGD in their respective countries. Using conjoint analysis, the result indicates that media practitioners <b>put</b> <b>premium</b> on ‘metadata’ and ‘data format’ respectively in order of importance. Results from the review also reveal that features of current OGD web portals in Africa are not consistent with the desired preferences of users. Overall, the study provides a general insight into media expectations of OGD in Africa, and also serves as a foundational knowledge for authorities and practitioners to manage expectations of the media in connection with OGD in Africa. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study explores this linguistic situation using data from interviews and recordings of classroom interactions in a Junior High School located in the predominantly Ewe-speaking community of Sogakope in South-Eastern Ghana. Employing a combination of language contact theories in sociolinguistics and the ABC Model of attitudinal study in social psychology for the analysis of data, we present the language choices made in this classroom as well as the pragmatic factors that influence these choices, participants’ attitudes, and how participants’ choices and attitudes could inform language-in-education policy in Ghana. The outcomes of the study show that students’ lack of competence in English and the linguistic gaps in Ewe are the pragmatic factors that influence language choices in this classroom and that code-switching is the main medium adopted to cater for these linguistic challenges. Furthermore, all participants have positive attitudes towards English as medium of instruction and as a subject of study because of its utilitarian function, and to code-switching as medium of instruction because it aids in lesson comprehension but they have negative and ambivalent attitudes towards Ewe as medium of instruction and as a subject of study respectively because it has low aspirational function. The study suggests {{that there should be a}} distinction between ‘medium of instruction’ and ‘medium of classroom interaction’ (Bonacina & Gafaranga, 2010) in order to <b>put</b> <b>premium</b> on students’ needs as the basis for language-in-education policies; that Ghanaian indigenous languages are made compulsory subjects of study from primary school to the Senior High School level and that competence in at least a Ghanaian indigenous language be made a condition for employment in Ghana to give a strong aspirational function to Ghanaian languages as well as trigger positive attitudes towards these languages (Owu-Ewie & Adu-Buandoh, 2014) ...|$|E
40|$|Title: VENTURE CAPITAL-BACKED INVESTMENT: IMPACT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN SWEDEN Author: John Gartchie Gatsi Supervisor: Anders Hederstierna Department: School of Management, Blekinge Institute of Technology Course: Master’s Thesis in Business Administration, 10 Credits Background {{and problem}} discussion: Sweden {{is one of}} the small open economies with flourishing venture capital investments. Much {{research}} has not been conducted into corporate governance in Sweden when venture capital is involved. I therefore studied how venture capital investments affect corporate governance and performance in Sweden. The research question focuses on board chairperson’s separation from the CEO, independent audit and compensation committees and other board members. Purpose: The study was conducted to understand how corporate governance has developed into the management of Venture Capital backed investments in Sweden since, Sweden ranked third to Venture Capital investment destination currently. The result will add to the limited existing literature on the subject in Sweden with venture capital as the focus. Theory: The study was conducted using both complementarities framework and governed corporation principle in which venture capital firms and their portfolio firms in Sweden benefit from each other. Analysis: Data for the thesis was collected from selected Venture Capitalists who are members of the Swedish Venture Capital Association through simple Open and closed ended self administered questionnaire. Conclusion: Venture capitalists ensure active participation in the portfolio firms through board representation but do not consider appointment of board chair as a means to enhance corporate governance. Separation of the board chair from the CEO of a portfolio firm is a clear characteristic of corporate governance in venture capital backed investments in Sweden. More importance is placed on collective decision making than Audit and Compensation Committees. The essence of this thesis has been set out in the research question to investigate into whether board chairpersons of Swedish Venture Capital firms are separated from the CEOs and whether they have independent auditing and compensation committees. The determination of other board members by management has also been investigated. Separation of the board chair from the CEO of a portfolio firm is a clear characteristic of corporate governance in venture capital backed investments in Sweden. Audit and Compensation Committees are not an important consideration to enhance corporate governance in the venture capital industry in Sweden, though some Venture Capital firms place some importance on these committees. They rather <b>put</b> <b>premium</b> on collective and collaborative decision making process that produces the best ideas, and strategies to end up in mutually beneficial exits. Swedish Venture capitalists are active investors who monitor their portfolio firms in diverse ways including demanding consistent reports, budgets, minutes of important meetings as well as business plans coupled with intermittent questionnaire. They augment this with regular presentations by portfolio firms to give “ready to analyse” data about the performance of their investment. In order to enhance transparency and fairness in the governance of their portfolio firms, Swedish Venture Capitalists permit managers/entrepreneurs to appoint other members of the board of directors. They widely encourage the use of stock options as means of compensation for board members and CEOs to maintain focus on achieving targets that will provide useful exits. Even though Swedish Venture Capital firms do not place much currency on the use of audit and compensation committees to influence the level of corporate governance practices, they do not rule out their importance. They rather wholeheartedly accept outside and independent representation on the board to add credibility to the accountability provided by the board of directors. Finally, they participate actively on the boards to influence the decision making process and thereafter monitor and support managers and CEOs to implement decisions effectively. nyagart@yahoo. com Box LG 367, Legon, Accra Ghana...|$|E
