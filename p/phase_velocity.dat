For example, as is discussed in the propagation of light in a medium section below, many wave velocities can exceed c.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{for identifying}} the svrface waves, Love-and Rayleigh-waves, in microtremors {{has already been}} developed as a new exploration technique which can determine S-wave velocity structure. A practical use of the technique has been designed and also examined at two experimental sites in an urban area, Morioka city in northen Honshu, Japan. The technique involves the measurement of the dispersion of both surface waves in microtremors by using a specially-designed circular seismic array consisting of more than three tri-axial seismometers that are equally spaced on acircle and one at the circular center. In determination of <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> of Love- and Rayleigh-waves, the newly-modified spatial auto-correlation method has been used. The method can provide not only the dispersion of Rayleigh waves, but also that of Love waves. The dispersion of Love waves is directly convertible to the S-wave <b>velocity</b> structure. Estimated <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> of Love wave using microtremors at the experiment site of Iwate University were {{in the range of}} 750 to 200 m/s corresponding to the frequency range from 2. 8 to 10 Hz. The <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> determined from horizontal microtremors were in good agreement with those calculated by the structure model which were derived from the <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> of Rayleigh waves. Estimated <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> of Love wave in microtremors were in the range of 450 to 200 m/s corresponding to the frequency range from 1 to 2. 9 Hz at the experiment site of Morioka technical high-school. These results of two experimental sites show that the newly-modified spatial auto-correlation method is applicable to estimation of Love wave <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> using microtremors...|$|R
5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the <b>phase</b> <b>velocity</b> is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

40|$|Microtremors {{are usually}} {{analysed}} without any {{consideration of the}} higher modes of surface waves. However, recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} higher modes contain useful information for improving the inverted S-wave velocity model. In this study, we propose two inversion methods that consider higher modes by using the amplitude response of each mode, which can avoid mode misidentification in the spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method. One method is to compare the observed <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> by the extended spatial autocorrelation (ESPAC) method with the effective <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> calculated from theoretical dispersion curves and the amplitude responses of each mode. In the other method, SPAC coefficients are fit directly by comparing theoretical SPAC coefficients determined from dispersion curves and amplitude responses with the observed ones. The latter, direct-fitting approach is much simpler than the method using effective <b>phase</b> <b>velocities.</b> To investigate the effectiveness of these methods, a simulation study was conducted. Simulated microtremors that included higher modes were successfully inverted by the proposed multimode methods. The observed <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> and SPAC coefficients determined from field data were also consistent with theoretical ones constructed by the proposed methods except at low frequencies. The inversion using effective <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> required prior information about an infinite half-space to obtain a better S-wave velocity model whereas the direct-fitting inversion worked well without prior information, suggesting the direct-fitting method is more robust than the method using effective <b>phase</b> <b>velocities.</b> We conclude that our proposed inversion methods are effective for estimating the S-wave velocity structure even if higher modes of surface waves are predominant in observed microtremors...|$|R

40|$|The coupled {{modeling}} {{of the flow}} of two immiscible fluid phases in a heterogeneous, elastic, porous material is formulated in a manner analogous to that for a single fluid phase. An asymptotic technique, valid when the heterogeneity is smoothly varying, is used to derive equations for the <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> of the various modes of propagation. A cubic equation is associated with the <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> of the longitudinal modes. The coefficients of the cubic equation are expressed in terms of sums of the determinants of 3 × 3 matrices whose elements are the parameters found in the governing equations. In addition to the three longitudinal modes, there is a transverse mode of propagation, a generalization of the elastic shear wave. Estimates of the <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> for a homogeneous medium, based upon the formulas in this paper, agree with previous studies.

30|$|Our study {{demonstrated}} that the lateral variation of attenuation coefficients estimated by the proposed method can identify sharp lateral discontinuities such as lithological boundaries and fracture zones. Estimating attenuation coefficients separately from positive- and negative-offset data is effective in identifying lithological boundaries. We also {{demonstrated that}} attenuation coefficients are more sensitive to localized fractures than <b>phase</b> <b>velocities,</b> although both attenuation coefficients and <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> are sensitive to lithological boundaries. Therefore, simultaneous interpretation of lateral variation of attenuation coefficients and that of <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> has a potential to distinguish lithological boundaries from the localized lateral discontinuities (fractures associated with faults). This ability would be valuable in applications such as fluid injection studies, where it may allow localized fractures to be detected using conventional seismic data.|$|R

25|$|The <b>phase</b> <b>velocity</b> of an {{electromagnetic}} wave, {{when traveling}} through a medium, can routinely exceed c, the vacuum velocity of light. For example, this occurs in most glasses at X-ray frequencies. However, the <b>phase</b> <b>velocity</b> {{of a wave}} corresponds to the propagation speed of a theoretical single-frequency (purely monochromatic) component of the wave at that frequency. Such a wave component must be infinite in extent and of constant amplitude (otherwise it is not truly monochromatic), and so cannot convey any information.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{velocity}} {{that must be}} exceeded is the <b>phase</b> <b>velocity</b> of light rather than the group velocity of light. The <b>phase</b> <b>velocity</b> can be altered dramatically by employing a periodic medium, {{and in that case}} one can even achieve Cherenkov radiation with no minimum particle velocity, a phenomenon known as the Smith–Purcell effect. In a more complex periodic medium, such as a photonic crystal, one can also obtain a variety of other anomalous Cherenkov effects, such as radiation in a backwards direction (whereas ordinary Cherenkov radiation forms an acute angle with the particle velocity).|$|E

More specifically, we investigate {{the form of the}} chimera states induced by a 3 D coupling matrix with nonlocal topology. The observed patterns are in many cases direct generalizations of the corresponding 2 D patterns, e. ~g. spheres, layers and cylinder grids. We also find cylindrical and "cross-layered" chimeras that do not have an equivalent in 2 D systems. Quantitative measures are calculated, such as the ratio of synchronized and unsynchronized neurons {{as a function of the}} coupling range, the mean <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> and the distribution of neurons in mean <b>phase</b> <b>velocities.</b> Based on these measures the chimeras are categorized in two families. The first family of patterns is observed for weaker coupling and exhibits higher mean <b>phase</b> <b>velocities</b> for the unsynchronized areas of the network. The opposite holds for the second family where the unsynchronized areas have lower mean <b>phase</b> <b>velocities.</b> The various measures demonstrate discontinuities, indicating criticality as the parameters cross from the first family of patterns to the second.
