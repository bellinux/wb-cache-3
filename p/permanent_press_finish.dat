50|$|The ABU {{comes in}} 236 {{different}} size options in {{both male and}} female sizes which are only offered in temperate weight. Additionally, its <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> <b>finish</b> means the uniform cannot be starched, pressed or dry-cleaned. Airmen are able to pull the ABU from the dryer and wear it without further treatment. Any further treatment would degrade the effectiveness of the uniform and damage the NIR capability.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 47) Permanent press fabrics {{are popular}} {{today because of}} their easy care properties. However, {{it has not been}} verified whether or not this same finish might also act as an antibacterial agent. Therefore, this study investigated the hypothesis that permanent press finishes might stop or curtail bacterial growth on fabrics. Inoculations of two bacteria, E. Coli and B. mega on finished and unfinished fabric samples provided results for a comparative study. Some samples were inoculated and plated immediately; others were inoculated and kept in a humidity chamber for twenty-four hours before plating to simulate storage and climatic conditions; and a third group were inoculated, kept in a humidity chamber for twenty-four hours and then laundered in and according to suggested Launderometer standards. The samples from this last test were then either plated whole or macerated and plated. The Agar Plate Test method (AATCC test standard for detection and evaluation of antibacterial finishes) and the Streak Test method were used for another set of tests. Another segment of the study concerned naturally soiled finished and unfinished fabrics. Small samples of each fabric were sewn in regular clothing, worn one day, and then plated. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and subsequently plated showed little or no growth whereas all the unfinished samples showed considerably increased growth. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and stored for twenty-four hours in a humidity chamber before plating showed no growth while the unfinished samples all exhibited bacterial growth. Of the samples that were inoculated, stored for twenty-four hours in the humidity chamber, washed, and plated whole, all finished samples had no growth but all untreated samples showed growth. Of the washed samples that were macerated, the untreated macerated fibers showed from five to six times more growth than the permanent press samples. The Agar Plate Test and Streak Test both showed that the permanent press samples inhibited bacterial growth whereas the unfinished samples showed no inhibition of growth. On all samples of naturally soiled permanent press fabrics, the majority of samples containing bacterial growth had less growth than the unfinished samples. These results would indicate that the <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> <b>finish</b> can inhibit some bacterial growth and thus may act concomitantly as an antibacterial finish...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{process has}} been {{developed}} to impart <b>permanent</b> paper <b>press</b> <b>finish</b> to wool fabric using the pressure decatiser. This involves developing a new wrapper fabric with appropriate smoothness, strength and steam permeability. The processing time {{is similar to that}} normally used in the pressure decatiser, thus in comparison with the conventional Paper <b>Press</b> <b>finish,</b> the processing and labour costs are significantly reduced. ...|$|R
50|$|Since the 1990s, with {{advances}} in {{technologies such as}} <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> process, <b>finishing</b> agents {{have been used to}} strengthen fabrics and make them wrinkle free. More recently, nanomaterials research has led to additional advancements, with companies such as Nano-Tex and NanoHorizons developing permanent treatments based on metallic nanoparticles for making textiles more resistant to things such as water, stains, wrinkles, and pathogens such as bacteria and fungi.|$|R
2500|$|For most people, {{irritation}} from formaldehyde {{is temporary}} and reversible, though formaldehyde can cause allergies and {{is part of}} the standard patch test series. In 2005–06, it was the seventh-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (9.0%). [...] People with formaldehyde allergy are advised to avoid formaldehyde releasers as well (e.g., Quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea, and diazolidinyl urea). People who suffer allergic reactions to formaldehyde tend to display lesions on the skin in the areas that have had direct contact with the substance, such as the neck or thighs (often due to formaldehyde released from <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> <b>finished</b> clothing) or dermatitis on the face (typically from cosmetics). Formaldehyde has been banned in cosmetics in both Sweden and Japan. The eyes are most sensitive to formaldehyde exposure: The lowest level at which many people can begin to smell formaldehyde is about 0.05 ppm and the highest level is 1 ppm. The maximum concentration value at the workplace is 0.3 ppm. In controlled chamber studies, individuals begin to sense eye irritation at about 0.5 ppm; 5 to 20 percent report eye irritation at 0.5 to 1 ppm; and greater certainty for sensory irritation occurred at 1 ppm and above. While some agencies have used a level as low as 0.1 ppm as a threshold for irritation, the expert panel found that a level of 0.3 ppm would protect against nearly all irritation. In fact, the expert panel found that a level of 1.0 ppm would avoid eye irritation—the most sensitive endpoint—in 75–95% of all people exposed.|$|R

The factors of complete versus incomplete families,employed and non ??employed women, women's educational and age level, and family income level {{were related to}} selection and use of <b>permanent</b> <b>press.</b> The above factors were analyzed in rela??tion to responses on;ownership,care,and planned replacement of <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> products;consumer motivation which included reasons for purchasing permanent press;and awareness and influences of advertising media. Generally,the complete families had a larger variety and {{a greater number of}} <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> products than the incomplete families. The employed women owned a larger number of <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> shirts and blouses than the non??-employed women. The non-employed were less aware of advertising but more were influenced by the advertising media than employed women. No significant differences occurred among the various educational groups when related to <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> behavior.
