The Office of Federal Procurement Policy is responsible for coordinating the act's requirements with other federal procurement policies, and for reporting to Congress every 2 years on federal agencies' progress in implementing these requirements. Twenty-five years after passage of the act, the success of this effort is largely uncertain. EPA accelerated its designation of recycled-content products in the 1990 s.

40|$|Public {{procurement}} is {{a dynamic}} process involving vendors, contractors and <b>procuring</b> <b>agencies.</b> Even before submitting bids, competition among contractors may already have started. Given the nature of public work and expected strategies of rivals, some firms decide to enter the market, but others do not. Procurers can also enhance or limit the bidder participation through various ex ante qualification procedures for quality assurance purposes. Some applicants are qualified, but others are not. Thus, the selection process has two dimensions: bidders self-select, and an auctioneer may (dis) qualify some applicants. The paper explores this selection dynamics, using procurement data from road projects in developing countries.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{the concept of}} using “offthe- shelf” Spacecraft (SC) buses for space science and earth science {{missions}} has become widespread. A “common bus” design approach {{has been used for}} Geosynchronous (GEO) communications satellites since the early 1970 ’s. The success of using common bus designs for the manufacture of GEO communications satellites is due to the commonality of mission requirements and orbit geometry. Science missions, on the other hand, each have unique mission and instrument payload requirements that can vary widely, encompassing orbit geometry, instrument type and configuration, science target, SC attitude, operations concept, and launch scenario. One of the most visible and successful implementations of “off-the-shelf” SC for science applications is the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Rapid Spacecraft Development Office (RSDO) catalog, first released in 1997. In the current catalog (Rapid II), there are twenty-three different SC buses manufactured by eight aerospace companies. This paper provides a case study describing the adaptation of Spectrum Astro’s SA- 200 HP (High Performance) RSDO catalog SC bus to two very different Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) science missions, Coriolis and Swift, which were both procured via the RSDO. Coriolis is a Department-of-Defense-sponsored sunsynchronous earth observation satellite whose primary instrument, WindSat, is designed to precisely measure the ocean surface wind vector. Swift is a low inclination NASA Medium Explorer (MIDEX) mission to detect and characterize Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). The Swift Observatory carries three separate telescopes.

40|$|Neither Congress, the <b>procuring</b> <b>agencies,</b> the media, nor {{the public}} will condone {{government}} contractors reaping what are perceived as excessive profits. Accordingly, the procurement process employs an unduly complex, burdensome, risk-laden, and ineffective mechanism that erects significant barriers to civil/military integration. This paper (presented at the 1999 Defense Systems Management College (DSMC) Acquisition Research Symposium) examines certain policy implications associated with the Truth In Negotiations Act (TINA), the existing audit regime, {{and the use of}} criminal and civil anti-fraud measures to scrutinize deviations from these complex cost, pricing, and profit policies and controls. It re-visits the long-extinct Renegotiation Act and finds it less troubling than the existing quagmire. It analogizes to recent experience in the public utilities industry, which employs a sharing mechanism as an explicit, transparent means for addressing excessive profits. The paper proposes to simplify and decriminalize Federal procurement pricing and profit policy by drawing from the historical renegotiation experience. A transparent renegotiation regime (1) could be one less burdensome or complex element of a regulatory scheme that presents suppliers with a menu of regulatory options; (2) would allow contractors to select the approach that best corresponds to their own assessment of which contractual rules will minimize their costs; and (3) could permit the Government to share, directly or indirectly, in these increased efficiencies and savings...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{has a bad}} image. There seems a lack of quality in construction works {{at the time of}} delivery, and estimates of time and costs seem to be exceeded structurally, especially in public projects. Partially, {{this has to do with}} the increased complexity of construction projects. Therefore, <b>procuring</b> <b>agencies</b> and contractors feel the need to discuss all aspects of the project before closing a contract. Changes in pre-contractual negotiations were to decrease post-contractual renegotiations and to improve mutual commitment. With the Competitive Dialogue procedure, a public procurement method that was introduced in 2004, this need was met. Yet, the procedure is not proven effective. This dissertation addresses the question how inter-organisational negotiations and commitments are interrelated, and what the effect is of using the competitive dialogue procedure. Based on a survey, a multiple-case study and an in-depth single case study, the author shows that understanding is the most important determinant for the development of negotiations and commitments in inter-organisational projects. Investment in creation of mutual understanding in early stages of project negotiations is likely to prevent renegotiations in later stages. The competitive dialogue could have a positive influence on the creation of mutual understanding, yet the research shows how several mechanisms of the procedure are currently counterproductive in realising that.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 33 - 34). Transparency, efficiency, accountability, competitiveness, equitable treatment and free & fair competition are essential to be ensured in the procurement using public funds. In Bangladesh, these could not be ensured earlier {{due to a lack}} of proper rules and regulation. To streamline the public procurement activities, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 and thereafter issued Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008. Since then government agencies are bound to abide by the Act and Rules very strictly in their procurement activities. The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) is continually monitoring the compliance of PPA 2006 and PPR 2008 by the target agencies in the light of 45 predetermined Key Performance Indicators (KPI). In spite of being a major <b>procuring</b> <b>agency</b> of the country PWD is not among the four target agency. At the time of selection of the target agency the amount of procurement in PWD is not in the first four. But after that the amount of procurement has increased substantially. Now PWD has procured more than Water development Board (one of the four target agency). For not being in the list of initial selection, the procurement activities of PWD are not monitored keenly. Now it is required to take a look on PWD’s procurement activities. The research has been designed under the questions if PWD is following PPR 2008 completely or not; and if not, then the causes behind that. The main objectives of the present study are to find out the extent of compliance of PPR 2008 by PWD and to find out the gap of compliance and scope of improvement for implementation. The related literatures and reports, particularly from PWD and SRGB, have been thoroughly reviewed before conducting the main research work. The key findings of these reports have been compared and analyzed which helped to draw important conclusion of the study. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect data of different projects undertaken by PWD. The study result shows a clear noncompliance to the rules of PPR 2008 in PWD in carrying out some of the compliance related KPIs. Among the 11 different compliance issues, it has been revealed that PWD is doing well in 7 KPIs. For other 4 issues namely submission of report by the TEC, Average number of days taken between submission of Tender Evaluation Report and approval of contract, Average number of days between final approval and Notification of Award (NOA) and Percentage of Contracts where interest for delayed payments was made are not satisfactory and a clear improvement is required in these areas. For improvement of these situations, some specific recommendations have been drawn. These are (i) Compiling the contractors profile (ii) Empowering the lower tier will decrease the time in approval process (iii) Strong adherence of law and effective internal auditing payment of interest in case of delayed payment should be considered carefully to protect the interests of both the parties. (v) Introduction to e-gp (vi) Training on Procurement law (vii) to ensure the timely payment to the contractors, tender should be floated only after availability of sufficient fund.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 45). Sustainable procurement (SP) is procurement {{that is consistent with}} the principles of sustainable development. Sustainable procurement is an approach that takes economic, environmental and social sustainability into account when making any purchasing decision. Public procurement is concerned with how public sector organizations spend tax payers’ money. Public procurement is guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and achieving value for money for citizens and tax payers. Public Works Department (PWD) {{is one of the biggest}} public <b>procuring</b> <b>agencies</b> for government in Bangladesh. The current scenario of sustainable procurement practice in the public sector has been studied through interviews with mid level procurement professionals from Public Works Department (PWD) addressing three aspects of sustainability. The analyses indicate that although there are a few cases where some sustainability issues are in practice, these are not very common as a whole in the public sector. Existing tendering system in public sector in Bangladesh is still based on the lowest price approach and whole life costing approach is rarely considered. Hardly any procuring entity has any provision as such an environmental management system. The study indicates that at present there is virtually no mechanism in our public procurement system to check the environmental performance of contractors/ suppliers. Sustainability criteria should be embedded in the tendering system. Knowledge and awareness at the individual procurement professional level seem important in order to make suitable sustainable procurement choices. The study reveals that the respondents are lacking in such knowledge and they are not trained enough. A clear commitment is necessary from the very top of government and down through the ministries and authorities formulating a sustainable procurement policy and to align the public procurement framework with the policy. Awareness campaign should be arranged focusing on how to take account of nonmonetary benefits of sustainable procurement. Finally, there is scope to further study about the sustainability issues in procurement. Advanced research needs to be conducted in order to get a deeper insight into the sustainability issue in relation to the public procurement. Mohammad Abul Kalam AzadM.

40|$|Text in AfrikaansThe study investigates {{legal and}} {{administrative}} {{aspects of the}} interaction between public sector and private enterprise effected by state procurement of goods and services. South African government contracts are, despite their elaborate regulation by statutory and administrative prescription, regarded as {{the subject matter of the}} private law of contract. In this regard, they may be distinguished from the contrats administratif of the French and related legal systems and resemble their British and, more closely, federal American counterparts. Important aspects of government procurement, notably the contractual capacity of organs of the state, those administrative procedures which precede the conclusion of agreements with contractors, and the right reserved to the state to rescind, in the public interest, a contract duly entered into, are nevertheless to be determined by the principles of administrative law. The budgeting, audit and parliamentary control of procurement expenditure, along with the invitation of suppliers' bids and the award of contracts, are the principal administrative aspects of the study and are analysed in Chapters III and IV. The pricing of government contracts in South Africa is, with scant exception, determined by competitive tender. Restrictive trade practices and bid preferences awarded by <b>procuring</b> <b>agencies</b> in the pursuit of socio-economic policies were found, in Chapter V, to impede the operation of free market forces. The law of contract features most prominently in the performance of contracts and is examined in Chapter VI. The discussion, depicting the essential provisions of six standard form contracts commonly employed by government for stores and works, is fairly concise. References to British and American procurement law and practice, a consistent feature of the study, are, however, extensive. In South Africa, the settlement of procurement disputes is generally entrusted to the ordillary courts. Chapter VII deals with a number of special remedies accorded to the state, procedural prerequisites for the institution of civil actions against the state, and alternatives to litigation, especially arbitration and administrative appeal. The final chapters survey the efficacy of procurement as an instrument of socio-economic policy, and advance a few recommendations regarding the proper law and more efficient administration of government procurement.

40|$|Focusing on {{four key}} {{infrastructure}} areas {{integral to the}} functioning of cities – energy, transport, water and waste, this report provides governments with a clear action agenda for realising productivity and liveability gains, and meeting sustainability outcomes. Executive summaryBy any measure, Australia’s cities are facing significant infrastructure challenges, with considerable flow-on impacts for their productivity, liveability and sustainability. The cost of these impacts extend well beyond city boundaries; after all, Australia’s major cities employ 70 per cent of the national workforce and contribute close to 80 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As well as contributing to a relative decline in national productivity, capacity shortfalls in Australia’s major cities are impacting our global competitiveness. In the past decade, Australia has fallen from the fifth most competitive {{economy in the world}} to the twentieth, with infrastructure constraints cited by the World Economic Forum as a key motivator for Australia’s relative decline. Real improvements in the functioning of Australia’s major cities will require greater clarity of responsibilities and required actions, as well as greater transparency of performance over time. Tasking the Productivity Commission with the development of tangible performance benchmarks for cities at both a sector (i. e. transport, water, electricity, waste) and city-wide (i. e. liveability, sustainability) level is a critical first step to achieving these goals. Aside from ensuring a robust and transparent assessment of performance, this would place Australia’s cities firmly at the centre of the drive for national productivity growth. Solutions also lie with smarter, more integrated and more efficient approaches to the way infrastructure is conceived, funded and regulated. The seamless integration of land-use and infrastructure planning will be fundamental in ensuring that Australia brings forward the right projects, in the right places – and delivers them at the right time. Greater integration will also provide for Treasuries and central agencies to better play facilitative roles, ensuring that project requirements are linked to budget processes. This will give <b>procuring</b> <b>agencies,</b> business and the community a higher degree of transparency about how, where and when particular projects will be delivered. This report is principally focused on Australia’s major capital cities; however it also provides important learnings for Australia’s smaller but fast growing regional centres, which are increasingly competing against the established urban centres as places to live and do business...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on a {{research}} thesis that explores how Australian state government <b>agencies</b> <b>procure</b> infrastructure projects and the extent to which they view the procurement process as an opportunity to deliver more than just a physical facility. The primary {{purpose of this}} study was to understand the practice of construction project procurement by project managers on behalf of Australian state government agencies and to explore the creation of public value through procurement. Design/methodology/approach - This thesis presents results drawn from ten case studies of state government organisations that procure infrastructure; either roads or buildings. A total of 37 highly experienced project managers operationally responsible for the procurement of infrastructure within these organisations were interviewed. Findings - The findings show that there is considerable scope for improving infrastructure procurement by Australian state governments and that broader public value creation approaches in the form of policy by-products are either not considered or inconsistently pursued. Practical implications - The broader policy implications flowing from the research findings provide valuable commentary that inform the practice of infrastructure procurement and point to areas to which improvement efforts may be directed. These areas include the challenge of developing the next generation of infrastructure procurement managers, applying non-price criteria in a rigorous way, using prequalification registers to engage in supplier development and delivering policy by-products as part of standard procurement approaches. Originality/value - This thesis presents qualitative data focused on the perspective of procurement professionals, a group who have, hitherto, been somewhat underrepresented in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The Nevada {{procurement}} {{laws for}} public agencies generally require open, competitive bidding for any item that exceeds 10, 000. Public agencies are also required {{to accept the}} lowest 2 ̆ 2 responsive 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 responsible 2 ̆ 2 bid. A 2 ̆ 2 responsive bid is one which has addressed all {{the requirements of the}} bid documents. All forms must be properly completed and signed. A 2 ̆ 2 responsible 2 ̆ 2 bid is one in which the bidder proves the ability to perform the contract and has the resources to fulfill all the requirements of the contract. If a bidder fails to comply with all of the requirements in the contract documents, then the agency can disallow the bid. This procedure is generally quite adequate for many routine and common commodities such as roads, buildings, pipelines, etc. The products and the raw materials used to construct these objects are very common, readily available and many businesses can provide the services to implement the desired result in a consistent manner. However, as more specialized products and/or services are required by public agencies, the task to procure and implement the intended results becomes more difficult. The materials and/or the labor expertise required for such products may be very scarce or quite unique. Fewer businesses are able to provide these unique products and services, and also compete in a highly specialized or technical market. Businesses may have different means and methods to reach the same end goal. Thus, the final solution could vary greatly depending on the business involved. This can be particularly true with highly technical items, such as computer hardware and software used in very specialized and technical applications such as computer based process control systems. How do public <b>agencies</b> <b>procure</b> control systems today? Is the current procurement method adequate in providing these specialized products and services through an open competitive market. Is there a better way? Are there alternatives to competitive bidding? This case study will examine three Nevada public agencies that used an alternative approach and found success in its application. It will explain computer systems in general and control systems specifically. It will finally offer a rationale for seeking alternatives to open competitive bidding. Although a general conclusion can not be reached, public agencies could benefit from the use of the software exemption clause in the Nevada bidding laws...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} India's domestic support policies {{to understand their}} classification and measurement {{for the purposes of}} official World Trade Organization (WTO) notifications. We then employed the underlying methods to prepare shadow notifications of India's domestic support for 1998 - 2005. Following that, we explored alternative support-definition scenarios and their possible effects on shadow notifications. Preliminary support estimates for 2006 - 2007 and a projection for 2015 are also provided with a discussion on how the latest WTO (2008) draft modalities are likely to impact India's domestic support. India's official notifications began in 1995 with green box support of nearly US$ 2 billion and limited use of special and differential treatment. The product-specific aggregate measure of support (AMS) was negative because external reference prices were larger than minimum support prices. Nonproduct-specific AMS, by way of fertilizer, electricity, irrigation, credit, and seed subsidies, accounted for about 7 percent of the value of agricultural production in 1995. In subsequent notifications, for 1996 and 1997, several key changes were observed. The first was the transfer of 80 percent of fertilizer, irrigation, and electricity subsidies from nonproduct-specific AMS to special and differential treatment of low-income and resource-poor farmers. Product-specific AMS remained negative, but the value of production was replaced by eligible production, which was set equal to quantities <b>procured</b> by public <b>agencies</b> in 1996 and 1997. Shadow notifications, based on our understanding of the underlying methods, showed that green box support had grown to nearly US$ 8. 0 billion in 2005. Estimates of input subsidies to low-income and resource-poor producers declined between 1998 and 2002, but they amounted to about US$ 4. 5 billion or 4 percent of the value of agricultural production in 2005. Product-specific AMS remained negative through 2005 mostly because of the wide gap between external reference prices and minimum support prices. Nonproduct-specific AMS accounted for about 1 percent of the annual value of agricultural production for 1998 - 2005. Alternative support-definition and measurement scenarios showed a possible increase in product-specific AMS. However, reallocating input subsidies from special and differential treatment to nonproduct-specific AMS would only eliminate some of the slack in the latter's de minimis exemption. With India's general elections expected in early 2009, the immediate future includes popular policies such as credit subsidies and significant growth in minimum support prices. Nevertheless, non-product-specific AMS would not likely exceed the limits proposed in the Doha Round (that is, 10 percent of value of production) even with popular policies. However, product-specific AMS would turn positive, especially in cereals, with high growth in support prices and the appreciation of Rupee as seen in recent years. Projections for 2015 suggest that de minimis exemptions would be about US$ 16 billion each for product-specific and non-product-specific AMS, giving India ample flexibility in domestic support policies.

40|$|When {{considering}} public transit, travelers typically {{judge whether}} it serves desired destinations {{in a timely}} manner and at a reasonable cost – often in comparison to traveling by private vehicle. How public transit agencies choose to operate their services – their networks, service frequency, and fare structures – to compete with private vehicles and provide mobility for those without them {{is the subject of this}} synthesis. Specifically, we examine the "make" or "buy" decision in public transit: Should government agencies operate (make) transit service directly, or does it save money to contract with private firms (buy) to operate transit service? The latter option is often called "contracting out" or, less accurately, "privatization. " Whether to make or buy transit service has fueled highly charged political debates that frequently cleave along partisan lines. Liberals often favor direct public provision of government services, and fear that contracting with private firms for service usually hurts labor. Conservatives tend to favor competitive procurement of goods and services, and assert that contracting for transit service is almost always more efficient than direct government provision. However, the issues at stake are far more subtle and complex than these competing perspectives, which are often offered in black and white at public meetings and depicted simplistically by the media. In this synthesis we aim to bring both nuance and rigor to bear on what can be noisy ideological debates over the costs and benefits of contracting out for transit service. It summarizes a series of recent studies conducted by researchers at the University of California. Our focus is on bus transit, which carries more passengers than any other transit mode (subway, trolley, van, etc.), operates on fixed routes and schedules and in mixed traffic on local streets and freeways. In the United States, the term "contracting out" is generally used when a public transit <b>agency</b> <b>procures</b> the services of a private firm through a competitive bid process. The contracted service may be for a portion of the system, such as a bus route, or systemwide. The transit agency typically maintains ownership of the service and authority over setting policies, such as fares and schedules. This system contrasts with full privatization efforts, such as those in the United Kingdom, where private firms own and operate public transit service (Iseki, 2004, 3 - 8). Private contracting also is used for transit maintenance and transportation infrastructure provision (mainly road and rail construction and street maintenance). Similar to transit service contracting, private infrastructure provision has generated controversy and debate over perceived benefits and challenges. Parts 1 and 2 of this synthesis present background on public transit provision over time, with a focus on today’s context. Part 3 analyzes and interprets key findings from a series of University of California studies of transit contracting. Part 4 considers the reasons contracting for transit operations has been chosen in practice as well as its effects on the traveling public, transit operators, and transit workers. Part 5 offers general guidelines for situations in which contracting has proven most promising and when it is less useful. Finally, Part 6 concludes with a recommended action plan for the State of California. Parts 1 and 2 present background on public transit provision over time, then focus on today’s context. Part 3 analyzes and interprets key findings from University of California studies of transit contracting. Part 4 considers the reasons that contracting out has been adopted and evaluates its effects on the traveling public, transit operators, and transit workers. Part 5 offers general guidelines for situations in which contracting has proven most promising and when it is less useful.

40|$|MPharm (Pharmacy Practice), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 In a well-functioning {{medicine}} {{supply chain}} management system, procurement forms an integral part {{that needs to be}} closely monitored and integrated with other functions. Good procurement practices in the public health sector ensure that good quality efficacious medicines are distributed in the country in the right quantities and at reasonable costs. Pharmaceutical procurement is a major determinant of drug availability and total health costs. It is indicated that medicine expenditure represents the single largest expenditure after salaries and accounts for approximately 20 to 40 % of the total healthcare budget, and up to 90 % of household budgets in the Sub-Saharan region (MSH, 2012 : 1). Moreover, effective and efficient public sector procurement systems are essential for the achievement of millennium development goals and the promotion of sustainable development (WHO, 2011 : 2). The general aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the current status of procurement and {{supply chain management}} systems in the public healthcare hospitals in Lesotho. The study set out to understand the policies, guidelines and practices governing medicine procurement in the public hospitals in Lesotho, and also to outline the impact of procurement activities on the overall operation and effectiveness of the healthcare services. A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted, focusing on all levels of medicine procurement and supply management systems in all public hospitals in Lesotho. The study period stretched over nine months, from January 2014 to September 2014. The study population was inclusive of 17 public healthcare hospitals in the country and the central medical store (CMS). The findings revealed that all hospitals studied (n= 17) perform the functions of selection, procurement, quantification, ordering, inventory management, distribution as well as utilisation. Although an essential medicine list (EML) and standard treatment guidelines (STGs) are available for use, public hospitals do not adhere to the use of EML and STGs for medicine procurement (n= 17). Therefore, procurement is not limited to medicines on the EML, it is based on the intensity of healthcare services provided, and public hospitals often request medicines that do not occur on the EML, but are necessary to address the different diseases and public health priorities in respective facilities. According to the Ministry of Health, all public facilities are mandated to procure medicines from the CMS. Public hospitals use their allocated funds for medicine to buy from the CMS, which will, in turn, procure medicines on behalf of the government and distribute to the hospitals as per request, since procurement is pooled at a central level (MOH, 2011 : 62). However, it was observed that only government facilities (n= 11) procure medicines from the CMS only. Facilities that are owned by the Christian health association of Lesotho (CHAL) procure medicines from other places concurrently (n= 6). Moreover, CHAL hospitals (n= 6) indicated that they are not fully mandated to procure medicines only from the CMS; they can also <b>procure</b> from other <b>agencies</b> based on stock-outs at the CMS, price differences and urgency of obtaining the medicines required. Therefore, procurement practices at government and CHAL hospitals are not similar. The total expenditure on medicines for government hospitals was 7 088 754. 50 Maloti and 121 338 713. 05 Maloti in the years 2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012, respectively. The total expenditure for CHAL hospitals was 2 520 590 Maloti and 3 577 360 Maloti in 2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012, respectively. According to the findings, variance of budget and expenditure for government hospitals were 15 623 446. 50 Maloti in 2010 / 2011 and 9 490 341. 22 Maloti in 2011 / 2012. Variance of the budget and expenditure for CHAL Hospitals were 912 570 million Maloti in 2010 / 2011 and 922 640 million Maloti in 2011 / 2012. Most hospitals showed a variance of above 50 % in 2010 / 2011. However, in 2011 / 2012, a shift pattern was observed indicating an improvement in the utilisation of funds allocated. This shift pattern may indicate a possible improvement in procurement practices, including the quantification and budgeting and commitment to procurement plans. Pharmaceutical management systems require sound policies and a legal framework that will provide a solid foundation for the systems. It is equally important that these policies and regulations are periodically updated to ensure that they address the current health situation in the country and are in line with international standards (MSH, 2012 : 4). However, some documents are very outdated, and therefore they do not reflect the current health situation in the country as well as procurement trends internationally, and these include national medicine policy, EML and STGs. In conclusion, the medicine procurement system in public hospitals should be strengthened and should incorporate continuous supportive supervision in order to facilitate and encourage adherence to good procurement practices, and therefore the constant availability of good quality, cost-effective essential medicines in the country.
