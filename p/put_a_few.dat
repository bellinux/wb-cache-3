5|$|Angkor Wat {{required}} considerable restoration in the 20th century, {{mainly the}} removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Khmer Rouge {{control of the country}} during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, a pavilion was ruined by a stray American shell, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by art thieves working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.|$|E
25|$|The Invincibles {{performed}} this haka {{during their}} unbeaten 1924–1925 tour. It was written during their voyage to England by Wiremu Rangi of Gisborne, and polished up by Judge Acheson of the Native Land Court. It had two verses, {{but the second}} verse (<b>Put</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of your famous teams on display, and let's play each other in friendship) was omitted in later matches.|$|E
25|$|After having {{completed}} substantial improvements {{over the}} second half of the 1990s and during the 2000s, which <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> regions on the brink of full employment, Spain suffered a severe setback in October 2008, when it saw its unemployment rate surging to 1996 levels. Between October 2007 and October 2008, Spain had its unemployment rate climb 36%, exceeding by far the unemployment surge of past economic crises like 1993. In particular, in October 2008, Spain suffered its worst unemployment rise ever recorded and, the country has suffered Europe's biggest unemployment crisis during the 2008 crisis.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk about our work and watch the cricket. And {{we can try to}} <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E
2500|$|An {{influential}} {{poet and}} person in Kenney's life, Merrill reviews and gets the audience ready for The Evolution of the Flightless Bird. Not containing much summary {{due to the}} article's purpose, the foreword does, however, <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> scenes into layman's terms. Other than that, this serves as a very well-written review.|$|E
2500|$|Hippies {{tended to}} travel light, and {{could pick up}} and go {{wherever}} the action was at any time. Whether at a [...] "love-in" [...] on Mount Tamalpais near San Francisco, a demonstration against the Vietnam War in Berkeley, or one of Ken Kesey's [...] "Acid Tests", if the [...] "vibe" [...] wasn't right and a change of scene was desired, hippies were mobile at a moment's notice. Planning was eschewed, as hippies were happy to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> clothes in a backpack, stick out their thumbs and hitchhike anywhere. Hippies seldom worried whether they had money, hotel reservations {{or any of the}} other standard accoutrements of travel. Hippie households welcomed overnight guests on an impromptu basis, and the reciprocal nature of the lifestyle permitted greater freedom of movement. People generally cooperated to meet each other's needs in ways that became less common after the early 1970s. This way of life is still seen among Rainbow Family groups, new age travellers and New Zealand's housetruckers.|$|E
6000|$|A shadow crossed Sherikov's face. [...] "I'd {{rather not}} bother the workmen right now, Commissioner. They've been under a great load, trying to {{complete}} the turret in time. I believe they're <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> last finishes on it at this moment." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lavender - Either {{bags with}} dried {{lavender}} flowers {{are put into}} the wardrobe (they can be refreshed by <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drops of lavender oil on them), or <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drops of lavender oil are <b>put</b> on <b>a</b> piece of fabric which is then deposited in the wardrobe and periodically refreshed. Disadvantage: strong [...] "perfumed" [...] smell.|$|R
50|$|A {{penetrating}} sealant {{will maintain}} the natural {{look of the}} tile. You should periodically test the seal by <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drops {{of water on the}} tile in various places. If the water is absorbed, then another coat of sealant should be applied.|$|R

50|$|An urban legend {{suggests}} that tetrahydrozoline can cause violent diarrhea if administered orally, such as by <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drops of Visine in an unsuspecting person's beverage. However, the actual {{results of the}} prank may be worse, varying from severe nausea and vomiting to seizures or a coma. Diarrhea is not a side effect.|$|R
