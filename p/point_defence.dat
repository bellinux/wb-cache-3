5|$|It {{was also}} {{alleged to have}} {{developed}} 'a terrifying reputation for killing its crew' when finally issued in 1942, following production difficulties. When it was issued (mainly to Home Guard units and those units in the regular Army tasked with <b>point</b> <b>defence,</b> such as guarding airfields, ammunition shortages meant that on average these units only had six or seven modified mortar rounds per gun. Despite these limitations many Home Guard units developed an attachment to the weapon, some later claiming it was 'one of the best pieces of equipment ever issued to the force'.|$|E
25|$|The cruiser's initial {{armament}} {{consisted of}} eight BL 8 inch Mk VIII naval guns in four twin turrets, four single QF 4 inch Mk V naval guns and four single QF 2 pounder naval guns (or pom-poms) for anti-aircraft defence, four 3-pounder guns, {{and a number}} of smaller calibre guns for <b>point</b> <b>defence.</b> During the 1930s, two 0.5-inch machine guns were added to the <b>point</b> <b>defence</b> armament.|$|E

5000|$|The Jerbourg <b>Point</b> <b>defences</b> resembled an Iron Age fort, it {{comprises}} {{a series of}} ditches and banks across {{the neck of the}} headland, providing a short defensive wall behind which the people could retreat in times of danger. Dating from 2,000 B.C. the Jerbourg defence of three ditches was improved, firstly with stone reinforcing and later with wooden platforms, palisades and a tower, however it fell to French invaders in 1338.|$|R

5000|$|The {{second stage}} began in 1936, when the Poles {{completed}} the <b>point</b> of <b>defence</b> in Bobrowniki, together with barracks.

In 1936 the strongest <b>point</b> of <b>defence</b> was located in the settlement of Lagiewniki. It was connected with additional, smaller points - Kamień, Brzeziny and Maciejowice, which created a continuous line of defence.|$|R

25|$|The 16th Air Land Regiment is the Australian Army's only {{ground-based}} {{air defence}} unit.

Prior to being equipped with the currently in-service RBS-70 surface-to-air missile system, the regiment was equipped with the Rapier systems for 25 years. The regiment is based at Woodside, South Australia, but frequently deploys with other Australian and allied units on operations and defence exercises. It is part of 6th Brigade.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, another {{renovation}} {{was taken by}} the Royal Malaysian Navy. Four Laksamana class corvettes were purchased from Italy. These compact ships were originally built for Iraq, but were not delivered due to international sanctions put in place against Iraq. A prominent addition to the fleet were two Lekiu class frigates. Based on the YARROW F2000 design, the two 2,300-ton frigates are armed with Exocet MM40 II SSM and the Sea Wolf VLS <b>point</b> <b>defence</b> SAM system with accommodation for one Westland Super Lynx helicopter. Complementing the two Lekiu frigates are two German-built Kasturi class corvettes which were delivered in the early 1980s. These vessels, together with two Mahamiru (Lerici) class minehunters, had been scheduled to receive the Service Life Extension Programme (SLEP).|$|E
500|$|The first hull {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Baltiysky Zavod in Leningrad in March 1974 under the name Kirov. By the time the ship was {{launched}} in December 1977, she had been reclassified as a [...] "heavy nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser" [...] (тяжёлый атомный ракетный крейсер; tyazholyy atomnyy raketnyy kreyser), with its primary armament being 20 SS-N-19 Shipwreck (P-700 Granit) anti-ship missiles. Commissioned into the Northern Fleet, [...] was the largest surface warship, excluding aircraft carriers and amphibious assault vessels, built {{since the end of}} the Second World War. Equipped with both anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles, as well as area defence and <b>point</b> <b>defence</b> surface to air missiles, torpedoes and a pair of 100 mm guns, the ship gave the Soviet Union a visible platform for power projection in the immediate absence of large aircraft carriers. Following the appearance of Kirov, two more units, [...] and , were commissioned at four-year intervals. When Frunze was commissioned in 1984, it was seen to have a different weapons fit to Kirov, with the pair of single 100mm guns swapped for a twin 130mm turret, and the SS-N-14 Silex ASW missile system deleted in favour of adding eight SA-N-9 Gauntlet SAM launchers. In the event, none of the four ships of the class received a completely identical armament fit.|$|E

The body {{is covered in}} long spines up to 5 cm in length, interspersed with thicker, sharply <b>pointed,</b> <b>defence</b> quills up to 3 cm long, and with bristly, blackish or brownish fur. The spines on the tail are hollow, and {{used to make a}} rattling sound to scare away predators. An erectile crest of long, bristly hairs runs {{from the top of the}} head down to the shoulders. The spines and quills cover the back and flanks of the animal, starting about a third of the way down the body, and continuing onto the tail. The quills have multiple bands of black and white along their length, and grow from regularly spaced grooves along the animal's body; each groove holding five to eight quills. The remainder of the animal, including the undersides, is covered with dark hair.|$|R
50|$|The {{class are}} {{currently}} going through mid-life refits which last 12-18 months and cost £15-20m. Aside from refurbishment {{of the mess}} decks and drive train, the ships are being fitted with a transom flap which {{can add up to}} 1 knot to the top speed and reduce fuel consumption by 13%, and Intersleek anti-fouling paint which added 2 knots to the top speed of Ark Royal. Although the top speed of the Duke class is commonly quoted as 28 knots, the caption of an official Navy photo suggests that Lancaster was capable of 32 knots even before her mid-life refit. The Sea Wolf Mid Life Update (SWMLU) improves the sensors and guidance of the missiles, <b>point</b> <b>defences</b> are further improved with new remotely operated 30mm guns, and Mod 1 of the Mk8 main gun has an all-electric loading system and a smaller radar cross-section. The communications and command systems are also upgraded.|$|R
