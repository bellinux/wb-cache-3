Migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years.

30|$|Drawing {{consistent}} inferences with schooling data drawn {{these two}} ways is in principle quite simple {{if the two}} types of questions have a similar structure of measurement error. Unfortunately, for the 1990 Census, Black et al. (2003) document that the education questions exhibit significant measurement error and that the degree of measurement error is correlated with race. Moreover, there was a dramatic increase in the educational attainment of Americans over the period. For instance, in 1940 88 <b>percent</b> of <b>blacks</b> and 64 <b>percent</b> of whites between the ages of 25 and 60 did not have a high school education, and only 2 <b>percent</b> of <b>blacks</b> and 8 <b>percent</b> of whites had a bachelor’s degree or better.

According to a 2006 survey by USA Today, the university's flagship campus, University Park, has the highest in-state tuition rates among comparable institutions nationwide. While a task force formed in 2001 to study options for tuition projections determined that the university's operating efficiency is {{among the highest in}} postsecondary education, it found that tuition increases at Penn State still consistently outpaced increases at other Big Ten Conference institutions. Student leaders of The Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG) have led annual rallies to support lower rate hikes at each of the nineteen commonwealth campuses and at the Pennsylvania state capitol in Harrisburg. In 2005, the board of trustees proposed a tuition freeze at the commonwealth campus locations as part of its state appropriation request.|$|E
