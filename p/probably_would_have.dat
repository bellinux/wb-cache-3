5|$|If {{traditional}} Hunanese customs were adhered to, the baby's {{head would}} have been shaved after four weeks, with a small tuft of hair left on the crown and {{at the nape of}} the neck; it was at this point that the child {{would have been}} officially given its name. According to tradition, visitors <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gathered for this ceremony, bringing gifts of money, pork, fish, fruit, and decorated eggs.|$|E
5|$|Thomas F. Wilson {{was cast}} as Biff Tannen because the {{producers}} {{felt that the}} original choice, J. J. Cohen, wasn't physically imposing enough to bully Stoltz. Cohen was recast as Skinhead, one of Biff's cohorts. Had Fox been cast from the beginning, Cohen <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won the part because he was sufficiently taller than Fox.|$|E
5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> risen.|$|E

5|$|If {{you guys}} think I'm a diva and I have {{requirements}}, Snoop is the next level. He's the hip-hop king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
5|$|The large armlet of pierced gold (opus interrasile) showed {{traces of}} {{hematite}} {{on the reverse}} side, which <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been used as a}} type of jeweller's rouge. This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery. Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the mercury gilding technique. The black inlay on the cast silver tigress shows the niello technique, but with silver sulphide rather than lead sulphide. The settings of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set, and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{began playing}} with the Melbourne Cricket Club in the 1890–91 season. He played two premiership matches early in the season, against Port Melbourne and Richmond, but scored only 13 runs in two innings and was not called upon to bowl. He did not play in another senior premiership game until the next season. In a match against Wesley College in March 1891, he played a high quality innings, scoring 121 runs. Several weeks later, while playing for MCC's seconds against South Melbourne's seconds, he took 13 wickets for 61 runs. The Tasmanian noted that it was pity he had not played that well earlier in the season, or he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> secured a {{permanent}} place in the first XI.|$|E
50|$|Lolita {{polarized}} contemporary critics, but is well-received today. Kubrick later commented, however, {{that if he}} {{had realized}} how severe the censorship limitations were going to be, he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> made the film.|$|R
60|$|As {{the night}} was dark Everingham could see nothing of His Eminence's {{expression}} of face. If he <b>had,</b> he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> only <b>have</b> seen the same mask of polite blandness which the Cardinal usually wore.|$|R
50|$|Indonesia has {{various other}} spots in other islands (like Lakey Peak or G-Land) which attract {{tourists}} only for surfing. Surfing has therefore developed a touristic activity in places which <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> attracted people otherwise.|$|R
5|$|Prior to 1758, the French and Indian War {{had gone}} very poorly for the British, whose {{military}} met few of its objectives. Following {{a string of}} French victories in 1757 in North America, coupled with military setbacks in Europe, William Pitt gained full control of the direction of British military efforts in the Seven Years' War. Embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in Europe, where France was strong, and offense in North America, where France was weak, he resolved to attack New France (the colonial holdings of France in North America) in three strategic campaigns. Large-scale campaigns were planned to capture Fort Duquesne on the Pennsylvania frontier and the fortress at Louisbourg (on Île-Royale, now known as Cape Breton Island). The third campaign, assigned to General James Abercrombie, was to launch an attack against Canada through the Champlain Valley. Pitt <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> preferred to have George Howe, a skilled tactician and a dynamic leader, lead this expedition, but seniority and political considerations led him to appoint the relatively undistinguished Abercrombie instead. Howe was appointed a brigadier general, and placed as Abercrombie's second in command.|$|E
5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E

50|$|This school brings closer {{access and}} better {{long-term}} educational facilities to over 400 {{of the most}} vulnerable rural youngsters, many of whom without this school, <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> this opportunity to attain any education at all.|$|R
50|$|Since the Quattrocento {{overlaps}} {{with part of}} the Renaissance movement, it would be inaccurate {{to say that a}} particular artist was Quattrocento or Renaissance. Artists of the time <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> identified themselves as members of a movement.|$|R
25|$|Critic A. Leroy Moore contends Adventists {{reject the}} {{orthodox}} view, and {{contends that the}} view <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been branded as Arian by the orthodox.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, {{revenues}} were dropping {{due to increased}} competition from the automobile and the line <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been gone for good, except for the intervention of World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Second World War {{was from}} 1939 to 1945, {{so most of}} the {{importance}} has dropped. There <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been an increase in wagon sheet production. It is thought that there is also damage again on the water tower {{at the back of the}} site.|$|E
5000|$|Sergei Rachmaninoff also {{composed}} a symphonic poem, Isle of the Dead, Op. 29 (1909), {{inspired by a}} black-and-white print of the painting. He said that had he seen the colour original, he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> written the music.|$|R

25|$|The battle {{flag was}} never {{adopted by the}} Confederate Congress, never flew over any state capitols during the Confederacy, and was never officially used by Confederate veterans' groups. The flag <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been relegated to Civil War museums {{if it had not}} been resurrected by the resurgent KKK and used by Southern Dixiecrats during the 1948 presidential election.|$|E
25|$|The {{specimen}} {{has advanced}} ossification and growth rings in the fibula that indicate {{it was likely}} eleven years of age when it died. It appears to have reached an early young adult stage at age seven, and <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> grown much larger when it reached the adult stage. This indicates a growth rate that is faster than in most large non-avian theropods.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Muller— {{the film}} editor for The Trial, Chimes at Midnight and the CBS Special Orson Bag was {{fortunate}} to work on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version— was asked for his opinion in 2013 from a journalist of Time Out, his reply was he felt that if released without image re-editing, but {{with the addition of}} ad hoc sound and music, it <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been rather successful.|$|E
60|$|The trap {{was placed}} upon a small stone {{by the side}} of a larger one. It was in a very snug and {{sheltered}} place, almost out of view. In fact it <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been observed by any ordinary passer-by.|$|R
50|$|<b>Probably</b> Marx <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{acknowledged}} that, but he <b>would</b> presumably <b>have</b> {{argued that}} ultimately, the dissynchrony or distortion between {{production and distribution}} would cause a crisis and then a readjustment of distribution to the real structure of production relations.|$|R
25|$|Although not {{released}} until 1992 due to legal complications, development of 386BSD, from which NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux. Torvalds has {{also stated that}} if 386BSD had been available at the time, he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> created Linux.|$|R
25|$|With the Islamic power centres of Baghdad and Damascus gone, Cairo, {{under the}} Mamluks, became {{the centre of}} Islamic power. The Mongols <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{continued}} their advance on through Palestine towards Egypt, {{but they had to}} stop their invasion because of an internal conflict in Turkestan. Hulagu departed with the bulk of his forces, leaving only about 10,000 Mongol horsemen in Syria under his Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa, to occupy the conquered territory.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the London Underground system {{during the}} war was {{considered}} one of the safest means of protecting relatively many people in a high-density area of the capital. An estimated 170,000 people sheltered in the tunnels and stations during World War II. Although not a great number in comparison to the total number of the inhabitants of the capital, it almost certainly saved many lives of the people who <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to find alternative, less secure means of protection.|$|E
25|$|I saw Owen and {{the other}} two players put their head in their hands and fired {{thinking}} it would perhaps do as a dejection pic. To be honest, had it happened earlier in the game when I had more time and things were less frantic, I <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> deleted it as you couldn't make out the faces on the crowd {{on the back of the}} camera, and it was only when I pulled it up on the laptop later that I realised what I had.|$|E
50|$|Duns {{are similar}} to brochs, but are smaller and <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been capable of {{supporting}} a very tall structure. Good examples {{of this kind of}} dun {{can be found in the}} Outer Hebrides of Scotland, on artificial islands in small lakes.|$|R
5000|$|United States Senator Dianne Feinstein {{and other}} leaders {{threatened}} an attempt to prevent the team from using [...] "San Francisco" [...] or the [...] "49ers" [...] in the team name, but <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> succeeded without changes to state or federal law.|$|R
5000|$|On Youre Fired, {{there was}} general {{disagreement}} with Sir Alans decision, with the consensus amongst the panel being that James {{should have been}} fired, and that even firing Ben <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been more justifiable than firing Majid.
