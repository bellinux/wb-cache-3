5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1960s, the carrier <b>provided</b> <b>some</b> initial {{aviation}} support to the Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission in its operation to acquire topographic maps of Ethiopia. The firm changed from a corporation to a share company in 1965, and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines. By 1966, the contractual relationship with TWA was adjusted to reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an Ethiopian deputy general manager. Two Boeing 720s were in operation and a Boeing 707-320C was due to be phased in by , when the carrier ordered a second -320C.|$|E

Under Alfonsin, negotiations started on a new programme with the IMF, but they led to nothing. In March 1984, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela lent Argentina $300 million for three months, followed by a similar amount by the United State. That <b>provided</b> <b>some</b> breathing space as it was not before late September 1984 that an agreement was reached between the IMF and Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 12th century, Angkor Wat {{gradually}} {{transformed from}} a Hindu centre of worship to Buddhism, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was somewhat neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned, its preservation being {{due in part to the}} fact that its moat also <b>provided</b> <b>some</b> protection from encroachment by the jungle.|$|E

5|$|Working {{domestic}} animals including cattle, horses, yaks, camels, and elephants {{have been used}} for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still <b>provided</b> <b>some</b> 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Commonwealth, several new types of military units were introduced. First among these were the registered Cossacks, formed in 1578. These were the troops made up of Cossacks, paid for their service and not subject to serfdom. Their numbers varied from about 500 to many times that number, with the Treaty of Zboriv setting the record at 40,477. The Cossacks' refusal to submit to serfdom, and the Commonwealth's nobility attempts to force them into it led to much political wrangling with regard {{to the size of the}} Cossack register, and to numerous Cossack uprisings, particularly in the 17th century. These weakened the state, and eventually led to the Cossack subjugation and destruction by the Russian Empire. In addition to the Cossack formations, another group that provided notable service to the Polish state were the Tatars, some of whom resided in Lithuania, and were Commonwealth subjects. Known as Lipka Tatars, they <b>provided</b> <b>some</b> light and medium cavalry units for the Lithuanian army.|$|E
5|$|As of January 2015, Valve {{themselves}} had <b>provided</b> <b>some</b> user-developed Workshop content as paid-for features in Valve-developed games, including Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2; with over $57 million {{being paid to}} content creators using the Workshop. Valve began allowing developers to use these advanced features in January 2015; both the developer and content generator share the profits of the sale of these items; the feature went live in April 2015, starting with various mods for Skyrim. This feature was pulled a few days afterward following negative user feedback and reports of pricing and copyright misuse. Six months later, Valve stated they were still interested in offering this type of functionality in the future, but would review the implementation to avoid these previous mistakes. In November 2015, the Steam client was updated with the ability for game developers to offer in-game items for direct sale via the store interface, with Rust being the first game to use the feature.|$|E
