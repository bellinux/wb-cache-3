40|$|The pre-weaning {{production}} of ewes and lambs in spring on <b>pastures</b> <b>grazed</b> {{during the previous}} autumn and early winter by either weaner sheep, adult sheep, or cattle was investigated together with estimating the benefits of pre- and post-lambing drenches to ewes. These treatments were compared with one in which parasitism was uncontrolled in ewes lambing on <b>pastures</b> <b>grazed</b> previously by untreated weaner sheep, and another where parasitism was suppressed by 2 -weekly drenching of the weaner sheep and also of the ewes and their lambs. Prior grazing by cattle effectively eliminated infection of pastures with intestinal Trichostrongylus and Nematodirus spp, but less so for Ostertagia spp. Worthwhile reductions in contamination were also achieved by grazing by adult sheep compared with grazing by undrenched weaners. Despite differences in the parasitological status of the pastures, there were no indications that pre-weaning growth rates of lambs were affected. However, wool growth in ewes was reduced by 10 to 20 % by parasite infection. Wool growth of ewes on <b>pastures</b> <b>grazed</b> by cattle during the pre-experimental period exceeded that on any other treatment, and was significantly {{greater than that of}} ewes on <b>pastures</b> <b>grazed</b> by undrenched weaners.

50|$|Unless factory farming, which entails in {{its most}} {{intensive}} form entirely trough-feeding, managed or unmanaged pasture is the main food source for ruminants. Pasture feeding dominates livestock farming where the land makes crop sowing and/or harvesting difficult, such as in arid or mountainous regions, where types of camel, goat, antelope, yak and other ruminants live which are well suited to the more hostile terrain and very rarely factory farmed. In more humid regions, <b>pasture</b> <b>grazing</b> is managed across a large global area for free range and organic farming. Certain types of pasture suit the diet, evolution and metabolism of particular animals, and their fertilising and tending of the land may over generations result in the pasture combined with the ruminants in question being integral to a particular ecosystem.|$|E
50|$|In Africa, wildebeests carry {{a lifelong}} {{infection}} of AlHV-1 {{but are not}} affected by the disease. The virus is passed from mother to offspring and shed mostly in the nasal secretions of wildebeest calves under one year old. Wildebeest associated MCF is transmitted from wildebeest to cattle normally following the wildebeest calving period. Cattle of all ages are susceptible to the disease, with a higher infection rate in adults, particularly in peripartuent females. Cattle are infected by contact with the secretions, but do not spread the disease to other cattle. Because no commercial treatment or vaccine is available for this disease, livestock management is the only method of control. This involves keeping cattle away from wildebeest during the critical calving period. This results in Massai pastoralists in Tanzania and Kenya being excluded from prime <b>pasture</b> <b>grazing</b> land during the wet season leading to a loss in productivity. In Eastern and Southern Africa MCF is classed {{as one of the}} five most important problems affecting pastoralists along with East coast fever, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, foot and mouth disease and anthrax.Hartebeests and topi also may carry the disease.

AS and SR had significant effects on pasture availability and composition and many AS SR interactions were detected. The <b>pastures</b> <b>grazed</b> by sheep had significantly reduced content and proportion of subterranean clover and more undesirable grasses {{compared with those}} grazed by goats. There were no differences in dry matter availabilities between goat- and sheep-grazed pastures at 7. 5 /ha, but at 10 and 12. 5 /ha goat pastures had significantly increased availabilities of green grass, dead and green clover and less weeds compared with sheep pastures. There was a significant AS SR interaction for the density of seedlings in May following pasture germination. Between July and January, the height of pastures was greater under goats than sheep but from January to March pasture height declined more on goat-grazed than on sheep-grazed pastures. There was an AS SR interaction for incidence of bare ground. Increasing the SR increased bare ground in <b>pastures</b> <b>grazed</b> by sheep but no change occurred on <b>pastures</b> <b>grazed</b> by goats. Changes in pasture characteristics due to increased SR were minimised on <b>pastures</b> <b>grazed</b> by goats but the grazing of sheep caused larger and faster changes and the pastures were damaged at the highest SR. Goats did not always select the same herbage material as sheep, changed their selection between seasons and were not less selective than sheep. Angora goats were flexible grazers and continually adapted their grazing behaviour to changing herbage conditions. Goat grazing led {{to an increase in}} subterranean clover, an accumulation of dead herbage {{at the base of the}} sward, reduced bare ground, taller pastures in spring and a more stable botanical composition. Mixed-grazed pasture characteristics were altered with SR. With careful management Angora goats on sheep farms may be used to manipulate pasture composition, to speed up establishment of subterranean clover, to decrease soil erosion and to reduce weed invasion...|$|R

This is study investigated how management strategies that varied amount and form of N input in a long-term experiment affected concentrations and stocks of total-soil organic C and N, particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), root and rhizome mass, C and N contents in topsoil of smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) pastures with silty clay loam soils in a wet (2010) and dry (2012) year. Management strategies included: (i) unfertilized <b>pasture</b> <b>grazed</b> with unsupplemented beef cattle (CONT); (ii) unfertilized <b>pasture</b> <b>grazed</b> with dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS) -supplemented beef cattle (SUPP); and (iii) nitrogen-fertilized <b>pasture</b> <b>grazed</b> with unsupplemented beef cattle (FERT). After 8 yr, management strategies had similar concentrations and stocks of total-soil organic C and N, POC, and PON, and there were no management strategy × year interactions. From 2010 to 2012, total-soil organic C and N, POC, and PON stocks increased as soils dried and soil bulk density increased. The CONT and SUPP management strategies had less root and rhizome mass (concentrations and stocks) and greater soil bulk density than FERT. These belowground responses were consistent with earlier research conducted at the site demonstrating greater herbage accumulation and litter deposition in FERT. Management strategies that vary amount and form of N inputs into pasture appear to have low potential to affect total-soil organic C and N concentrations in the short-term, but long-term effects of less root and rhizome contents remain unknown...|$|R

Potential live weight gains were calculated through metabolisable energy in feed and daily animal intakes using reference feed standards. The pre-mating average daily weight gains were 0. 59 kgLWT/day, 0. 53 kgLWT/day and 0. 49 kgLWT/day for the ad libitum fodder beet, restricted fodder beet and <b>pasture</b> <b>grazing</b> respectively. None of these diets meet mating live weight targets, however ad lib fodder beet was the closest at 1. 8 %. The weight gains between mating and calving on the ad libitum fodder beet diet and restricted fodder beet diet were 0. 59 kgLWT/day and 0. 53 kgLWT/day respectively, higher than 0. 49 kgLWT/day seen in the <b>pasture</b> <b>grazing</b> systems. The ad libitum fodder beet diet live weights were undesired at 29. 4 % above target, however the other systems meet target weights.

Heifer body weight and body condition score change during the winter were not markedly different between MP and CP supplemented heifers, but hay supplementation reduced body weight and condition score loss. Grazed forage intake was not affected by treatment, but intake declined from November through February. ^ Trial 3 was conducted to determine effects of supplementing pregnant heifers to meet MP or CP requirements on 2 -yr-old pregnancy and profitability. March calving heifers were supplemented from September to February at two locations across 2 yr. Supplementing to meet MP requirements improved pregnancy and profitability in three of four situations. ^ Grazing system affected fall diet nutrient content.

40|$|With {{the price}} of corn now over $ 6 per bushel, and with feedlot total cost per pound of gain now {{approaching}} $ 1. 00 per pound of gain there are new incentives to try and add weight to calves outside of feedlots. The question then arises of how to add weight to a calf in the most economical manner. There are many different feeding programs to consider. However, with few exceptions, the cheapest way to add weight outside of a feedlot usually involves the calf grazing {{for an extended period}} of time. Winter <b>pasture</b> <b>grazing,</b> wheat <b>pasture</b> <b>grazing</b> and corn stalk grazing followed by summer <b>pasture</b> <b>grazing</b> are examples of these programs. However, with the exception of California, most of the area west of the Great Plains lacks the resources and climate for most of these winter grazing programs. For those states, cattle producers can background calves through the winter and then allow them to graze pastures in the summer. Backgrounding calves is essentially taking calves at weaning and feeding them to heavier weights without placing them directly in a feedlot on a finishing ration. The overall objective of this research is to evaluate the level and variability of returns to several background feeding alternatives. The returns will be evaluated in an expected value-variance analysis and ranked using stochastic dominance procedures. It appears that there are several different background alternatives that producers could utilize to increase returns with an acceptable level of risk and add additional value to their calves...|$|E
