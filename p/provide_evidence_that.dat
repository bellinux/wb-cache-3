5|$|Ancient rock paintings, rock shelters, paleolithic {{stone tools}} (hundreds of {{thousands}} of years old), and megaliths <b>provide</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the mountains of the region have been inhabited since prehistoric times.

50|$|Its defences are so well {{preserved}} {{that until}} the mid-1970s archaeologists believed the site to be either a Roman fort or mediaeval farmstead. However excavations in the early 1980s <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> it was inhabited between the 100 BC and 200 AD by local Celtic farmers.

5|$|Later {{chapters}} <b>provide</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{evolution has}} occurred, supporting {{the idea of}} branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternate concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, {{and its ability to}} explain a wide range of observations.|$|E
5|$|Lichen-like fossils {{have been}} found in the Doushantuo Formation in {{southern}} China dating back to 635–551Ma. Lichens formed a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400Ma; this date corresponds to the age of the oldest known sporocarp fossil, a Paleopyrenomycites species found in the Rhynie Chert. The oldest fossil with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is Palaeoancistrus, found permineralized with a fern from the Pennsylvanian. Rare in the fossil record are the Homobasidiomycetes (a taxon roughly equivalent to the mushroom-producing species of the Agaricomycetes). Two amber-preserved specimens <b>provide</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species Archaeomarasmius leggetti) appeared during the late Cretaceous, 90Ma.|$|E
5|$|According to Quintanilla, Jr., in January 1995 {{he began}} {{receiving}} telephone calls from fans {{who said they}} had paid {{for membership in the}} Selena fan club and had received nothing in return for it, and he began an investigation. Quintanilla, Jr. discovered that Saldívar had embezzled more than $30,000 via forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques. Quintanilla, Jr. held a meeting with Selena and Suzette on the night of March 9 at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. presented Saldívar with the inconsistencies concerning the disappeared funds. Quintanilla, Jr. told her that if she did not <b>provide</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> disproved his accusations, he would involve the local police. Quintanilla, Jr. banned Saldívar from having any contact with Selena. However, Selena did not want to dissolve their friendship; she thought Saldívar was essential {{to the success of the}} clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep her close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax preparation.|$|E
