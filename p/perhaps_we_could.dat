500|$|The Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop), the {{organization}} {{responsible for the}} production of Sesame Street, considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode. As early as 1989, writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it, stating, [...] "My two projects for this year are drugs and divorce. Divorce is a difficult one. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do it with puppets. I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure". Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990, before it reached development. While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series, she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families, which was the show's target audience. She said that [...] "divorce is a middle-class thing," [...] and suggested instead that an episode focus on a single-parent family, with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father. Singer stated, even after the episode was filmed, [...] "We were really nervous about the show, and we didn't think it was a shoo-in. When you're dealing with something like death, the approach can be universal. But with divorce, it's so personal. People react differently." [...] The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year, after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all children in the United States, not just the middle classes, would soon live in divorced households.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Hiroshi Yamauchi decided that the console should use a red and white theme after seeing a billboard for DX Antenna which used those colors.|$|E

We want one in operation but not in name. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> call it a Spiritual Guidance Center. Think up its name, will you. And we could put in nice desks and our boys in neat blue with diplomas {{on the walls and}} 1.knock psychotherapy into history and 2.make enough money to shine up my operating scope and 3.keep the HAS solvent. It is a problem of practical business. I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell. A religious charter would be necessary in Pennsylvania or NJ to make it stick. But I sure could make it stick. We're treating the present time beingness, psychotherapy treats the past and the brain. And brother, that's religion, not mental science.|$|E

5000|$|However, Rothbard {{also wrote}} a piece, {{published}} posthumously, entitled 'Are Libertarians [...] "Anarchists"?' where he traced the etymological roots of Anarchist philosophy, ultimately {{coming to the}} conclusion that [...] "...we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position. That none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines", and furthermore, [...] "We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive. <b>Perhaps,</b> then, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist." ...|$|R

It’s a subject he knows pretty well, having written a thesis about it. However, despite some great work by Ken and others, we are still a long way from a union theory of management. We know that command-and-control leads to endless problems, but we are still scratching our heads over what to do instead. <b>Perhaps</b> one place <b>we</b> <b>could</b> start is within our own organisations – labor unions.

The poetry of the man-of-war still clings to the [...] "three-decker out of the foam" [...] of the past; it is too soon yet for it to have cast a mischievous halo about the modern battle-ship; and I looked at the New York and the Texas and the Brooklyn and the rest, and thought, [...] "Ah, but for you, and our need of proving your dire efficiency, <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have got on with the wickedness of Spanish rule in Cuba, and there had been no war!"

60|$|As soon as I had {{satisfied}} {{my curiosity}} by gazing at this scene, I fell to wondering {{how it was}} that what we had taken for a path should have conducted us to so singular a place, and began to suspect that after all I might have been deceived in supposing it {{to have been a}} track formed by the islanders. This was rather an agreeable reflection than otherwise, for it diminished our dread of accidentally meeting with any of them, and I {{came to the conclusion that}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not have selected a more secure hiding-place than this very spot we had so accidentally hit upon. Toby agreed with me in this view of the matter, and we immediately began gathering together the limbs of trees which lay scattered about, with the view of constructing a temporary hut for the night. This we were obliged to build close to the foot of the cataract for the current of water extended very nearly to the sides of the gorge. The few moments of light that remained we employed in covering our hut with a species of broad-bladed grass that grew in every fissure of the ravine. Our hut, if it deserved to be called one, consisted of six or eight of the straightest branches we could find laid obliquely against the steep wall of rock, with their lowered ends within a foot of the stream. Into the space thus covered over we managed to crawl, and dispose our wearied bodies as best we could.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of researchers’ {{previous}} industry experience on the research outputs and outcomes of university faculty affiliated with NSF and DOE research centers. Using a dataset combining curriculum vita and surveys, our results indicate significant differences between the researchers who have previous industry experience and those who do not. Using a simple model of research productivity, we found that academic researchers who had prior industry exposure produce fewer total career publications, but they support more students. Most important, and <b>perhaps</b> surprising, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not establish any difference between the two groups’ publication activity when focusing on a five-year cross-section (years 1996 – 2000) rather than total career publications. We found statistical evidence that previous industry experience raised the annual publication productivity of junior faculty members and women researchers in our sample of research center personnel. We believe the unique blend of research center affiliation, academic post, and past industry experience gives an individual who embodies or possesses all three characteristics a diverse source of scientific and technical human capital and particular advantages over those who have no industry experience (though the “academic-only” set also has particular advantages in cumulative publishing productivity).

5000|$|... 19th century individualist anarchists espoused {{the labor}} theory of value. Many {{believe that the}} modern {{movement}} of anarcho-capitalism {{is the result of}} simply removing the labor theory of value from ideas of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists: [...] "Their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard, having abandoned the labor theory of value, describe themselves as anarcho-capitalists." [...] As economic theory changed, the popularity of the labor theory of classical economics was superseded by the subjective theory of value of neo-classical economics. Murray Rothbard, a student of Ludwig von Mises, combined the Austrian school economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker. In the mid-1950s Rothbard wrote an article under a pseudonym, saying that [...] "we are not anarchists ... but not archists either ... <b>Perhaps,</b> then, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist," [...] concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of other anarchists (including the individualist anarchists of the 19th century). There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement {{due to the fact that}} anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.|$|R
