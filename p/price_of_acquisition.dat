40|$|During {{the past}} few years new drugs with greatly {{improved}} efficacy have become available to physicians and their patients. The higher purchase price of these new drugs is quite important and is quoted as a significant cause of the escalating cost of health care. Antibiotics have played a highly visible role in this therapeutic scene and account for $ 1. 2 billion of the yearly national pharmaceutical budget in the United States. From an economic point of view, costs arise because resources are limited and have alternative uses. The real cost of prescribing a new, more expensive drug, may be that other drugs and/or services become unavailable. Unsurprisingly, considering the magnitude of the slakes, we have seen the recent development and expansion of subsets of the field of health economics. Of these, cost of illness studies and pharmacoeconomics have played a prominent role. The ultimate objective of these relatively new tools is to help clinicians and decision makers in selling priori lies. A pharmacoeconomic study can have different perspectives. Cost and benefits can be calculated with respect to the patients', society's, the payers, or the health care providers, point of view. The perspective chosen for a study determines what is counted as cost or benefit; therefore, the economic impact of an intervention may be quite different depending on the perspective taken. Pharmacoeconomics is particularly relevant to antibiotic therapy since it can demonstrate that the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>acquisition</b> of the drug plays a relatively modest part in the global pharmacoeconomic aspect of tl 1 c treatment of bacterial infections. This is easily understood when it is realized that failure to treat a bacterial infection due to an inadequate choice of antibiotic promptly can result in avoidable hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, permanent disability and even death...|$|E
40|$|Learning {{materials}} have multiple forms, such as books, overhead slides, computer files, blackboard notes by teachers, narration to the notes, video/audio tapes etc. Since the forms are highly inhomogeneous, it becomes difficult {{to collect and}} practically use them by a particular learner for individual study at home. Such multiple media are also expensive in management, since human resources are {{needed to keep the}} material repositories in order. One solution of the problem lies in centralized active digital repositories. Such repositories aim to simplify the learner’s work and boost learning efficiency. With introduction of interactivity and live communication tools such repositories become learning platforms exceeding the functionality of “passive” digital libraries. Such learning platforms could be easily used both for on-campus and distance education. This dissertation presents an evaluation of a digital repository of interactive multimedia content in the field of Heat and Power Technology: Computerized Educational Platform (CompEdu HPT). The platform evaluation consisted of integration of the tool into the university curriculum and then collection of feedback from students and teachers. The evaluation concerned usefulness of the platform for learning, aspects of instruction improvement, collecting observations about how the platform is used by students, as well as their opinions about the IT application direction chosen. The methods included: online feedback forms, questionnaires, interviews, discussions and observations. The evaluation demonstrated that the main strength of the platform is the integration of learning materials in one portable package. The students appreciated structured and logically arranged information that was available for easy access. Coverage of a broad area of knowledge related to heat and power technology was also pointed out as an advantage with reflection on the very low <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>acquisition</b> of the materials. The most popular elements of the content in use included: simulations, lecture notes, the print function, the glossary, and calculation exercises. A major part of the students declared the high value of CompEdu in facilitating home study. Nevertheless, not all the students had a positive impression: around one-fifth of them did not find the platform useful and expressed preference for more traditional learning media. The majority of the negative opinions concerned content quality, which directly related to weaknesses of the content production and review process. The evaluation emphasized the importance of material quality and amount as the key issue for a good learning platform with relatively smaller importance of presentation forms. The evaluation also considered aspects of functionality from the user point of view. Differentiation between popularity of simulations showed that simulations used by teachers during lectures have higher educational value than those for individual use only. The popularity of the printing option indicated a need for adaptation of digital materials for paper publishing. The general conclusion for practical use of multimedia tools in education was that high usability and simplicity of information access should be the focus point of any chosen approach in the direction. The CompEdu evaluation suggested that after thorough content review and addition of an efficient search mechanism the platform can successfully deliver rich learning content. The platform gave an extensive real-case illustration of how multimedia can be used in educational practice. Due to the evaluation, the CompEdu e-learning group has collected rich experience and know-how in the field of active knowledge repositories. The experience will be used for development of a more sophisticated learning platform working in the global Internet environment with major focus on information accessibility by easy search.

40|$|Abstract—In placing {{capital market}} {{imperfections}} {{at the center}} of emerg-ing market crises, the theoretical literature has associated a liquidity crisis with low foreign investment and the exit of investors from the crisis economy. However, a liquidity crisis is equally consistent with an inflow of foreign capital in the form <b>of</b> mergers and <b>acquisitions</b> (M&A). To support this hypothesis, we use a firm-level data set to show that foreign acquisitions increased by 91 % in East Asia between 1996 and 1998, while intranational merger activity declined. Firm liquidity plays a significant and sizable role in explaining both the increase in foreign acquisitions and the decline in the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>acquisitions</b> during the crisis. This contrasts with the role of liquidity in noncrisis years and in noncrisis economies in the region. This effect is also most prominent in the tradable sector. Quanti-tatively, the observed decline in liquidity can explain 25 % of the increase in foreign acquisition activity in the tradable sectors. The nature of M&A activity supports liquidity-based explanations of the East Asian crisis and provides an explanation for the puzzling stability of FDI inflows during the crises. I...|$|R
