50|$|No forms <b>of</b> {{religious}} <b>slaughter</b> {{are named}} as being {{banned in the}} Norwegian legislation. Norwegian law requires that animals be stunned before being slaughtered, without exception for religious practices, which is incompatible with shechita. (The Norwegian Islamic Council, on the other hand, has found that sedation is compatible with halal rules, provided that the animal's heart is still beating at the time <b>of</b> <b>slaughter.)</b> Representatives <b>of</b> both Muslim and Jewish communities, citing scientific studies, dispute the assertion that traditional halal and kosher slaughtering methods lead to unnecessary animal suffering. Norway's acceptance of hunting, whaling and sealing were also raised as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the alleged hypocrisy of the Norwegian position. Minister of Agriculture, Lars Peder Brekk of the Centre Party (which has always rejected shechita, see above), rejected the comparison.|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of welfare issues {{relating}} to religious slaughter and the handling of animals both before slaughter and at point <b>of</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Most notably perceived pain and distress by cattle during the neck cut and the duration of sensibility in the period after slaughter prior to loss of brain function are often examined within religious slaughter methods. This paper will examine two different methods <b>of</b> the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> cattle: penetrating captive bolt versus traditional halal slaughter. The two methods at point <b>of</b> <b>slaughter</b> will first be illustrated, and then pre-slaughter methods relating to the restraint of the animal prior to slaughter will be compared and contrasted. Ultimately, these comparisons will answer the question: is commercial captive bolt stunning more humane than the practice <b>of</b> halal style <b>slaughter?</b> Several physiological indicators such as bleed-out rate, sentience at point <b>of</b> <b>slaughter,</b> and time to collapse among others will be examined and compared between the two methods...|$|R
