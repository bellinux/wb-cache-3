40|$|My {{thesis is}} that the {{transition}} between private- and public-company status could be less bumpy if we unify the public-private dividing line under the Securities Act and Exchange Act. The insight builds on Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s thought experiment where Congress first enacted the Exchange Act. My proposed public-private standard would take the company-registration model to its logical conclusion. The customary path to public-company status is through an IPO, typically with simultaneous listing of the shares on an exchange. There is nothing about public offerings, however, that makes them inherently antecedent to public-company status.

40|$|Provisions in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 {{have made}} it much easier for firms to avoid federal {{periodic}} disclosure obligations, but these provisions were enacted based upon a virtually nonexistent legislative record and upended rules established only after careful consideration almost fifty years earlier. Determining when firms {{should be required to}} comply with federal periodic disclosure requirements is best done {{in the context of a}} broader understanding of the history and economics of periodic disclosure regulation. This Article provides such an understanding. The history of periodic disclosure regulation in the United States is traced back to its origins in the eighteenth century, and the economic analysis of periodic disclosure regulation is updated and refined to incorporate recent findings. Building on this historical and economic understanding of periodic disclosure regulation, I identify a flaw in the underlying structure of the rules currently used to determine when firms must make <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosures.</b> To rectify this structural problem, I conclude that firms with a market capitalization of less than $ 35 million or fewer than one hundred beneficial shareholders should be granted an automatic exemption from periodic disclosure requirements. All other firms should be provided a choice between: (1) complying with federal periodic disclosure obligations, or (2) implementing measures that would mitigate the need for periodic disclosure regulation, such as severely restricting the tradability of the firm’s shares or committing to an acceptable alternative disclosure regime...|$|E
40|$|The Saudi {{securities}} {{market has}} been suffering {{from the lack of}} transparency and disclosure credibility, which accounts for the market collapse in 2006 causing a loss of 50 per cent of the total market value and heavy losses for many investors. This disaster has triggered an effect on {{a large proportion of the}} population, and in several cases, death was recorded, and there were other instances where people became ill due to the stress of the situation. However, such investors have not yet been compensated. One main reason for this bad state of the market is the non-compliance with corporate disclosures requirements set out by the Capital Market Law 2003 (Saudi Arabia) (CML’ 03) and the regulations issued by the Capital Market Authority (CMA). This collapse was caused by widespread defective corporate disclosures. The aim of this thesis is to examine the civil liability regime for defective disclosures in the Saudi securities market from the perspective of investor protection. An analytical approach to the examination of the relevant legal rules and principles has been adopted in undertaking the present thesis. The civil liability regime attracted by breaches of the disclosure rules related to prospectus and post-prospectus disclosures (continuous and <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosures)</b> has been examined. In this connection, to assess whether the Saudi investors have sufficient protection, the relevant laws and principles from selected developed countries (the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and Canada), and the principles of securities market regulation set out by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and case laws have been discussed as a benchmark. This thesis also examines the remedy provisions for investors, defences available to the accused (such as the issuers), and the judicial and administrative enforcement of these provisions (including those related to the disclosure regime) of the Saudi securities laws compared to the laws of the above mentioned jurisdictions. Finally, this study arrives at the finding that Saudi Arabia lacks a strong disclosure, liability and remedy regime in terms of both substantive provisions and their enforcement through the court of law and the securities commission. There follows a number of suggestions to bring about legal and regulatory reforms in the securities law of Saudi Arabia with particular reference to the areas of concern under scrutiny in this study...|$|E

In section III, I canvass the degree to which such disclosure is actually required under securities law vis-a`-vis the continuous disclosure obligation that requires public companies to provide <b>periodic</b> and timely <b>disclosure</b> to investors. I focus on three of the key components of <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure</b> - quarterly/annual financial statements, the management discussion and analysis and, most importantly, the annual information form. Although many firms are underreporting, it is clear that a sufficient legal basis exists to compel the disclosure of material social information. However, various weaknesses limit the potential of existing provisions and arguably facilitate corporate opacity. As such, in section IV I provide a set of recommendations that I hope will serve to enhance the social disclosure landscape...|$|R

[2011]), this paper examines how analysts process information, particularly in an information environment characterised by multiple and potentially complementary information sources. The setting is the microprocessor industry, one in which technical information is particularly significant and complex to digest. Based on 3837 analyst earnings-forecast revisions, issued by 134 analysts, we examine quantitatively the speed, magnitude, and information content of the reactions of individual analysts and subgroups of analysts to both periodic and timely technical disclosures, and as a complement to <b>periodic</b> financial <b>disclosure.</b> We find that analysts are much slower to react to timely technical disclosures than they are to <b>periodic</b> financial <b>disclosures.</b> We find also that technical and financial disclosures complement each other. Furthermore, we find {{that there is a}} ‘hierarchy’ of analysts in this particular industry, as evidenced through the strength of reaction to timely technical disclosures. Finally, we find that lower speed in reacting to timely technical disclosures and a higher intensity in the use of timely technical disclosure (in conjunction with <b>periodic</b> financial <b>disclosure)</b> result in greater accuracy, and that more experienced analysts tend to be less accurate. We suggest that the findings may have implications for other industries such as Bio-Tech Pharma...|$|R

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the extent and}} quality of information provided by listed companies through the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), {{and the likelihood of}} additional private or selective disclosure. This is important because markets benefit greatly from public transparency and accountability. The global financial crisis has starkly reminded us that modern markets, real economies and people'&# 146;s lives are closely interconnected. Effective company disclosure in the public arena is especially vital in Australia, because the equity market operates with the highest retail investor participation in the world and a large proportion of savings is invested through compulsory superannuation. Policy statements on company disclosure and insider trading regulation emphasise the importance of equal access to company information. They also acknowledge the links between equal access, investor confidence in the integrity of the market and efficiency outcomes. I therefore review the conceptual bases and empirical attributes of fairness and efficiency within markets, and consider the fairness and efficiency of the listed company disclosure framework in Australia. I find the level of public transparency across the equity market is highly variable; access to listed company information in Australia is far from equal; and the content and quality of ASX disclosures are sometimes insufficient for well-informed decisions. Commentary from companies, regulators and investors reveals a large gap in expectations between listed companies and their stakeholders relating to disclosure practices and enforcement. Moreover, scholarly studies and original research suggest that a significant proportion of information required for informed decisions and broader managerial accountability is disseminated on a private, selective or tiered basis. I conclude that reforms to the disclosure framework are needed to enhance its fairness and long-term economic efficiency. Specific reforms to the <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure,</b> continuous disclosure and company briefing rules and processes are proposed. These reforms, if implemented, would enable more equitable access to information and reduce the scope for trading on inside or selectively disclosed information. In addition, general policy recommendations are outlined to promote a disclosure framework founded on a solid theoretical basis, with clearly identifiable goals, and a bold and effective regulatory and enforcement structure...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{efficient}} design of civil liability for mandatory securities disclosure violations by established issuers. An issuer not publicly offering securities {{at the time}} of a violation should have no liability. Its annual filings should be signed by an external certifier—an investment bank or other well-capitalized entity with financial expertise. If the filing contains a material misstatement and the certifier fails to do due diligence, the certifier should face measured liability. Officers and directors should face similar liability, capped relative to their compensation but with no indemnification or insurance allowed. Damages should be payable to the issuer, not traders in its shares, because the true social harm from issuer misstatements is poor corporate governance and reduced liquidity. A trader is as likely to be a gainer by selling, as a loser by buying, at the misstatement-inflated price. An issuer publicly offering securities {{at the time of}} a violation should be liable to purchasers for the resulting inflation in price. Such liability is an antidote to what otherwise would be an extra incentive not to comply. This design would increase incentives for U. S. issuers to comply with <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure</b> rules. At the same time, litigation-expensive fraud-on-themarket class actions would be eliminated. So would underwriter liability for lack of due diligence, a sharply diminishing spur for disclosure given the speed of modern offerings. For countries considering implementation of securities disclosure civil liability systems for the first time, this design helps them get it right from the start...|$|R

To gather the information required to do so, securities analysts review <b>periodic</b> financial <b>disclosures</b> (such as made by United States-listed issuers to the Securities and Exchange Commission) of the issuer and other relevant companies, participate or listen in on management conference calls, read industry news and use trading history and industry information databases, interview managers and customers of the issuer, and (sometimes) perform their own primary research.|$|R
40|$|The present paper aims at {{exploring}} strategic plans as key vehicles of forward-looking {{information in the}} Italian context, focusing on their role within corporate financial communication and their connection with <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure.</b> The release of information regarding firm prospects is generally voluntary and highly appreciated by the market, so {{it is essential that}} such disclosure is continuous and provided in a form allowing investors to verify the achievement of corporate goals. The study is {{based on the idea that}} it is essential that forward-looking disclosure is integrated with reported results. In other words, integration is reached when investors are able to verify whether the previously disclosed strategic and financial targets have been hit. It allows users not only to interpret corporate disclosures but also to have an indication of the likely reliability of future financial forecasts. In such a perspective, the primary purpose of this paper is to explore the connection between strategic plans and periodic reports, with particular reference to continuity and comparability of information disclosed through different documents. Such issues seem of particular interest with concern to information needs of investors, who want to be able to verify in periodic reports whether firms are keeping their strategic plan promises. In pursuit of that objective the paper introduces an index to measure integration between forward-looking and historical disclosure, based on the comparison of data released in strategic plans and in the following annual and half-year reports. We posit that historical data directly comparable to forward-looking information contained in previous strategic plans is an indicator of integration between documents. We also investigate determinants of integration between forward-looking and historical disclosure, focusing on firm size, information asymmetries and proprietary costs...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is two-fold: first, to explain the demise of {{subprime}} and Alt-A mortgage markets in the U. S. from the viewpoint of measuring and managing mortgage credit risk; and secondly, to discuss several policy lessons that can be learned from the market meltdown. To that end, three tiers of mortgage credit models are elaborated, including the scoring (or risk rank-ordering), risk-based pricing, and ¡§sizing¡¨ (or the analytics used in determining subordination levels of credit-sensitive mortgage backed security (MBS) deals) models. Using these as conceptual underpinning, empirical evidence is surveyed to document key contributing factors to the market demise. Those that are identified include the non-availability of reliable mortgage performance data, lack of theory as well as industry best-practices in performing simulation-based mortgage risk assessments, complex and arcane structures of mortgage backed securities, and information asymmetry among the parties involved in the security transactions. The overall conclusion derived is that the participants to these market segments surpass their risk management capabilities in globalizing funding for subprime and Alt-A mortgages. The policy lessons emphasized are the importance of the infrastructure of proper risk assessment and risk-based pricing, as well as prudent and transparent MBS products along with <b>periodic</b> information <b>disclosure.</b> Subprime mortgage; Mortgage-backed securities; Mortgage default; Credit risk management...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007 - 09 has raised questions concerning orthodox ideas of how financial markets operate and how financial institution firms (and their decision makers) behave in such market settings. The crisis has revealed {{the need for}} new thinking in these areas. This paper outlines a grounded theory of the fund management firm and investment decision making at the level of individuals and teams. The theory comprises the role of external and internal firm contexts on individual fund managers and teams and the funds they manage. It includes the properties of FM firm organisational contexts comprising order, creativity, knowledge, coherence and matching; and the relative peer group strengths of these properties. It includes the properties of individual and team contexts and their strengths. These contexts and their properties all purposefully interacted as collective and integrated FM organisational means (or dynamic system) to help individuals and teams to reduce the complexity of new information flows, to make sense of information, to avoid their own negative behaviour, to exploit the behaviour of others, to take investment decisions, to create diversified portfolios, and to produce FM financial performance (at the level of funds managed, and the firm overall). The FM value creation process, the continuous interaction (and <b>periodic</b> <b>disclosure)</b> with investee companies and with stock and information markets, and ongoing investment decision making at individual and team level, also led to cumulative FM learning and strategic choices about the perceived drivers of fund and market outcomes. The interaction and learning created new knowledge intensive contexts or priors for FM investment decision behaviour which then became drivers of subsequent investment decisions. The ongoing investment interactions, the longer term knowledge creating interactions, and the FM responses revealed the dynamic elements to FM investment behaviour. The FM contextual elements and dynamic interactions were common empirical patterns across case FMs. Variation in context and properties were used to tentatively explain, in part, FMs type or style. Variation in strength (weaknesses) of contextual properties (within a fund type or peer group) were used to tentatively explain, in part, differences in performance. A major function of the grounded theory may be to provide a new conceptual tool to fully investigate the reasons for such variety in FM styles. In addition it may provide a new tool to fully investigate and explain the reasons for pervasive and systematic FM underperformance rather than to explain the more unusual cases of success. The research was conducted through case interview field work in 20 large international FMs during 2004 - 2011 and use was made of archival sources. A grounded theory approach was employed in processing the data. The results were discussed relative to relevant literature and to previous grounded theory of FM. Areas for further research were identified. ...|$|R
30|$|According to Abugre & Nyuur (2015 : 173) “Communicating CSR is a {{means of}} {{ensuring}} that these firms are in touch with their stakeholders to be responsible for their social and environmental impacts”. The increasing desire by companies to engage in CSR is largely attributed to the myriad of benefits that companies stand to gain when perceived by society as being social responsible (Du et al., 2010). According to Rizk et al., 2008 : 306) corporate social responsibility reporting is “the process of communicating the social and environmental effects of organizations’ economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large. As such, it involves extending the accountability of organizations (particularly) companies; beyond the traditional role of providing a financial account to the owners of capital, in particular to shareholders. Such an extension is predicated upon the assumption that companies do have wider responsibility than simply to make money for their shareholders”. Fonseca et al. (2011) see sustainability reporting as the process of accessing and making <b>periodic</b> public <b>disclosures</b> relating to organization’s social, environment, economic, safety and health performance. Hinson et al., (2010) discussed how banks in Ghana disclose their CSR on their websites.

40|$|Forecasting future {{directions}} {{is at best}} a risky business. Few can claim to see with confidence the shape of things to come. In addition, the {{issues related to the}} {{future directions}} of educational achievement and ability testing are broad and numerous. They range from such important, but difficult to forecast, areas as the national mood toward education and educational accountability, legislation and the political arena, and court rulings to theoretical and technological advances. However, instead of providing a survey of possible futures resulting from these diverse and numerous potential influences, this chapter focuses on two areas of overriding importance in considering these future directions. The two areas to be addressed are: (a) the evolving conceptual {{understanding of the nature of}} the achievement and ability constructs, and (b) the opportunities afforded by advances in computer technology. The chapter begins with a brief review of the current status of such testing to establish a context for the consideration of these two central issues and their implications for the future. It then turns, first, to the conceptual directions likely to evolve from changes in the familiar ability and achievement constructs and, second, to some of the implications of computer technology for testing in the future. CURRENT STATUS OF ACHIEVEMENT AND ABILITY TESTING A Recent Period of Criticism To examine the current status of educational testing, it is necessary to recognize that the period from the late 1960 s through the 1970 s was a time of intense criticism of standardized testing. During this period of increased social awareness, test score differences between groups were attributed quickly to bias in tests, particularly when the major alternative explanation under debate was hereditary differences in intelligence between groups (Jensen, 1969). Access to education and appropriate employment for minority applicants was one major objective of the civil rights movement and often tests were viewed as tools which stood in the way of such access. The courts were asked to judge the appropriateness of tests and test use and tests became central in several court rulings. When the concern with citizen rights made its way into the market place and the consumer movement began in earnest, the result was calls for “truth in testing, “which was implemented in some states basically as a requirement for <b>periodic</b> public <b>disclosure</b> of the content of major tests. As this time of criticism blossomed, testing specialists were in the forefront both criticizing and defending tests in the public and professional literature and seeking ways to improve them. Measurement specialists began to examine with a new seriousness the possibility of test bias. The professional literature contains hundreds of studies conducted during this period (e. g., see Cole, 198 1, 1983) which address technical approaches and substantive issues of bias. It became common for manuals of educational tests to routinely address the issue of bias. More measurement professionals began to disassociate themselves from arguments that test score differences necessarily reflect hereditary differences and in so doing emphasized with new vigor the effects of educationally related experience on educational ability tests. In addition, many test developers began to adopt a more critical view of their tests in preparation for disclosure and other forms of public scrutiny- to view them as an interested public might- and in so doing discovered a number of small ways of improving test content...|$|R
