5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if from {{the eyes of the}} game's protagonist. The <b>player</b> controls the movement of the <b>player</b> character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where the <b>player</b> loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. The <b>player</b> character possesses numerical values for their health and armor, which are displayed on the game's heads-up display. As the <b>player</b> character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, the <b>player</b> character will die. Armor lessens the impact to the <b>player</b> character's health from hostile action, but once depleted the <b>player</b> will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using wall-mounted terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E
