40|$|This paper {{develops}} numerical {{methods for}} finding optimal dividend pay-out and reinsurance policies. A generalized singular control formulation of surplus and discounted payoff function are introduced, where the surplus is modeled by a regime-switching process subject to both regular and singular controls. To approximate the value function and optimal controls, Markov chain approximation techniques {{are used to}} construct a discrete-time controlled Markov chain with two components. The proofs of the convergence of the approximation sequence to the surplus process and the value function are given. Examples of <b>proportional</b> and excess-of-loss <b>reinsurance</b> are presented to illustrate {{the applicability of the}} numerical methods. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{reinsurance}} strategy, called threshold strategy, that has a different behaviour depending on the reserves.

The study of the effect of the introduction of the threshold reinsurance on the survival probability, and the comparison with the <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> and the option of not reinsuring, allows us to find equivalent strategies of reinsurance from the solvency point of view. survival probability, <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance,</b> threshold reinsurance, risk theory...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the optimal {{reinsurance}} strategy from an insurer’s point of view. Our objective {{is to find the}} optimal policy that maximises the insurer’s survival probability. To meet the requirement of regulators and provide a tool to risk management, we introduce the dynamic version of Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and worst-case CVaR (wcCVaR) constraints in diffusion model and the risk measure limit is proportional to company’s surplus in hand. In the dynamic setting, a CVaR/wcCVaR constraint is equivalent to a VaR constraint under a higher confidence level. Applying dynamic programming technique, we obtain closed form expressions of the optimal reinsurance strategies and corresponding survival probabilities under both <b>proportional</b> and excess-of-loss <b>reinsurance.</b> Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact caused by dynamic VaR/CVaR/wcCVaR limit in both types of reinsurance policy.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the optimal control problem for a insurance company. Our objective is to maximize the expectation of discounted dividends and its terminal value which represents the company liquidation value upon the time of bankruptcy. The surplus of the insurance company is governed by the Brownian motion with a constant drift and a diffusion term. The company can manage its risk exposure simultaneously through <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance.</b> Apart from the <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance,</b> the insurance company also pays out dividends with bounded dividends rate. With {{the help of the}} stochastic dynamic programming approach, we solve the control problem of maximizing the expectation of discounted dividends and the terminal value. We first construct a solution to the HJB equation and then verify that the solution of the HJB equation is indeed the optimal value function for our problem.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal control {{problem of the}} insurance company with <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> policy under solvency constraints. The management of the company controls the reinsurance rate and dividends payout processes to maximize the expected present value of the dividend until the time of bankruptcy. This is a mixed singular-regular control problem. However, the optimal dividend payout barrier may be too low to be acceptable. The company may be prohibited to pay dividend according to external reasons because this low dividend payout barrier will result in bankruptcy soon. Therefore, some constraints on the insurance company's dividend policy will be imposed. One reasonable and normal constraint is that if b is the minimum dividend barrier, then the bankrupt probability should not be larger than some predetermined [epsilon] within the time horizon T.

40|$|When {{analyzing}} catastrophic risk, traditional {{measures for}} evaluating risk, {{such as the}} probable maximum loss (PML), value at risk (VaR), Tail VAR (TVaR), and others, can become practically impossible to obtain analytically in certain types of insurance, such as earthquake. Given the available information {{it can be very}} difficult for an insurer to measure this risk. The transfer of risk in this type of insurance is usually done through reinsurance schemes that can be of diverse types that can greatly reduce the extreme tail of the cedant’s loss distribution. This effect can be assessed mathematically. The PML is defined in terms of a very extreme quantile. Also, under standard operating conditions, insurers use several “layers ” of non <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> that will be combined with some type of <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance.</b> The resulting reinsurance structures will then be very complicated to analyze and to evaluate their mitigation or transfer effects analytically {{it may be necessary to}} use alternative approaches, such as Monte Carlo simulation methods.

40|$|In this paper, {{we assume}} that the surplus process of an {{insurance}} entity is represented by a pure diffusion. The company can invest its surplus into a Black-Scholes risky asset and a risk free asset. We impose investment restrictions that only a limited amount is allowed in the risky asset and that no short-selling is allowed. We further assume that when the surplus level becomes negative, the company can borrow to continue financing. The ultimate objective is to seek an optimal investment strategy that minimizes the probability of absolute ruin, i. e. the probability that the liminf of the surplus process is negative infinity. The corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is analyzed and a verification theorem is proved; applying the HJB method we obtain explicit expressions for the S-shaped minimal absolute ruin function and its associated optimal investment strategy. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we study the optimization problem with both investment and <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> control.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the optimization of mutual <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> — a mutual reserve {{system that is}} intended for the collective reinsurance needs of homogeneous mutual members, such as P&I Clubs in marine mutual insurance and reserve banks in the U. S. Federal Reserve. Compared to general (non-mutual) insurance models, which involve one-sided impulse control (i. e., either downside or upside impulse) of the underlying insurance reserve process that is required to be positive, a mutual insurance differs in allowing two-sided impulse control (i. e., both downside and upside impulse), coupled with the classical proportional control of reinsurance. We prove that a special band-type impulse control (a,A,B, b) with a = 0 and a < A < B < b, coupled with a <b>proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> policy (classical control), is optimal when {{the objective is to}} minimize the total maintenance cost. That is, when the reserve position reaches a lower boundary of a = 0, the reserve should immediately be raised to level A; when the reserve reaches an upper boundary of b, it should immediately be reduced to a level B. ∗This work was supported by Hong Kong GRF 5225 / 07 E...|$|E
