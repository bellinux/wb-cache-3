40|$|EDITED VERSION TO BE PUBLISHED SOON <b>Pluriactivity</b> {{has been}} a topic of {{research}} in agriculture for {{the best part of}} a century. It is a term which has both broad and narrow definitions and hence is subject to multiple interpretations. This paper considers two forms of pluriactivity: within the farm gate <b>pluriactivity,</b> also commonly referred to as farm diversification, and beyond the farm-gate <b>pluriactivity,</b> also known as multiple job holding. Previous studies of <b>pluriactivity</b> have shown that it can inhibit the natural process of structural change in the farm sector, by allowing small and unprofitable farms to survive with the support of income from outside the sector. In this paper, two empirical models of <b>pluriactivity</b> are estimated using farm level data for Ireland. The first examines the impact of on-farm diversification on off-farm labour supply, while the second investigates the relationship between off-farm labour supply and farm exit which is specified in the context of retirement and non-succession. The result of the first model suggests that farms that engage in within the farm gate <b>pluriactivity</b> are less likely to engage in beyond the farm gate <b>pluriactivity,</b> in other words more diversified farmers are less likely to work off farm. The second model confirms previous findings in the literature that part-time farmers have a reduced probability of having a farm successor. While the model results are specific to the Irish case, they do provide some value insights into the impacts of <b>pluriactivity</b> on structural change in farming...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, <b>pluriactivity</b> has become quite {{widespread}} among moshav farming households, especially those located within Metropolitan Tel Aviv’s rural fringe. Agricultural income {{has been on the}} decline and other sources of income have appeared. This paper has a threefold aim: To identify major patterns of income sources among Moshav’s households; to explain the underlying causes for choosing <b>pluriactivity</b> as an income-producing strategy; and to explain the reasons for the specific choice of <b>pluriactivity</b> patterns adopted. An analysis of the activities of moshavim 1 located in the Sharon Region indicates that the further the moshav from the metropolitan area, the greater the role of agriculture in total family income. Within a <b>pluriactivity</b> strategy, the main additional sources of income are wage employment and small business activity, carried out either on or off the moshav. The main factors stimulating the increase in <b>pluriactivity</b> are the decline in agricultural income and the desire to take advantage of vocational training. This trend is supported by other factors, such as the availability of premises for alternative uses as well as the ease of operating a business from the home. The divergence in <b>pluriactivity</b> patterns may indicate that the frequency of mixing agriculture with other income sources may be a temporary option adopted by households for which agriculture has been a mainstay. Those households may shift away from agriculture in the short or mid-term. We would argue that at present, for the majority of those no longer devoted solely to agriculture, <b>pluriactivity</b> is also aimed at helping to sustain agricultural activity. In such cases, farmers utilise the resources acquired from non-agricultural employment for investment in agriculture, including the upgrading of equipment and other assets. # 200...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{business}} ownership {{has become}} an important theme within the small firms research literature. While early studies emphasised its role in reducing business risk, more recently portfolio entrepreneurship has been recognised as an important growth strategy, particularly in sectors where economies of scale can be achieved at a relatively low level. Research studies specifically examining multiple business ownership are still scarce, but the parallels between portfolio entrepreneurship in non-farm sectors and farm <b>pluriactivity</b> have been noted. Although <b>pluriactivity</b> has been subject to extensive investigation in recent years, analysis has generally focused on farm-centred diversification, rather than the wider entrepreneurial activities of the farmer. Using a survey of nearly 300 farm owners in Cambridgeshire, this exploratory study analyses the incidence of portfolio entrepreneurship in the farm sector and assesses its contribution to enterprise and employment creation. The results demonstrate that a core of farmers have multiple business interests and that these additional business activities make a substantial contribution to both numbers of enterprises and employment creation. While previous studies of <b>pluriactivity</b> have generally used the farm business as the main unit of analysis, {{it is argued that}} including the wider business activities of the farm owner enables a more precise estimation of the total contribution of farmers to rural economic development...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{research}} on portfolio entrepreneurship seldom focuses on empirical {{evidence of the}} determinants of portfolio activities in farming (i. e. <b>pluriactivity).</b> Most studies report the incidence {{of this type of}} entrepreneurship rather than seeking to explain it. Insights from an early period of portfolio development are used here to demonstrate the prevalence of portfolio farming activity in the past at levels similar to modern development. Using the 1881 census for England and Wales, the paper explores factors that influence the decision to pursue a single or multiple occupations, such as farm areal size, number of employees, market potential measured by population density, and demographic characteristics of farmers. Empirical findings from a multi-level logit model suggest that farm size, population density and farmers’ age have a non-linear relationship with the probability of <b>pluriactivity.</b> With respect to gender and marital status, single men and women as well as widows are less likely to engage in <b>pluriactivity</b> than married men. The estimates are consistent with historical and modern literature evidencing the key role of family resources and locational opportunity. We also estimate the model for each of eleven regions separately. Results are broadly consistent with those from the full population. However, exceptions for London indicate generally weaker demographic relationships and greater impacts of market opportunities...|$|E

Our object of study is located in the rural (Agreste) of Pernambuco that is the focus of many studies, precisely because of its natural barrier mainly to the development of agricultural activities that becomes an importat factor {{in the development of the}} <b>pluriactivity.</b> The methodology was based on a case study in which the unit of analysis is some families in the community.

40|$|The rural {{environment}} and Brazilian agriculture have been showing an intense process of transformations in recent decades. These changes have generated many debates in political, economic and academic circles, among {{which there is}} the notion of <b>pluriactivity,</b> a recent term for the family farmer that, residing in rural areas, combines agricultural activities with non-agricultural activities as a way to supplement the family income. The research sought to analyze how the <b>pluriactivity</b> is presented in rural communities of semiarid northeast and how this practice interferes in the social, economic and ecological sustainability of the communities studied. To achieve this goal, the dialectical method was used as the scientific method, and semi-structured interviews with representatives of local government agencies and the pluriactive families of the communities were used as methodological procedures. Inside the semiarid northeastern scenario, the empirical references of the study were three rural communities in the municipality of Brejinho/PE: Sítio Caldeirão, Sítio Lagoa dos Campos and Vila de Fátima. The analysis of the results indicates that the <b>pluriactivity</b> has a key role in social, economic and environmental sustainability of the communities surveyed. However, it cannot be considered as the solution to rural problems, as many families in the semiarid region still have their social and economic reproduction threatened, and soils in the process of degradation. Thus, many challenges remain to be overcome to achieve a sustainable semiarid region...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{begins by}} {{looking at some of}} the reasons why farm {{household}} <b>pluriactivity,</b> although long-standing, has now become a phenomenon of interest to European policymakers. This European concern is then compared with the current interest of UK policymakers and academics in the related concept of farm diversification. In many respects, UK policies differ significantly from those in the rest of Europe, most notably in their neglect of off-farm income-earning opportunities, and the reasons for this are discussed. Furthermore, it is argued that a preoccupation with forms of diversification or <b>pluriactivity</b> is likely to be less helpful analytically than a focus on underlying farm business and farm household strategies. Finally, some preliminary results of empirical work in Devon and Grampian are presented which suggest that farm household strategies may be at variance with prior expectations in some respects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Multifunctionality of {{agriculture}} (MFA) {{has become a}} key issue on the European Agenda {{as well as in}} WTO talks. In this paper, we compare two dif-ferent EU NUTS 3 areas (UKM 41 and AT 322) to evalu-ate the extent to which multiple functions of agricul-ture are linked to <b>pluriactivity</b> of farms and farm households. The paper presents some initial results from the FP 6 project TOP-MARD and highlights one aspect of MFA which is particularly relevant for the two study areas compared. The comparison highlights structural differences and similarities of the chosen areas and gives some indication as to how pluriactiv-ity and MFA are linked. The comparison shows that the prevalence of on-farm <b>pluriactivity</b> is linked with extensive on-farm production and low on-farm in-comes. On the other hand, high regional economic importance of nature-based tourism is often but not always an indicator of high MFA. ...|$|E

In France, the debate on the MF of activities concerns all forms of agricultural activities, including those closest to what is sometimes conventionally known as the productivist model. This situation differs from most other European Union (EU) countries where the concept of “multifunctionality” is mainly used to study forms of agricultural activities considered to be “heterodox” (<b>pluriactivity,</b> agro-tourism, diversification, etc.).

40|$|A body of {{research}} conducted in the 1990 s confirmed and extended evidence within New Zealand of farm family <b>pluriactivity,</b> including multiple job holding through off farm employment, and non agricultural enterprises run by farm men and women. The 1990 s research showed that multiple job holding is {{a key part of}} the strategy used by farm households to support their household incomes, and therefore their farm incomes. Furthermore, there was evidence of farm women in particular developing career paths in their chosen occupations, in addition to their important contribution to farm work. <b>Pluriactivity</b> is also important in the process of farm succession. National profiling of multiple job holding from the 2001 Census shows that farmer occupational groups rate highly for their level of multiple job holding, as do people in rural areas. However, there are important limitations posed by the questions asked about work in the census. Analysis of farm industry groups by factors such as sex, work status, age, ethnicity, and hours of work will provide further insights into multiple job holders verses non-multiple job holders. The national statistical profile is interpreted against the previous, indepth research and scoping analysis based on a small number of in-depth interviews.

The article concerning the economy of pluriactive farm enterprises deals with machine contracting, wood processing, farm holidays and processing of agricultural products as separate branches of industry, and the profitability of these has been compared with that of traditional farm enterprises.

40|$|Small {{businesses}} in Kentucky are facing numerous challenges {{as they try}} to develop their business and compete in a changing marketplace. Some scholars argue that a reshaping or restructuring of employment patterns is taking place. These patterns include short-term or seasonal, part-time, or multi-job income sources. Women’s increased labor force participation, the professionalization of social relations, and lifestyle or quality of life issues that emphasize individualism, self-employment, and entrepreneurship are factors (Fuller & Bollman, l 992). Multi-job or <b>pluriactivity</b> is not uncommon in rural and agricultural communities. Many individuals have more than one structured business or more than one income generating stream within their business. Farm communities, such as the Amish and Mennonite communities have long engaged in patterns of work that included farm work and non-farm activities to generate income. The trend toward <b>pluriactivity</b> may have ramifications for rural communities in particular, especially in light of change in rural economies and the restructuring of agriculture. Many businesses cite the use of technology and computers as a way to transcend geographic boundaries to target markets for their products and services. In fact, most businesses can not survive on local trade alone. Technological advances are making markets more open and competitive in rural areas. Some experts suggest the ‘new economy ’ as described recently at a Kentucky League Cities conference, “The Morphing of Mainstreet”, will need technological infrastructure and trained workers. Rural communities, on the other hand, offer many of the qualities such as quality of life issues, neighborliness, and lower cost of living that attract ‘new economy’ small businesses. This has important implications for Kentucky business owners since parts of Kentucky are experiencing “digital divide ” (Smith-Mello, Childress, Watts & Watkins, 2000). This lack of access to information technology compounds economic problems already evident in these regions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades farming in the European Union (EU) has come under {{increasing}} pressure to survive as the profits from sales of agricultural commodities have fallen despite the substantial financial inputs from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). To maintain their income, farmers have had to diversify their business. The sociocultural, political and economic reasons involved in farm diversification ought to be analysed critically at this particular time for European agriculture with the implementation of Agenda 2000 promoting farm diversification within its rural development policy. Recent changes in the CAP which aim to shift away agriculture from a purely agricultural support agenda towards a broader approach to both agricultural and rural development have encouraged diversification and/or <b>pluriactivity</b> among farmers. The aim of introducing diversification and/or <b>pluriactivity</b> on farms is to maintain falling farm income by providing another source of income in the business and spreading the economic risk, to develop rural development by the creation of jobs, but also to protect the environment. The primary aim of the research was to identify, analyse and compare the nature of diversification in two European dairy areas, sud Manche (France) and west Dorset (Britain). Sud Manche and west Dorset are two dairy areas that have a great opportunity for farm diversification linked to milk processing activities and tourism. The secondary aim of this research was to determine whether the decision-making process used by farmers to decide to diversify is driven by the changes in agricultural policy or by the characteristics of the farmers and the farms. The study used questionnaires, interviews and focus group to identify {{the nature and extent of}} diversification as well as to collect information on farmer's attitudes towards diversification. The results have showed that farmers from both study areas have diversified and have a different attitude toward diversification. The nature of diversification is different in the two areas. Farmers in sud Manche have diversified into a more agricultural orientated diversification whereas farmers in west Dorset have more non-agricultural diversification. However, some farmers in both study areas do not believe that diversification is a long term solution to the agricultural crisis in Europe. Moreover, many farmers have expressed their concerns about agricultural policy changes and the entry to the EU of countries from central and eastern Europe and the consequences this could have on agricultural prices. Farmers in sud Manche appeared not very knowledgeable about the various options to diversification and were quite reluctant to do anything else except producing food. On the other hand, farmers in west Dorset appeared to have more knowledge about diversification and <b>pluriactivity</b> and were more inclined to the idea of producing something else than food production.

40|$|The {{engagement}} of farm businesses with <b>pluriactivity</b> {{in response to}} persistent downward pressures on agricultural incomes provided an enduring focus for research in agricultural geography during the late 20 th century. This study contributes to and further develops the <b>pluriactivity</b> genre of research through a detailed investigation of farm-based recreation. A {{review of existing literature}} reveals that farm-based recreation has been widely acknowledged as a significant component of <b>pluriactivity,</b> yet the reasons for its contemporary development remain largely unexplored for two main interrelated reasons. First, the concept of <b>pluriactivity</b> is inadequate because it places emphasis on income-generating non-agricultural enterprises, yet many recreational activities fill non-economic roles within the farm business and have therefore been ignored in previous research. Secondly, those studies that examine farm-based recreation specifically are anachronistic and suffer from a failure to define it consistently. The variety of recreational activities included within 'recreation' varies considerably between studies. For example, the majority of studies have not included shortterm recreational events in their analyses. The economic nature of these studies is again a handicap. This study resolves definitional issues and presents a conceptual framework for a more rigorous analysis of farm-based recreation than hitherto has been attempted. The framework synthesizes the underlying principles of the established modified political economy approach in agricultural geography with insights from postmodernism in rural geography as represented by the 'cultural turn'. It represents a rational, sensible and profitable approach which combines the major strengths and takes account of the criticisms of both perspectives. Its value for this study is that a flexible methodology can be used to ensure that the analysis is sensitive to the great diversity of both recreational activities and the farm business forms within which they are enmeshed. An extensive postal questionnaire survey of over 4000 farms is conducted in eight geographical regions (counties) selected primarily {{on the basis of their}} agricultural characteristics. This enables the diversity of recreational activities to be fully appreciated and a geographical analysis of them to be undertaken, features rarely explored by the literature. Building upon the quantitative approach of the postal questionnaire survey, 20 individual farm businesses are selected for more detailed qualitative investigation in the form of ethnographic case studies. Using the conceptual framework as a guide, results from both quantitative and qualitative approaches are discussed in an integrative way to provide a novel analysis of farm-based recreation. The results highlight the widespread occurrence of recreational activities. Indeed, 41 % of the postal questionnaire survey respondents provide some form of permanent and/or temporary recreational activity, a figure significantly higher than typically reported in previous studies. Differentiated by broad categories, and specific types, the diversity of different forms of recreational provision becomes apparent, highlighting the occurrence of numerous types rarely documented before. Distinct patterns emerge from an analysis of the inter- and intra-regional incidence of recreational provision. The characteristics of recreational activities and the factors influencing their initiation, operation and evolution are explored. The relatively low level of financial motivation expressed in relation to the initiation of recreational activities is of particular interest (42 % of farms with recreational provision), and highlights the abundance of non-financially motivated forms and the importance of interest, altruistic and social motives. Clear variations in motives according to categories, and types, of recreational activity are also observed and two broad groups, characterised as economic 'diversification recreation' and non-economic 'cultural recreation', emerge. Detailed analysis of the relationships between recreational provision and farm business characteristics and operation identifies many strong links. Finally, an exploration of the reasons for the non-adoption of recreational activities is undertaken. With a renewed policy emphasis on rural development, including on-farm diversification, from the Agenda 2000 reform of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) currently being implemented, these findings make a significant contribution to the understanding of a phenomenon that is likely to be important to both farmers and researchers in agricultural geography in the early 21 st century...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{analytical}} framework “heritage and patrimony of the peasantry” and its recommended implementation theoretically {{provide an}} enhancement over previous methodologies to examine rural development. The current paper measures rural development indicators in six Mexican rural territories, and analyses their interaction in the heritages and patrimonies of the peasantry. The principal indicators {{that affect the}} patrimonies in these regions were recognised as <b>Pluriactivity,</b> Social Acknowledgment, Biodiversity and Recycling. Based on these outcomes, the indicators that belong to the Human Patrimony define it as the lowest of all the heritages of the Mexican peasantry. The analysis of the results remarks {{on the fact that}} the emphasis of public policies on productive concerns has left out complicated social problems such as the loss of identity, diversity and culture. These matters are becoming the strongest threat affecting the Mexican peasantry to improve their quality of life while respecting their human rights...|$|E
40|$|European {{agricultural}} and environmental policy has evolved considerably {{over the last}} 15 years. In this paper the changes in farm businesses in an Environmentally Sensitive Area in England are evaluated based on two surveys with the same farmers at the start and end of this period. The rate {{of participation in the}} environmental scheme had increased significantly at a time when Government led goals in this area had developed and become more output focussed. A combination of policy, market and animal health status changes had encouraged a number to leave cattle production, and though remaining with stock and grass they had decided against any extensive development in the direction of <b>pluriactivity</b> – with or without Government encouragement. This left the future of this group in some uncertainty given that two significant forms of financial support, the environmental scheme and the Hill Farm Allowance, were due to close. ...|$|E
