40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} {{the importance of}} shear mechanisms on reinforced concrete (RC) beams and comparing with CFRP <b>externally</b> <b>reinforced</b> beams under static and impact loading. A total of six RC beams were tested in two groups: shear-deficient (A) and <b>externally</b> <b>reinforced</b> beams (B) with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP). All beams designed had identical reinforcement properties with the intent to investigate the influences of composite materials on the overall results. Emphasis was placed on crack propagation, experimental failure modes and prevention methods. Experimental results confirm that increases in the shear reinforcement decreases the overall impact displacement, indicating that the shear properties influence the performance of the beams under impact loading.

40|$|A {{new method}} for repair or {{strengthening}} of metallic structures {{has been developed}} and investigated during the recent years. The traditional way of upgrading metallic beam elements have been by use of additional metallic plates, which have been either bolted or welded to the existing substrate.

However, lapped plates, precracking and variable glue thickness had no effect on the structural behaviour of the beams. Beams with multiple layers of plates behave almost similar to beams with single plates of the same total sectional area. The beams strengthened with thick plates (3 and 6  mm) fail led by the sudden separation of the plate ends together with the concrete cover, before reaching their ultimate load.|$|R

40|$|With the {{technology}} {{development on the}} compressive strength of concrete over the years, the use of high strength concrete has proved most popular in terms of economy, superior strength, stiffness and durability due to many advantages it could offer. However, strength and ductility are inversely proportional. High strength concrete is a brittle material causing failure to be quite sudden and ‘explosive’ under loads. It is also known that structural concrete columns concentrically compressed rarely occur in practice. The stress concentrations caused by the eccentric loading further reduce the strength and ductility of high strength concrete. Therefore, studies for high strength concrete columns under eccentric loading are essential for the practical use.

40|$|Abstract: The use of <b>externally</b> bonded fiber <b>reinforced</b> polymer (FRP) fabrics to {{strengthen}} and rehabilitate existing concrete structures has recently received {{a great deal}} of attention within the Civil Engineering community. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of externally bonded FRP strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) structures. The overall performance of the strengthened system depends highly upon the bond quality between the concrete and the FRP laminate. Low bond strength can cause de-lamination and result in a premature failure of a repaired structure. Failure of RC members strengthened with FRP fabrics may be caused by crushing of the concrete, rupture of FRP laminate, or by the de-lamination of the FRP laminate. When a peeling or de-lamination failure can be avoided, a more effective engagement of the FRP sheet occurs which results in more efficient use of material. To that end, an experimental program was undertaken to investigate the effect of a broad range of surface roughnesses and concrete strengths on bond performance. The specimens used in the study were unreinforced concrete beams and prisms that were <b>externally</b> <b>reinforced</b> with CFRP fabrics after varying surface preparation was completed. The specimens were then tested using either a flexural or direct shear test method. Test results indicated that the strength of the concrete substrate, the surface roughness level, and the roughness technique utilized influenced the bond strength of the FRP laminate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Timber was the {{material}} of choice for {{a large number of}} Australian infrastructure projects during the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Many of these timber structures have lasted well and remain in use today. However, some important timber structures, particularly timber road and rail bridges, are reaching a critical point in their life as codes call on them to carry loads above their capacity or their condition has deteriorated to a point where they are no longer considered safe, or a combination of both. It is often not financially viable or convenient in the short term to replace these bridges. It is proposed it may be possible for managers of civil infrastructure to be able to quickly, inexpensively and significantly improve the structural behaviour of timber bridges and extend their service life until they are able to be taken out of service and replaced. This paper in-vestigates the use of fibre composite materials to rehabilitate timber structures such as these.

The uncracked push-off specimens were either <b>externally</b> <b>reinforced</b> with CFRP sheets with a reinforcement ratio of 0. 8 % and 1. 6 % or internally with CFRP bars as additional shear reinforcement corresponding to 0. 8 % reinforcement ratio.

The effects of varying anchorage length of the CFRP on the shear friction capacity of the push-off specimens with externally bonded reinforcement (EBR) were studied through various strengthening schemes. Experimental results showed an increase in shear strength ranging from 23 – 84 % compared to the unstrengthened control specimens. Tests with various wrapping schemes showed no evidence that additional shear friction capacity can be developed when beyond a sufficient anchorage length.

In this study, a conventional test method based on a three-point bending beam (3 PBB) specimen, used commonly for determining Mode-I fracture properties of concrete and rock, is adapted to characterize Mode-I fracture of concrete-FRP bonded interfaces. Two types of fiber fabrics: E-glass and Carbon are used, and a common epoxy resin is applied to bond the concrete-concrete and concrete-composite interfaces. Mode-I fracture tests of the 3 PBB specimens for concrete-concrete, concrete-E-glass/epoxy composite, and concrete-Carbon/epoxy composite bonded interfaces are performed to determine the applied loads and load point displacements, from which critical strain energy release rates are obtained.
