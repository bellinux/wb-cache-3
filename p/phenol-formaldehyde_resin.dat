50|$|HPL {{consists}} {{of more than}} 60 to 70% paper, with the remaining 30 to 40% a combination of <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> for the core layers and melamine-formaldehyde resin for the surface layer. Both resins belong to a class of thermosetting resins which crosslink during the press cycle creating irreversible chemical bonds that produce a nonreactive, stable material with characteristics different and superior {{to those of the}} component parts.|$|E

50|$|Friction {{particles}} {{are made by}} polymerizing the unsaturated side chain of cardanol, followed by cross-polymerization with formaldehyde to yield a cardanol-formaldehyde resin by a process analogous {{to the formation of}} <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> such as Bakelite. Cardanol-phenol resins were developed in the 1920s by Mortimer T. Harvey, then a student at Columbia University. These resins found use in vehicle brakes after it was found that they had a coefficient of friction that was less sensitive to temperature changes than <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Condensed tannins, e.g., {{quebracho}} tannin, and Hydrolyzable tannins, e.g., chestnut tannin, {{appear to}} be able to substitute a high proportion of synthetic phenol in <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> for wood particleboard.|$|R
50|$|Para {{tertiary}} butylphenol formaldehyde resin {{also known}} as p-tert-butylphenol-formaldehyde resin (PTBP-FR) or 4-(1,1-dimethylethyl) phenol (PTBP Formaldehyde) is a <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> found in commercial adhesives, and in particular in adhesives used to bond leather and rubber. It has broad usage in a large variety of industries {{and can be found}} in many household items and textile products, and in particular it is used in the manufacture of shoes.|$|E
50|$|In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet {{started the}} first {{artificial}} fiber plant based on regenerated cellulose, or viscose rayon, {{as a substitute}} for silk, but it was very flammable. In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic polymer, a thermosetting <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> called Bakelite. Around the same time, Hermann Leuchs reported the synthesis of amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides and their high molecular weight products upon reaction with nucleophiles, but stopped short of referring to these as polymers, possibly due to the strong views espoused by Emil Fischer, his direct supervisor, denying the possibility of any covalent molecule exceeding 6,000 daltons. Cellophane was invented in 1908 by Jocques Brandenberger who squirted sheets of viscose rayon into an acid bath.|$|E
50|$|Shellac {{was once}} used for fixing inductor, motor, {{generator}} and transformer windings, {{where it was}} applied directly to single layer windings in an alcohol solution. For multi-layer windings, the whole coil was submerged in shellac solution, then drained {{and placed in a}} warm place to allow the alcohol to evaporate. The shellac then locks the wire turns in place, provides extra insulation and prevents movement and vibration, reducing buzz and hum. In motors and generators it also helps transfer force generated by magnetic attraction and repulsion from the windings to the rotor or armature. In more recent times, synthetic resins, such as glyptol, (Glyptal), have been substituted for the shellac. Some applications use shellac mixed with other natural or synthetic resins, such as pine resin or <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin,</b> of which Bakelite is the best known, for electrical use. Mixed with other resins, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, zinc sulfide, aluminium oxide and/or cuprous carbonate (malachite), shellac forms a component of heat-cured capping cement used to fasten the caps or bases to the bulbs of electric lamps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins,</b> as a group, {{are formed}} by a {{step-growth}} polymerization reaction {{that can be}} either acid- or base-catalysed. Since formaldehyde exists predominantly in solution as a dynamic equilibrium of methylene glycol oligomers, the concentration of the reactive form of formaldehyde depends on temperature and pH.|$|R
2500|$|Formaldehyde {{is also a}} {{precursor}} to polyfunctional alcohols such as pentaerythritol, {{which is used to}} make paints and explosives. Other formaldehyde derivatives include methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, an important component in polyurethane paints and foams, and hexamine, which is used in <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> as well as the explosive RDX.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} has been to {{characterize}} {{the relation between the}} pyrolysis temperature of <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin,</b> the development of a porous structure, and the mechanical properties for the application of semipermeable membranes for gas separation. No previous study has dealt with this problem in its entirety. <b>Phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> showed an increasing trend toward micropore porosity in the temperature range from 500 till 1000 °C, together with closure of mesopores and macropores. Samples cured and pyrolyzed at 1000 °C pronounced hysteresis of desorption branch. The ultimate bending strength was measured using a four-point arrangement that is more suitable for measuring of brittle materials. The chevron notch technique was used for determination the fracture toughness. The results for mechanical properties indicated that <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> pyrolyzates behaved similarly to ceramic materials. The data obtained for the material can be used for calculating the technical design of gas separation membranes...|$|E

40|$|By using lignin {{extracted}} from steam-exploded wood as adhesive in plywood and hot-pressed fibreboards to substitute <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> is reported. Mixtures of commercial <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> containing 10 % lignin by weight tested as plywood binders {{under conditions of}} factory production show satisfactory cohesion. Properties of sample boards containing different amount of lignin adhesive are compared between themselves and with the EU standards for fibreboards. A strong correlation of density and form stability under humid conditions with the lignin content is found. Results of testing mechanical properties of the boards suggest that effect of lignin on mechanical strength depends {{on the size of}} particles and hot-pressing temperature. Steam explosion and hot-pressing technologies tested in the study are shown to have potential of utilizing low-quality wood and waste from forest industry to make value-added products. The estimates based on a simple model of energy flows show the energy required by steam explosion pre-treatment of biomass being within 10 % of the heat content of biomass...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPure zinc {{and zinc}} hybrid {{coatings}} containing <b>phenol–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> particles were prepared by electrodeposition from zinc sulfate electrolytes. The effect of mean diameter size of particles on the morphology and topography of the surfaces was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). It was shown that pure zinc coating has a regular surface, whereas the hybrid coating surfaces have fine surface structure. The corrosion resistance in 0. 5 M sodium chloride was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques.

40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} course of <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> extended with thiolignin {{was investigated in}} air at atmospheric pressure by means of thermoanalytical methods. The sample resins were prepared with the conditions that ratio of thiolignin to phenol was 1. 0 in weight and ratio of formaldehyde to phenol was 2. 0 in mol., then, were cured by heating at 140 ℃. The DTA curves of the cured phenol-formaldehyde resins extended with thiolignin showed two peaks of exothermal reactions at lower temperatures than 550 ℃. The first exothermal peak (310 ～ 340 ℃) was attributed to thermoxidation of thiolignin, and the second (510 ～ 540 ℃) was done mainly to thermooxidation of <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b> The temperature at first exothermal peak was as follows (ref.

50|$|Base-catalysed <b>phenol-{{formaldehyde}}</b> <b>resins</b> {{are made}} with a formaldehyde to phenol ratio of greater than one (usually around 1.5). These resins are called resoles. Phenol, formaldehyde, water and catalyst are mixed in the desired amount, depending on the resin to be formed, and are then heated.

40|$|<b>Phenol–formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> and a {{low-cost}} biomass residue, olive stones (OS), {{were used to}} prepare five activated carbons for CO 2 separation at atmospheric pressure, i. e., in post-combustion processes or from biogas and bio-hydrogen streams. Two <b>phenol–formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> were synthesized: Resol, obtained by using alkaline environment, and Novolac, synthesized {{in the presence of}} an acid catalyst. Carbon precursors were prepared by mixing both resins with KCl or by mixing the Novolac resin with OS. The precursors were carbonized under an inert atmosphere of N 2 at different temperatures. The last stage in the synthesis of the adsorbents involved physical activation with carbon dioxide, which was carried out at different temperatures and burn-off degrees. Response surface methodology (RSM) is proposed as a tool for rapidly optimizing the activation parameters in order to obtain the highest possible CO 2 capture capacity of activated carbons. The optimum values of activation temperature and burn-off degree that maximize CO 2 uptake by the activated carbons at 35 °C and atmospheric pressure were obtained within the experimental region.

40|$|In {{the present}} work we study the {{hydroxide}} activation (NaOH and KOH) of <b>phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> derived CNFs prepared by a polymer blend technique to prepare highly porous activated carbon nanofibres (ACNFs). Morphology and textural characteristics of these ACNFs were studied and their hydrogen storage capacities at 77 K (at 0. 1 MPa and at high pressures up to 4 MPa) were assessed, and compared, with reported capacities of other porous carbon materials. <b>Phenol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> derived carbon fibres were successfully activated {{with these two}} alkaline hydroxides rendering highly microporous ACNFs with reasonable good activation process yields up to 47 wt. % compared to 7 wt. % yields from steam activation for similar surface areas of 1500 m 2 /g or higher. These nano-sized activated carbons present interesting H 2 storage capacities at 77 K which are comparable, or even higher, to other high quality microporous carbon materials. This observation is due, in part, to their nano-sized diameters allowing to enhance their packing densities to 0. 71 g/cm 3 and hence their resulting hydrogen storage capacities.
