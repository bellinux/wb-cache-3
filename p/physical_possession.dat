5|$|On October 8, 2005, at New Japan Pro Wrestling's (NJPW) Toukon Souzou New Chapter {{event in}} Tokyo, Japan, Brock Lesnar {{defeated}} Kazuyuki Fujita and Masahiro Chono in a Three Way {{match for the}} IWGP Heavyweight Championship. He held the title for 280 days, having three successful defenses, until he {{failed to show up}} for a scheduled title defense. NJPW thus stripped Lesnar of the championship on July 15, 2006. Lesnar cited visa issues along with NJPW owing him compensation for his reasons at failing to appear at the planned title defense. After this series of events, NJPW founder Antonio Inoki left NJPW and created a new promotion, the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF). Inoki then recognized Lesnar as the IWGP Heavyweight Champion due to Lesnar never having lost the championship in a match and Lesnar still maintaining <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of the title belt. NJPW recognized Lesnar as the IWGP 3rd Belt Champion and not the IWGP Heavyweight Champion, maintaining their stance on having stripped him of the title in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Hard Justice was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the {{champion}} Samoa Joe and the challenger Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title, which Joe won to remain champion. The duo also fought at TNA's previous PPV event Victory Road on July13, which ended in a no contest after interference from Sting allowed Booker T to gain an unofficial pinfall counted by his legitimate wife Sharmell instead of an official referee. On the July17 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T proclaimed {{that he was the}} new TNA World Heavyweight Champion before Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Booker T did not win the match and that Joe was still the TNA World Heavyweight Champion, despite Booker T having taken possession of the title belt. Cornette then scheduled a rematch between the two for the title at Hard Justice; Joe did not retrieve <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of the title belt after this, instead chose to reclaim the physical belt after he beat Booker T at the event. On the July24 episode of Impact!, Joe and Booker T made the contest a Six Sides of Steel Weapons match.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{hunter-gatherer}} societies tend to {{have little}} corporal punishment whereas agricultural and industrial societies tend to progressively have more.

25|$|Denis de Rougemont {{said that}} the troubadours were {{influenced}} by Cathar doctrines which rejected {{the pleasures of the}} flesh and that they were metaphorically addressing the spirit and soul of their ladies. Rougemont also said that courtly love subscribed to the code of chivalry, and therefore a knight's loyalty was always to his King before his mistress. Edmund Reiss claimed it was also a spiritual love, but a love that had more in common with Christian love, or caritas. On the other hand, scholars such as Mosché Lazar claim it was adulterous sexual love with <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of the lady the desired end.|$|E
25|$|Cargas {{generally}} {{last for}} one year and start small, such as being in charge of cleaning the neighborhood church, collecting alms and acting as a go-between for the priest and parishioners. However, most involve the sponsorship of the many religious festivals {{that take place in}} the city. This system {{is one of the more}} complex of its type in the world. Receiving a carga gives the person, called a mayordomo, prestige from the community since he is considered to be working for the common good. Mayordomos can be men, women and even children. The most prestigious carga is to be the mayordomo of the neighborhood's patron saint. This mayordomo receives a certain amount of authority and even a silver scepter along with <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of the image. The wives of these mayordomos, carry silver baskets. Even more prestigious than this is to be a mayordomo of a citywide festival which is organized among the neighborhoods. These include the festival of the Virgin of the Remedies, the Fiesta del Pueblo, and events related to Holy Week.|$|E
25|$|At Lockdown, Joe {{defeated}} Angle to win {{his first}} TNA World Championship and become TNA's third Triple Crown Champion. The stipulation of the match was if Joe had lost, {{he would have had}} to retire from professional wrestling. He defeated Angle in a rematch on Impact! and then retained against Scott Steiner and Kaz at Sacrifice. At Slammiversary, Joe became the first champion to ever retain his title in a King of the Mountain match. Joe was then challenged to a match by Booker T at Victory Road, which he accepted. At Victory Road the match went to a No Contest when Sting hit Joe with a baseball bat and Booker pinned him while Sharmell made the three count. At Hard Justice, Joe defeated Booker after a guitar shot, thus reclaiming <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of the title belt, which Booker had kept after Victory Road. At Bound for Glory IV, he fought Sting in a losing effort to defend the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, ending his reign at 182 days.|$|E

The fallout that shocked the Muay Thai community forced Namsaknoi into retirement, as no gym was able to pay Por Pramuk's asking price to buy over Namsaknoi's contract.

50|$|Important widely {{recognized}} types of property include real property (the combination {{of land and}} any improvements to or on the land), personal property (<b>physical</b> <b>possessions</b> belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights over artistic creations, inventions, etc.), although the last is not always as {{widely recognized}} or enforced. An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. A title, or a right of ownership, establishes {{the relation between the}} property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit.|$|R
25|$|Booker T turned heel for {{the first}} time in TNA at Sacrifice by attacking Christian Cage and Rhino from behind with a steel chair. This came about as a result of losing a tag team match up against Christian Cage and Rhino, with them furthering {{themselves}} in the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament. Booker then competed in the King of the Mountain match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary. He was seconds away from winning the match, when Kevin Nash stopped him and performed a Jackknife Powerbomb; Samoa Joe would later go on to win the match. On the next Impact!, Booker challenged Joe to a title match at Victory Road, which Joe would later accept. Also around this time he reverted to a gimmick similar to his King Booker gimmick albeit while proclaiming himself a supposed king of Africa. The match at Victory Road ended in a draw after Sharmell replaced the referee and counted after the match was already over. At Hard Justice, Samoa Joe defeated Booker after a guitar shot, thus reclaiming <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of the title belt, which Booker had kept after Victory Road. Later he introduced the TNA Legends Championship and became the first official champion and defended it on several occasions before losing it to A.J. Styles.|$|E

[...] "The big payoff for me," [...] he said, [...] "was actually possessing whatever it was I had stolen. I really enjoyed having something ... that I had wanted and gone out and taken." [...] Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well. Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to [...] "totally possess" [...] his victims. At first, he killed his victims [...] "as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [...] caught"; but later, murder became part of the [...] "adventure".

500|$|Common law tracing {{is where}} the {{claimant}} seeks to identify property that belongs to him at common law. This is where <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of the property passes, but not legal ownership. The problem with common law tracing is that the property must be identifiable; if it has been mixed with other property, such as money paid into an account with other money from a different source, it cannot be successfully recovered. It is also essential that the involuntary transfer did not also transfer the legal title, nor any succeeding transfer. If this has happened, the property is also not recoverable under the common law. Someone with an equitable interest in the property but no legal title, as in MCC Proceeds v Lehman Brothers, cannot recover the money under common law. Due to these limitations, [...] "many leading academics and judges" [...] have suggested that common law tracing should be completely merged with equitable tracing.|$|E
5000|$|Babalú-Ayé is an Orisha {{strongly}} associated with infectious disease and healing. The name Babalú-Ayé translates as “Father, lord of the Earth” {{and points to the}} authority this orisha exercises on all things earthly, including the body, wealth, and <b>physical</b> <b>possessions.</b> In West Africa, he was {{strongly associated}} with epidemics of smallpox, leprosy, influenza, ebola, and HIV/AIDS. [...] Although {{strongly associated with}} illness and disease, Babalú-Ayé is also the spirit that cures these ailments. Both feared and loved, Babalú-Ayé is sometimes referred to as the “Wrath of the supreme god” because he punishes people for their transgressions. People hold Babalú-Ayé in great respect and avoid calling his actual name, because they do not wish to invoke epidemics.|$|R
3000|$|... 51. Peter Harvey holds similar opinion, as he says, “ Working with a rebirth {{perspective}} {{also helps}} sustain a long-term motivation for {{moral and spiritual}} practice. While death means that one loses all <b>physical</b> <b>possessions,</b> and is parted from one’s loved ones and one’s life’s ‘attainments’, the purification of character that is developed by ethical and meditative practice is seen as something that death does not destroy [...]. It becomes part of one’s mental continuum that will‘spill over’into another life. In that life, the spiritual development of this life may be neglected or further built on: but at the very least, it {{can act as a}} positive residue of this life, {{to be used as a}} foundation for further development. The opposite applies in the case of bad character-traits.” Harvey (2000), p. 29.|$|R
5000|$|A {{psychological}} adaptation for {{the purpose}} of reproductive success can be seen in female mate choice. David Buss, an evolutionary psychologist, examines the fundamental principles of selection pressures that create human mate preferences in his contribution to the publication The Adapted Mind. [...] Females have evolved psychological procedures that affect mating decisions in relation to certain male physical attributes and behaviours. [...] Robert Trivers, an evolutionary biologist, outlines the evolutionary basis of these preferences in relation to parental investment and sexual selection. [...] He proposes that females have adapted a preference to mate with males who display both an ability and willingness to invest vital resources for the survival of the female and her offspring. Research suggests females are able to use external cues displayed by males such as territory or <b>physical</b> <b>possessions.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Act first {{identifies}} the occupier. Section 1(2) {{identifies the}} occupier {{as the person}} occupying or {{in control of the}} premises, not necessarily the owner, with the underlying premise being that the person liable should be the person most likely {{to have been able to}} prevent the harm; the person occupying the premises, not necessarily the owner of those premises. The Act does not define occupier, but provides that the person to be treated as the occupier is the person who would be considered an occupier under common law rules. In Wheat v E Lacon & Co Ltd [...] 1 All ER 582 it was established that more than one person can be an occupier. In Harris v Birkenhead Corporation [...] it was held that it was possible to be an occupier without having <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of the house if the [...] "occupier" [...] has legal control of the property. Section 1(3) extends the standards set by the Act not only to land but to any fixed or movable structure, which includes ships and aircraft.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, in {{an attempt}} to {{maintain}} secrecy over the impending release of the fifth Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against [...] "the person or persons who has or have <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants". The ruling obtained, {{for the first time in}} British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, [...] "The new Harry Potter style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, so long as you could find a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified 'those who are included and those who are not'". The [...] "Potter injunction" [...] was later used against a camp of Roma travellers.

500|$|After denying to a {{reporter}} just {{a month before the}} election that he had a Crédit Mobilier connection, Wilson admitted involvement when he gave testimony before a Senate committee on February 13, 1873. [...] Wilson told members of the investigating committee that in December 1867 he had agreed to purchase $2,000 in Crédit Mobilier stock (20 shares) using Mrs. Wilson's money and in her name. [...] According to Wilson, his wife and he later had concerns about the propriety of the transaction and had never taken possession of the actual stock certificates, so Wilson asked Ames to cancel the transaction and Ames refunded the $2,000 purchase price to Wilson. [...] Wilson said he then returned $814 to Ames – $748 in dividends and $66 in interest that Mrs. Wilson had supposedly earned as profits, even though she had not taken <b>physical</b> <b>possession</b> of her shares. [...] Wilson further claimed that because Mrs. Wilson had refused to take these proceeds from Ames, Wilson took it upon himself to pay her $814 from his own funds to compensate her for the profit she would have made if she had kept the stock, which he said he felt obligated to do because his wife had originally agreed to purchase the stock on his recommendation, and had lost money by following his later recommendation to cancel the transaction.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of academic {{papers on the}} Internet auction design do not distinguish between the auctioneer and the object owner, whereas nowadays leading Internet auction websites operate primarily as mediators that provide the platforms with no <b>physical</b> <b>possessions</b> of the auction objects. The role separation between the auctioneer and the object owner (seller) creates both incentive misalignment and information asymmetry issues. In this paper, we acknowledge this role separation and study the optimal (revenue-maximizing) auction mechanism from the mediator's perspective, {{taking into account the}} costly participation from both the sellers and the buyers. We show that the mechanism induces participation from low-valuation sellers and high-valuation buyers. Compared with the conventional seller-optimal auction, the seller in the mediator-optimal mechanism keeps the object more frequently ex post because the mediator intentionally compensates the seller for withholding the object. This exacerbated ex post allocative inefficiency also gives rise to too little ex ante participation for both the seller and the buyers. We propose a simple two-stage mechanism for implementation that is reminiscent of some widely observed Internet auctions. Our qualitative results are robust against model variations such as heterogeneous participation costs, multiple units, and multiple sellers. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

At the police station, the officers seized two cell phones from Wurie’s person, including the [...] "flip phone" [...] at issue in this case. Shortly after arriving at the station, police noticed that the phone was receiving multiple calls from a source identified as “my house” on the phone's external screen.

They secured a search warrant for the location and, during the ensuing search, found 215 grams of crack cocaine, marijuana, drug paraphernalia, a firearm, ammunition, and cash. Wurie was subsequently charged with drug and firearm offenses. He moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of the apartment, but the District Court denied the motion, and Wurie was convicted.
