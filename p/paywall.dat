25|$|During development, Kojima Productions and Konami {{attracted}} {{criticism for}} {{their decision to}} include microtransactions; a system that allows players to pay for access to content in the game. However, a spokesperson for Kojima Productions confirmed that the system was included to benefit players {{who may not have}} the time to complete the game, given its scale, and that no content would be available exclusively through microtransactions. Further controversy emerged following the publication of an early review claiming that the Forward Operating Base mode was behind a <b>paywall,</b> which Konami refuted saying that microtransactions acted as an accelerator rather than a <b>paywall.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Paywalls</b> {{have become}} controversial, with partisans arguing over the {{effectiveness}} of <b>paywalls</b> in generating revenue and their effect on media in general. Critics of <b>paywalls</b> include many businesspeople, academics such as media professor Jay Rosen, and journalists such as Howard Owens and media analyst Matthew Ingram of GigaOm. Those who see potential in <b>paywalls</b> include investor Warren Buffett, former Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Some have changed their opinions of <b>paywalls.</b> Felix Salmon of Reuters was initially an outspoken skeptic of <b>paywalls,</b> but later expressed the opinion {{that they could be}} effective. [...] A NYU media theorist, Clay Shirky, was initially a skeptic of <b>paywalls,</b> but in May 2012 wrote, [...] "Newspapers should turn to their most loyal readers for income, via a digital subscription service of the sort the York Times" [...] <b>Paywalls</b> are rapidly changing journalism, with an impact on its practice and business model, and on freedom of information on the Internet, that is yet unclear.|$|R
40|$|The Master's diploma thesis {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} imposing <b>paywalls</b> on news content. By using qualitative interview research, case studies, theoretical and empirical analysis the thesis emphasizes mainly the differences between individual ways of imposing <b>paywalls</b> and also factors that can influence the process of implementing <b>paywalls.</b> Hypothesis claims that imposing <b>paywalls</b> on existing free content can serve as an incentive on the media market to reach a growing productivity of media enterprises {{in spite of a}} booming popularity of sharing free information. It depends whether the right business model is implemented. According to the hypothesis the right model is "metered model" that responds {{to the nature of the}} internet and implies that certain amount of content would remain free of charge. Both paid and free content spheres should have to be redefined by new ergonomy and new journalistic content...|$|R

Four years later the FT launched its HTML5 mobile internet app. Smartphones and tablets now drive 12% of subscriptions and 19% of traffic to FT.com.

500|$|Falling print {{advertising}} revenue and projections of continued decline {{resulted in a}} <b>paywall</b> being instituted in 2011, regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100million in revenue [...] The <b>paywall</b> was announced on March 17, 2011, that starting on March 28, 2011 (March 17, 2011, for Canada), it would charge frequent readers for access to its online content. Readers {{would be able to}} access up to 20 articles each month without charge. (Although beginning in April 2012, the number of free-access articles was halved to just ten articles per month.) Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription. This plan would allow free access for occasional readers, but produce revenue from [...] "heavy" [...] readers. Digital subscriptions rates for four weeks range from $15 to $35 depending on the package selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99Â¢. Subscribers to the paper's print edition get full access without any additional fee. Some content, such as the front page and section fronts will remain free, as well as the Top News page on mobile apps. In January 2013, The New York Times Public Editor Margaret M. Sullivan announced {{that for the first time}} in many decades, the paper generated more revenue through subscriptions than through advertising.|$|E

Between September 2011 and March 2014, the Globe gradually withdrew stories written by Globe journalists from Boston.com, making the sites more and more separated. BostonGlobe.com was designed to emphasize a premium experience focusing on content and emulating the visual appearance of The Boston Globe newspaper; the site was {{one of the first}} major websites to use a responsive design which automatically adapts its layout to a device's screen size. Boston.com followed suit in 2014.

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the {{availability}} of news via [...] and then {{the availability of}} online journalism posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid circulation has declined, while advertising revenueâwhich makes {{up the bulk of}} most newspapers' incomeâhas been shifting from print to the new media (social media websites and news websites), resulting in a general decline in print newspapers' revenues and profits. Many newspapers around the world launched online editions in the 2000s, in an attempt to follow or stay ahead of their audience. One of the big challenges is that a number of online news websites, such as Google news, are free to access. Some online news sites are free, and rely on online advertising; other online news sites have a <b>paywall</b> and require paid subscription for access. However, in the non-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, the growing middle class and other factors have more than compensated for the emergence of electronic media and newspapers continue to grow.|$|E
