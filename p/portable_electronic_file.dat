40|$|Air traffic service {{providers}} are increasingly embracing electronic {{alternatives to the}} traditional paper Flight Progress Strip (FPS). However, most development of such electronic systems, and of Decision Support Tools (DSTs) in general, has centered on radar-based en route or terminal-area facilities, rather than the airport air traffic control tower. Based on {{an analysis of the}} unique human factors requirements of the control tower environment, a prototype <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS has been designed that also serves as an interface to a DST for departure operations. The <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS has been implemented using a system of networked, handheld computers as prototype hardware. A study has been conducted to evaluate the usability of the <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS. The study consisted of a human-in-the-loop experiment that simulated the tasks an air traffic controller performs at a major airport. Three issues were explored: the importance of FPS portability, the appropriateness of departure sequence DST advisories distributed onto each <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS, and the advantages of interaction mechanisms enabled by an electronic interface. Test subjects used multiple versions of the <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS as well as a current-day paper FPS. Quantitative measures of departure sequencing efficiency and traffic monitoring ability were recorded for each test subject, as well as subjective FPS preference rankings. This paper reviews the final design and prototype implementation of the <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS, presents the design and results of the usability study, and suggests future research that should be pursued in order to create an operationally deployable <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS system...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in using electronic alternatives to the paper Flight Progress Strip (FPS) for air traffic control. However, most research has been centered on radar-based control environments, and has not considered the unique operational needs of the airport air traffic control tower. Based on {{an analysis of the}} human factors issues for control tower Decision Support Tool (DST) interfaces, a requirement has been identified for an interaction mechanism which replicates the advantages of the paper FPS (e. g., minimal head-down time, portability) but also enables input and output with DSTs. An approach has been developed which uses a <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS that has attributes of both a paper flight strip and an electronic flight strip. The prototype <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> Flight Progress Strip system uses handheld computers to replace individual paper strips in addition to a central management interface which is displayed on a desktop computer. Each electronic FPS is connected to the management interface via a wireless local area network. The <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPSs replicate the core functionality of paper flight strips and have additional features which provide an interface to a DST. A departure DST is used as a motivating example. This report presents the rationale for a <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS system and discusses the formatting and functionalities of the prototype displays. A usability study has been conducted to determine the utility of the <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS in comparison to paper flight strips. This study consisted of a human-in-the-loop experiment which simulated the tasks of an air traffic controller in an airport control tower environment. Specific issues explored during the experiment include the appropriateness of displaying departure advisories on the <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS, the importance of FPS portability, and the advantages of interaction mechanisms enabled by an electronic interface. Experimental results are presented which show that test subjects preferred the <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS to a paper FPS. However, results for performance-based measures were partially confounded by a dominance of practice effects, experimental limitations, and characteristics of the prototype hardware itself. The implications of the experimental results are discussed with the aim of directing further research toward the goal of creating an operationally-deployable <b>Portable</b> <b>Electronic</b> FPS system. Future research should explore emergent display technologies which better emulate the physical characteristics of the paper FPS. Once this is accomplished, higher-fidelity performance-based analyses may be conducted, engaging air traffic controllers on design and implementation issues.

40|$|As the {{frequency}} and diversity of use of <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> devices by drivers has increased, so have the roadway safety concerns associated with such multitasking.

It would be instructive to see how this group behaves in terms of its own <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> device use while driving. An internet survey was distributed to members of two prominent professional society technical groups in driver safety.
