This revealed a problem in NASA's checksum system, which traced back to the lack of the <b>plus</b> <b>character</b> (+) on the teletype machines used at NASA, which ultimately {{turned out to be a}} problem from the punch card era that occurred when NORAD updated from the BCD to EBCDIC character set on the computer sending out the updates.

Nowadays, characterbuilding-based curriculum has been promoted throughout the country to educate students 2 ̆ 7 character building. It also soon becomes the government 2 ̆ 7 s concern and urgency to teach character building to students of any level as it is mentioned in the Decree of National Education Ministry number 045 /U/ 2002. However, there are some problematic matters in designing its teaching materials whether it is between didactic and non-didactic or implied and vice versa method of teaching. To propose a prospective solution of teaching character building to students; therefore, this paper aims to probe and to share a case study from the readers of O. Henry 2 ̆ 7 s After Twenty Years who happen to be the students of Book Report class at English Language and Literature Department of Jenderal Soedirman University in Purwokerto Central Java. The short story is given to the students as the teaching material to seek the most efficient way of teaching them character building as it is reflected within the short story. Given the short story, read it, responded and finally answered the questionnaire, those students are able to identify the character building embedded in that particular literary work and to learn them from the story. Besides, derived from the students 2 ̆ 7 questionnaire, it can be concluded that students can educate themselves the character building through the story by mentioning those learned characters, and they also can show their selfreflection after learning it. In conclusion, there is possibility of using literature as prospective teaching material in educating students 2 ̆ 7 character building by analyzing the qualities embedded in the literature e. g. novels, short stories and poems, and doing this is also a way of empowering literature for a greater life benefit...|$|E
40|$|Medical student {{selection}} {{has been}} a matter of concern and debate for decades and the selection process of students into medical school is currently being challenged. The customary combination of academic results, tests and interviews are conducted by most medical schools worldwide. However, there is growing opinion that admission procedures are inadequate and do not reliably or comprehensively select for all the desirable and predictive traits of a student best suited to practise medicine. If we add to this dilemma the issues surrounding the workforce shortages in rural and remote areas and the pressures on medical schools to produce not only more doctors but supply them in areas of need, the call for better selection procedures becomes paramount. In view of the contrasting evidence for traditional selection procedures, it may be timely to investigate the value of a standardised assessment that informs about personality traits, in particular temperament and character, to help select medical students best suited to particular disciplines and workplace contexts. Temperament is defined as those components of personality that are heritable, developmentally stable and not influenced by socio-cultural learning. Character traits are a reflection of personal goals and values and are therefore specified in terms of ‘subject-object’ relations. They are influenced by socio-cultural learning and mature in progressive steps throughout life. The importance of personality traits has much support through studies that identify characteristics associated with medical students’ specialty choices and doctors in all specialities. Our research question asked; do students who have high intent/interest in rural medicine as a chosen speciality possess a unique profile of temperament and character traits compared with students of low intent/interest? A demographic survey and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI–R 140) were completed by 272 medical students across all four years of a graduate entry medical program. Differences between students with regard to their TCI levels based on gender, level of interest in rural medicine and rural background were explored using T-tests, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis. Analysis confirmed significant differences in one temperament trait of Harm Avoidance (HA) and all three character traits of Self Directedness (SD), Cooperativeness (CO) and Self Transcendence (ST) between students with a high or low interest in rural medicine. Female medical students were significantly different from males in levels of Reward Dependence (RD), CO and HA. Our preliminary findings identified a different profile of temperament and character traits in students with a high or low interest in rural medicine. Distinguishing heritable temperament traits that may be conducive to coping in rural medicine <b>plus</b> <b>character</b> traits that can be influenced and nurtured through education, could provide medical schools with an approach to; 1) modify and ultimately improve their selection process, 2) tailor training policies for rural experiences to produce cohorts of students better equipped to cope with and be retained in a rural environment, and 3) provide well informed counselling to students with an interest in a rural career. Further work has described the temperament and character profiles of rural and urban based doctors...|$|E
