40|$|This study {{investigated}} memory {{in children with}} temporal lobe epilepsy {{and the ability to}} discern hippocampal dysfunction with conventional memory tests that are typically used to detect more global memory impairment. All data was obtained retrospectively from the epilepsy surgery program at a local children’s hospital. The research population consisted of 54 children with intractable epilepsy of temporal onset, balanced across pathology types (with and without hippocampal disease) and other demographics. Each was given a clinical battery prior to surgical intervention, which included the WRAML/WRAML 2 Verbal Learning subtest from which the dependent variables for this study were extracted. The research hypothesis had predicted that memory retention between verbal learning and recall would be worse for participants with pathology that included hippocampal sclerosis than for those with non-hippocampal temporal lobe pathology. A two-way mixed-design ANOVA was used to test the hypothesis, which allowed incorporation of variables of interest related to memory factors, <b>pathology</b> <b>type,</b> and hemispheric laterality, as well as their various interactions. There was {{a significant main effect for}} change in the number of words retained from the final learning trial to the delayed recall. Although the interaction between memory retention and <b>pathology</b> <b>type</b> was not statistically significant, the average of the memory scores as it related to pathology by side did show significance. Thus, results did not support the hypothetical relationship between retention and hippocampal function. However, additional exploratory analyses revealed that the final learning trial by itself was associated with hippocampal pathology, which applied only to those participants with left-hemisphere lesions. Logistic regression with the final learning trial correctly classified 74 percent of participants into the appropriate pathology category, with 81 percent sensitivity to hippocampal dysfunction. Mean participant memory scores were nearly one standard deviation below the normative mean for both delayed recall and total learning scaled scores, regardless of <b>pathology</b> <b>type</b> or lesion hemisphericity. Thus, while the conventionally used indices of the WRAML Verbal Learning test are useful for determining overall memory status, they are not specific to pathological substrate. The within-subject main effect showed an expected loss of information across the time of the delay, but overall the recall score showed no association with hippocampal functioning. This study revealed the possibility of measuring hippocampal function at statistically significant group levels using learning scores from a widely used measure of verbal memory, even in participants with intact contralateral mesial temporal structures. It also indicated that hippocampal structures do not play a role during recall measures given after a standard time delay. Data further demonstrated a role of the hippocampus for encoding and transferring information beyond short term/working memory into long term. During the learning process, the hippocampus appears to work in concert with short-term memory systems, but does not take over the encoding process until enough repetitions have occurred to saturate the working memory buffer. This research represents a small, yet important step forward in our understanding of the hippocampus, with potentially important implications for the future study of memory constructs and mensuration...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: While the {{prevalence}} of maternal While {{the prevalence}} of diabetes mellitus reaches epidemic proportions, most available treatments still focus on the symptoms of the disease, rather than the underlying <b>pathology.</b> <b>Types</b> 1 and 2 diabetes have in common a deficit in β-cell mass. In type 1 diabetes, auto-immune β-cell destruction leads to an absolute deficit in β-cells, while in type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction cause a functional deficit. More recently, however, {{it has been suggested}} that type 2 diabetes is also marked by an absolute deficit in β-cell mass, although a causal relationship has not yet been established. Overall β-cell mass reflects the balance between the dynamic processes of β-cell expansion, through proliferation and neogenesis, and β-cell loss via apoptosis. Given that β-cell mass can be modified significantly by altering the rate of any of these mechanisms, therapies that modulate β-cell expansion and loss have garnered recent interest. We review herein the current therapeutics under investigation as modulators of β-cell mass dynamics, and the basic research that supports these novel therapeutic targets...|$|R

Causes for failure are mainly aseptic loosening of one or both components partially due to wear of articular surfaces and partially to design. The present analysis aimed to identify risk factors and quantify their effects on aseptic failure. Methods Multivariate survival analysis was applied to 4, 750 primary total hip arthroplasties performed between 1995 and 2000.

The worst conditions are male patients, younger than 40 years, affected by sequelae of congenital diseases, operated by a who performed less than 400 total hip artroplasty in the period. Furthermore, cemented cups and stems (less expensive) have a higher risk of failure compared with uncemented ones (more expensive). Conclusion The only variable that affects survival and that can be modified by is the type of prosthesis: a lower cost is associated to a higher risk. Results concerning the risk associated with cemented components are partially in disagreement with studies performed in countries where cemented prostheses are used more often than uncemented ones. </p...|$|E
40|$|The cream skimming? {{effect in}} the {{insurance}} sector occurs when the insurer has the possibility to select individuals whose risk-adjusted per capita payment he considers to be above the expected cost level. To avoid this possibility of selection, the public authority has to determine a financing formula which takes account of the several determinants of costs, to create homogeneous payment groups. We consider the cream skimming effect at the hospital level, through the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and inpatient length of stay. The Belgian hospitals? financing of day of stay is based upon pathologies (APDRG) and age. The omission of SES may be an incentive for hospitals to select its patients. Our data set contains data from 60 Belgian hospitals for the year 1995, i. e. 466, 087 individual observations, with fully comparable explanatory variables such as pathology, age, length of stay and income, and also community- based observations on social isolation and quality of accommodation. We test the incidence of social factors on length of stay controlling for age, <b>pathologies,</b> <b>type</b> of hospital (public or private), occupation rate, and type of exit (death or transfer). The main outcome is that length of stay is decreasing with income, and is positively related to social isolation. Length of stay is also higher for unemployed or retired people, and for benefit-recipients. social factors, selection, cream skimming, length of stay, hospital...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the maternal and neonatal immigrant population and to compare it with the Italian population in the Agostino Gemelli Hospital (Rome). METHODS: This study was a prospective population-based study. We compared 595 newborns from immigrant mothers with 2413 newborns from Italian mothers. Neonatal characteristics included in this study were sex, gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, transfer to pathology units, minor <b>pathologies,</b> and <b>type</b> of breastfeeding at discharge. Maternal characteristics included nationality, age, parity, type of delivery, twin birth, and pathology during the pregnancy. RESULTS: Immigrant newborns comprised 20...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Breast microcalcifications are key diagnostically {{significant}} radiological {{features for}} localisation of malignancy. This study explores {{the hypothesis that}} breast calcification composition {{is directly related to}} the local tissue pathological state. METHODS: A total of 236 human breast calcifications from 110 patients were analysed by mid-Fouries transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy from three different <b>pathology</b> <b>types</b> (112 invasive carcinoma (IC), 64 in-situ carcinomas and 60 benign). The biochemical composition and the incorporation of carbonate into the hydroxyapatite lattice of the microcalcifications were studied by infrared microspectroscopy. This allowed the spectrally identified composition to be directly correlated with the histopathology grading of the surrounding tissue. RESULTS: The carbonate content of breast microcalcifications was shown to significantly decrease when progressing from benign to malignant disease. In this study, we report significant correlations (Po 0. 001) between microcalcification chemical composition (carbonate content and protein matrix: mineral ratios) and distinct pathology grades (benign, in-situ carcinoma and ICs). Furthermore, a significant correlation (Po 0. 001) was observed between carbonate concentrations and carcinoma in-situ sub-grades. Using the two measures of pathology-specific calcification composition (carbonate content and protein matrix: mineral ratios) as the inputs to a two-metric discriminant model sensitivities of 79, 84 and 90 % and specificities of 98, 82 and 96 % were achieved for benign, ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive malignancies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first demonstration of a direct link between the chemical nature of microcalcifications and the grade o...|$|R
