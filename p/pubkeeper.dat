5000|$|There is {{no record}} of the {{identity}} of the candidates before 1747. At that particular year, the [...] "clerk and recorder" [...] from a nonexistent town hall issued notification of election between Squire Blowmedown and Squire Gubbins (waterman and <b>pubkeeper,</b> respectively, in their day-to-day jobs). Both candidates gave out handbills where they praised their own merits and mocked those of their opponent, imitating political leaflets of the day. Same two candidates attended the next election in 1754, again abusing each other and their supporters in their handbills.|$|E
5000|$|The Czechs are the majority, but Krupka is {{a little}} {{cosmopolitan}} town. Some minorities live there as signs of last regimes or political situations. There are some German or scions of them who became Czechs by years. Germans were here on inviting of Czech kings in the Middle Age, but {{a result of the}} World War 2 and followed Benešovy dekrety meant for German people to be moved back to Germany, because lots of them were cooperating with Nazists (not all of them, for example Herta Lindgren - the park in the centre of town was given her name).There are also some Vietnamese who came to the Czech Republic (that time Czechoslovakia) during the communism. They are shopkeepers or <b>pubkeepers,</b> the others are occupied in their national friends´ firms.Peharps the most plentiful minority in Krupka, are the Roma. They are placed in the part called Maršov, exactly at Horní Sídliště. There are lots of problems with some of them. There is a big criminality at Horní Sídliště and most of the Romani are the unemployed. The next, say, group of people living in Krupka are Czechs who had lived in Ukraine and later Soviet Union had to move back to the Czechoslovakia after the World War 2. These people are called [...] "Volynští Češi" [...] or [...] "Volyňáci".|$|R
50|$|The 50-year-old guy Mané {{who was a}} {{resident}} of Mindelo {{on the island of}} São Vicente as a <b>pubkeeper</b> and a youth football (soccer) trainer. He is reminded each day as he was once as a successful goalkeeper. The old admiration for him is steadily disappearing. He is therefore not gaining his opportunity to switch to SL Benfica, the young Kalu in the team trained for his talent in which he wanted him to compete for Benfica. Against the will of his wife, he later made his trip to Lisbon. Not he wanted to see his bestranged son but for the club Benfica {{on the occasion of the}} finals match and for a chance for Kalu to participate. He also urged him to find a sportsman, who then, unlike him decides to change to Benfica. Afterwards he returned to his home island of São Vicente sobered.|$|E
