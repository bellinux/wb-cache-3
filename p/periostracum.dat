5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the <b>periostracum.</b> These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the <b>periostracum</b> is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the <b>periostracum.</b> In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{consists}} of three layers: the outer layer (the <b>periostracum)</b> made of organic matter, a middle layer made of columnar calcite, and an inner layer consisting of laminated calcite, often nacreous.|$|E
5|$|The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily {{absent in}} a number of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that {{consists}} of mainly chitin and conchiolin (a protein hardened with calcium carbonate), except the outermost layer in almost all cases is all conchiolin (see <b>periostracum).</b> Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the questionable exception of Cobcrephora.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the <b>periostracum,</b> a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The <b>periostracum</b> is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
5|$|The spire is a {{protruding}} part of {{the shell}} that includes all of the whorls except the largest and final whorl (known as the body whorl). It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails, such as the closely related and larger goliath conch, Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil. In L.gigas, the glossy finish or glaze around the aperture of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink. It may show a cream, peach or yellow colouration, {{but it can also}} sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta, shading almost to red. The <b>periostracum,</b> a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost {{part of the}} shell surface, is thin and a pale brown or tan colour.|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present {{on the outside of the}} shell. The <b>periostracum,</b> a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{single most}} major aspect of shell {{variation}} within the genus {{is the color}} patterning. In general, many arboreal snails are brightly colored, obvious examples being the bulimulid genera Drymaeus and Liguus, the cepolid Polymita, and the camaenid Papuina. However, Polymita, Liguus and Amphidromus are particularly noted for their color variations. The basic ground color of Amphidromus appears to be yellow, and this color is usually (except for Amphidromus entobaptus) confined to the surface layers of the shell, since worn specimens appear to be nearly devoid of color. In some species the background color is whitish, and a few have dark background colors. The apical whorls are pale, purple, brown, or black, and this sometimes varies within a population (as in A. quadrasi). A few species, for example A. schomburgki, have a deciduous green <b>periostracum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The shell {{has three}} layers. In the pearly mussels {{there is an}} inner {{iridescent}} layer of nacre (mother-of-pearl) composed of calcium carbonate, which is continuously secreted by the mantle; the prismatic layer, a middle layer of chalky white crystals of calcium carbonate in a protein matrix; and the <b>periostracum,</b> an outer pigmented layer resembling a skin. The <b>periostracum</b> is composed of a protein called conchin, and its function {{is to protect the}} prismatic layer from abrasion and dissolution by acids (especially important in freshwater forms where the decay of leaf materials produces acids).|$|E
25|$|The {{shell of}} this species is massive, {{with three or four}} {{prominent}} columellar plicae. It is usually pure white under a heavy brown <b>periostracum,</b> {{but it can also be}} a pale apricot color. It can sometimes be dotted with dark brown.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} bullate, fairly thick, white, spirally striate, with a {{well-developed}} <b>periostracum.</b> There is no spire and no umbilicus. The columella {{is smooth and}} simple. The aperture extends for the whole length of the shell, and is narrower above than below. The apertural lip extends upwards beyond {{the apex of the}} shell.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} rudimentary, auriform, thin, opaque, oval, {{increasing}} irregularly. The protoconch is first smooth, then spirally grooved. The sculpture {{of the adult}} volution is somewhat irregularly and rather distantly spirally grooved, the grooves crossed by coarse irregular and arcuate growth wrinkles. The shell is colorless, glossy chestnut shaded to greenish yellow at the margin. The spire is tinged with reddish brown. The color of the ventral side of the shell is nacreous, gleaming white and purple. The columellar lip is white. The <b>periostracum</b> is thin and polished. The color of <b>periostracum</b> is greenish-olive. The spire is quite flat. The protoconch is of 1½ rapidly increasing whorls. The protoconch is flatly convex, one-seventh of the total length, regular, well defined. The shell has two whorls. The adult half whorl is the most rapidly increasing, fingernail-shaped, descending at the suture. The suture is deep. The peristome is thin and sharp, the upper lip very little curved. The outer lip is regularly rounded. The basal lip is nearly straight. The columella is very short, subvertical. Inner lip is thickly callous, terminating below in 1 or several minute tubercles, and spreading broadly above over the parietal wall. The inside of the aperture is strongly callous in the centre and towards the columella, {{where there is a}} well-impressed muscular scar of the columellar muscle. A second elongated muscle-scar is situated on the inner side of the basal lip.|$|E
25|$|The {{somewhat}} {{thin and}} fragile shell is {{small compared to}} what is known from the other achatinids in southern Africa, its length/height is less than 45mm with about 7½ whorls. (This description is in contradiction to Connolly (1925), who probably attributes a wrongly identified shell 63.2mm long to this taxon – a statement not repeated in his 1939 monograph.) The length is always more than two times the maximum diameter, which is situated at {{about the level of}} the apex of the aperture. The length of the aperture is always less than half that of the shell; the length of the last whorl in front view is always under three quarters of the total length. The apex is comparatively blunt. The whorls are hardly convex, including the body whorl. The aperture is fairly narrow (greatest width just under the middle) with a thin outer lip; the columella is white, short and narrow, concave with a slight twist, obliquely truncate close to the base. The nepionic whorls are wrinkled and granulose, though always worn in the material studied. The sculpture consists of regular and close wrinkles resulting in a reticulate-granulate pattern, very prominent below the sutures but well visible on all whorls; in addition there are very faint growth striae. All specimens exhibit a close and fine zebra pattern with irregular, orange-brown flames on a yellowish-brown background; there is a very thin and deciduous <b>periostracum.</b> On the whole this seems to be a well-defined taxon because of the size, shape and sculpture of the shell.|$|E
500|$|Each valve {{consists}} of three layers, an outer <b>periostracum</b> made of organic compounds and two biomineralized layers. Articulated brachiopods have an outermost <b>periostracum</b> made of proteins, a [...] "primary layer" [...] of calcite (a form of calcium carbonate) under that, and innermost a mixture of proteins and calcite. Inarticulate brachiopod shells have a similar sequence of layers, but their composition {{is different from that}} of articulated brachiopods and also varies among the classes of inarticulate brachiopods. Lingulids and discinids, which have pedicles, have a matrix of glycosaminoglycans (long, unbranched polysaccharides), in which other materials are embedded: chitin in the periostracum; apatite containing calcium phosphate in the primary biomineralized layer; and a complex mixture in the innermost layer, containing collagen and other proteins, chitinophosphate and apatite. Craniids, which have no pedicle and cement themselves directly to hard surfaces, have a <b>periostracum</b> of chitin and mineralized layers of calcite.|$|E
500|$|Chrysomallon squamiferum, {{common name}} the scaly-foot {{gastropod}}, is {{a species of}} deep-sea hydrothermal-vent snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Peltospiridae. This vent-endemic gastropod is known only from deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Indian Ocean, {{where it has been}} found at depths of about [...] C. squamiferum differs greatly from other deep-sea gastropods, even the closely related neomphalines. The shell is of a unique construction, with three layers; the outer layer consists of iron sulfides, the middle layer is equivalent to the organic <b>periostracum</b> found in other gastropods, and the innermost layer is made of aragonite. The foot is also unusual, being armored at the sides with iron-mineralised sclerites.|$|E
2500|$|The registry's rules specify that {{specimens}} [...] "should {{be measured}} with vernier type calipers and should reflect the greatest measurable {{dimension of the}} shell in any direction including any processes of hard shell material produced by the animal (i.e. spines, wings, keels, siphonal canals, etc.) and not including attachments, barnacles, coralline algae, or any other encrusting organisms.

50|$|Younger mussels {{normally}} have a yellowish-brown <b>periostracum</b> (outer shell layer), while more mature mussels generally have a dark brown to greenish-brown <b>periostracum.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for shell collectors to deliberately remove a <b>periostracum</b> layer (using household bleach) if they feel that a shell is more attractive without it. However the <b>periostracum</b> {{is an important part of}} the shell, and is definitely of interest to malacologists. Details of the <b>periostracum</b> can sometimes be very helpful in identifying a species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Periostracum</b> can in {{some cases}} be quite thin, smooth, glossy and transparent, such that it looks almost like a thin yellow varnish, {{or it can be}} thicker and more or less opaque. When it is thick it is often {{relatively}} rough in texture and dull. In some species the <b>periostracum</b> is tufted, or forms hair-like growths which {{in some cases}} can give the fresh shell a velvety feel, see. In some species the <b>periostracum</b> adheres very tightly to the underlying shell surface, in others the <b>periostracum</b> is less firmly attached.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Periostracum</b> {{is often}} {{yellowish}} or brownish in color. In some species it is black. The <b>periostracum</b> is very often {{a different color}} than the underlying layer of the shell.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell of}} Paryphanta busbyi has very thick <b>periostracum</b> and only few {{micrometre}} thick calcium layer. When the shell {{is kept in}} dry environment, the shell will explode into pieces, because its <b>periostracum</b> shrinks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>periostracum</b> of brachiopods {{is made of}} chitin. Relatively new cells on {{the edges}} of the brachiopod mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the <b>periostracum,</b> but are displaced on the upper side of the mantle by more recent cells, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves.|$|E

50|$|Many Recent shells, {{when the}} animal is alive or the shell is freshly empty, have an {{uppermost}} shell layer of horny, smooth, or hairy epidermis or <b>periostracum,</b> a proteinaceous layer which sometimes is thick enough to hide the color markings of {{the surface of the}} shell. The <b>periostracum,</b> as well as the coloration, is only rarely preserved in fossil shells.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the shell is a chalky white, but it is covered by a very dark brown, closely adhering <b>periostracum,</b> except {{in areas of the}} shell where the <b>periostracum</b> has been eroded. The apex of the shell is almost always eroded, and the shell is often quite damaged by the acidic properties of the mud in which the animal lives.|$|E
50|$|The larger {{species of}} cone snails can {{grow up to}} 23 cm in length.
