40|$|Abstract. Light microscopy, the {{mainstay}} of malaria diagnosis in epidemiologic studies, exhibits limited sensitivity for detecting low level infections and often under-estimates the frequency of mixed Plasmodium species infections. To overcome these shortcomings we performed the PCR method for detection and identification of Plasmodium species in blood specimens from 242 individuals collected during the peak season of malaria incidence (July – October). Malaria prevalence was 81. 4 % and 43. 4 % by PCR and microscopy respectively. Moreover, while PCR detected Plasmodium malariae DNA in 108 (44. 6 %), microscopic examination detected only 20 (8. 3 %) individuals parasitized with this species. Further data analysis revealed an independent random distribution <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> irrespective of age groups (0 - 5 yrs, chi-square 7 df = 2. 77, P> 0. 95; 6 - 15 yrs, chi-square 7 df = 4. 82, P> 0. 50;> 15 yrs, chi-square 7 df = 4. 4, P> 0. 70) and sexes (for male chi-square 7 df = 2. 48, P> 0. 95; for female, chi-square 7 df = 1. 85, P> 0. 95). However, although the parasite distribution is random irrespective of sex, females had more P. malariae infections (P = 0. 004, OR = 2. 312, 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 4. 1). Our study demonstrates that the parasite distribution in Orissa is random with substantially higher prevalence of P. malariae than previously suspected {{and this may be}} seasonal.

40|$|Epidemics are engines for host-{{parasite}} coevolution, where parasite {{adaptation to}} hosts drives reciprocal adaptation in host populations. A key {{challenge is to}} understand whether parasite adaptation and any underlying evolution and coevolution is repeatable across ecologically realistic populations that experience different environmental conditions, or if each population follows a completely unique evolutionary path. We established twenty replicate pond populations comprising an identical suite of genotypes of crustacean host, Daphnia magna, and inoculum <b>of</b> their <b>parasite,</b> Pasteuria ramosa. Using a time-shift experiment, we compared parasite infection traits before and after epidemics and linked <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> evolution with shifts in host genotype frequencies. Parasite adaptation to the sympatric suite of host genotypes came {{at a cost of}} poorer performance on foreign genotypes across populations and environments. However, this consistent <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> adaptation was driven by different types of frequency-dependent selection that was contingent on an ecologically relevant environmental treatment (whether or not there was physical mixing of water within ponds). In unmixed ponds, large epidemics drove rapid and strong host-parasite coevolution. In mixed ponds, epidemics were smaller and host evolution was driven mainly by the mixing treatment itself; here, host evolution and parasite evolution were clear, but coevolution was absent. Population mixing breaks an otherwise robust coevolutionary cycle.

Fecal samples from 50 adult cows that were housed in a temporary enclosure within the herd’s natural range at Boundary Lake, Yukon Territory were collected and analyzed during 5 sampling periods. A minimum <b>of</b> 6 <b>parasite</b> genera were recovered: eggs of Trichostrongylidae species (most likely Ostertagia gruehneri and Teladorsagia boreoarcticus), Marshallagia sp., Anoplocephalidae cestodes, and Skrjabinema sp.; oocysts of Eimeria spp.; and dorsal-spined first-stage protostrongylid larvae, including Parelaphostrongylus andersoni. Prevalence of Trichostrongylidae spp. eggs in fresh fecals was at or near 100 % throughout the sampling period, however, the median intensity increased significantly from 8 to 34 eggs per gram (epg) {{at the peak of}} calving and then decreased to 12 epg 2 weeks post-calving (P = 2. 83 e- 07). Three plots of feces collected from these animals were established outside of the enclosure on 4 May 2006 and monitored every 10 days to investigate <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> development under natural conditions.

40|$|Acquisition of {{partially}} protective immunity is {{a dominant}} {{feature of the}} epidemiology of malaria among exposed individuals. The processes that determine the acquisition of immunity to clinical disease and to asymptomatic carriage <b>of</b> malaria <b>parasites</b> are poorly understood, {{in part because of}} a lack of validated immunological markers of protection. Using mathematical models, we seek to better understand the processes that determine observed epidemiological patterns. We have developed an age-structured mathematical model of malaria transmission in which acquired immunity can act in three ways ("immunity functions") : reducing the probability of clinical disease, speeding the clearance <b>of</b> <b>parasites,</b> and increasing tolerance to subpatent infections. Each immunity function was allowed to vary in efficacy depending on both age and malaria transmission intensity. The results were compared to age <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> prevalence and clinical disease in endemic settings in northeastern Tanzania and The Gambia. Two types of immune function were required to reproduce the epidemiological age-prevalence curves seen in the empirical data; a form of clinical immunity that reduces susceptibility to clinical disease and develops with age and exposure (with half-life of the order of five years or more) and a form of anti-parasite immunity which results in more rapid clearance of parasitaemia, is acquired later in life and is longer lasting (half-life of > 20 y). The development of anti-parasite immunity better reproduced observed epidemiological patterns if it was dominated by age-dependent physiological processes rather than by the magnitude of exposure (provided some exposure occurs). Tolerance to subpatent infections was not required to explain the empirical data. The model comprising immunity to clinical disease which develops early in life and is exposure-dependent, and anti-parasite immunity which develops later in life and is not dependent on the magnitude of exposure, appears to best reproduce the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> prevalence and clinical disease by age in different malaria transmission settings.

40|$|Abstract Spatially {{explicit}} models {{show that}} local interactions <b>of</b> hosts and <b>parasites</b> can strongly influence invasion and persistence <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> and can create lasting spatial patchiness <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> distributions. These predictions have {{been supported by}} experiments con-ducted in two-dimensional landscapes. Yet, three-dimensional systems, such as lakes, ponds, and oceans, have received comparatively little attention from epi-demiologists. Freshwater zooplankton hosts often aggregate horizontally and vertically in lakes, potentially leading to local host–parasite interactions in one-, two-, or three-dimensions. To evaluate the potential spatial component of daphniid parasitism driven by these local interactions (patchiness), we surveyed vertical and hor-izontal heterogeneity of pelagic Daphnia infected with multiple microparasites in several north temperate lakes. These surveys uncovered little evidence for persistent vertical patchiness of parasitism, since the prevalence <b>of</b> two <b>parasites</b> showed little consistent trend with depth in four lakes (but more heterogeneity during day than at night). On a horizontal scale of tens of meters, we found little systematic evidence of strong aggregation and spatial <b>patterning</b> <b>of</b> daphniid hosts and parasites.

40|$|Estimates of {{the total}} number of species that inhabit the Earth have {{increased}} significantly since Linnaeus's initial catalog of 20, 000 species. The best recent estimates suggest that there are ≈ 6 million species. More emphasis has been placed on counts of free-living species than on parasitic species. We rectify this by quantifying the numbers and proportion of parasitic species. We estimate that there are between 75, 000 and 300, 000 helminth species parasitizing the vertebrates. We have no credible way of estimating how many parasitic protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses exist. We estimate that between 3 % and 5 % of parasitic helminths are threatened with extinction in the next 50 to 100 years. Because <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> diversity do not clearly map onto <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> host diversity, we can make very little prediction about geographical <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> threat to <b>parasites.</b> If the threats reflect those experienced by avian hosts, then we expect climate change to be a major threat to the relatively small proportion <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> diversity that lives in the polar and temperate regions, whereas habitat destruction will be the major threat to tropical parasite diversity. Recent studies of food webs suggest that ≈ 75 % of the links in food webs involve a parasitic species; these links are vital for regulation of host abundance and potentially for reducing the impact of toxic pollutants.

We evaluated {{the relative importance of}} morphological (body size, body weight, wingspan, bill length), life-history (longevity, clutch size), ecological (population size, geographical range) and behavioural (diving versus non-diving) variables as predictors of louse diversity on 413 seabird hosts species. Diversity was measured at the level of louse suborder, genus, and species, and uneven sampling of hosts was controlled for using literature citations as a proxy for sampling effort.

Lack of a vaccine, inconsistent sociopolitical will to maintain sanitation and control measures, and anthropogenic ecological disturbances that expand habitat range of the aquatic snail intermediate host (Biomphalaria glabrata in the Americas) maintain a continuous threat of infection and resurgence or introduction of disease transmission in tropical areas. Elucidating host and parasite genetic distribution in both space and time is important for understanding and gaining predictive power over disease epidemiology, particularly as it relates to influences <b>of</b> habitat on <b>parasite</b> transmission at a local scale. Moreover, understanding host-parasite distributions is necessary for assessing the coevolutionary potential of host-parasite interactions. Using Brazilian populations of S. mansoni and B. glabrata, I have assessed spatiotemporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> and snail genetic variation at the level of individual villages in order to better understand the interactions of environment and host movement on parasite transmission, as well as to further our knowledge of natural levels <b>of</b> host and <b>parasite</b> variation at local scales. Assessments of neutral genetic variation within and among both snail host populations and parasite populations collected from infected humans indicate that human definitive hosts are the primary drivers <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> gene flow within these Brazilian villages. Furthermore, relative to their snail intermediate hosts, parasites appear more genetically variable and 2 ̆ 2 well-traveled 2 ̆ 2, setting the stage for potential local coadaptation between schistosomes and snails.

Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that parasites are overdispersed within their snail hosts and that interactions between co-infecting parasites can influence infection outcomes and, thus, transmission dynamics. To facilitate experimental investigations of intraspecific interactions between co-infecting schistosomes, I have tested and applied a molecular method allowing comparisons of the relative transmission potential <b>of</b> competing larval <b>parasite</b> strains.

Parasite infection patterns were not congruent with host phylogeny, suggesting that host phylogeny is not a significant predictor of host–parasite interactions in this system. However, the two host stages produced significantly different numbers <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> propagules, indicating that ecological factors may be important determinants of host specificity in this host–parasite system. While field infections reflect extant natural infection <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites,</b> experimental infections can demonstrate potential host–parasite interactions, which aids in identifying factors that may be significant in shaping future host–parasite interactions...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: In India, diurnally sub {{periodic}} Wuchereria bancrofti {{transmitted by}} Downsiomyia nivea is prevalent {{only in the}} Nicobar district of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The ongoing LF elimination programme aims at transmission interruption by bringing down the microfilarie (mf) load in the community, which has implication on the parasite load in mosquito vector. Therefore, understanding density dependent constraints on transmission assumes significance from control perspective. The present study was undertaken in Teressa Island to understand the density dependent parasite mortality and survival probability <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> Do. nivea. Methods: The entomological data collected from Teressa Island, endemic for the diurnally sub periodic form of W. bancrofti were {{used to examine the}} parasite loss and its survival up to infectivity. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> distribution in Do. nivea were examined. Results: Distribution <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> microfilariae were found to be over dispersed in Do. nivea. The later stages <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> in the vector were randomly distributed. Distribution <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> various filarial larval stages suggested that the loss <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> occurred as development progressed and was maximal {{between the first and second}} stages. Further, both the prevalence of infection and the degree <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> aggregation in the vector population have fallen significantly with development <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> stage. Interpretation & conclusions: Results indicate the operation <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> density dependent mortality <b>of</b> vectors or <b>parasite</b> loss or combination of both. The present study with Aedes transmitted filariasis conducted before launching LF elimination programme in the study area indicates a comparable level <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> regulation in the vector which has similar implications on the transmission threshold. Thus, the consideration of Aedes with Culex in deriving the critical level of antigen positive for making decisions on cessation of mass drug administration (MDA) can be justified. However, with MDA aiming at reducing parasite load in the community, the operation of density dependent factor in the transmission becomes less pronounced in the subsequent rounds of MDA...|$|R
40|$|Hosts {{frequently}} harbour multiple <b>parasite</b> infections, yet <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> co-occurrence {{are poorly}} documented in nature. In this study, we asked whether two common avian blood parasites, one haemosporidian and one trypanosome, affect each other's occurrence in individuals {{of a single}} host species. We used molecular genotyping to survey protozoan parasites in the peripheral blood of yellow-breasted chats (Aves: Passeriformes [Parulidae]: Icteria virens) from the Ozarks of Southern Missouri. We also determined whether single and co-infections differently influence white blood cell and polychromatic erythrocyte counts, the latter being a measure of regenerative anaemia. We found a positive association between the haemosporidian and trypanosome parasites, such that infection by one increases the probability that an individual host is infected by the other. Adult individuals {{were more likely than}} juveniles to exhibit haemosporidian infection, but co-infections and single trypanosome infections were not age-related. We found evidence of pathogenicity of trypanosomes in that infected individuals exhibited similar levels of regenerative anaemia as birds infected with haemosporidian <b>parasites</b> <b>of</b> the genus Plasmodium. Counts of white blood cells did not differ with respect to infection status...|$|R

However, the factors that affect the transmission <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> from humans to mosquitoes show complex dynamics {{in relation to the}} intensity and seasonality of malaria transmission, and thus such benefits might not be automatic.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{antibodies}} in bloodmeals of mice and hamsters immunized with Leishmania major subcellular fractions and sandfly (Phlebotomus duboscqi) gut antigens to inhibit development of L. major in its vector P. duboscqi was examined. Antibodies from animals immunized with either L. major subcellular fractions alone or sandfly gut antigen alone {{were not very}} effective in inhibiting development of L. major in the sandfly. When P. duboscqi were fed on blood from animals immunized with both parasite flagella and sandfly gut antigen, development of L. major was significantly inhibited (P< 0. 05). Control sandflies fed on naive animals displayed a normal <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> development to the metacyclic stage.

40|$|International audienceEchinococcoses are {{parasitic}} diseases of major public health importance globally. Human infection results in chronic disease with poor prognosis and serious medical, {{social and economic}} consequences for vulnerable populations. According to recent estimates, the geographical distribution of Echinococcus spp. infections is expanding and becoming an emerging and re-emerging problem in several regions of the world. Echinococcosis endemicity is geographically heterogeneous and over time it may be affected by global environmental change. Therefore, landscape epidemiology offers {{a unique opportunity to}} quantify and predict the ecological risk of infection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we review the most relevant environmental sources of spatial variation in human echinococcosis risk, and describe the potential applications of landscape epidemiological studies to characterise the current <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> transmission across natural and human-altered landscapes. We advocate future work promoting the use of this approach as a support tool for decision-making that facilitates the design, implementation and monitoring of spatially targeted interventions to reduce the burden of human echinococcoses in disease-endemic areas...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the term}} {{endemism}} refers to restricted areas of taxa, this term {{is used in}} a different way in epidemiology and host-parasite relationship. An endemic disease refers to the maintenance of a disease over a long-term period in a limited geographic area (endemic area). In biogeographical studies, endemism refers to the organisms that are restricted to a given area. However, little is known about parasitism in endemic hosts. Here, we show how epidemiological models and the derivation of the basic transmission rate (R 0) can help to understand the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> species richness among endemic hosts. The main prediction arising from epidemiological models concerns the host density threshold, i. e. the minimum host density that allows a disease to spread into a population of susceptible hosts. When host density, or host range, increases we can predict a concomitant increase <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> species richness, in the case <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> transmitted directly or through predator-prey relationship. This prediction can be tested using comparative data. These predictions are successfully tested using several data sets on <b>parasites</b> <b>of</b> marine and freshwater fish. We will show that restricted areas and/or low density is correlated with a decrease in parasite species richness. The epidemiological theory is also helpful for predictions concerning parasite and disease introductions in endemic host faunas (or isolated hosts). We emphasize why and how this endemic fauna may be susceptible to introduce pathogens and parasites. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying {{the factors}} that predict {{parasite}} outbreak and persistence is a major challenge for both applied and fundamental biology. Key to understanding parasite prevalence and disease outbreaks is determining at what age individuals show signs of infection, {{and whether or not}} they recover. Age-dependent <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> the infection of a host population by parasites can indicate among-individual heterogeneities in their susceptibility to, or rate <b>of</b> recovery from, <b>parasite</b> infections. Here, we present a cross-sectional study of avian malaria in a long-lived bird species, the mute swan Cygnus olor, examining age-related <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> prevalence and modelling <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> infection and recovery. One-hundred and fifteen swans, ranging from one to nineteen years old, were screened for infection with Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon parasites. Infections with three cytochrome-b lineages of Haemoproteus were found (pooled prevalence 67 %), namely WW 1 (26 %), which is common in passerine birds, and two new lineages closely related to WW 1 : MUTSW 1 (25 %) and MUTSW 2 (16 %). We found evidence for age-related infection in one lineage, MUTSW 1. Catalytic models examining <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> infection and recovery in the population suggested that infections in this population were not life-long - recovery of individuals was included in the best fitting models. These findings support the results of recent studies that suggest hosts can clear infections, although <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> infection-related mortality in older birds remain to be studied in more detail. © 2013 The Author.

40|$|Biogeographic <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> {{diversity}} {{are useful}} for determining how host-parasite interactions can influence speciation. However, variation in methodologies and sampling effort can skew diversity estimates. Avian haemosporidians are vector-transmitted blood parasites represented by over 1300 unique genetic lineages spread across over 40 countries. We used a global database of lineage distribu- tions for two avian haemosporidian genera, Plasmodium and Haemoproteus, to test for congruence of diversity among haemosporidians and their avian hosts across 13 geographic regions. We demonstrated that avian haemosporidians exhibit similar diversity patterns to their avian hosts; however, specific pat- terns differ between genera. Haemoproteus spp. diversity estimates {{were significantly higher than}} those of Plasmodium spp. in all areas where the genera co-occurred, apart from the Plasmodium spp. -rich region of South America. The geographic distributions <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> genera also differed, with Haemoproteus spp. absent from the majority of oceanic regions while Plasmodium spp. were cosmopolitan. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the way avian haemosporidians diverge and colonise new communi- ties. Nevertheless, {{a review of the literature}} suggests that accurate estimates of avian haemosporidian diversity patterns are limited by (i) a concentration of sampling towards passerines from Europe and North America, (ii) a frequent failure to include microscopic techniques together with molecular screen- ing and (iii) a paucity of studies investigating distributions across vector hosts.

40|$|Although immunodominance of CD 8 (+) T-cell {{responses}} is a well-recognised {{feature of}} viral infections, {{its role in}} responses to more antigenically complex pathogens is less clear. In previous studies we have observed that CD 8 (+) T-cell responses to Theileria parva exhibit different <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> strain specificity in cattle of different MHC genotypes. In the current study, we demonstrated that animals homozygous for the A 10 and A 18 MHC haplotypes have detectable responses to only one of 5 T. parva antigens. Over 60 % of the responding T cells from the A 18 (+) and A 10 (+) animals recognised defined epitopes in the Tp 1 and Tp 2 antigens, respectively. Comparison of T-cell receptor beta chain expression profiles of CD 8 (+) T-cell lines and CD 8 (+) T cells harvested ex vivo confirmed that {{the composition of the}} T-cell lines was representative of the in vivo memory CD 8 (+) T-cell populations. Analysis of the Tp 1 and Tp 2 antigens revealed sequence polymorphism, which was reflected by differential recognition by T-cell lines. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a profound immunodominance in the CD 8 (+) T-cell response to T. parva, which we propose is a major determinant <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> strain specificity <b>of</b> the response and hence immune protection...|$|R
