40|$|On the Great Northern Peninsula, western Newfoundland, the transqressive <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> Formation (Middle Ordovician) overlies the Lower Ordovician St. George Group. The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> strata are overlain by {{carbonate}} breccias and easterly derived flysch deposits. The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> sediments include limestones, mainly rubbly, with dolostones at {{the base}} (lower <b>Table</b> <b>Head),</b> overlain by limestones interbedded with shales (middle <b>Table</b> <b>Head)</b> and black graptolitiferous shales at the top (upper <b>Table</b> <b>Head).</b> The lower <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> limestones represent the last platform carbonate deposit before the bank foundered {{probably due to the}} emplacement of Lower Ordovician allochthons in western Newfoundland. [...] The formation has been studied in detail from eight localities in the area from Bellburns community in the south to St. John Island in the north. Additional information from localities on Port au Port Peninsula and Hare Bay is included. The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> sediments all along on the west coast of Newfoundland compare with those in the study area. The thickness of the different units varies considerably and reaches its maximum at Table Point. The detailed investigation of the rocks revealed that carbonate accumulation was interrupted by "catastrophic" downwarps of the shelf. These {{may be related to the}} emplacement of the allochthons. [...] A total of approximately 17, 000 conodonts was recorded within the study area. An additional 3, 000 were recorded from elsewhere in western Newfoundland. The conodont fauna is described in multi-element taxonomy, and a supragenetic classification is applied. 35 genera and Panderodontidae, and the new recognized family Cornuodontidae n. fam [...] [...] Two phylo-zones and four biointerval-zones are defined. The phylo-zones are based on phylogenetically related and facies independent species of Histiodella. The species from the basal lower <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> on Newfoundland belong to Midcontinent Fauna 4, and are correlative with strata from North America. The conodonts reinforce trilobite and cephalopod data that indicate a late Whiterockian (early Llanvirnian age for these strata. The North Atlantic Province conodonts from the middle <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> have a number of species in common with the Eoplacognathus suecicus Zone of Scandinavia. The top of the middle <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> at <b>Table</b> Point may be as young as the E. suecicus-P. sulcatus Subzone. [...] The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> strata accumulated in lagoonal, shelf (inner-outer) and slope environments. The lateral distribution of conodonts can be directly related to these depositional environments, and a sequence of three biofacies and sub-biofacies is introduced. The lagoonal (Midcontinent Province) and slope (North Atlantic Province) biofacies are distinct, whereas the shelf biofacies is less distinct. The occurrence of occasional invaders from the open oceanic biofacies can be related to the oscillating transgression...|$|R

5000|$|Alfred H. Brooks also complimented Major Bagley in his {{preface to}} his USGS Bulletin: [...] "The plate camera has heen used {{for many years}} in {{topographic}} surveying in the United States and Canada, as well as in many European coimtries, and since 1910 J. W. Bagley, a topographic engineer of the United States Geological Survey, has been employing the panoramic film camera in conjunction with the <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> in surveys in Alaska. Mr. Bagley has devised some new instruments and methods and has proved conclusively that the panoramic camera is extremely valuable in certain kinds of topographic work. Some of the results of his phototopographic surveys are presented in the maps accompanying this bulletin. These maps give conclusive evidence of the refinements that are made possible by the use of that instrument. The methods and instruments here described have thus far been used only in Alaska, but they promise to have a wider appUcation in topographic surveys; hence this bulletin has been prepared. As the camera is used in conjunction with the <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> the bulletin includes also a brief account of the uses of the <b>plane</b> <b>table.</b> Mr. Bagley shows clearly that the field cost of surveys made by the use of the panoramic camera and <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> is far lower than that of surveys made by the <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> alone, and though the compilation of the field data in the office is more laborious the final cost of the completed map is nevertheless lower. The methods here described are especially applicable to regions where the field season is short, the field cost high, and the climatic conditions adverse to topographic work." ...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> {{became a}} popular {{instrument}} for surveying. [...] Its use was widely taught. Interestingly, {{there were those}} who considered it a substandard instrument compared to such devices as the theodolite, since it was relatively easy to use. [...] By allowing the use of graphical methods rather than mathematical calculations, it could be used by those with less education than other instruments. The addition of a camera to the <b>plane</b> <b>table,</b> as was done from 1890 by Sebastian Finsterwalder in conjunction with a phototheodolite, established photogrammetry in spatial and temporal surveying.|$|R
