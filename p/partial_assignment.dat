These problems are dened by xing a <b>partial</b> weight <b>assignment</b> (H, C, K). We define two classes of <b>partial</b> weight <b>assignment</b> the simple and the plain.

40|$|Abstract. We {{define a}} {{relation}} of compatibility on <b>partial</b> true <b>assignments</b> using the system’s equations. The relation is a Boolean matrix- the compatibility matrix. We deplete the matrix eliminating relations between those <b>partial</b> true <b>assignments</b> {{which are not}} parts of a solution of the whole system. The depletion transforms the relation of compatibility {{on the set of}} <b>partial</b> true <b>assignments</b> into the relation of “they are parts of one solution of the system” on the set. The relation is a Boolean matrix- the general solution of a Boolean system. Values “true ” in the general solution indicate which <b>partial</b> true <b>assignments</b> can be extrapolated to a full solution and in which “directions ” the extrapolation has to be done. We use the method and solve SAT...|$|R

50|$|Size is however not {{the only}} feature of learned {{constraints}} to take into account. Indeed, a small constraint may be useless in a particular state of the search space because the values that violate {{it will not be}} encountered again. A larger constraint whose violating values are more similar to the current <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> may be preferred in such cases.|$|E
5000|$|Backtracking is a {{recursive}} algorithm. It {{maintains a}} <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> of the variables. Initially, all variables are unassigned. At each step, a variable is chosen, and all {{possible values are}} assigned to it in turn. For each value, {{the consistency of the}} <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> with the constraints is checked; in case of consistency, a recursive call is performed. When all values have been tried, the algorithm backtracks. In this basic backtracking algorithm, consistency is defined as the satisfaction of all constraints whose variables are all assigned. Several variants of backtracking exist. Backmarking improves the efficiency of checking consistency. Backjumping allows saving part of the search by backtracking [...] "more than one variable" [...] in some cases. Constraint learning infers and saves new constraints that can be later used to avoid part of the search. Look-ahead is also often used in backtracking to attempt to foresee the effects of choosing a variable or a value, thus sometimes determining in advance when a subproblem is satisfiable or unsatisfiable.|$|E
40|$|The 250 -MHz {{high-resolution}} proton {{magnetic resonance}} spectra of gramicidin-S in solution in deuterated methanol, deuterated ethylene glycol, and binary mixtures of these solvents have been recorded. Starting from previously published <b>partial</b> <b>assignments</b> for deuterated methanol solution, the solvent transition yields <b>partial</b> <b>assignments</b> in deuterated ethylene glycol solution. In the latter the rotational correlation {{time for the}} peptide backbone, tauc, is calculated to be 14 ns at 25 degrees C. The long tauc leads to proton spin relaxation behavior that mimics that of moderate-sized proteins in water, and yields negative nuclear Overhauser effects, which have been measured for the protons of the phenylalanine ring. The results {{suggest that there is}} rapid and efficient spin-diffusion within closely-connected "islands" of protons, and less efficient spin-diffusion between islands. The results are compatible with the accepted solution conformation of gramicidin-S...|$|R
40|$|The Learning to Reason {{framework}} {{combines the}} study of Learning and Reasoning into a single task. Within it, learning is done specifically {{for the purpose of}} reasoning with the learned knowledge. Computational considerations show that this is a useful paradigm; in some cases learning and reasoning problems that are intractable when studied separately become tractable when performed as a task of Learning to Reason. In this paper we study Learning to Reason problems where the interaction with the world supplies the learner only partial information in the form of <b>partial</b> <b>assignments.</b> Several natural interpretations of <b>partial</b> <b>assignments</b> are considered and learning and reasoning algorithms using these are developed.

50|$|If f is a {{quadratic}} polynomial, {{a concept}} called roof duality {{can be used}} to obtain a lower bound for its minimum value. Roof duality may also provide a <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> of the variables, indicating some of the values of a minimizer to the polynomial. Several different methods of obtaining lower bounds were developed only to later be shown to be equivalent to what is now called roof duality.|$|E
50|$|Unsatisfiability {{of a given}} <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> is {{detected}} if one clause becomes empty, i.e. if all its variables have been assigned {{in a way that}} makes the corresponding literals false. Satisfiability of the formula {{is detected}} either when all variables are assigned without generating the empty clause, or, in modern implementations, if all clauses are satisfied. Unsatisfiability of the complete formula can only be detected after exhaustive search.|$|E
50|$|Jumpback {{learning}} {{is based on}} storing as constraints the inconsistent assignments that would be found by conflict-based backjumping. Whenever a <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> is found inconsistent, this algorithm selects the violated constraint that is minimal according to an ordering based {{on the order of}} instantiation of variables. The evaluation restricted of the variables that are in this constraint is inconsistent and is usually shorter than the complete evaluation. Jumpback learning stores this fact as a new constraint.|$|E
40|$|Two new {{distributed}} search algorithms for Distributed CSPs are proposed. In one algorithm, {{search is}} performed concurrently on disjoint {{parts of the}} global search space, by agents that constitute these parts. Agents form a hierarchy of groups and each group generates consistent partial solutions. Partial solutions are produced concurrently and are combined into consistent global solutions by agents that are higher in the hierarchy. In another algorithm, concurrent independent backtracking search processes grow <b>partial</b> <b>assignments</b> along a hierarchy of agent groups, with each agent participating in multiple search processes. Stochastic choices for the order of assigning agents are taken after backtracking, securing the growing <b>partial</b> <b>assignments</b> from stalling in local minima. The first part of both algorithms partitions the distributed constraint network into a binary tree of groups. After completing the partition, the hierarchy of groups starts to produce partial solutions. The distributed partition algorithm uses a heuristic that selects to join neighbors that are strongly constrained, into groups. This i...|$|R

40|$|For NP-hard {{constraint}} satisfaction problems {{the existence of}} a feasible solution cannot be decided efficiently. Applying a tree search often results in the exploration of parts of the search space that do not contain feasible solutions at all. Redundant constraints can help to detect inconsistencies of <b>partial</b> <b>assignments</b> higher up in the search tree.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to optimal rectangle packing, an NP-complete problem {{that can be used to}} model many simple scheduling tasks. Recent attempts at incorporating artificial intelligence search techniques to the problem of rectangle packing have focused on a CSP formulation, in which <b>partial</b> <b>assignments</b> are defined to be the fixed placement of a subset of rectangles. Our technique takes a significant departure from this search space, as we instead view <b>partial</b> <b>assignments</b> as subsets of relative pairwise relationships between rectangles. This approach recalls the meta-CSP commonly constructed in constraint-based temporal reasoning, and is thus a candidate for several pruning techniques that have been developed in that field. We apply these to the domain of rectangle packing, and develop a suite of new techniques that exploit both the symmetry and geometry present in this particular domain. We then provide experimental results demonstrating that our approach performs competitively compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a series of benchmarks, matching or surpassing it in speed on nearly all instances. Finally, we conjecture that our technique is particularly appropriate for problems containing large rectangles, which are difficult for the fixed-placement formulation to handle efficiently...|$|R
5000|$|While the {{previous}} definitions of consistency {{are all about}} consistency of assignments, relational consistency involves satisfaction of a given constraint or set of constraints only. More precisely, relational consistency implies that every consistent <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> can be extended {{in such a way}} that a given constraint or set of constraints is satisfied. Formally, a constraint [...] on variables [...] is relational arc-consistent with one of its variables [...] if every consistent assignment to [...] can be extended to [...] in such a way [...] is satisfied. The difference between [...] "regular" [...] consistency and relational arc consistency is that the latter only requires the extended assignment to satisfy a given constraint, while the former requires it to satisfy all relevant constraints.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} case, John W. Banks, II {{was fired from}} his job with the California Department of Education. He {{retained}} an attorney on a contingent-fee basis and filed a civil suit against his employer alleging employment discrimination against his employer. Banks settled the case for $464,000 and paid $150,000 to his lawyer. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) contended that the entire amount was income to Banks, a position upheld by the United States Tax Court. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{ruled in favor of}} Banks, holding the lawyer's share could be excluded from the taxpayer's gross income. The Court of Appeals reasoned the contingent-fee arrangement “is more like a <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> of income-producing property than an assignment of income.” Under this theory, Banks and his attorney were in effect partners in a joint venture who shared a recovery, and who should each be taxed only on his separate part.|$|E

40|$|A new search {{algorithm}} {{for solving}} distributed constraint satisfaction problems (DisCSPs) is presented. Agents assign variables sequentially, but perform forward checking asynchronously. The asynchronous forward-checking algorithm (AFC) is a distributed search algorithm that keeps one consistent <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> at all times. Forward checking is performed by sending {{copies of the}} <b>partial</b> <b>assignment</b> to all unassigned agents concurrently. The algorithm is described in detail and its correctness proven. An experimental comparison of AFC to two asynchronous algorithms, Asynchronous BackTracking (ABT) and Distributed Dynamic Backtracking (DisDB), on randomly generated DisCSPs is presented.
