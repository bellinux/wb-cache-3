Three other <b>public</b> <b>corporations</b> were privatized as well: the Metropolitan Expressway <b>Public</b> <b>Corporation,</b> the Hanshin Expressway <b>Public</b> <b>Corporation,</b> and the Honshu-Shikoku Bridge authority.

40|$|The {{debate on}} <b>public</b> <b>corporation</b> between Italian economists in the Sixties of the 20 th Century is {{characterized}} {{at least by}} four theorizations. The first is the macroeconomic one, in which <b>public</b> <b>corporation</b> is considered {{as an instrument of}} the policy of economic planning. The second is the institutional one: <b>public</b> <b>corporation</b> is seen as an economic institution which can develop the market where private enterprise fails. It can do it through the creation of different and complementary industries and a large-scale planned industrialization which doesn’t have to neglect economic efficiency. In the third approach, catholic economists see <b>public</b> <b>corporation</b> as an actor able to reinforce the market where it is not able to rise or where it is strongly inefficient. Finally, in the fourth thesis, liberal economists think that <b>public</b> <b>corporation</b> has to be managed as a private one and don’t have to be privileged by the government, not even for the development of depressed areas. ...|$|R
