5000|$|The {{structure}} of the metrical grid explains a number of otherwise surprising features of prominence <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> <b>language.</b> For example, the main stress in English phrases may be placed several syllables away {{from the end of}} the phrase, even though the rule assigning this stress looks for a lexically stressed syllable near this boundary. Using a metrical grid, this rule can simply apply to the rightmost element in the highest row of the grid. Therefore, what seemed to be a non-local application of the phrasal stress rule is reinterpreted as the local application of the rule to the highest row of the metrical grid.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> <b>language</b> {{have been}} {{claimed to be}} unlearnable from {{positive}} evidence alone. One example is the hierarchical nature of languages. The grammars of human languages produce hierarchical tree structures and some linguists argue that human languages are also capable of infinite recursion (see context-free grammar). For any given set of sentences generated by a hierarchical grammar capable of infinite recursion, there are an indefinite number of grammars that could have produced the same data. This would make learning any such language impossible. Indeed, a proof by E. Mark Gold showed that any formal language that has hierarchical structure capable of infinite recursion is unlearnable from positive evidence alone, {{in the sense that}} it is impossible to formulate a procedure that will discover with certainty the correct grammar given any arbitrary sequence of positive data in which each utterance occurs at least once. However, this does not preclude arriving at the correct grammar using typical input sequences rather than particularly malicious sequences or arrive at an almost perfect approximation to the correct grammar. Indeed, it has been proposed that under very mild assumptions (ergodicity and stationarity), the probability of producing a sequence that renders language learning impossible is in fact zero.|$|E

50|$|One usually {{thinks of}} {{dimension}} {{for a set}} which is dense, like the points on a line, for example. Dimension makes sense in a discrete setting, like for graphs, only in the large system limit, as the size tends to infinity. For example, in Statistical Mechanics, one considers discrete points which are located on regular lattices of different dimensions. Such studies have been extended to arbitrary networks, and {{it is interesting to}} consider how the definition of dimension can be extended to cover these cases. A very simple and obvious way to extend the definition of dimension to arbitrary large networks is to consider how the volume (number of nodes within a given distance from a specified node) scales as the distance (shortest path connecting two nodes in the graph) is increased. For many systems arising in physics, this is indeed a useful approach. This definition of dimension could be put on a strong mathematical foundation, similar to the definition of Hausdorff dimension for continuous systems. The mathematically robust definition uses the concept of a zeta function for a graph. The complex network zeta function and the graph surface function were introduced to characterize large graphs. They have also been applied to study <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> <b>Language</b> Analysis. In this section we will briefly review the definition of the functions and discuss further some of their properties which follow from the definition.|$|E
40|$|Is agency a {{straightforward}} and universal feature of human experience? Or is {{the construction of}} agency (including attention to and memory for people involved in events) guided by patterns in culture? In this paper we focus on one aspect of cultural experience: <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> <b>language.</b> We examined English and Japanese speakers ’ descriptions of intentional and accidental events. English and Japanese speakers described intentional events similarly, using mostly agentive language (e. g., “She broke the vase”). However, {{when it came to}} accidental events English speakers used more agentive language than did Japanese speakers. We then tested whether these different patterns found in language may also manifest in cross-cultural differences in attention and memory. Results from a non-linguistic memory task showed that English and Japanese speakers remembered the agents of intentional events equally well. However, English speakers remembered the agents of accidents better than did Japanese speakers, as predicted from <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> <b>language.</b> Further, directly manipulating agency in language during another laboratory task changed people’s eye-witness memory, confirming a possible causal role for language. Patterns in one’s linguistic environment may promote and support how people instantiate agency in context...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Language {{development}} {{is characterized by}} predictable shifts in the words children produce and the complexity of their utterances. Because acquisition typi-cally occurs simultaneously with maturation and cognitive development, {{it is difficult to}} determine the causes of these shifts. We explored howacquisition proceeds in the absence of possible cognitive or maturational roadblocks, by examining the acquisition of English in internationally adopted preschoolers. Like infants, and unlike other sec-ond-language learners, these children acquire language from child-directed speech, without access to bilingual informants. Parental reports and speech samples were collected from 27 preschoolers, 3 to 18 months after they were adopted fromChina. These children showed the same developmental <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> <b>language</b> production as mono...|$|E

40|$|The {{central issue}} in corpus-driven {{linguistics}} is the detection and description of <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> <b>language</b> usage. The features {{that constitute the}} notion of a pattern can be computed to a certain extent by statistical (collocation) methods, but a crucial part of the notion may vary depending on applications and users.

We present a generic process model that supports the recognition, interpretation, and expression of the patterns inside and of the relations between clusters. By this, clusters can be merged virtually according to any notion of a 'pattern', and their relations can be exploited for different application...|$|E
