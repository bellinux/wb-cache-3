40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} evaluation of a new concordancer called The <b>Prime</b> <b>Machine</b> which has been developed as an English language learning and teaching tool. The software {{has been designed to}} provide learners with a multitude of examples from corpus texts and additional information about the contextual environment in which words and combinations of words tend to occur. The prevailing view of how language operates has been that grammar and lexis are separate systems and sentences can be constructed merely by choosing any syntactic structure and slotting in vocabulary. Over the last few decades, however, corpus linguistics has presented challenges to this view of language, drawing on evidence which {{can be found in the}} patterning of language choices in texts. Nevertheless, despite some reports of success from researchers in this area, only a limited number of teachers and learners of second language seem to make direct use of corpus software tools. The desire to develop a new corpus tool grew out of professional experience as an English language teacher and manager in China. This thesis begins by introducing some background information about the role of English in international higher education and the language learning context in China, and then goes on to describe the software architecture and the process by which corpus texts are transformed from their raw state into rows of data in a sophisticated database to be accessed by the concordancer. It then introduces innovations including several aspects of the search screen interface, the concordance line display and the use of collocation data. The software provides a rich learning platform for language learners to independently look up and compare similar words, different word forms, different collocations and the same words across two corpora. Underpinning the design is a view of language which draws on Michael Hoey's theory of Lexical Priming. The software is designed to make it possible to see tendencies of words and phrases which are not usually apparent in either dictionary examples or the output from other concordancing software. The design features are considered from a pedagogical perspective, focusing on English for Academic Purposes and including important software design principles from Computer Aided Language Learning. Through a small evaluation involving undergraduate students, the software has been shown to have great potential as a tool for the writing process. It is believed that The <b>Prime</b> <b>Machine</b> will be a very useful corpus tool which, while simple to operate, provides a wealth of information for English language teaching and self-tutoring...|$|R

50|$|By 1970, {{there were}} about 50000 stamp selling {{machines}} {{being used in the}} UK and many more had been exported worldwide. The basic design remained unchanged from 1905 until 1970, when the Type ‘G’ series was introduced. G.1 was the first “modern” mechanism and was said by the manufacturer to be designed to fit in the old housings, although subsequent to the prototype it had to be modified and in any case was much deeper than the preceding designs so that it actually required its own specially designed case, designated Type U. Type G machines incorporated many novel features including a Perspex cover sealed from moisture over the stamp coil to prevent the stamps sticking together. In addition the mechanism was driven by the user lifting a large flap over the vend slot. This action <b>primed</b> the <b>machine.</b> It could be set to dispense any number of stamps from one to five against the insertion of a single coin, although in practice this was never done and all Type G machines vended a strip of five values. Initially these added up to 1 shilling, then after 1971, 5 new pence and by 1980, 10p. Changes in postal rates introduced in 1980 meant that all surviving 10p machines were withdrawn from service.|$|R
30|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen the {{realization}} of the manufacturing firms towards quality consciousness. In pursuit of quality, the main concerns for alloy wheel machining process areas follows: alloy wheel unclean, surface finish deterioration, non-conformance to geometric and dimensional specification, over hump diameter over size or undersize. The spoke profile and rim profile not as per the requirement lead to non-optimal weight and pre-mature wheel failure in the radial fatigue test. Over used machining inserts result in surface finish deterioration and a patchy surface in the paint line. The <b>prime</b> concern in <b>machining</b> is the problem of unclean leading to rework. Hence, aluminum alloy wheel machining constitutes an important area of study for improvement of process capability. In this process more prominence is laid on prevention of defects rather than simply detecting and rejecting the defect in the usual traditional end inspection quality check.|$|R

40|$|Five {{patients}} are presented who underwent emergency pulmonary embolectomy {{with the use}} of venous inflow occlusion at normothermia. Two of these patients made satisfactory recoveries. It is suggested that this technique is of value in centres where facilities for providing cardio-pulmonary bypass are not available. The introduction of cardiopulmonary bypass for the urgent removal of massive pulmonary emboli by Sharp (1962) revolutionized the surgical management of this emergency. More patients were successfully treated in the four years follow-ing this than in the preceding 50 years since Trendelenburg's (1908) classical description of pulmonary embolectomy. The use of an extra-corporeal circulation, and accurate diagnostic methods such as pulmonary angiography and radioactive isotope scanning of the lungs, must be regarded as the ideal. This ideal is difficult to attain in hospitals without the services of staff experienced in open-heart surgery and where facilities to provide a heart-lung <b>machine,</b> <b>primed</b> and ready to use within a very short time, do not exist.

All the presented types of machines can work as refrigerating <b>machines,</b> <b>prime</b> movers or heat exchange accelerators depending on parameters such as the hot to cold source temperatures ratio, the nondimensional mass of working gas in the ma-chine, the displacer rod to displacer cross sectional area ratio, the corrected dead space to piston cylinder volume ratio and the displacer to piston cylinder volume ratio.

Patients' mean body weight was 16. 6 kg (range, 8. 9 - 32. 0 kg), and the median age was 4 years (range, 1 - 10 years). Instead of saline, it was used irradiated and leukoreduced red blood cell (RBC) units to <b>prime</b> the <b>machine</b> in 15 patients weighting 25 kg or less. the median number of LVL was 2 (range, 1 - 4) and a mean of 5. 2 patient's blood volume was processed per session lasting 165 min (range, 118 - 239). the mean number of CD 34 + cells, one day before leukapheresis was 49 mm(- 3) (range, 9219). the PBPC collection yielded 24. 7 x 10 (8) total nucleated cells/kg (range, 6. 2 - 74. 0), 10. 7 x 106 kg(- 1) CD 34 + cells (range, 3. 6 - 53. 7); 49. 8 x 10 (4) CFU-GM/kg (range, 6. 4 - 198. 1), and 65. 6 x 10 (4) BFU-E/kg (range, 7. 6 - 198. 1). the platelet count decreased significantly after each procedure 39. 8 +/- 9. 1 x 109 mm- 3 (range, 18. 000 - 76. 000) (p < 0. 001). in conclusion, our data show that LVL for collection of PBPC in low weight pediatric patients is a safe and efficient procedure, but it may expose the patient to the risk of thrombocytopenia.

50|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{applying}} pressure to the green tire in a mold in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the green tire is automatically transferred onto the lower mold bead seat, a rubber bladder is inserted into the green tire, and the mold closes while the bladder inflates. As the mold closes and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the green tire flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger tires cure in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the mold. The tire may be placed on a PCI, or post-cure inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic curing press types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the <b>prime</b> mover for <b>machine</b> motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.|$|R
