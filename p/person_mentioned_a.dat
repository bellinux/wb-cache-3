50|$|Rob Schneider {{was a man}} who had {{a strange}} {{psychological}} condition who would not actually orgasm, but mildly lose control of himself when thinking about something he enjoyed, be it beer or sports. To mess with him, one <b>person</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>a</b> slew of interests in succession, causing Orgasm Guy to lose his bearing and fall out the window. He grabbed onto a ledge, but then saw a billboard advertising a favored product. He went into his excited state and lost his grip. This was a one-time sketch, with it being presumed Orgasm Guy fell to his death in his first and final appearance. Debuted December 12, 1992.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Discovering the {{interactions}} between the <b>persons</b> <b>mentioned</b> in <b>a</b> set of topic documents can help readers construct {{the background of the}} topic and facilitate document comprehension. To discover person interactions, we need a detection method that can identify text segments containing information about {{the interactions}}. Information extraction algorithms then analyze the segments to extract interaction tuples and construct an interaction network of topic persons. In this paper, we define interaction detection as a classification problem. The proposed interaction detection method, called FISER, exploits nineteen features covering syntactic, context-dependent, and semantic information in text to detect interactive segments in topic documents. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of FISER, and show that it significantly outperforms many well-known Open IE methods...|$|R

However, McCain's strong opposition to the economic stimulus package of 2009 warmed some conservatives to him and made a primary challenge less likely.|$|R

40|$|Person {{detection}} and recognition in videos {{is a hard}} problem due to the intrinsic ambiguities of the sound and image channels and their interaction. Whatever method is used to extract person hypotheses from the audio or the image channels, person recognition in videos relies on a multimodal decision process that merges the different hypotheses produced in order to decide, for each frame, who {{is present in the}} video at the audio level, at the image level or at the content level (<b>person</b> <b>mention</b> in speech or inserted text boxes). In this framework the focus {{of this paper is to}} produce a list of person presence hypotheses from the audio channel of a video document only, to be used in addition to person presence detected at the image level by a multimodal fusion process. In this study we focus on the audio channel only, using two kinds of features: linguistic features corresponding to the way <b>a</b> <b>person</b> is <b>mentioned</b> by <b>a</b> speaker; structural features corresponding to the context of occurrence of a name in a show. We show that both sets of features are complementary and that good results can be achieved on a TV show corpus annotated with person presence labels...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Persons,</b> citing Boyan, <b>mentioned</b> <b>a</b> {{document}} that reads: [...] "A warrant was {{issued by the}} Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall to inquire about the division of lands of the late Francis Tregian, Recusant, in May 28, 1619" [...] indicating that he died prior to that date. Ironically, living at Fleet Prison allowed Tregian a modicum of style and he maintained a library of [...] "many hundred books" [...] according to Alexander Harris, the prison warden. Probably due to unpaid debts, the library was dispersed and nothing is known about its eventual disposition. After Tregian's death his mother accused him of defrauding her by furtive financial transactions, and another [...] "kynsman," [...] John Arundell, accused him of financial impropriety. Thompson concludes that Tregian's imprisonment was probably much more about improper handling of finances than it was about recusancy.|$|R

50|$|Ridley is the everyman {{protagonist of}} the serial, and {{is by no}} means an action hero.

Despite his initial revulsion at the anger brought out in him by the shadowmen, Ridley soon develops the instinct through necessity and frustration, but retains his stoicism and dry humour throughout the serial. His fraternal instinct to protect Elsie translates naturally into protecting Trent, and this gives him new energy and resourcefulness when it comes to facing down shadowmen.
