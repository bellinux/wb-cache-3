50|$|While <b>paper</b> <b>feeding</b> and {{scanning}} {{can be done}} automatically and quickly, {{preparation and}} indexing are necessary and require much work by humans. Preparation involves manually inspecting the papers to be scanned {{and making sure that}} they are in order, unfolded, without staples or anything else that might jam the scanner. Additionally, some industries such as legal and medical may require documents to have Bates Numbering or some other mark giving a document identification number and date/time of the document scan.|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the printer}} {{technology}} the dot size or grid shape {{may not be}} uniform. Some printers are capable of producing smaller dots and will intermesh the small dots within the corners larger ones for antialiasing. Some printers have a fixed resolution across the printhead but with much smaller micro-stepping for the mechanical <b>paper</b> <b>feed,</b> resulting in non-uniform dot-overlapping printing resolutions like 600×1200 dpi.|$|R

30|$|Often, {{the first}} step in {{document}} forensics focuses on source identification. The aim is to trace the source of the documents including the brand and model of the device. Typically, statistical characteristics of the printed characters are used to identify the source brands and models. For example, Delp et al. used gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) [2, 3] features, variance/entropy, and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) [4] features to identify the printer source. Banding frequency is another characteristic used to identify the source as a laser printer. Banding, which appears as non-uniform light and dark lines perpendicular to the printing direction [5], is caused by fluctuations in the rotating angular velocity of the organic photo conductor (OPC) drum and by errors in the gear transmission mechanism. Delp et al. [6] printed pre-generated gray images and exploited the projection method and Fourier transform to estimate banding frequencies. Some researchers have also focused on hardware defects to trace the source; these include spinning velocity fluctuations of the polygon mirror in the laser printer and the imperfections of the <b>paper</b> <b>feeding</b> mechanism, which result in geometric distortions in the document that can serve to characterize individual laser printers. Kong et al. [7] established a projective transformation model to estimate such geometric distortions. Bulan et al. [8] computed the geometric distortion signature from printed halftone images to trace the source laser printer by estimating the variations in the center positions of halftone dots.|$|E
40|$|Background: Second {{generation}} lignocellulosic feedstocks {{are being}} considered {{as an alternative}} to first generation biofuels that are derived from grain starches and sugars. However, the current pre-treatment methods for second generation biofuel production are inefficient and expensive due to the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulose. In this study, we used the lower termite Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar), as a model to identify potential pretreatment genes/enzymes specifically adapted for use against agricultural feedstocks. Results: Metatranscriptomic profiling was performed on worker termite guts after feeding on corn stover (CS), soybean residue (SR), or 98 % pure cellulose (paper) to identify (i) microbial community, (ii) pathway level and (iii) gene-level responses. Microbial community profiles after CS and SR feeding were different from the <b>paper</b> <b>feeding</b> profile, and protist symbiont abundance decreased significantly in termites feeding on SR and CS relative to paper. Functional profiles after CS feeding were similar to paper and SR; whereas paper and SR showed different profiles. Amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways were downregulated in termites feeding on SR relative to paper and CS. Gene expression analyses showed more significant down regulation of genes after SR feeding relative to paper and CS. Stereotypical lignocellulase genes/enzymes were not differentially expressed, but rather were among the most abundant/constitutively-expressed genes. Conclusions: These results suggest that the effect of CS and SR feeding on termite gut lignocellulase composition is minimal and thus, the most abundantly expressed enzymes appear to encode the best candidate catalysts for use in saccharification of these and related second-generation feedstocks. Further, based on these findings we hypothesize that the most abundantly expressed lignocellulases, rather than those that are differentially expressed have the best potential as pretreatment enzymes for CS and SR feedstocks. © 2015 Rajarapu et al...|$|E
50|$|In 1905, {{with their}} limited cash running out, Hess and Myers turned to Thomas Fortune Ryan, the wealthy financier. They {{demonstrated}} their machine which had numerous innovations including: friction-free, ball-bearing, one-track rail {{to support the}} weight of the carriage, a new <b>paper</b> <b>feed,</b> a lighter and faster typebar action, and complete visibility of the words as they are typed. Ryan was impressed and put up $220,000 in exchange for financial control.|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{forensic}} identification of typewriters, computer printers and copiers {{can be traced}} by imperfections in their output. The mechanical tolerances of the toner and <b>paper</b> <b>feed</b> mechanisms cause banding, which can reveal information about the individual device's mechanical properties. It is often possible to identify the manufacturer and brand, and, in some cases, the individual printer can be identified from a set of known printers by comparing their outputs.|$|R
50|$|A {{baseline}} is {{representation of}} the output device settings (i.e. <b>paper</b> <b>feed,</b> head alignment, etc.) and associated conditions (i.e. media, ink, screening, etc.). A baseline is created by adjusting device settings under a given set of conditions and running test samples, measuring the samples, readjusting the settings, until the output process is brought to an optimal state. Once optimized, a final set of measurements are made of output samples and this data {{becomes part of the}} baseline information.|$|R
5000|$|A {{feature of}} the 4+, and 4Si {{particularly}} dear to graphic designers was the straight <b>paper</b> <b>feed.</b> Unusually thick <b>paper</b> could be run through the printers without jamming by setting the output tray to [...] "Lower (face up)" [...] and having it come {{out the back of}} the printer. (Note: This is not a {{feature of the}} original 1992 Laserjet 4.) Similar models of earlier HP laser printers had this feature, but it became less common with the later models.|$|R
40|$|Portable ballot {{counters}} using camera {{technology and}} manual <b>paper</b> <b>feed</b> are potentially more reliable {{and less expensive}} than scanner based systems. We show that the spatial sampling rate, geometric linearity, point spread function, and photometric transfer function of off-the-shelf consumer cameras are acceptable for ballot imaging. However, scanner illumination is much more uniform than can be economically accomplished for variable size ballots. Therefore flat-field compensation must be designed into the image processing software. We illustrate the mechanical design of a prototype camera based ballot reader based on our comparative observations...|$|R

In {{order to achieve}} a precise contoured beam for Malaysia, selection of feed structures is very important. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>feed</b> structures for horn antenna and array antenna are studied for a parabolic reflector antenna system. Feed positions of the feed structures are determined by a newly developed feed position graph. For {{the case of a}} horn feed, a problem with regards to its physical dimension is shown.

40|$|In some {{previous}} <b>papers,</b> <b>feed</b> forward {{configurations of}} realizing second order all pass transfer functions with complex poles by adding some configurations to a first order circuit are discussed. In this dissertation, the above idea extended to realize some other basic second order complex pole filter transfer functions. A new corollary for circuit conversion is proposed and proved. This corollary {{is useful for}} converting op amp based voltage-mode circuits to their CCII based equivalent circuits, as are other existing theorems. But the new corollary is useful for converting circuits that cannot be converted by other theorems...|$|R
50|$|Some {{decades after}} its first development, the motor {{was used in}} {{telegraphy}} to power the <b>paper</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism for both Kelvin's and Muirhead's syphon recorders. These used a moving pen attached to a galvanometer to record telegraph signals. A paper roll was wound through the recorder by a Froment motor and the inked trace appeared as a wiggling line. Muirhead's design used a vibrating pen to avoid the ink causing the pen to stick against the tiny forces of the galvanometer. Kelvin's design instead used a hollow glass pen with an electrostatic charge to propel ink from the syphon tube. This charge was generated by an influence machine, also driven by the motor.|$|R

50|$|The ink {{consumed}} in the cleaning process needs to be collected to prevent ink from leaking in the printer. The collection area is called the spittoon, and in Hewlett Packard printers this is an open plastic tray underneath the cleaning/wiping station. In Epson printers, there is typically a large absorption pad in a pan underneath the <b>paper</b> <b>feed</b> platen. For printers several years old, {{it is common for}} the dried ink in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and touch the printheads, jamming the printer. Some larger professional printers using solvent inks may employ a replaceable plastic receptacle to contain waste ink and solvent which must be emptied or replaced when full.|$|R

The observation show that the contact zone is changing with the normal load F and the rubber thickness has effect on the stress distribution. In addition, the study shows that the PIM method is an efficient and promising method for simulating the problem...|$|R
