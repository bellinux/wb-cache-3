5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, <b>peat</b> <b>fire,</b> vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
500|$|The Head Wall {{was built}} in 1834 when the medieval village was {{abandoned}} and a new one planned between Tobar Childa and the sea some 700feet (200 m) down the slope. This came about {{as the result of}} a visit by Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland, one of the members of parliament for Devon. Appalled by the primitive conditions, he gave money for the building of a completely new settlement of thirty new blackhouses. These houses were made of dry stone, had thick walls, and were roofed with turf. Each typically had only one tiny window and a small opening for letting out smoke from the <b>peat</b> <b>fire</b> that burnt in the middle of the room. As a result, the interiors were blackened by soot. The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter, and once a year the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground. [...] In October 1860, several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale, and repairs were sufficient only to make them suitable for use as byres. According to Alasdair MacGregor's analysis of the settlement, the sixteen modern, zinc-roofed cottages amidst the black houses and new Factor's house seen in most photographs of the native islanders were constructed around 1862.|$|E
500|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century there was a {{conscious}} attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun, and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. Hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years. Many small settlements were dismantled. Of those that remained many were now crofters: poor families living on [...] "crofts"—very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals, with kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service as important sources of revenue. Many lived in blackhouses with double thickness walls about [...] high, made of local stone and packed with rubble and earth and thatched with reeds. They were unfaced inside and were usually warmed by a <b>peat</b> <b>fire</b> on a slab floor, the smoke from which gave them their name. Others were forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn at Ormiston and Archibald Grant's Monymusk, to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, northern England, or to Canada or the United States.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> are a major {{contributor}} to the haze. In 2009, around 40% of all fires in Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, Sumatra and Java were detected in peatlands, even though they cover only 10% of the land area studied. The concentration of sulphur in rain falling over Singapore in 1997 correlated closely with the PM2.5 concentration, which {{can be attributed to the}} strong sulphur emission from <b>peat</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that in 1997, <b>peat</b> and forest <b>fires</b> in Indonesia released between 0.81 and 2.57 Gt of carbon; equivalent to 13–40 percent of the amount released by global fossil fuel burning, and greater than the carbon uptake of the world's biosphere.

More than 100 <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> in Kalimantan and East Sumatra have continued to burn since 1997; each year, these <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> ignite new forest fires above the ground.|$|R

2500|$|Some Scotch whisky distilleries, such {{as those}} on Islay, use <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> to dry malted barley. The drying process takes about 30 hours. This gives the whiskies a {{distinctive}} smoky flavour, often called [...] "peatiness".|$|R
60|$|At the Cove {{the whole}} party was {{accommodated}} in a single-roomed hut, which chanced to be empty at the time.

60|$|Mother Doll's exclamations of pity were profuse. There was {{a kettle}} of broth on the <b>peat</b> <b>fire,</b> and after placing {{the girl in}} a corner of the settle, she filled three wooden bowls, two of which she placed before Hal and the shepherd, making signs to the heavy-browed Piers to wait; and getting no reply from her {{worn-out}} guest, she took her in her arms, and fed her from a wooden spoon. Though without clear waking, mouthfuls were swallowed down, till the bowl was filled again and set before Piers.|$|E
60|$|The flagged {{kitchen was}} very clean {{and a big}} <b>peat</b> <b>fire</b> burned in the grate. A black oak meal-chest stood {{against the wall and}} old-fashioned china filled the rack above. On the {{opposite}} side, there was a large cupboard, which Foster thought concealed a bed. The room was warm and looked comfortable after the wet moor. Then Foster turned to the red-cheeked old woman who sat knitting by the fire and fixed on him a quietly-scrutinizing gaze. He explained that he was tired and wanted to stay the night, adding that Pete had said {{they would be willing to}} accommodate him.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was on a}} Saturday evening {{soon after}} Bill Swinton had become convalescent. The parlor of the [...] "Brown Cow" [...] was filled with its usual gathering; a <b>peat</b> <b>fire</b> glowed upon the hearth, and two tallow candles burned {{somewhat}} faintly in the dense smoke. Mugs of beer stood on the tables, but they were seldom applied to the lips of the smokers, for {{they had to do}} service without being refilled through the long evening. The silence was broken only by the short puffs at the pipes. All were thinking over the usual topic, when old Gideon Jones unexpectedly led their ideas into another channel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peat</b> <b>fires</b> causing {{significant}} loss {{of properties}} and an unverified number of human fatalities {{started in the}} Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, the Voronezh Oblast, Moscow Oblast, Ryazan Oblast and across central and western Russia due to unseasonably hot weather.|$|R
50|$|In January 2014, a major bushfire {{broke out}} {{just north of}} the town, igniting {{heathland}} all the way north to Suffolk Park. The blaze was started by a lighting strike and continued for another month due to underground <b>peat</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R
25|$|In North America, <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> {{can occur}} during severe {{droughts}} throughout their occurrence, from boreal forests in Canada to swamps and fens in the subtropical southern Florida Everglades.

60|$|Foster {{thanked him}} and {{followed}} the track, which {{led him to a}} hollow where lights shone among a clump of bare ash trees. A few low, white houses straggled along the roadside, and he thought one that was somewhat larger and had dormer windows was the change-house. When he knocked he was shown into an untidy kitchen where two men sat drinking by a <b>peat</b> <b>fire.</b> At first, the landlord seemed doubtful about being able to find room for him, but his manner changed when Foster carelessly mentioned that he understood from Pete that he would be welcome, and one of the others gave him a keen glance.|$|E
60|$|Pete {{arrived in}} the evening when it was getting dark, and after a meal, which they ate together, Foster moved his chair {{back from the table}} and sat {{opposite}} his companions. A lamp was burning and the red glow from the <b>peat</b> <b>fire</b> fell on their rough clothing and quiet brown faces as they waited for him to speak. He admitted that what he was about to do was rash. He had no logical reason for trusting these people and perhaps no right to involve them in his difficulties, while the sensible course would be to put the matter {{in the hands of the}} police. But this was a course he did not mean to take.|$|E
60|$|Entering, he was {{surprised}} to find a neatly, though plainly, furnished room, which was evidently the kitchen of the house--indeed, the sole room, with the exception of an off-shoot closet. The large open fireplace contained a <b>peat</b> <b>fire</b> on the hearth, over which hung a bubbling pot. There were two box-beds opposite the fire, and in the wall which faced the door there was a very small window, containing four panes of glass, each of which had a knot in the middle of it. One of them also presented the phenomenon of a flattened nose, for the boy with the ragged head had rushed down and stationed himself there to observe the result of the unexpected and singular visit.|$|E
50|$|In the {{hot summer}} of 2009, {{smouldering}} dry <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> {{broke out in}} the area. Such fires were not a new phenomenon in the region; they had affected the peatlands alongside the Guadiana in previous years, but by reappearing in the National Park, the fires represented another symptom of the wetland's degradation.|$|R
2500|$|Large {{areas of}} organic wetland (peat) soils are {{currently}} drained for agriculture, forestry, and peat extraction. This process {{is taking place}} all over the world. This not only destroys the habitat of many species but also heavily fuels climate change. As a result of peat drainage, the organic carbon– which built over thousands of years and is normally underwater– is suddenly exposed to the air. It decomposes and turns into carbon dioxide (...) , which is released into the atmosphere. Emissions The global [...] emissions from drained peatlands have increased from 1,058 Mton in 1990 to 1,298 Mton in 2008 (a 20% increase). This increase has particularly taken place in developing countries, of which Indonesia, China, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea are the fastest-growing top emitters. This estimate excludes emissions from <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> (conservative estimates amount to at least 4,000 Mton/-eq./yr for south-east Asia). With 174 Mton/-eq./yr the EU is after Indonesia (500 Mton) and before Russia (161 Mton) the world's second-largest emitter of drainage-related peatland [...] (excl. extracted <b>peat</b> and <b>fires).</b> Total [...] emissions from the worldwide 500,000km2 of degraded peatland may exceed 2.0 Gtons (including emissions from <b>peat</b> <b>fires)</b> which is almost 6% of all global carbon emissions.|$|R
50|$|According to the Emergencies Ministry, {{there were}} {{registered}} 831 <b>fires,</b> including 42 <b>peat</b> <b>fires.</b> 80 large fires were registered {{in an area}} of 150800 ha. Almost 162,000 people were reported to be fighting with the flames in the regions of Moscow, Voronezh, Nizhny Novgorod, Ryazan, Ivanovo, Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Tver, Yekaterinburg, Republic of Mordovia, and Mari El Republic.|$|R
60|$|Hannah and {{her mother}} and father sat down that night in silence to their simple meal of oatmeal {{porridge}} and Scotch whisky. In the evening the mother sat to her spinning. Busily she plied her work, for it was a task of love. Her eldest born, Jamie, was away at college at Edinburgh, preparing for the ministry. His graduation day was approaching, and Jamie's mother was spinning him a pair of breeches against the day. The breeches were to be a surprise. Already they were shaping that way. Oyster McShamus sat reading the Old Testament in silence, while Hannah looked into the <b>peat</b> <b>fire</b> and thought of the beautiful young Laird. Only once the Highlander spoke.|$|E
60|$|Grisell durst {{not stop}} {{to ask whether}} she had heard the word Copeland aright, and ran downstairs with a {{throbbing}} heart, just crossing the hall, where she thought she saw a figure bowed down, with hands over his face and elbows on his knees, {{but she could not}} pause, and went on to the kitchen, where the <b>peat</b> <b>fire</b> was never allowed to expire, and it was easy to stir it into heat. Whatever was cold she handed over to the servants to appease the hunger of the arrivals, while she broiled steaks, and heated the great perennial cauldron of broth with all the expedition in her power, with the help of Thora and the grumbling cook, when he appeared, angry at being disturbed.|$|E
60|$|Winter had begun, and {{although}} the briars shone red along the hedgerows and the stunted oaks had not lost all their leaves, bitter sleet blew across the dale when Grace went up the muddy lonning to Mireside farm. Railton's daughter had for a time helped the housekeeper at Tarnside, and Grace, hearing that the farmer had been ill, {{was going to ask}} about him. It was nearly dark when she entered the big kitchen. The lamp had not been lighted, but a <b>peat</b> <b>fire</b> burned in the wide grate, where irons for cooking pots hung above the blaze. A bright glow leaped up and spread about the kitchen, touching the people in the room, and then faded as she shut the massive door.|$|E
50|$|An eternal flame is a flame, lamp or torch {{that burns}} {{continuously}} for an indefinite period. Most eternal flames are ignited and tended intentionally, {{but some are}} natural phenomena caused by natural gas leaks, <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> and coal seam fires, {{all of which can}} be initially ignited by lightning, piezoelectricity or human activity, some of which have burned for thousands of years.|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} use of dried peat is as a soil {{amendment}} (sold as moss peat or sphagnum peat) {{to increase the}} soil's capacity to retain moisture and enrich the soil. It is also used as a mulch. Some distilleries, notably in the Islay whisky-producing region, use the smoke from <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> to dry the barley used in making Scotch whisky.|$|R
50|$|The {{swamps and}} bogs {{surrounding}} Moscow had been drained in the 1960s for agricultural use and mining of peat to generate energy. In 2002, {{a series of}} hard-to-extinguish <b>peat</b> <b>fires</b> led the government {{to recognize that the}} peat fields needed to be re-watered to prevent wildfires. By 2010, however, large expanses of peat areas had not been rewatered and were kindling wildfires.|$|R
