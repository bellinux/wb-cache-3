5|$|Natural predators of the Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{include the}} barn owl, the tawny owl, the northern goshawk, the peregrine falcon, the golden eagle, the eagle owl, the red fox, the stone marten and the <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the animals}} in the spruce-fir forest have ranges that extend into the balsam fir forest higher up. Warblers are abundant; more than ten species exist in this forest type. Other common birds include brown-capped chickadees, spruce grouse, and yellow-capped woodpeckers. Mammals include the red {{squirrel}} and the <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{elevation}} and level of precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines, including ponderosa and lodgepole pines, as well as spruces. Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mountain goats, <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> and mountain lions, while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.|$|E

40|$|Does size {{dimorphism}} reduce {{competition between}} sexes? The diet {{of male and}} female <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> at local and wider geographical scales Andrzej ZALEWSKI Zalewski A. 2007. Does size dimorphism reduce competition between sexes? The diet {{of male and female}} <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> at local and wider geographical scales. Acta Theriologica 52 : 237 – 250. Sex-specific niche segregation is often used to explain sexual size dimorphism (SSD). However, whether food niche partitioning between sexes occurs as a case of sexual size dimorphism or by other mechanisms, such as behavioural dimorp-hism or habitat segregation, remains poorly understood. To evaluate {{the nature and extent of}} food-niche differentiation between sexes in a solitary predator I examined variation in the diet of male and female <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> Martes martes Linnaeus, 1758 in years of high and low rodent abundance.

50|$|Hospital Wood {{is home to}} {{wildlife}} such as <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> deer, foxes {{and a variety of}} birds.|$|R
5|$|The area {{shares a}} common brown bear {{population}} with Norway and Russia. Other predators include red fox, stoat, <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> and the rare wolverine and Eurasian lynx. The gray wolf was common until the 1940s. There {{is also a}} large population of moose. Inari–Pasvik has a shared population of 6,000 reindeer, which are herded to different areas depending on the season. Fences have been installed to hinder reindeer from wandering across the national borders.|$|E
5|$|The {{great spotted cuckoo}} (Clamator glandarius) {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw, depositing its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel. Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, tawny owl, and least weasel (Mustela nivalis) in England, and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Finland. The European <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes martes) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests {{are part of a}} colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{was able to}} quickly replace lost birds – {{there is a high}} proportion of non-breeding, non-territorial birds able to fill vacant territories. The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey; gamekeepers' more successful efforts to wipe out the northern goshawk and <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> – predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk – may have benefited it. The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed, for example during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife {{includes}} the large Monache deer herd, the sensitive Sierra Nevada red fox, <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> cougars, and black bears.|$|R
25|$|Mammals inhabiting {{the peak}} and its {{immediate}} surroundings include bighorn sheep, marmots, pikas, <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> mule deer, and dwarf shrew.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} species {{which may be}} observed in the reserve, namely red deer, mountain hare, kestrels and <b>pine</b> <b>martens.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because Ireland became {{isolated}} from mainland Europe by rising sea levels {{before the last}} ice age had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
5|$|The larger Welsh mammals {{died out}} during the Norman period, {{including}} the brown bear, wolf and the wildcat. Today, mammals of note include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. Other animals of note include, otter, stoat and weasel. The <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> which has had the occasional sighting, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats {{can be found in}} Snowdonia.|$|E
5000|$|Fur {{was also}} {{exported}} as it provided warmth. This included the furs of <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> foxes, bears, otters and beavers.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife {{includes}} the large Monache mule deer herd, the sensitive Sierra Nevada red fox, <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> mountain lions, and American black bears.|$|R
50|$|The beech marten's penis {{is larger}} than the pine marten's, with the bacula of young beech martens often outsizing those of old <b>pine</b> <b>martens.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mountain hare (apparently {{absent from}} Skye in the 18th century) and rabbit are now {{abundant}} and predated on by wild cat and <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b> Red deer are common {{on the hills}} and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland in internationally important numbers, with colonies of the former found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles and the latter most abundant in the Firth of Lorn. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore minke whales, killer whales, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life {{that can be seen}} and edible crab and oyster are also found, in for example, the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b> Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
50|$|Mammalian fauna {{includes}} wolves, bears, wild boars, foxes, hares, badgers and European <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> some {{of which}} are declared rare and endangered in Serbia.|$|R
50|$|In October 2008, 21 {{species of}} mammals were {{recorded}} on the island. They included, in Belgrade rarely seen, otters, nutrias, weasels and European <b>pine</b> <b>martens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Menorca has no large native mammals. There {{are some}} small mammals {{including}} rabbits, bats, rats, mice, <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> and a subspecies of North African hedgehog.|$|R
5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and European <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b> The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E
5|$|While loss {{of habitat}} has {{affected}} native {{animals such as}} the <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> elk, woodland caribou, and bison, others like whitetail deer and bobcat thrive. The state has the nation's largest population of timber wolves outside Alaska, and supports healthy populations of black bears, moose, and gophers. Located on the Mississippi Flyway, Minnesota hosts migratory waterfowl such as geese and ducks, and game birds such as grouse, pheasants, and turkeys. It is home to birds of prey, including {{the largest number of}} breeding pairs of bald eagles in the lower 48 states as of 2007, red-tailed hawks, and snowy owls. The lakes teem with sport fish such as walleye, bass, muskellunge, and northern pike, and streams in the southeast and northeast are populated by brook, brown, and rainbow trout.|$|E
25|$|Most mammals {{native to}} Ireland and long {{established}} introduced species {{are found in}} the park. The bank vole was first identified in 1964 in northwest Kerry. Its range has now expanded and now includes the park. <b>Pine</b> <b>marten</b> is another notable species in the park.|$|E
50|$|When {{present in}} large numbers, they may cause damage to {{orchards}} and be considered pests. Their primary predators include owls, foxes, <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> and wildcats.|$|R
50|$|Spruce grouse {{eggs are}} taken by red squirrels, foxes, weasels, and {{probably}} corvids. Adults can {{fall prey to}} various hawks and owls, foxes, <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> and coyotes.|$|R
5000|$|The island {{also has}} several birds of prey, such as hen harriers, golden eagles, and short eared owls: all {{difficult}} species to see {{throughout the rest}} of the UK. <b>Pine</b> <b>martens</b> have also recently become established on Mull. According to a paper by Scottish Natural Heritage [...] it is unlikely that <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> have ever been native to the Isle of Mull. Based on sighting records, and from resulting modelling exercises, it is believed the species arrived in 2004 through accidental transportation on timber boats from the mainland.|$|R
25|$|Non-domestic {{animals in}} the Boho area include the Irish hare, wild goats, foxes, badgers, red squirrels, rats, mice and shrews and the {{occasional}} <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b> Amongst Northern Ireland's priority species are Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentoni) which was observed in a nursery roost located in Boho Caves in July 1895.|$|E
25|$|Pantalaimon is Lyra's dæmon. Like all dæmons of children, {{he changes}} from one {{creature}} to another constantly. When Lyra reaches puberty he assumes the permanent {{form of a}} <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b> Pantalaimon and Lyra follow her father, Lord Asriel, when he travels to the newly discovered world of Cittagazze.|$|E
25|$|Bird {{species that}} {{reside in the}} oak woods include blue tit, common chaffinch, goldcrest, European robin, and wren. Mammals include badger, fox, <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> red deer, sika deer, and red squirrel. Insects include many species of the {{parasitic}} gall wasp and the purple hairstreak butterfly, whose caterpillar is entirely dependent upon oak trees.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} the far {{northern}} lands; much of the wildlife in the books from those lands are primarily native to Scotland specifically, such as <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> and golden eagles.|$|R
50|$|Assynt {{is renowned}} for having diverse {{wildlife}} and Achmelvich is no exceptions with cetaceans, seals, basking sharks, otters, <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> ospreys and white-tailed eagles having {{been seen in}} the area.|$|R
50|$|Animals that inhabit {{this park}} include caribou, foxes, {{peregrine}} falcons, grizzly bears, wolves, Alaskan moose, wolverines, gyrfalcons, black bears, muskoxen, golden eagles, <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> ground squirrels, muskrats, lynxes, and minks.|$|R
