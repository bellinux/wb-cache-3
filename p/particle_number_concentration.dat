50|$|A {{particle}} may diffuse to {{a surface}} in quiescent conditions, but {{this process is}} inefficient as a thick depletion layer develops, {{which leads to a}} progressive slowing down of the deposition. When particle deposition is efficient, it proceeds almost exclusively in a system under flow. In such conditions, the hydrodynamic flow will transport the particles close to the surface. Once a particle is situated close to the surface, it will attach spontaneously, when the particle-surface interactions are attractive. In this situation, one refers to favorable deposition conditions. When the interaction is repulsive at larger distances, but attractive at shorter distances, deposition will still occur but it will be slowed down. One refers to unfavorable deposition conditions here. The initial stages of the deposition process can be described with the rate equation where &Gamma; is the number density of deposited particles, t is the time, c the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration,</b> and k the deposition rate coefficient. The rate coefficient depends on the flow velocity, flow geometry, and the interaction potential of the depositing particle with the substrate. In many situations, this potential can be approximated by a superposition of attractive van der Waals forces and repulsive electrical double layer forces and can be described by DLVO theory. When the charge of the particles is of the same sign as the substrate, deposition will be favorable at high salt levels, while it will be unfavorable at lower salt levels. When the charge of the particles is of the opposite sign as the substrate, deposition is favorable for all salt levels, and one observes a small enhancement of the deposition rate with decreasing salt level due to attractive electrostatic double layer forces. Initial stages of the deposition process are relatively similar to the early stages of particle heteroaggregation, whereby one of the particles is much larger than the other.|$|E

Based on Pearson coefficients between <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> and meteorological parameters, precipitation and temperature both had significantly negative relationships with <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations,</b> whereas atmospheric pressure was positively correlated with the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The diurnal variation of <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> in nucleation mode particles correlated closely with photochemical processes in all four seasons.

The function control allows unattended quality assurance experiments at remote air quality monitoring or research stations under field conditions. The automated function control also has the advantage of being able to get a faster system stability response than the recommended on-site comparisons with reference instruments. The method is based on a comparison of the total <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> measured by a mobility particle size spectrometer and a condensation particle counter while removing diffusive particles smaller than 20 nm in diameter. In practice, the small particles are removed by a set of diffusion screens, as traditionally used in a diffusion battery. Another feature of the automated function control is to check the zero-point behaviour of the ambient aerosol passing through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The performance of the function control is illustrated {{with the aid of a}} 1 -year data set recorded at Annaberg-Buchholz, a station in the Saxon air quality monitoring network. During the period of concern, the total <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> derived from the mobility particle size spectrometer slightly overestimated the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> recorded by the condensation particle counter by 2 % (grand average).

A clear accumulation mode was observed during the darker months from October until mid-May, which became considerably more pronounced during the prominent Arctic haze months from March to mid-May. In contrast, nucleation- and Aitken-mode particles were predominantly observed during the summer months. Analysis of wind direction and wind speed indicated possible contributions of marine sources from the easterly side of the station to the observed summertime <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations,</b> while southwesterly to westerly winds dominated during the darker months. NPF events lasting from hours to days were mostly observed from June until August, with fewer events observed during the months with less sunlight, i. e., March, April, September and October. The results tend to indicate that ozone (O 3) might be weakly anti-correlated with <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the nucleation-mode range (10 - 30 ĝ€nm) in almost half of the NPF events, while no positive correlation was observed. Calculations of air mass back trajectories using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model for the NPF event days suggested that the onset or interruption of events could possibly be explained by changes in air mass origin. A map of event occurrence probability was computed, indicating that southerly air masses from over the Greenland Sea were more likely linked to those events...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the short-term respiratory effects due to the inhalation of electronic and conventional tobacco cigarette-generated mainstream aerosols through the measurement of the exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). To this purpose, twenty-five smokers were asked to smoke a conventional cigarette and to vape an electronic cigarette (with and without nicotine), and an electronic cigarette without liquid (control session). Electronic and tobacco cigarette mainstream aerosols were characterized in terms of total <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> and size distributions. On the basis of the measured total <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> and size distributions, the average particle doses deposited in alveolar and tracheobronchial regions of the lungs for a single 2 -s puff were also estimated considering a subject performing resting (sitting) activity. Total <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the mainstream resulted equal to 3. 5 ± 0. 4 × 109, 5. 1 ± 0. 1 × 109, and 3. 1 ± 0. 6 × 109 part. cm− 3 for electronic cigarettes without nicotine, with nicotine, and for conventional cigarettes, respectively. The corresponding alveolar doses for a resting subject were estimated equal to 3. 8 × 1010, 5. 2 × 1010 and 2. 3 × 1010 particles. The mean eNO variations measured after each smoking/vaping session were equal to 3. 2 ppb, 2. 7 ppb and 2. 8 ppb for electronic cigarettes without nicotine, with nicotine, and for conventional cigarettes, respectively; whereas, negligible eNO changes were measured in the control session. Statistical tests performed on eNO data showed statistically significant differences between smoking/vaping sessions and the control session, thus confirming a similar effect on human airways whatever the cigarette smoked/vaped, the nicotine content, and the particle dose received...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{developed}} condensation particle counter UF- 02 was approbated and tested. The {{investigations of the}} measured concentration range {{have shown that the}} condensation particle counter UF- 02 can be used for measuring the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> from 0. 002 to 100 000 cm¡ 3, and the determined cut-off size was 4 nm. Three {{newly developed}} condensation particle counters (CPCs) UF- 02 were tested at the SMEAR I station in Värriö (Lapland, Finland). The studied period covers 26 April and 12 May 2003. These CPCs were used for measurement of the aerosol <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> in the atmospheric boundary layer at the SMEAR I station. Two instruments were set into action with the cut-off size of 4. 5 nm and one with 10 nm. The data of the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> variability were collected. The air mass backward trajectories were used to estimate the prehistory of the air masses. Moreover, trace gas (O 3, NOx, and SO 2) concentrations were analysed. During these studies the calibration and inter-comparison of instruments were also performed. The information about new characteristics of the instruments was obtained...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{potential}} effects of vehicle emissions on human health, the ability to predict ultrafine <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> and dispersion is important for maintaining a healthy environment and evaluating human exposure. This study aimed to investigate the concentration and distribution of airborne particles at a bus station, with the buses idling. The results of the CFD modeling {{used in this study}} indicated that wind direction, wind speed and the ultrafine particle emission factors of buses all {{play a critical role in}} determining pollutant concentration and distribution. Airborne particles were found to increase down wind from the bus station and decrease with increasing distance from the bus station. This study also compared the results of the CFD model with experimental measurements and confirmed that CFD modeling is a fast, simple and effective method for predicting ultrafine <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> and dispersion produced by idling buses. Further studies should aim at developing predictive models for ultrafine <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> when the buses are in motion, in order to determine the relative importance of acceleration and deceleration in contributing to pollutant dispersion...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} particle evolution measurements {{taken in}} the Particulate Aerosol Laboratory (PAL). The PAL consists of a burner capable of burning jet fuel that exhausts into an altitude chamber that can simulate temperature and pressure conditions up to 13, 700 m. After presenting results from initial temperature distributions inside the chamber, particle count data measured in the altitude chamber are shown. Initial particle count data show that the sampling system can {{have a significant effect}} on the measured particle distribution: both the value of <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> and the shape of the radial distribution of the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> depend on whether the measurement probe is heated or unheated...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{describes the}} first international intercomparison of particle size determination by single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sp-ICPMS). Concentrated monodisperse silver nanoparticle suspensions with aparticle diameters of of 20, 40 and 100 nm and a blank solution were sent to 23 laboratories in Europe and the Americas. Laboratories prepared eight nanoparticle preparations in two food simulants (distilled water; 10 % ethanol) and reported median particle size, Ag particle mass <b>concentration</b> and Ag <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Average repeatability and reproducibility standard deviation (sr and sR) for the median particle diameter were 1 and 14 nm, respectively. Relative precision was worse for Ag <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> (RSDr = 11 %; RSDR = 78 %). While further improvements of the method, especially with respect to software tools for evaluation, hardware options for shorter dwell-times, calibration standards for determining nebuliser efficiency and further experience by laboratories are certainly desirable, {{the results of this}} study demonstrate the suitability of sp-ICPMS for the detection and quantification of certain kinds of nanoparticles.

40|$|Total <b>number</b> <b>concentrations,</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> of {{ultrafine}} (0. 01 - 0. 1 mum) and accumulation (0. 1 - 0. 5 mum) particles, {{as well as}} {{mass concentration}} of PM 2. 5 particles and blackness of PM 2. 5 filters, which is related to Black Smoke were simultaneously monitored in three European cities during the winter period {{for three and a}} half months. The purpose of the study was to describe the differences in concentration levels and daily and diurnal variations in <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> and mass <b>concentrations</b> between European cities. The results show statistically significant differences in the concentrations of PM 2. 5 and the blackness of the PM 2. 5 filters between the cities, but not in the concentrations of ultrafine particles. Daily PM 2. 5 levels were found to be poorly correlated with the daily total and ultrafine <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> but better correlated with the <b>number</b> <b>concentration</b> of accumulation <b>particles.</b> According to the principal component analysis airborne particulate pollutants seem to be divided into two major source categories, one identified with <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> <b>concentrations</b> and the other related to mass-based information. The present results underline the importance of using both <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> and mass <b>concentrations</b> to evaluate urban air quality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
