500|$|Despite {{cancelling}} the DDL project, {{the government}} endorsed the RAN's requirement for new destroyer-type warships and requested {{a review of}} existing foreign designs to find a replacement. The process of evaluating new designs was managed by what had been the DDL project office, and in line with the government's priorities it initially focused on selecting affordable warships of a <b>proven</b> <b>design</b> for further consideration. A large number of designs were studied by the project office, and the United States' s and a variant of the British Type 42 destroyer armed with SM-1 surface to air missiles were eventually short listed for detailed evaluation. The project team found that the Type 42 was the only design capable of meeting the Navy's requirement, and stated that the Oliver Hazard Perry class was [...] "a second rate escort that falls short of the DDL requirements on virtually every respect". Despite this, there were serious concerns over whether {{it would be possible to}} fit SM-1 missiles to the Type 42, and this led the government to approve the purchase of two Oliver Hazard Perry ships from the United States in April 1974.|$|E

2500|$|Czechoslovakia {{chose the}} MB.200 {{as part of}} a {{modernisation}} program for its air force of the [...] mid-1930s. [...] Although at the rate of aircraft development at that time, the MB.200 would quickly become obsolete, the Czechoslovakians needed a quick solution involving the license production of a <b>proven</b> <b>design,</b> as their own aircraft industry did not have sufficient development experience with such a large aircraft, or with all-metal airframes and stressed-skin construction, placing an initial order for 74 aircraft. After some delays, both Aero and Avia began license-production in 1937, with [...] a total of about 124 built. Czechoslovakian MB.200s were basically similar to their French counterparts, with differences in defensive armament and other equipment.|$|E
