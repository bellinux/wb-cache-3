5000|$|Erle E. Bartley (October 23, 1922 - February 10, 1983) was an Agricultural Science Professor at Kansas State University from 1949 {{until his}} death in 1983. He was known for his many {{agricultural}} inventions, especially those regarding ruminal tympany (ruminant bloat) problems. He invented the bloat preventative <b>poloxalene,</b> also known as [...] "Bloat Guard".|$|E
50|$|Bartley's {{research}} {{focused on}} ruminant bloat, legume bloat, and {{the utilization of}} ammonia in the rumen. He was {{best known for his}} work on preventative treatments for ruminant bloat, including <b>poloxalene</b> and the antibiotic lascalocid. He also researched ammonia toxicity in ruminants as well as the interactions between carbohydrates and urea in the ruminant digestive system.|$|E
40|$|<b>Poloxalene</b> {{has proved}} to be an {{effective}} agent to prevent legume bloat in cattle, however, intake of the compound at regular intervals during the day is important. Intake twice daily at approximately 12 -hour intervals has been shown to control bloat. This presents a management problem with beef cattle under most grazing conditions. This trial tested the effectiveness of <b>poloxalene</b> administered to beef cattle grazing immature alfalfa in a molasses-salt block and as “Bloat Guard” mixed with rolled sorghum grain fed free choice in a self feeder...|$|E
40|$|<b>Poloxalene</b> and {{a mineral}} mixture feed {{supplement}} patented {{for the treatment}} of emphysema, polyarthritis, and other pectin related diseases were tested in two trials for their ability to prevent bloat in cattle fed fresh alfalfa. Each trial had a crossover design using three Jersey steers with rumen fistulas per group. Each trial period continued until the total number of cases of bloat reached > or = 24. Treatments were given at 0800 each day. The mineral mixture was given at 100 g/d and 190 mg/kg body weight per day in the first and second trials, respectively. <b>Poloxalene,</b> which was tested only in the second trial, was given at 23 mg/kg body weight per day. Each group of steers was then fed 200 kg of freshly harvested alfalfa in the vegetative to early bloom stages of growth at 0830. In the first trial, only 69 % as many cases of bloat occurred on the mineral mixture as on the control treatment, but no significant difference was detected in the second trial. The potency of the alfalfa may have been higher in the second trial, when forage dry matter was lower, magnesium and soluble nitrogen were higher, and bloat occasionally occurred twice a day. Bloat did not occur when the steers were treated with <b>poloxalene.</b> In these trials, <b>poloxalene</b> was completely effective in preventing bloat, but the mineral mixture was only partially so...|$|E
40|$|The hypocholesterolemic {{effect of}} the {{hydrophobic}} surfactant, <b>poloxalene</b> 2930, was studied in the rabbit to determine whether this agent prevents experimentally produced atherosclerosis. Male rabbits were divided into four groups and fed a control diet (group A) or an atherogenic diet (groups B, C, and D) for 10 wk. Diets of groups C and D were supplemented with 0. 5 and 1 % <b>poloxalene</b> 2930, respectively. Animals in group B developed significantly greater levels of cholesterol in the serum and aorta compared with group A. Addition of <b>poloxalene</b> 2930 to the diets of groups C and D prevented significant elevations in cholesterol concentrations of both serum and aorta compared with group B with values for group D being essentially similar to those observed in group A. Groups C and D also had significant increases of fecal excretion of both neutral fat and neutral steroids as compared with either groups A or B. There were no atherosclerotic lesions of the aortas from group D. Aortas from rabbits in group B had numerous atheromatous plaques while one rabbit each from groups A and C had several very small atheromatous lesions. These results demonstrate that <b>poloxalene</b> 2930 reduces the rise of serum cholesterol in rabbits {{in response to an}} atherogenic diet and prevents the development of atherosclerosis. This hypocholesterolemic effect is likely mediated by the effect of this surfactant on the small intestine...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{relating}} to the bloat-controlling efficacy of several anti-bloat pastes were studied. Firstly, the detergent diffusion rates of various pastes were measured in a rumen model. In comparison with the liquid detergent control, some formulations were found to markedly slow the washout of detergent from the model. A theoretical paste dosing schedule versus liquid dosing schedule, based on the rumen model calculations, revealed several advantages of the paste formulation over the liquid. For example, the paste maintained a more steady detergent concentration and extended the interval between dosings. An investigation {{of the effects of}} administration to the live animal on the intactness of the paste bolus when delivered at the cardia was undertaken. It was found that the reaction of the animal to the dosing procedure had a strong influence on the degree of intactness of the paste bolus entering the rumen. A difference between animals in this respect was observed. It was shown that fragmented boli collected at the cardia dissolved more quickly than intact boli when subjected to mild agitation. The consequences of this in relation to persistence of protection for bloat were discussed. The decay curves of <b>Poloxalene</b> detergent administered to steers in either a liquid or a paste formulation were calculated and compared. As a standard control against which other materials might be compared, the concentration decay curve of a water soluble rumen marker (polyethylene glycol, 4000) was determined in each steer. It was found that the paste formulation did not slow the washout of detergent from the rumen by more than about two hours. Also, the average concentration dilution rates of detergent and PEG 4000 were found to be similar. However, at high <b>Poloxalene</b> dose rates, the endogenous water inflow to the rumen was found to increase markedly which in turn influenced the average detergent dilution rate. The diffusion rate curves of <b>Poloxalene</b> paste either in the rumen model or in vivo showed striking similarities. This suggested that the rumen model might be a valuable screening system for new paste formulations. Several field trials were undertaken to test whether the bloat-controlling efficacy of paste formulations of detergent was better than that of liquids, and to examine the validity of the rumen model findings. Unfortunately, the bloat challenge on each occasion was insufficient to collect the necessary data. However, valuable information regarding the requirements for satisfactory field trials was obtained and are discussed. In summary, {{the results of the study}} showed that: 1) Pastes can be formulated which, relative to similar liquid preparations, will slow the rate of detergent washout from a rumen model. 2) The in vivo detergent decay curves of both <b>Poloxalene</b> paste and liquid were similar to those determined in vitro. Together with (1) above, this suggests the rumen model might be a useful screening system. 3) Paste boli delivered at the cardia can vary widely in intactness between and within animals and this depends largely on animal reaction to the dosing procedure. 4) Fragmented boli dissolve more quickly than intact boli in vitro and this characteristic may be crucial in detergent longevity in the rumen liquor. Therefore it is concluded that: 1) The rumen model warrants development and testing. 2) An efficient analytical method needs to be developed for detecting detergents in rumen liquor. This would allow accurate in vivo detergent decay curves to be established. Without this, further progress will be slow. 3) Field trials must still be carried out to provide and confirm relationships between in vitro results and field efficacy...|$|E
