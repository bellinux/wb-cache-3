40|$|Abstract: This {{work offers}} a general {{framework}} of fuzzy constraint-based agent negotiation with opponent learning. The proposed approach via fuzzy probability constraint clusters the opponent’s information in negotiation process as <b>proximate</b> regularities <b>to</b> increase the efficiency on {{the convergence of}} behavior patterns, and eliminates the bulk of false hypotheses or beliefs to improves the effectiveness on beliefs learning. By using fuzzy instance method, our approach can not only reuse the prior opponent knowledge to speed up problem-solving, but also reason the <b>proximate</b> regularities <b>to</b> acquire desirable outcomes on predicting opponent behavior. Besides, the proposed interaction method enables the negotiating agent to adapt dynamically based on expected objectives. Moreover, experimental {{results suggest that the}} proposed framework allowed an agent to achieve a higher reward, fairer deal, or less cost of negotiation. Key–Words: Intelligence systems, multi-agent systems, agent negotiation, opponent modeling, beliefs learning, fuzzy constraints. ...|$|R

25|$|It is {{believed}} that latent HIV can cross the blood–brain barrier inside circulating monocytes in the bloodstream ("Trojan horse theory") within the first 14 days of infection. Once inside, these monocytes become activated and are transformed into macrophages. Activated macrophages release virions into the brain tissue <b>proximate</b> <b>to</b> brain microvessels. These viral particles likely {{attract the attention of}} sentinel brain microglia and perivascular macrophages initiating an inflammatory cascade that may cause a series of intracellular signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells and damage the functional and structural integrity of the BBB. This inflammation is HIV encephalitis (HIVE). Instances of HIVE probably occur throughout the course of AIDS and are a precursor for HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The premier model for studying HIV and HIVE is the simian model.|$|E

25|$|Vesicles in {{the nerve}} {{terminal}} are grouped into three pools: the readily releasable pool, the recycling pool, and the reserve pool. These pools are distinguished by their function and {{position in the}} nerve terminal. The readily releasable pool are docked to the cell membrane, making these {{the first group of}} vesicles to be released on stimulation. The readily releasable pool is small and is quickly exhausted. The recycling pool is <b>proximate</b> <b>to</b> the cell membrane, and tend to be cycled at moderate stimulation, so that the rate of vesicle release is the same as, or lower than, the rate of vesicle formation. This pool is larger than the readily releasable pool, but it takes longer to become mobilised. The reserve pool contains vesicles that are not released under normal conditions. This reserve pool can be quite large (~50%) in neurons grown on a glass substrate, but is very small or absent at mature synapses in intact brain tissue.|$|E
25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the strip club industry observed in the 2000s occurred primarily in the Western world. Far from its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, Japan's sex industry {{has been in a}} protracted slump {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century, as the overall economy experienced a recession. Its hostess and strip bars (those which had not closed outright) felt the impact of dwindling corporate spending accounts, leading to increased competition (and reduced boundaries) for remaining patrons. Profitability of strip clubs, as with other service-oriented businesses, is largely driven by location and customer spending habits. Clubs closely <b>proximate</b> <b>to</b> Wall Street in New York, New York are notorious for hosting meetings with financial industry power brokers, among other business heavyweights, which are frequently expensed on company bankrolls. Since clubs located in urban areas or business centers have caused concerns over traffic and social issues, some club owners with common interests in close proximity have shared representation without consolidating their businesses. After numerous incidents during the 1990s with local and state government, Downtown Entertainment Inc. was formed in 2000 to represent the interests of business owners on The Block in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
