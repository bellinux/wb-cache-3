5|$|Before troop {{transportation}} began, all of {{the ships}} were hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including Montanan and Dakotan, were designated to carry animals and other cargo; the other ten were designated to carry troops. Ramps and stalls were built on the four ships chosen to carry livestock. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before docking at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the guns were put in <b>place.</b> <b>All</b> the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to <b>place</b> <b>all</b> the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking <b>place</b> <b>all</b> day on Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then {{transmitted}} live—with a few pre-filmed 35mm film inserts shot {{before and during}} the rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It {{was one of the last}} major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.|$|E

5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He raised one {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, and hold the enemy in <b>place.</b> <b>All</b> groups not in contact were to ride {{to the sound of}} firing, and dismount, surrounding the enemy when they got there. Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E
5|$|The Red Sox won 15 {{games in}} a row in 1946. They were unstoppable and were in first <b>place</b> <b>all</b> but two days in the season, and would play in their first World Series game since 1918, having {{finished}} ahead of the Yankees in the American League {{for the first time since}} selling Babe Ruth. Since the Red Sox last pennant in 1918, the Yankees had won 14 pennants and 10 World Series. Although the tide against the Yankees had turned, Boston would eventually lose the Series four games to three to the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the treaty}} signed at the {{conclusion}} of the war, Hierapytna agreed to break off all relations and alliances with foreign powers and to <b>place</b> <b>all</b> its harbors and bases at Rhodes' disposal. Olous, among the ruins of which the terms of the treaty have been found, had to accept Rhodian domination. As a result, Rhodes was left with control of a significant part of eastern Crete after the war. The conclusion of the war left the Rhodians free to help their allies in the Second Macedonian War.|$|E

5|$|At the World Cup {{he played}} all three group games against Uruguay, Mexico and France, however in the win against France midfielder Joseph Bonnel racked his studs down Greaves' shin, causing a wound that {{required}} 14 stitches {{and left a}} permanent scar. His replacement, Geoff Hurst, scored the winner in the quarter-final against Argentina and kept his <b>place</b> <b>all</b> {{the way to the}} final, where Hurst scored a hat-trick as England won the tournament. Greaves was fit to play in the final, but manager Alf Ramsey opted against changing a winning team. Only the 11 players on the pitch {{at the end of the}} 4–2 win over West Germany received medals. Following a Football Association-led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all the winners' squad members, Greaves was presented with his medal by Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009. In November 2014, Greaves' medal was sold at auction for £44,000.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the subtle}} {{variations}} between specimens of pteranodontid from the Niobrara Formation, most researchers have assigned {{all of them}} to the single genus Pteranodon, in at least two species (P. longiceps and P. sternbergi) distinguished mainly by the shape of the crest. However, the classification of these two forms has varied from researcher to researcher. In 1972, Halsey Wilkinson Miller published a paper arguing that the various forms of Pteranodon were different enough to be placed in distinct subgenera. He named these Pteranodon (Occidentalia) occidentalis (for the now-disused species P. occidentalis) and Pteranodon (Sternbergia) sternbergi. However, the name Sternbergia was preoccupied, and in 1978 Miller re-named the species Pteranodon (Geosternbergia) sternbergi, and named a third subgenus/species combination for P. longiceps, as Pteranodon (Longicepia) longiceps. Most prominent pterosaur researchers of the late 20th century however, including S. Christopher Bennett and Peter Wellnhofer, did not adopt these subgeneric names, and continued to <b>place</b> <b>all</b> pteranodont species into the single genus Pteranodon.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{while serving}} at the FCO, Penfold volunteered {{to learn a}} {{difficult}} language {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. After passing an aptitude test, he was assigned a professional language tutor and began learning Amharic—the official language of Ethiopia—and after six weeks of tuition, was sent to Gondar to continue learning the language by living in Ethiopia. Shortly after, he was posted to Addis Ababa as second secretary, because the British ambassador to Ethiopia, Sir Willie Morris, was keen to have an Amharic-speaking second secretary. Penfold was responsible for monitoring and reporting on internal Ethiopian affairs and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), as the latter was based in Addis. As part of the role, Penfold was required to attend and report on meetings of the OAU, which took <b>place</b> <b>all</b> over Africa. On the instruction of Foreign Secretary David Owen, Penfold met with the leaders of the independence movement in Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) at an OAU conference in Gabon in 1977. There he met separately with Bishop Muzorewa, Joshua Nkomo, and Robert Mugabe. Penfold believed Mugabe to be difficult to work with, but later stated that it should have been obvious that Mugabe would come to power in Zimbabwe and that the British government could have made a greater effort to work with him.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 14th century, the {{position}} of fairs began to decline. The larger merchants, particularly in London, began to establish direct links with the larger landowners such as the nobility and the church; rather than the landowner buying from a chartered fair, they would buy directly from the merchant. Meanwhile, the growth of the indigenous England merchant class in the major cities, especially London, gradually crowded out the foreign merchants upon whom the great chartered fairs had largely depended. The crown's control over trade in the towns, especially the emerging newer towns towards {{the end of the}} 15th century that lacked central civic government, was increasingly weaker, making chartered status less relevant as more trade occurred from private properties and took <b>place</b> <b>all</b> year around. Nonetheless, the great fairs remained of importance well into the 15th century, as illustrated by their role in exchanging money, regional commerce and in providing choice for individual consumers.|$|E
