40|$|Learned {{helpless}} {{behavior has}} been successfully bred in rats and designated as a genetic animal model of human depression and/or anxiety. Since congenital learned helpless animals have an impaired stress response in adulthood, we {{examined the effects of}} early stressors (at postnatal day 7, 14 or 21) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the renin-angiotensin system. The functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was monitored through changes in corticosterone plasma levels in the adult animals after acute exposure to cold stress and maternal deprivation early in development. Renin-angiotensin system functioning was assessed by <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity.</b> Unstressed congenital learned helpless rats had corticosterone levels that were similar to control animals (congenital non-learned helpless rats not stressed during development), but unstressed <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> of congenital learned helpless rats were lower than congenital non-learned helpless rats. There was a step-wise increase in corticosterone plasma levels in the congenital learned helpless rats with age of acute presentation of either cold stress or maternal deprivation stress (day 7, 49 %; day 14, 84 %; and day 21, 543 % for cold stress). However, these baseline corticosterone levels were significantly lower in congenital learned helpless rats compared to congenital non-learned helpless controls.

The correlations between PAF-AH and CAD are controversial. Furthermore, the differences of the enzyme levels between patients with stable and unstable CAD are not fully determined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate plasma PAF-AH levels and its association with the presence of CAD and some clinical risk factors in the patients. Methods: This case-control study included 50 control subjects without CAD, 50 stable CAD patients and 50 unstable CAD patients with angiographically documented CAD. <b>Plasma</b> PAF-AH <b>activity</b> was determined by a commercial kit. The inflammatory markers, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), and lipid profile were also measured.

40|$|ATTEMPTS {{are being}} made to {{investigate}} whether proteolytic enzymes, possibly liberated from the tumour cells, are implicated in the observed extracellular proteolysis of fibrous host proteins at the periphery of malignant tumours (Sylven, 1945 and 1954; Sylven and Malmgren, 1957). The solid mouse tumour materials did not, until very recently, allow separate sampling of the extracellular fluid for enzymic assays. Therefore, the ascites tumour material was chosen since in this case an extracellular fluid compartment could easily be sampled. The present line of approach is supported by some recent evidence that malignant cells in general are more permeable than normal non-malignant cells {{in the sense that}} cytoplasmic proteins and enzymes are more freely passing out of the cell membranes.

Objectives: This study examines the selenium effect on antioxidant activity and recovery from sciatic nerve ischemia-reperfusion in adult rats. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 80 adult male Wistar rats weighing 250 - 300 g were used. They {{were divided into}} ten groups (n = 8 per group). The first group received sham surgery only. The second group received 0. 2 mg/kg selenium without ischemia-reperfusion surgery and eight remaining groups were divided to four control groups and four experimental groups which the latter groups received 0. 2 mg/kg selenium. All ischemia groups were rendered in ischemic for 3 hours and reperfused for various times of 3, 7, 14 and 28 days.

In univariate analysis PLTP activity correlated positively with waist (r= 0. 188), waist/hip ratio (r= 0. 143), BMI (r= 0. 125) and HOMA(ir) (r= 0. 192) (P < 0. 05 to P < 0. 001). The relationship of PLTP with HOMA(ir) was confined to subjects with the highest waist circumference and waist/hip ratio. In age- and sex-adjusted multiple linear regression models, waist circumference (β= 0. 158, P= 0. 025), but not BMI, predicted PLTP activity independently of HOMA(ir) (β= 0. 126, P= 0. 047).

40|$|Abstract. Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} is {{associated}} with procoagulant activity but not with thromboembolism. We measured coagulation factor XIII, i. e., fibrin-stabilizing factor, in 45 patients with falciparum malaria over time. Of these, 22 had organ complications. The factor XIII antigen (subunits A and B) and <b>plasma</b> <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> were abnormally low in those with falciparum malaria. They increased during antiparasitic therapy. In 14 of 22 patients with complications, but in no patient with mild disease (P, 0. 001), subunit A and activity was, 50 %. The factor X. III levels were inversely correlated with clinical severity, parasitemia, and human neutrophil elastase (HNE), but not with thrombin-antithrombin III levels. Thus, low factor XIII levels may reflect proteolysis by HNE, rather than procoagulant activity. One could speculate that factor XIII degradation in severe malaria prevents thromboembolism. On the other hand, factor XIII deficiency might reduce protection of the vascular endothelium against HNE and reactive oxygen species, which would promote organ damage.

Evidence suggests that pathological changes produced during infection with trypanosomes could be initiated by nonspecific endotoxin-like substances in trypanosomes and/or Gram-negative secondary bacterial infection. Studies in trypanosome-infected rats indicate damage to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) accompanied by increased leakage of the GIT mucosa. The current Study was carried out to determine the in vivo response to endotoxin-like Substances of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. To this purpose we neutralized the entrance of endotoxin through the GIT using polymyxin-B treatment and monitored the plasma concentration of the acute phase proteins SAP and Hp. The results in this study, where infection was performed {{in the presence of}} oral antibiotic that is not absorbed from GIT and which binds to and inactivates endotoxin, show that the elevated <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> of endotoxin-like <b>activity</b> and the resulting acute phase response indicated by an increase in levels of Hp and SAP, are due to trypanosome infection.

Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were similar in the three groups.

No differences in plasma LCAT, CETP and PLTP <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> were observed between the three groups. Analysis of covariance also demonstrated that the use of alcohol was associated with higher HDL cholesterol (P < 0. 04), whereas plasma LCAT, CETP and PLTP <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> were not related to alcohol consumption.

Results Smoking per se did not significantly impact the AIP but the interaction PON 1 genotype by smoking significantly increased the AIP. In subjects with the RR genotype smoking increased the AIP index from (estimated mean ± SEM) - 0. 038 ± 0. 039 to 0. 224 ± 0. 094. The QR genotype increased the Framingham risk index by around 1. 3 points. Smoking by RR genotype carriers significantly increased the Framingham risk score (17. 23 ± 2. 04) as compared to smoking (13. 00 ± 1. 06) and non-smoking (7. 79 ± 0. 70) by QQ+QR genotype carriers.

40|$|The {{response}} of renin release {{to the administration}} of renin inhibitors cannot be studied with conventional enzymatic methods used to measure plasma renin. In the present experiments, a novel multirange enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human and primate renin was used to investigate the changes in plasma immunoreactive renin after renin inhibition. A potent and long-acting statine-containing renin inhibitor, CGP 29 287, was injected in conscious marmosets after mild or severe sodium depletion. In mildly sodium-depleted marmosets, CGP 29 287 (0. 1 mg/kg i. v.) reduced mean arterial blood pressure and completely inhibited <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity</b> for up to 30 minutes. This response {{was associated with a}} transient increase in plasma immunoreactive renin concentration. After a dose of 1. 0 mg/kg i. v., the reduction of mean arterial pressure and the complete inhibition of <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity</b> persisted for up to 120 minutes. These effects were accompanied by a sustained increase in plasma immunoreactive renin concentration. In severely sodium-depleted marmosets, CGP 29 287 (1. 0 mg/kg i. v.) induced a marked fall in systolic blood pressure and complete inhibition of <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity</b> within 30 minutes of injection. Plasma immunoreactive renin levels increased to 257 % of pretreatment values. The converting-enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (2 mg/kg i. v.) induced a fall in systolic blood pressure of similar magnitude, which was accompanied by an increase in <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity.</b> <b>Levels</b> of <b>plasma</b> immunoreactive renin increased to 210 % of pretreatment values. Hydralazine (0. 2 mg/kg i. v.) did not increase <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity</b> or <b>plasma</b> immunoreactive renin levels despite a comparable hypotensive effect.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the oxidative stress through enzymatic and nonenzymatic biomarkers in diabetic patients {{with and without}} hypertension and prediabetics. The SOD and CAT (in erythrocytes) and GPx (in <b>plasma)</b> enzymatic <b>activities,</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> of lipid peroxidation, and total thiols were measured {{in the blood of}} 55 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 38 subjects without diabetes (9 pre-diabetics and 29 controls) aged 40 – 86 years. The total SOD activity and the lipid peroxidation were higher in diabetics compared to nondiabetics. In stratified groups, the total SOD activity was different for the hypertensive diabetics compared to the prediabetics and normotensive controls. Lipid peroxidation was significantly higher in both groups of diabetics (hypertensive and normotensive) compared to prediabetic groups and hypertensive and normotensive controls. There {{was no significant difference in}} the CAT and GPx activities, as well as in the concentration of total thiols in the groups studied. Present data strongly suggest the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of diabetes, revealing that the increased lipid peroxidation has a close relationship with high glucose levels, as observed by the fasting glucose and HbA 1 c levels. The results evidence the correlation between lipid peroxidation and DM, irrespective of the presence of hypertension...|$|R
40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of rehabilitation and quality of life, persistent (chronic) hypotension {{has been focused on}} as a serious complication of maintenance hemodialysis in patients with chronic renal failure. In this study, 32 hemodialysed patients were categorized into three groups according to their blood pressure as follows, hypertensive (n= 5), normotensive (n= 14) and hypotensive patients (n= 13). To elucidate some etiologic factors responsible for the pathogenesis of chronic hypotension, a variety of the factors regulating blood pressure, such as <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity,</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> of angiotensin Ⅱ, aldosterone, noradrenaline, α-human atrial natriuretic peptide (h-ANP) and sodium content in erythrocyte, were investigated. In addition, Valsalva index was measured as a parameter indicative of baroreflex sensitivity in the autonomic nervous system. The conclusions confirmed in this study were as follows : 1) The renin-aldosterone system might not particle in the pathogenesis of chronic hypotension. 2) No evidence could be found to support the hypothesis that h-ANP {{would be one of the}} etiologic factors in the development of chronic hypotension. 3) An impaired baroreflex sensitivity was closely linked with the pathogenesis of this clinical entity. 4) As an another important factor, a down regulation between noradrenaline and peripheral vessel was strongly suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{performed in}} this thesis have consistently demonstrated {{that there is a}} metabolic link between the regulation of plasma FFA and triglycerides {{on the one hand and}} plasma PLTP but not CETP on the other hand. Thus, (obese) NIDDM patients and insulin resistant individuals without diabetes have high <b>plasma</b> PLTP <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> in conjunction with high plasma triglyclerides. Further studies have necessary to elucidate which tissues contribute to PLTP in human plasma and how PLTP secretion and catabolism is regulated at the molecular level. Liver and adipose tissue are possible sources of plasma PLTP. The effect of insulin to decrease hepatic VLDL secretion has been recently demonstrated to be impaired in NIDDM. In this thesis (part IV) it has been shown that the inhibitory effect of insulin on adipose tissue lipolysis is not impaired in NIDDM. It may, therefore, be speculated that the blunted plasma PLTP lowering by insulin in NIDDM is related to a diminshed effect of insulin in the liver [...] . Zie: Summary and conclusions...|$|R
40|$|It was {{recently}} {{reported that the}} circadian clock machinery controls plasma levels of factor (F) VII, the serine protease triggering blood coagulation. Here, by exploiting the mouse model, {{this study showed that}} variations of photoperiod (i. e., winter or summer conditions or simulated chronic jetlag conditions) have a strong impact on <b>plasma</b> FVII <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> Under conditions mimicking summer or winter photoperiods, FVII activity showed a clear 24 h rhythmicity. Interestingly, mean daily FVII <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly reduced in mice exposed to summer photoperiods. Behavioral activity rhythms under both photoperiods were synchronized to LD cycles, and the amount of activity per 24 h was comparable. The authors also investigated the influence of chronic jetlag (CJL) on the FVII activity rhythms, which can be easily mimicked in mice through continuous abrupt shifts in the lighting schedule. The exposure of mice to simulated CJL of either consecutive westward or consecutive westward and eastward flights for 15 days did not abolish the behavioral activity rhythms but was associated with a period significantly different from 24 h. Intriguingly, both types of CJL exerted a strong influence on FVII activity rhythms, which were virtually suppressed. Moreover, the mean daily FVII activity was significantly lower in the CJL than in the winter photoperiod condition. Taken together, these findings in mice provide novel insights into the modulation of FVII <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> which might have implications for human pathophysiology...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} whether {{the determination of}} maternal plasma Factor II:C (FII:C) and mean uterine artery resistance index {{may be useful to}} early predict pre-eclampsia in patients with gestational hypertension. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Consecutive enrollment in a public tertiary clinical care centre. PATIENTS: A total of 65 women with gestational hypertension at 24 - 26 weeks. INTERVENTION: Measurements of maternal <b>plasma</b> FII:C <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> ultrasonographic biometrical parameters and Doppler velocimetry of maternal uterine arteries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : The probability of developing pre-eclampsia was the main outcome of the study and it was computed by combining the FII:C and the mean uterine artery resistance index cut-off points, chosen by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: F-II:C <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> and mean uterine artery resistance index were significantly (both P < 0. 01) higher in women who developed pre-eclampsia. A weak, but significant correlation (r = 0. 3, P < 0. 05) was found between these two parameters. FII:C <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> at the cut-off value of 136. 5 % achieved a sensitivity of 61. 1 % and a specificity of 71. 3 %, while mean uterine artery resistance index (RI) at the cut-off value of 0. 57 showed a sensitivity of 85. 7 % and a specificity of 90. 2 % in predicting the onset of pre-eclampsia. When both FII:C and mean uterine RI were over the cut-off points the positive predictive value was of 89 %, with a 100 % negative predictive value when both were below the cut-off points. CONCLUSION: F-II:C <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> and mean uterine artery resistance index determination at mid trimester may improve the prediction of superimposed pre-eclampsia on women with early onset gestational hypertensio...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} the development of hypercholesterolemia in rabbits and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity secretion by their perfused livers. Two inbred strains of rabbits were compared which differ markedly in their hypercholesterolemic response to dietary cholesterol. Feed-ing a high-cholesterol (0. 3 %) diet, increased plasma nd liver cholesterol levels in the two strains, the increments being 15 mM and 30 / 2 mol/g reater in the hyperresponders, espectively. The high-cholesterol diet caused an about 2 -fold increased hepatic secretion of CETP activity, but {{there was no difference between}} the two rabbit strains. Feeding a lower amount of dietary cholesterol (0. 08 %) also caused higher cholesteroleinic (2 raM) and hepatocholesterolic (28 /. /tnol/g) responses in hyper- than in hyporesponsive rabbits. The activity of hepatic CETP secretion was not increased by the low-cholesterol diet, and there was no difference between hypo- and hyperresponsive rabbits. Cholesterol feeding increased <b>plasma</b> CETP <b>activity</b> by 90 % in both rabbit strains, but there was no difference between the strains. Our combined ata suggest that with increasing plasma cholesterol levels, hepatic CETP secretion may be increased in a parabolic manner, reaching its maximum rate far before plasma cholesterol concentrations are maximal. There were no differences in hepatic CETP <b>activity</b> secretion or <b>plasma</b> CETP <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> between the genetically different strains of hypo- and hyperresponsive rabbits...|$|R
40|$|Induction of {{congestive}} heart failure by high-frequency pacing has been reported to increase plasma levels of immunoreactive kinins in dogs. In the present study, we evaluated plasma bradykinin levels in human heart failure. Utilizing a recently developed method, we specifically measured plasma levels of bradykinin-(1 - 9) nonapeptide in 21 patients with chronic {{congestive heart}} failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) stages III and IV). At the same time, we measured plasma atrial natriuretic peptide <b>levels</b> and <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity,</b> and, as a marker of inflammation, plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor. In addition, 18 healthy subjects matched for gender and age served as normal controls. Plasma bradykinin concentrations were not higher in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (median 2. 1 fmol/ml) than in healthy subjects (2. 6 fmol/ml). In contrast, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels were clearly higher (patients, 63 fmol/ml; controls, 24 fmol/ml; P&lt; 0. 0001), despite diuretic treatment and in the presence of high <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity</b> (patients, 13. 0 ng x h(- 1) x ml(- 1); controls, 0. 3 ng x h(- 1) x ml(- 1); P&lt; 0. 0001). Tumour necrosis factor was elevated in heart failure patients in NYHA class IV only (27 pg/ml, compared with 21 pg/ml in controls; P= 0. 013). Bradykinin, atrial natriuretic peptide and <b>plasma</b> renin <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> were not correlated with the severity of the disease, as assessed by NYHA classification. These results indicate that a rather selective cytokine activation, without concomitant stimulation of the kallikrein-kinin system, occurs in human chronic congestive heart failure...|$|R
40|$|AIM: In {{patients}} with atherosclerosis {{there is an}} activation of the tissue factor mediated coagulation cascade. The aim of our study was to ascertain {{if there is a}} relationship between increased tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) antigen and <b>activity</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> and atherosclerosis. METHODS: Design: case-control study. Setting: Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Diseases, University of Palermo and Laboratory of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. Patients: 63 consecutive {{patients with}} asymptomatic atherosclerosis or with its acute or chronic complications, and 20 healthy volunteers. Measurements: TFPI antigen was detected by an immunoenzimatic assay (Imunobind total TFPI ELISA kit, American Diagnostica Inc., USA). TFPI activity was evaluated by an activity assay (Actichrome TFPI activity assay, American Diagnostica Inc., USA). RESULTS: Patients with chronic (P= 0. 0001 for TFPI Ag, P= 0. 006 for TFPI Ac) and acute (P= 0. 04 for TFPI Ag, P= 0. 01 for TFPI Ac) vascular disease and with asymptomatic carotid plaque (P= 0. 0019 for TFPI Ag, P< 0. 05 for TFPI Ac) had significantly increased TFPI antigen and <b>activity</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> vs healthy volunteers. Moreover, patients with chronic vascular disease had higher TFPI Ag levels vs patients with asymptomatic atherosclerosis (P= 0. 0013). CONCLUSIONS: The originality of our study was the finding of increased TFPI levels, not only in patients with acute complication of atherosclerosis, but also in those with chronic vascular disease and with asymptomatic carotid plaque...|$|R
