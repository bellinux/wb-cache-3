50|$|Pine-pine gall rust, {{also known}} as western gall rust, is a fungal disease of pine trees. This plant disease is caused by Endocronartium harknessii (asexual name is <b>Peridermium</b> harknessii), an autoecious, endocyclic, rust fungus that grows in the {{vascular}} cambium of the host. Pine-pine gall rust is found on pine trees (Pinus spp.) {{with two or three}} needles such as ponderosa pine, jack pine, and scots pine. The disease is very similar to pine-oak gall rust, but its second host is another Pinus species. The fungal infection results in gall formation on branches or trunks of infected hosts. Gall formation is typically not detrimental to old trees but has been known to kill younger less stable saplings. Galls can vary from small growths on branch extremities to grapefruit sized galls on trunks.|$|E

The first volume covered the genus Puccinia and the second the genus Uromyces. The third volume described the systematics and taxonomy used to classify the family and provided a key as well as further descriptions of other genera including Gymnosporangium and Phragmidium. The final volume published covered the related genera; <b>Peridermium,</b> Aecidium, Monosporidium, Roestelia, Caeoma, Uredo and Mapea.|$|E
40|$|External needle {{extracts}} from an infected {{and a healthy}} Pinus sylvestris L. did not adversely affect the germination of aeciospores of <b>Peridermium</b> pini (Pere.) Lev. Internal extracts and juices expressed from needles and shoots showed a fungistatic effect on spores. The effect was more pronounced when extracts and juices were derived from needles of a healthy tree than from an infected one. In the former case, the germ tubes were invariably deformed. The significance of these differences in relation to resistance is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Western gall rust (<b>Peridermium</b> harknessii J. P. Moore (syn. Endocronartium harknessii (J. P. Moore) Y. Hiratsuka) is {{potentially}} {{a serious threat}} to exotic Pinus radiata D. Don plantations of New Zealand although the pathogen has not been recorded here. Mechanisms that may have prevented invasion of the pathogen include geographic isolation, biological characteristics of the fungus, stand management, and regulatory mechanisms affecting transport and establishment. Major factors may include a low probability of importation of infected seedlings, unlikely spore transport in the atmosphere across the tropics, and asynchrony of rust sporulation and pine susceptibility in North America and New Zealand. The outbreak or “wave year ” phenomenon in the native range of western gall rust demonstrates that both biological and microclimatic conditions must be suitable for establishment to occur. We conclude that the probability of invasion of New Zealand by western gall rust is very low; however, if the pathogen were to become established in New Zealand, the long-term effects may be large...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{assessing}} {{the resistance of}} 84 Scotch pine climatypes, growing in a provenance trial in a taiga zone in Middle Siberia, to pathogens are presented in this paper: pathogens of needle cast (Lophodermium pinastri Chev.), snow blight (Phacidium infestans Karst.), Cenangium diebak (Cenangium ferruginosum Fr. : Fr.) and rust (Cronartium flaccidum (Alb. et Schw.) Wint. and <b>Peridermium</b> pini (Pers.) Lew. et Kleb). The dynamics of the diseases caused by these pathogens are shown for a 30 -year period. The authors found that Scotch pine resistance to the pathogens in the provenance trial depended both on ecological regime of the growing site and on the genetic peculiarities of the climatypes determined by their site of origin. Differences in {{the resistance of the}} same Scotch pine climatypes to the pathogens showed itself when growing them on different ecological backgrounds (on sandy soil - the bear berry pine forest type, and on dark-gray forest soil - the tall-herb pine forest type). Climatypes of “northern Lapponian” and “Siberian” pine subspecies are more tolerant to the pathogens. Articl...|$|E
40|$|<b>Peridermium</b> pini {{growing in}} the green, {{parenchymatous}} cortex of a young tree of pine (Pinus sylvestris) has been studied by electron microscopy. The extensively branched septate hyphae are spread in the intercellular spaces {{and in the middle}} part of walls separating contiguous host cells. The hyphal cells are uninucleate. The septa are simple and perforate. The septal pore is occluded by a Woronin body. This organization of the septum {{is similar to that of}} some Ascomycetes, as is the occurrence of a centriolar plaque on the nucleaer envelope. P. pini has in addition a structural configuration characteristic for rust fungi, namely an approximately hemispherical pore apparatus bordered by a layer of microbodies. The sac-like haustorium is separated from its extracellular mother cell by a cross-wall, situated in the short neck region. At the place of penetration, the host wall forms a papilla-shaped collar. Almost one third of the haustoria observed becomes encased by an extensively proliferating collar. A few per cent of the haustoria become necrotic after having entered host cells. The attacked parenchyma cells, which may each contain several haustoria, have generally an affected plasmalemma and more or less degenerated chloroplasts...|$|E
40|$|Somatic {{mutations}} {{are transmitted}} during mitosis in developing somatic tissue. Somatic cells bearing the mutations can develop into reproductive (germ) cells and the somatic mutations are then {{passed on to}} the next generation of plants. Somatic mutations are a source of variation essential to evolve new defense strategies and adapt to the environment. Stem rust disease in Scots pine has a negative effect on wood quality, and thus adversely affects the economy. It is caused by the 2 most destructive fungal species in Scandinavia: <b>Peridermium</b> pini and Cronartium flaccidum. We studied nuclear genome stability in Scots pine under biotic stress (fungus-infected, 22 trees) compared to a control population (plantation, 20 trees). Stability was assessed as accumulation of new somatic mutations in 10 microsatellite loci selected for genotyping. Microsatellites are widely used as molecular markers in population genetics studies of plants, and are particularly used for detection of somatic mutations as their rate of mutation is of a much higher magnitude when compared with other DNA markers. We report double the rate of somatic mutation per locus in the fungus-infected trees (4. 8 × 10 – 3 mutations per locus), as compared to the controls (2. 0 × 10 – 3 mutations per locus) when individual samples were analyzed at 10 different microsatellite markers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Peridermium</b> pini {{causes a}} stem rust of two-needled pine trees, with the {{greatest}} problems in the United Kingdom associated with Scots pine forests in north-east Scotland.   It was hypothesised that silvicultural practices are viable options for controlling the incidence of P. pini and {{that a combination of}} climatic and biophysical factors may be significant in regulating the incidence of the disease.   P. pini incidence was determined in four Scots pine plantations established in Moray, and in five native pinewoods.   P. pini incidence in the Scots pine forests of north-east Scotland has increased since the previous surveys undertaken in the 1960 s.   Mean disease incidence for all plantations was 4. 9 %, with a range from 4. 0 % at Cawdor Estate to 5. 7 % at Darnaway Estate. Age-class, the number of years since thinning, elevation and continentality were statistically significant factors influencing disease incidence.   These factors were used as the basis for a rule-based model to describe the distribution of P. pini within the forests surveyed. A second modelling approach, using Bayesian methods to analyse a large number of datasets, supported the hypothesis that management factors had the major influence on incidence of the disease and that climatic factors added, incrementally, to explaining the spatial distribution of the disease.   Maps produced from the outputs designated the probabilities of P. pini incidence into risk classes. Estimation of timber volume losses in infected stands confirmed that the disease would have significant economic impact in most sites if no savage thinnings were undertaken.   This process would have the most significant effect at Altyre Estate. The combination of these modelling approaches with Geographic Information Systems is potentially useful as a decision-support tool for forest managers, enabling greater confidence in judging the potential local significance of the factors affecting disease incidence.

40|$|Selected {{isolates}} of Cladosporium tenuissimum {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to inhibit in vitro aeciospore germination of the two-needle pine stem rusts Cronartium flaccidum and <b>Peridermium</b> pini and to suppress disease development in planta. The antagonistic fungus displayed a number of disease-suppressive mechanisms. Aeciospore germination on water agar slides was reduced at 12, 18, and 24 h when a conidial suspension (1. 5 x 10 (7) conidia per ml) of the Cladosporium tenuissimum isolates was added. When the aeciospores were incubated in same-strength conidial suspensions for 1, 11, 21, and 31 days, viability was reduced at 20 and 4 degreesC. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed that rust spores were directly parasitized by Cladosporium tenuissimum and that the antagonist had evolved several strategies to breach the spore wail and gain access to the underlying tissues. Penetration occurred with or without appressoria. The hyperparasite exerted a mechanical force to destroy the spore structures (spinules, cell wall) by direct contact, penetrated the aeciospores and subsequently proliferated within them. However, an enzymatic action could also be involved. This was shown by the dissolution of the host tell wall that comes in contact with the mycelium of the mycoparasite, by the lack of indentation in the host wall at the contact site, and by the minimal swelling at the infecting hyphal tip. Culture filtrates of the hyperparasite inhibited germination of rust propagules. A compound purified from the filtrates was characterized by chemical and spectroscopic analysis as cladosporol, a known beta - 1, 3 -glucan biosynthesis inhibitor. Conidia of Cladosporium tenuissimum reduced rust development on new infected pine seedlings over 2 years under greenhouse conditions. Because the fungus is an aggressive mycoparasite, produces fungicidal metabolites, and can survive and multiply in forest ecosystems without rusts, it seems a promising agent for the biological control of pine stem rusts in Europe...|$|E
