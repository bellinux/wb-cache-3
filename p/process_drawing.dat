2500|$|Wire {{drawing is}} a {{metalworking}} process {{used to reduce}} the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). [...] There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. [...] Although similar in <b>process,</b> <b>drawing</b> is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, {{but it may be}} performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{grammatical}} interpretation {{leads to}} the technical interpretation as the reader attempts {{to understand why the}} author selected the language s/he did to convey his/her inner thoughts. [...] Part of the task of hermeneutics is to fully understand these thoughts through the author’s discourse, even better than the author him/herself. This can be done by discovering unity within the author, first in knowing why a particular work was produced, secondly in other works produced in a similar genre by others, and finally by other works by the same author in any genre. The interpreter can then evaluate what the effect of the work was on the author’s context. [...] If a reader can understand the psyche of the author, s/he can understand the work, but only in balance with the grammatical side of interpretation, which attempts to understand the work to understand the inner thoughts of the author. [...] "Understanding" [...] for Schleiermacher is the art of experiencing the same process of thought that the author experienced. Understanding is made possible by the fact that author and reader, since both are human, share the reasoning ability. Therefore, the process of understanding is not only a historical process, learning about {{the context in which the}} author wrote, but also a psychological <b>process,</b> <b>drawing</b> upon the connection between interpreter and the author. Thus, hermeneutics is a cyclical task, but for Schleiermacher it is not viciously circular because of the role of intuition. As humans, therefore, interpreters approach a text with some shared understanding with the author that creates the possibility of understanding.|$|E

5000|$|The “argumentative turn" [...] {{refers to}} a group of {{different}} approaches in policy-analysis and planning that emphasize the increased relevance of argumentation, language and deliberation in policy-making. Inspired by the “linguistic turn” in the field of humanities, it was developed {{as an alternative to the}} epistemological limitations of “neo-positivist” policy analysis and its underlying technocratic understanding of the decision-making process. The argumentative approach systematically integrates empirical and normative questions into a methodological framework oriented towards the analysis of policy deliberation. It is sensitive to the situative context and the multiple kinds of knowledge practices involved in each stage of the policy <b>process,</b> <b>drawing</b> attention to different forms of argumentation, persuasion and justification.|$|E

50|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 1999, Jorion offered a new theory of consciousness which goes beyond the Freudian notion that some of our decisions have unconscious motives by suggesting that in fact all our decision-making has unconscious roots, revealing freewill to be an illusion. Consciousness is shown to be a consequence of a mechanism allowing us to perceive as simultaneous the sensations produced separately by our five senses, a necessary preliminary to creating memory traces, that is, also, the prerequisite to any learning <b>process.</b> <b>Drawing</b> the consequences of an observation made by Benjamin Libet, that intention is an artifact as it springs to consciousness half a second later than the action it is supposed to have generated, Jorion further suggested that consciousness errs when it assumes to be the cause of human actions while it is nothing more than an ancillary consequence of the registration process that allows memory to accrue.|$|E
5000|$|Waterman eschews all metaphysics and supernaturalism in the {{interpretation}} of the effects of psychoactive plants and substances. His theories are loosely {{based on the work of}} Czech psychiatrist Stanislav Grof who as one of the leading specialists on the clinical administration of LSD formulated theories linking the contents of psychedelic catalyzed states of consciousness to the birth <b>process.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on literature as diverse as Joseph Campbell's [...] "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" [...] and Otto Rank's [...] "Das Trauma der Geburt", as well as the works of child psychologist Alice Miller, particularly her ideas about [...] "poisonous pedagogy", and Stanley Milgram's research into the nature of authority and obedience, Waterman posits that all human experience, including religious and mystical states, can be traced back to the earliest stages of biological, cognitive and social development. He then goes on to posit a relationship between early cognitive and psychological development and culture in the production of ethical intuition and behaviour.|$|E
50|$|Andrea Press' {{intellectual}} concerns {{center on}} the nature of culture and the way people appropriate and recreate its meanings. In particular, she has sought to investigate how culture contributes to the reproduction of social class and gender in the contemporary U.S. Her focus on television, and now both on the new media environment and on the history of Hollywood film, derives from this interest. Media reception provides an idea site for examining the production and reproduction of a popular culture marked by gender and class distinctions. Given these interests, Press' work is inherently interdisciplinary, as scholars in many disciplines have developed definitions of culture and derived methods for studying cultural production and reproduction. Press develops and refines a qualitative, interpretive methodology for studying the active reception of popular cultural forms and for examining the role of gender and class in this <b>process,</b> <b>drawing</b> insights from several disciplines such as anthropology, philosophy, literature, and political theory. Press has explored these questions in four books projects thus far, each building on and extending the results of the last, to construct a theory of how women in particular interpret and appropriate cultural forms, and use them in understanding and creating gendered political, moral, social and cultural identities.|$|E
