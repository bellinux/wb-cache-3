25|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>prostate-specific</b> <b>antigen</b> (PSA) is beset with controversy; as PSA {{is present in}} prostatic tissue and semen, it was independently discovered and given different names, thus adding to the controversy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{now clear}} that the term <b>prostate-{{specific}}</b> <b>antigen</b> is a misnomer: it is an antigen but is not specific to the prostate. Although present in large amounts in prostatic tissue and semen, it has been detected in other body fluids and tissues.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Preliminary gel {{diffusion}} precipitation {{studies of}} rabbit antisera to saline extracts of pooled normal human prostatic tissue {{have demonstrated the}} presence of three <b>prostate-specific</b> <b>antigens.</b> Two of the antigens were found in prostatic tissue extract, and the third occurred in both prostatic tissue extract and prostatic fluid. Several studies initiated in this laboratory {{have dealt with the}} immunological and immunochemical characterization of normal and pathological huma...|$|R
50|$|Endocyte’s other {{preclinical}} drug candidates also {{target the}} folate receptor {{as well as}} <b>prostate-specific</b> membrane <b>antigen</b> (PSMA) receptors. The company was formed based on technology developed by Philip Low (the company's CSO), and Christopher Leamon, PhD, the company’s VP of research. This technology is a folic acid-based drug delivery system, referred to now as folate targeting. The company is also developing SMDCs with varying drug payloads as well as different ligands for other molecular targets, such as <b>prostate-specific</b> membrane <b>antigen</b> (PSMA) and has also developed, with Bristol-Myers Squibb, an epothilone-folic acid conjugate (BMS-753493), described at a 2008 conference.|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{significance of}} molecular markers was evaluated by immunohistochemical research of surgical and biopsy material of 106 patients with diseases of bladder and 57 patients with diseases of prostate. They received treatment at Scientific Research Institute of Fundamental and Clinical Uronephrology with monoclonal antibodies: Ki- 67, PCNA, p 63 (markers of proliferative activity), p 53 (suppressor of tumor growth), Bcl- 2, Bax (markers of apoptosis), EGFR (receptor of epidermal growth factors), PSA, PSMA, AMACR (<b>prostate-specific</b> <b>antigens)</b> and cytokeratin profile.

25|$|Prostatic {{secretions}} vary among species. They {{are generally}} composed of simple sugars {{and are often}} slightly alkaline. In human prostatic secretions, the protein content is less than 1% and includes proteolytic enzymes, prostatic acid phosphatase, beta-microseminoprotein, and <b>prostate-specific</b> <b>antigen.</b> The secretions also contain zinc with a concentration 500–1,000 times the concentration in blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of finding pre-invasive malignancy or nonmalignant benign disease is commonplace in {{all forms of}} cancer screening, including pap smears for cervical cancer, fecal occult blood testing for colon cancer, and <b>prostate-specific</b> <b>antigen</b> testing for prostate cancer. All of these tests {{have the potential to}} detect asymptomatic cancers, and all of them have a high rate of false positives and lead to invasive procedures that are unlikely to benefit the patient.|$|E
25|$|Prostate cancer {{screening}} {{is an attempt}} to find unsuspected cancers. Initial screens may lead to more invasive follow-up tests such as a biopsy. Options include the digital rectal exam (DRE) and the <b>prostate-specific</b> <b>antigen</b> (PSA) blood test. Such screening is controversial and, in some people, may lead to unnecessary disruption and possibly harmful consequences. Routine screening with either a DRE or PSA is not supported by the evidence as there is no mortality benefit from screening.|$|E

50|$|BIND-014 is an Accurin {{nanomedicine}} {{produced by}} Bind Therapeutics Inc. BIND-014 targets <b>prostate-specific</b> membrane <b>antigen</b> (PSMA), which is expressed on prostate cancer cells {{and the blood}} vessels of many types of solid tumors, and contains docetaxel as the cytotoxic agent.|$|R
25|$|<b>Prostate-specific</b> <b>antigen</b> (PSA), {{also known}} as gamma-seminoprotein or kallikrein-3 (KLK3), is a {{glycoprotein}} enzyme encoded in humans by the KLK3 gene. PSA {{is a member of}} the kallikrein-related peptidase family and is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland. PSA is produced for the ejaculate, where it liquefies semen in the seminal coagulum and allows sperm to swim freely. It is also believed to be instrumental in dissolving cervical mucus, allowing the entry of sperm into the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Prostate cancer {{screening}} is controversial. <b>Prostate-specific</b> <b>antigen</b> (PSA) testing increases cancer detection {{but does not}} decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due {{to the risk of}} overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5α-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not appear to affect the risk.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{widespread}} use of <b>prostate-specific</b> <b>antigen</b> (PSA) screening in the US has resulted in diagnosis at earlier age and cancer stage, the vast majority of cases are still diagnosed in men older than 65 years, and approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in men older than 75 years. Though US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend using life expectancy greater than or less than 10 years to help make treatment decisions, in practice, many elderly patients are not offered curative treatment options such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and are instead treated with hormonal therapy or watchful waiting. This pattern can be attributed to factors such as medical co-morbidity and patient preferences is regard to quality of life in addition to prostate cancer specific risk factors such as pretreatment PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage. As the average life expectancy increases due to advances in the treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other chronic diseases, it is likely that more elderly patients will be living long enough to suffer the consequences of their prostate cancer. Therefore, there is currently much interest in the role of aggressive prostate cancer treatment modalities such as with surgery or radiation in the elderly population who have localized disease.|$|E
30|$|The {{development}} of highly selective radiolabeled ligands binding to <b>prostate-specific</b> membrane <b>antigen</b> (PSMA) opened up an additional therapeutic option (PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT)) [3] {{that has been}} exploited in more than 1000, mainly CRPC, patients worldwide, often in combination with basic ARB.|$|R
30|$|Radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177 Lu-DKFZ- 617 PSMA (Lu-PSMA) (<b>prostate-specific</b> {{membrane}} <b>antigen)</b> {{is a novel}} {{targeted therapy}} of metastatic prostate cancer. We analysed retrospectively the early side effects and the response rate in the first patients, who received a therapy with Lu-PSMA in our departments.|$|R
50|$|Glutamate {{carboxypeptidase}} II (GCPII), {{also known}} as N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate peptidase I (NAALADase I), NAAG peptidase, or <b>prostate-specific</b> membrane <b>antigen</b> (PSMA) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the FOLH1 (folate hydrolase 1) gene. Human GCPII contains 750 amino acids and weighs approximately 84 kDa.|$|R
500|$|Regnier de Graaf, in 1672, {{observed}} that the secretions (female ejaculation) by the erogenous zone in the vagina lubricate [...] "in agreeable fashion during coitus". Modern scientific hypotheses linking G-spot sensitivity with female ejaculation led {{to the idea that}} non-urine female ejaculate may originate from the Skene's gland, with the Skene's gland and male prostate acting similarly in terms of <b>prostate-specific</b> <b>antigen</b> and prostate-specific acid phosphatase studies, which led to a trend of calling the Skene's glands the female prostate. Additionally, the enzyme PDE5 (involved with erectile dysfunction) has additionally been associated with the G-spot area. Because of these factors, {{it has been argued that}} the G-spot is a system of glands and ducts located within the anterior (front) wall of the vagina. A similar approach has linked the G-spot with the urethral sponge.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Prostate-specific</b> <b>antigen</b> (PSA, {{also known}} as kallikrein III, seminin, semenogelase, γ-seminoprotein and P-30 antigen) is a 34-kD {{glycoprotein}} produced almost exclusively by the prostate gland. It is a serine protease (...) enzyme, the gene of which {{is located on the}} 19th chromosome (19q13) in humans.|$|E

40|$|Prostate cancer {{prevention}} and therapies were reviewed {{in a recent}} update. Finasteride, a 5 α reductase inhibitor, shows promise as a preventative; however, it may increase the incidence of high-grade cancer. There are ongoing studies regarding {{the positive effects of}} antioxidant therapy (vitamin E, selenium, and lycopene) on the prevention of prostate cancer; initial results are promising. Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with a statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer incidence, a 46 % reduction in risk of high-grade or high-stage prostate cancer, and a 66 % reduction in mortality from prostate cancer. Overexpression of transcription factors is caused by translocation of the promoter of the TMPRSS 2 gene, which may be a primary event in prostate cancer. Immunomic profiling with use of autoantibodies directed against <b>prostate-specific</b> <b>antigens</b> may be used to identify cases of prostate cancer...|$|R
