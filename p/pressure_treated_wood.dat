50|$|The PTI {{preservative}} imparts {{very little}} {{color to the}} wood.

The PTI wood products are very well adapted for paint and stain applications with no bleed-through. The addition of the wax stabilizer allows a lower preservative retention plus substantially reduces the tendency of wood to warp and split as it dries.

40|$|Although organic, {{lipophilic}} acids, such as acetic, propionic, sorbic and benzoic, have a {{long history}} as preservatives in the food industry, relatively high concentrations are required and their bioactivities generally pertain to retarding microbial growth rather than eliminating pathogens.

However, specific organic acids (i. e., glycolic and L lactic), even at low concentrations, are now known to be potent synergists with certain fatty acids as broad-spectrum, environmentally compatible fungicides.

A fundamental model was developed which includes rates of intraparticle diffusion, external film mass transfer, desorption and the initial distribution of PCP between the pore volume (cell lumen) and pore surface (cell wall) of wood wafers. The intraparticle diffusion and external mass transfer rates are combined in terms of an overall mass transfer coefficient derived from the assumption of a parabolic concentration profile of PCP inside the wafer pores. The initial distribution of PCP between cell lumen and cell wall was determined by fitting the mathematical model to dynamic extraction rate data. The desorption rate was very small for all the extraction conditions, and extraction rate increased with the pressure, temperature, and flow rate because the combined mass transfer increased.

40|$|Despite {{the poor}} economy in Japan, there remain {{promising}} niche markets for Alaskan softwood lumber. The unique characteristics of Alaskan softwood species are {{well suited to}} the demands of the Japanese market in general and Japanese post and beam home builders in particular. In addition, Alaskan species, particularly Sitka spruce and Alaska yellow cedar, enjoy a good reputation in Japan. For example, as a result of recent regulatory changes in the residential construction sector, it may be advantageous for Alaskan producers to supply kiln-dried lumber and glulam products milled to the specific dimensions required by the post and beam industry. Given that Alaskan producers cannot compete solely on the basis of price, a more effective strategy is to differentiate their products using non-price attributes that are valued in Japan. The primary aims of this research were to identify niche market opportunities for Alaskan timber species in the Japanese post and beam industry, describe those market opportunities and provide recommendations to help Alaskan sawmills evaluate the niche opportunities in Japan and objectively assess how those market opportunities match their own production and sales capabilities. The market opportunities in specific niche markets are described below. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION The Housing Quality Assurance Act of 2000 requires that all builders provide a 10 year warranty on their homes, including the structural components used to frame-in the house. This requirement has had a significant impact on the species of lumber specified for structural components that are used in ground contact applications. In the future, Japanese builders are expected to increase their use of naturally durable timber species in an effort to reduce their liability and increase the performance of their homes. A second factor influencing material specification in residential construction has been the homebuyers’ increasing awareness of, and concern about, “sick house syndrome”. Sick house syndrome has received extensive coverage within the Japanese media and, while it is primarily attributed to off-gassing of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) from carpeting, paint, and vinyl wall coverings and their adhesives, this concern on the part of some homebuyers has caused a growing number of builders to reduce or discontinue their use of engineered wood products and <b>pressure</b> <b>treated</b> <b>wood.</b> The combination of these two factors provides Alaskan sawmills with a unique opportunity to increase their sales of Alaska yellow cedar lumber in both the post and beam as well as the 2 x 4 segments in the home building industry. LAMINA FOR GLUE-LAMINATED BEAMS Currently there are six glu-lam beam manufacturers in Japan that utilize Alaska yellow cedar lumber to produce laminated dodai and posts. Alaska yellow cedar glu-lam ground sills tend to be used in higher end homes, although some builders of mid-price homes use yellow cedar glu-lam ground sills as a way of demonstrating the high quality of their houses and differentiating their homes from their competitors. In addition to ground sills, there are also opportunities to export lamstock produced from Sitka spruce and hemlock for use as posts and structural beams. This is particularly true because Alaskan timber species tend to be slow growth with narrower growth rings and correspondingly higher strength characteristics than the same species growing in other parts of the Pacific Northwest. LUMBER FOR SHOJI COMPONENTS Traditional Japanese homes typically have a tatami room. The tatami room may be where the family gathers or it may serve as a bedroom at night. Tatami rooms use a large volume of appearance grade wood in exposed applications such as beams, shoji screens, and moldings. While there are fewer tatami rooms being built in Japanese homes today, there is still a good demand for high quality yellow and red cedar, as well as Sitka spruce and white spruce, for shoji components. In addition, the price premiums obtained for shoji grade lumber make this a good market for lumber manufacturers. This research has demonstrated that there are a number of potential market opportunities in Japan for softwood lumber from Alaska. These range from rough green lumber to planed and kiln-dried lumber to laminated yellow cedar sill plates (dodai). The most promising opportunities were found to be yellow cedar dodai for the post and beam market, 2 x 4 and 2 x 6 yellow cedar dimension lumber for sill plates in the 2 x 4 market, Alaska yellow cedar, Sitka spruce, and hemlock lamina for the laminated beam industry, and rough, green or planed, kiln-dried yellow cedar, western red cedar, Sitka spruce, and white spruce lumber for the shoji manufacturing industry. Having identified a series of market opportunities for softwood lumber from Alaska is not enough though. A more important factor is to provide sawmill managers in Alaska with a series of marketing recommendations that will allow them to objectively assess and determine if exporting softwood lumber to Japan makes strategic sense for their company and, perhaps more importantly, that will assist them in determining whether their company is prepared to make the commitment of time and resources that are critical to achieving success in the Japanese market. A series of ten strategic marketing recommendations developed during the course of this study are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Treated timber is {{a widely}} used {{construction}} material, as it is resistant to insect and fungal attack. The most commonly used timber treatment solution worldwide is copper chromium arsenate (CCA) <b>pressure</b> <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> (APVMA 2005 a). Environmental and health issues have been raised over CCA wood, with major particular concern raised on the possibilities of arsenic in the wood potentially leaching out. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) have limited its usage to minimise human contact with CCA structures (APVMA 2005 a). In South Australia, CCA applications increased dramatically with {{the expansion of the}} winery industry where CCA treated timber posts were widely used for vineyard trellises. Due to the mechanical method by which most grapes are harvested, roughly 2 % of all posts are broken and require disposal annually (SAEPA 2008). The Environmental Protection Agency of South Australia (EPASA) have placed restrictions on CCA disposal from vineyards (SAEPA 2004) and waste CCA stock is either stockpiled or sent to specially lined landfills incurring an estimated cost penalty of over $AU 200 per tonne¹. Clearly, improved CCA treatment technologies must be developed to reduce (or eliminate) the cost of CCA disposal and to the footprint of land filled waste. CCA timber disposal techniques currently being researched are focussed primarily on thermal and biological routes. Thermal techniques are problematic due to volatilization of the arsenic in the product, whilst biological removal techniques are very slow. Chemical remediation is an alternative and attractive disposal technique of interest using various acids to extract copper, chromium and arsenic. Nitric acid {{has been shown to be}} particularly effective (Honda, Kanjo et al. 1991), although research has been limited. Nitric acid is also used in one method of paper pulp production, and as such, there is the potential for a combined CCA extraction and paper pulp process. This has the attraction of turning a waste in a value added product. The kinetics of copper, chromium and arsenic dissolution in nitric acid has been examined in this thesis. A key finding of the work identifies the size of CCA wood particles as the dominant factor affecting the extraction rate, whilst temperature and acid concentration only provide a minor effect. The extraction rate for all elements from CCA wood using nitric acid generally follow 2 nd order kinetics. Concurrently, a study examining wood chips of various ages taken from vineyards was performed using chip sizes typical required for paper production. It was found that despite significant variations in the concentration profile of CCA in posts, a general model based on the fraction of each element could be created for posts of all ages. Over an 8 hour period, 65 - 80 % of chromium, 50 - 70 % of copper and 75 - 90 % of arsenic was extracted from all posts. Given the excellent extraction observed under relatively simple nitric acid extraction, further studies on the applicability of nitric pulping for CCA remediation are recommended. Minimizing chip size subject to fibre size constraints in paper production is key to improved removal and additional means for enhancing chip surface area are identified. Other stages present in paper pulping process may solublize additional CCA and these warrant further investigation. A basic economic estimation was undertaken, where it was found that creating paper pulp from CCA wood could be economically feasible, but will require further research to determine the expected costs and revenues involved. The nature of the CCA wood waste was investigated. The expectation was that CCA posts would contain relatively consistent concentration profiles for copper, chromium and arsenic. However, it was observed that the concentrations were quite varied. Further, several posts produced during the wine boom in South Australia were very poorly treated with very poor penetration of the preservatives into the posts. This could result in a reduced lifetime for the posts, and potentially higher arsenic leaching than expected. It is also recommended that the frequency of these poorly treated posts be determined, as three of the six posts examined from this period were potentially poorly treated, implying it may be significant and unexpected problem. In addition, a study should be initiated to determine if these poorly treated posts are leaching higher levels of arsenic, by both a study of the surrounding soil and a simulated rainfall leaching experiment. Based on the concern that more arsenic leached from pieces of CCA post left in deionised water than expected, an experiment on posts of various ages revealed that over a 100 day period, 1. 5 - 3 g of elemental arsenic could leach from a submerged CCA treated post. There is a serious concern that with CCA posts being landfilled, they will be exposed to water contact over the wet months, resulting in high arsenic leaching. It is theorised that this high arsenic leaching is due to insufficient chromium in the CCA solution. Previous studies have recommended higher chromium to arsenic ratios than are currently employed in Australia. Further studies on the extent to which this leaching can occur in landfill are recommended. ¹ Personal communication with John Blumson, Zero Waste South Australia, 22 / 7 / 08. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) -based {{composites}} with alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ) - and micronized copper quaternary (MCQ) -treated wood fibers were manufactured through injection molding. The mechanical properties, water absorption, {{and biological}} resistance {{properties of the}} fabricated composites with different coupling treatments were investigated. Composites with ACQ- and MCQ-treated wood had mechanical properties comparable with those made of untreated wood. The different coupling agents worked well for the <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> materials. Similar water absorption behaviors were observed for the HDPE composites containing <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> and those containing untreated wood. The results of the termite test showed that the composites containing untreated wood had slightly more weight loss. The decay test revealed that the composites containing <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> had less decay fungal growth on the surfaces, compared with samples from untreated wood, indicating enhanced decay resistance for the composites from the treated material. The stable mechanical properties and improved biological performances of the composites containing <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> demonstrated the feasibility of making wood-plastic composites with pressure-treated wood materials, and thus offered a practical way to recycle <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> into value-added composites...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of discarded <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> products upon disposal {{is one of}} the many factors that should be considered when evaluating a new wood preservative or when comparing wood preservatives as part of a life cycle assessment. Future environmental ramifications of disposal, as well as regulatory requirements and costs, must be assessed and weighed. This paper presents an overview of the factors that must be evaluated when assessing the disposal issues associated with discarded <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> products. The discussion is based on current US regulations and policy, but the general approach toward evaluating disposal issues will be valid for most countries. A primary consideration is whether a wood preservative has the potential to cause a <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> product to be a hazardous waste. Only a limited number of compounds can cause a solid waste to be a regulatory hazardous waste, and since the costs of hazardous waste management are high, this should be examined critically. Discarded <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> products that are not hazardous may still pose environmental and regulatory concerns. Impact on landfill disposal, combustion systems, and wood recycling operations should be addressed. The concepts described in the paper are illustrated by examining four <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> types: chromated copper arsenate, alkaline copper quaternary, a commercially available borate-treated product and a hypothetical <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> product containing a silver-based biocide...|$|R
