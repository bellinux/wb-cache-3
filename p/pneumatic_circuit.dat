40|$|Abstract- “It takes 8, 460 bolts to {{assemble}} an automobile, and one nut to scatter {{it all over}} the road. ” Some of the biggest advances in the field of automotive technology in the past 10 years have come in the area of safety. Spurred by the improvements in the microprocessor speed, miniaturization, and software development, the automobile continues to evolve. In this new approach proposed, I am going to have an electronic and a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>circuit</b> to automatically control the traction of the vehicle. During ordinary conditions, when the vehicle is driven down a straight road, or if the difference between speeds of the two (rear) wheels is below a specified limit, no signal will be generated by the electronic circuit. This helps the vehicle negotiate the turns with better traction control as differential action is unaltered. But if the difference between speeds is beyond a specified limit, the signal will be generated by the electronic circuit which will actuate the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>circuit.</b> This causes gradual braking on the faster wheel until it gains traction. Hence, the wheels will never lose traction. This system ensures a reduction of more than 50 % in the capital investment as compared to the already existing systems can tilt the scales in the favour of the manufacturing company and eventually the cost conscious consume...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of Intelligent Design and Modelling Environments is to offer {{students}} the opportunity to acquire knowledge while working on a sequence of given or self-selected problems chosen from the application domain.

50|$|Over the years, {{several new}} pieces were {{introduced}} in this line as well. The new pump was spring based, and could only be operated by hand, which limited pneumatic power to how fast it could be manually pumped. This obviously limited the power of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>circuits.</b> So in 1992, LEGO introduced two new pieces; a small pump and a small cylinder. The small pump {{did not have a}} spring on it, and it was designed to be operated by a motor, which would allow for continuously-running pneumatic creations. As of 2011, the small pump has only appeared in one set — 8868 Air Tech Claw Rig (1992) (found on Peeron) — and a few parts sets (no longer available). A new version of the small pump was released in Lego set 8110 Unimog U400 (2011). At 2L, this pump's stroke is 1/3 longer than the old one's 1.5L, 'L' being the LEGO unit of a stud.

40|$|On {{classical}} passenger trains, {{the secondary}} Suspension is commonly ensured by airsprings which are integrated in a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>circuit.</b> In {{addition to the}} pneumatic bellows. the circuit contains various pneumatic components such as tanks, pipes, orifices, levelling valves. etc., {{the purpose of the}} latter being, to maintain a costant height between the carbody and the bogie.

This paper deals with multidisciplinary modelling of a vehicle equipped with such a suspension taking into account both multibody and pneumatic aspects. First, it depicts in more detail the various elements of a pneumatic; suspension. Then, many criteria that influence the suspension morphology are presented: the kind of bogie, the use of an auxiliary tank, the position of this tank relative to the bellows, the kind of levelling system, the use of all additional anti-roll bar, the use of an additional hydraulic damper, etc. The description of the complete <b>pneumatic</b> <b>Circuit</b> implies the use of thermodynamic models which take into account the airflow through the pipes and the valves, the pressure in the bellows, etc, Several pipe models are presented, the choice depending on the length of the pipe: an algebraic model is sufficient for short pipes, while a differential model is needed {{to take into account the}} dynamics of longer pipes. The pneumatic model is then coupled with a SIMPACK multibody model in order to analyse the behaviour of the complete vehicle.
