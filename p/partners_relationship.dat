In the theoretical part I {{focused on the}} concepts of infatuation, love, the importance of attraction, and furthermore on <b>partner</b> <b>relationships,</b> developing relationships, {{and the impact of}} childhood experiences on <b>partner</b> <b>relationships</b> later in life. I presented conflict in <b>partner</b> <b>relationships,</b> types of arguments, troublesome communication and the importance of conversation between partners. In the last part, I focused on the concepts of intimacy, sexuality, sexuality in relation to love, differences in men and women experiencing sexuality, sexuality in connection with sexual satisfaction, and difficulties and communication within sexuality. With qualitative analysis of two semi-structured interviews, one with a man and one with a woman, I tried to get a comprehensive and holistic insight into their experience of a <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> and the related conflicts and sexuality. The results in the empirical part are split into five thematic sets: the process of getting to know someone in relation to infatuation and love, the importance of a <b>partner</b> <b>relationship,</b> the experience of conflict in a relationship, and sexual experience and sexuality in relation to conflicts and problems in a <b>partner</b> <b>relationship.</b> <b>Partners</b> experience some components of a <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> similarly and others differently.

In their examination of roommate pairs, high self-image goals were associated with partners??? perceiving less support in the relationship. The current study examines how these goals function in romantic relationships. At Time 1, 45 heterosexual couples completed measures of compassionate and self-image goals, relationship satisfaction, and relationship need satisfaction. At Time 2 (4 weeks later), participants completed a satisfaction measure. Given the interdependence of the data (Kenny, 1995), a series of multilevel random coefficient modeling analyses revealed that both self and partner compassionate goals were predictive of Time 1 relationship need satisfaction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze {{individual}} and dyadic trajectories of change for positive and negative <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> from early pregnancy up to 30 months postpartum, while considering time, gender, and parity. Two hundred sixty couples (N 520) recruited from an Obstetrics Outpatient Unit (Portugal) completed a self-report measure of <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> at the first, second, and third pregnancy trimester, at childbirth, and again at 3 and 30 months postpartum. Using multilevel modeling, piecewise dyadic growth curve models were performed to predict positive and negative <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> through time, gender, and parity. From the first trimester to 3 months postpartum, positive and negative <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> decreased, and from 3 to 30 months postpartum positive <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> decreased, while negative <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> increased, revealing the deterioration of partner relation- ship over time. The positive and the negative <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> dimensions were positively correlated within-dyad. From the first trimester to 3 months postpartum the deterioration of <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> was worse for women and for second-time parents, whereas from 3 to 30 months postpartum was worse for first-time parents. These findings provided a relevant contribution toward the body of knowledge related with <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> quality over pregnancy and the postpartum period. Additionally, the findings presented a relevant practical contribution. Prevention and intervention programs aimed at reducing the risk of deterioration in <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> over pregnancy and the postpartum would benefit from including men and women, first- and second-time parents, while addressing the difficulties and challenges that the transition to parenthood poses to <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> quality.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer death {{worldwide}} and characterized by a poor prognosis. It has a major impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and their partners. Recently, it has been shown that Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in cancer patients. The generalization of these results is limited since most participants were female patients with breast cancer. Moreover, only one study examined the effectiveness of MBSR in partners of cancer patients. Therefore, in the present trial we study the effectiveness of MBSR versus treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with lung cancer and their partners. METHODS/DESIGN: A parallel group, randomized controlled trial is conducted to compare MBSR with TAU. Lung cancer patients who have received or are still under treatment, and their partners are recruited. Assessments will take place at baseline, post intervention and at three-month follow-up. The primary outcome is psychological distress (i. e. anxiety and depressive symptoms). Secondary outcomes are quality of life (only for patients), caregiver appraisal (only for <b>partners),</b> <b>relationship</b> quality and spirituality. In addition, cost-effectiveness ratio (only in patients) and several process variables are assessed. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MBSR compared to TAU in patients with lung cancer and their partners...|$|E

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study investigated a new {{conceptualization of the}} effectiveness of social support attempts called social support effectiveness (SSE) that takes into account {{the quantity and quality of}} support attempts and the extent to which they meet the needs of recipients. SSE was assessed in a sample of 176 pregnant women with regard to their partners ’ social support behaviors. Potential antecedents of SSE were investigated, including individual and relationship variables. In addition, it was hypothesized that women who appraised their partner’s support as more effective would have lower prenatal anxiety, both concurrently (in mid-pregnancy) and prospectively (in late preg-nancy). Factor analyses confirmed that all hypothesized aspects of SSE contributed to a unitary factor of SSE. Struc-tural equation modeling was used to test the proposed antecedents and consequences of SSE. Results revealed that women’s ratings {{of the effectiveness of}} partner support were predicted by their interpersonal orientation (adult attachment, network orientation, kin individualism–collectivism, and social skills) and by characteristics of their relationships with their <b>partners</b> (<b>relationship</b> quality, emotional closeness and intimacy, and equity). Furthermore, women who perceived themselves to have more effective partner support reported less anxiety in mid-pregnancy and showed a reduction in anxiety from mid- to late pregnancy.

40|$|Internalized working {{model of}} attachment, which affects quality of {{interactions}} with others, can remain relatively stable throughout a person&# 39;s life. Attachment relationship {{seems to have}} some universal characteristics regardless of {{the form of the}} relationship (romantic <b>partners</b> <b>relationship</b> or parent-infant relationship). We were trying to develop a questionnaire of the attachment relationship between a father and his child in early childhood, that could offer comparable results and would be relatively easy to answer and validate. The questionnaire presented in this paper was adapted from the Experiences in Close Relationships &# 8211; Revised (ECR-R; Fraley, Waller and Brennan, 2000) with regard to the relationship between a father and a child. This adapted inventory is a self-report questionnaire for fathers and is used for establishing father&# 39;s perceptions of anxiety and avoidance in the attachment relationship with his child in early childhood. Analysis of 32 statements adapted from the ECR-R proved a 22 item form of the questionnaire (12 items on the anxiety and 10 items on the avoidance subscale) to be adequate. Principal component analysis of 22 items showed a two-component solution. Reliability of both subscales of the adapted instrument for 22 item solution proved to be acceptably high.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to explore the experience of known egg donation in order to identify the psychosocial issues involved. Previous research into known egg donation remains sparse, with the majority of studies focusing on the psychological aspects of treatment, providing largely quantitative information about the practice. In addition to the purely psychological, the current research acknowledges the importance of social factors, highlighting the psychosocial implications of known egg donation for those involved. The study took a hermeneutic phenomenological approach in an effort to understand and interpret participants’ experience of known egg donation through the use of language during interviews. The research was conducted in two distinct phases. During Phase One, semi-structured interviews were conducted with counsellors in UK licensed treatment centres and analysed using a version of thematic analysis. During Phase Two, known egg donors, recipients and the partners of recipients were interviewed in-depth and analysed using a voice-centred relational approach. Following the identification of a number of key themes, the data collected during both phases were synthesized to enable the identification of the psychosocial implications of known egg donation. The main findings highlighted the importance of negotiating relationships before, during and after the donation. Key psychosocial issues identified are: the existence of pressure (both overt and covert) within the donor-recipient relationship, defining and maintaining clear relationship boundaries, involvement of male <b>partners,</b> <b>relationship</b> changes, and a continued renegotiation of relationships in the longer-term. The psychosocial implications identified emphasise the need for counsellors to: adopt a relationally-focused approach within their work, promote {{the best interests of the}} families involved, work with all those involved in the donation throughout the donation process and beyond, encourage ongoing discussion surrounding the implications of secrecy and disclosure, and ensure consistency of psychosocial care.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{experience}} ofWlemployment and re-employment for managers who experience a job loss and are compensated financially {{and supported by}} career transition counselling during Wlemployment. It also explores the experience for the partners ofthese managers. The unique characteristics ofthis group provide an insightful perspective on Wlemployment and this thesis makes a theoretical contribution to the Wlemployment, family and the work stress cross over literature. Career transition counselling cushions Wlemployment but managers continue to be vulnerable to psychological strain. For this group it is the cognitive and emotional demands associated with loss, and lack ofstructure and the constraints ofagency which are the dominant drivers ofpsychological strain, rather than financial security, while a positive outlook is protective. Underlying these dominant drivers, family relationships and social support also provide some protection. These variables combine elements ofWarr's (1987), Jaboda's (1972) and Fryer's (1995) theory of unemployment, within the framework ofthe transactional model ofstress. Interestingly the female partners ofthese unemployed managers are also vulnerable to psychological strain, and there is evidence ofcross over ofpsychological strain between <b>partners.</b> <b>Relationship</b> characteristics ofcohesion, adaptability and relationship strain (Olson, 1993) also cross over between partners. The partners at highest risk ofpsychological strain are women in well paid positions with relationship. strain and lower levels ofsocial support. After re-employment the supported managers are significantly less vulnerable to psychological strain, although their partners' levels ofpsychological strain remain high. Relationship characteristics and social support appear to have less effect on psychological strain after re-employment, although there continues to be evidence of cross over between partners. Job quality is important to psychological strain, with congruency and job satisfaction rather than money being most important. A change in career and low fmancial security are associated with increased psychological strain for the partners. Managers who change careers are more committed, have greater confidence and feel more effective, although this increased confidence is associated with their partners' psychological strain.

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} The study aimed to {{investigate}} the relationship between adult attachment style (AS) in mothers and fathers and post-partum depression (PPD). Methods Study sample was made of 31 women (mean age 32; SD = 5. 41 yrs) and relative <b>partners.</b> <b>Relationship</b> Questionnaire (RQ) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPSD) were administered to women within 48 hours from delivery. Contemporarily RQ was administered to partners. EPSD was then administered to women 4 months later. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA using women ASs as independent variables as reported by RQ (insecure vs secure) and EPDS scores in both times as dependent variable. A two channels ANOVA with repeated measures using partners ASs as reported by RQ (secure and insecure) as independent variable and women EPSD 48 hours and 4 months scores as dependent variable was performed Results There was a significant effect of strength (Table 1) of insecure attachment (F (2. 28) = 6. 94). Post-hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test (Table 2) revealed {{that the difference between}} women with 48 hours secure attachment vs women with 48 hours insecure attachment was significant (M= 7. 59 vs M= 12. 75; p<. 05); the difference between women with 4 months secure attachment vs women with 4 months insecure attachment was highly significant (M= 6. 00 vs M= 12. 75; p<. 001). In other words secure attachment seems to be protective compared to insecure attachment and this effect increases with time. In the partner sample the influence on EPSD of the time and group variables were not significant. Post-hoc comparisons using LSD test revealed that the differences between secure (p=. 02) and preoccupied (p=. 02) attachment vs dismissing were significant (Table 3). Discussion This study confirms that mother insecure attachment is strongly correlated with the onset of PPD. Partner AS was not a risk factor for PPD considering either the whole insecure styles or each single insecure attachment style. On the other hand, the post hoc analysis showed a significant protective effect of secure and preoccupied AS over dismissing attachment in the development of 4 months PPD. In conclusion, this study suggests that furher research based on AS may be a fruitful approach to understanding the developmental pathways leading to PPD...|$|E

Background Having a partner is assumed to relate to better health status via the intermediary process of social support. However, women's health research indicates that having a partner is not always associated with positive social support. Design An exploratory post hoc analysis focused on posttraumatic stress and childbearing was conducted using a large perinatal database from 2005 – 2009. Methods To operationalize <b>partner</b> <b>relationship,</b> four variables were analysed: partner (‘yes’ or ‘no’), intimate partner violence (‘yes’ or ‘no’), the combination of those two factors, and the woman's appraisal {{of the quality of}} her <b>partner</b> <b>relationship</b> via a single item.
