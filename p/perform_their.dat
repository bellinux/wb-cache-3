5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.|$|E
5|$|A month-long European trek began June 10 in Madrid, {{covering}} major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde. Matt Walker {{stood in}} for Vig {{for the rest}} of the summer. Garbage performed two shows in Nice and Lyon supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a further two headlining French shows in Lille and Paris with Mercury Rev as support. The European leg ended at Espárrago Rock in Spain on July 12. Throughout the run, Manson was dogged by vocal problems, leading to the cancellation of a few festival appearances. After a six-week break, Garbage returned to the United Kingdom to <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> last European shows of the year – two intimate club gigs in London.|$|E
5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. He was surprised to find seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E

5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Aguilera is chatting {{with a group}} of women. When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between them. As she continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for {{one side or the}} player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E
5|$|Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel {{long before}} Lucas would shoot it. They trained {{extensively}} with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> duel together. As {{in the previous}} two prequel films, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes {{without the use of}} stunt doubles. The speed at which Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E
5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E

5|$|The Christians, {{believing that}} this tribulation came upon {{them for their}} neglect of the Law of God and their {{religious}} duties, began to fervently read the Krista Purana, an epic poem {{on the life of}} Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens (1549–1619). On discovering this, some Muslims destroyed the books, but the Christians constructed subterranean refuges in which to <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> religious devotions, read the books, and strengthen their faith. According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears, nose, feet and one hand.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to enforce the}} revenue laws were met with stiff resistance {{from a number of}} Massachusetts communities. Several towns refused to choose commissioners to assess the town population and estates, and officials from a number of them were consequently arrested and brought to Boston. Some were fined and released, while others were imprisoned until they promised to <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> duties. The leaders of Ipswich, who had been most vocal in their opposition to the law, were tried and convicted of misdemeanor offenses.|$|E

5|$|This wall is {{visited by}} all our {{brothers}} on every feast and festival; {{and the large}} space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as {{we have a very}} old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.|$|E
5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E
5|$|At the Country Disc Jockey Convention {{in early}} November, Presley was voted the year's most {{promising}} male artist. Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him. After three major labels made offers {{of up to}} $25,000, Parker and Phillips {{struck a deal with}} RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000. Presley, at 20, was still a minor, so his father signed the contract. Parker arranged with the owners of Hill and Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> compositions. By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.|$|E
