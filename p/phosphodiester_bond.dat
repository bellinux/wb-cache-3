25|$|Transcription {{fidelity}} {{is achieved}} through multiple mechanisms. RNA polymerases select correct nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate to prevent transcription errors. Only the NTP which correctly base pairs with the coding {{base in the}} DNA is admitted to the active center. RNA polymerase performs two known proof reading functions to detect and remove misincorporated nucleotides: pyrophosphorylytic editing and hydrolytic editing. The former removes the incorrectly inserted ribonucleotide by a simple reversal of the polymerization reaction, while the latter involves backtracking of the polymerase and cleaving of a segment of error-containing RNA product. Elongation factor TFIIS stimulates an inherent ribonuclease activity in the polymerase, allowing the removal of misincorporated bases through limited local RNA degradation. Note that all reactions (<b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond</b> synthesis, pyrophosphorolysis, <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond</b> hydrolysis) are performed by RNA polymerase by using a single active center.|$|E

Although RNA cleavage {{is often referred to}} as hydrolysis, the mechanism employed does not in fact involve the addition of water. Rather, the cleavage reaction is simply an isomerization that consists of rearrangement of the linking <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond.</b> It is the same reaction, chemically, that occurs with random base-mediated RNA degradation, except that it is highly site-specific and the rate is accelerated 10,000-fold or more.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of its}} history, the {{technology}} underlying shotgun sequencing was the classical chain-termination method or 'Sanger method', {{which is based on}} the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication. Recently, shotgun sequencing has been supplanted by high-throughput sequencing methods, especially for large-scale, automated genome analyses. However, the Sanger method remains in wide use, primarily for smaller-scale projects and for obtaining especially long contiguous DNA sequence reads (>500 nucleotides). Chain-termination methods require a single-stranded DNA template, a DNA primer, a DNA polymerase, normal deoxynucleosidetriphosphates (dNTPs), and modified nucleotides (dideoxyNTPs) that terminate DNA strand elongation. These chain-terminating nucleotides lack a 3'-OH group required for the formation of a <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond</b> between two nucleotides, causing DNA polymerase to cease extension of DNA when a ddNTP is incorporated. The ddNTPs may be radioactively or fluorescently labelled for detection in DNA sequencers. Typically, these machines can sequence up to 96 DNA samples in a single batch (run) in up to 48 runs a day.|$|E
25|$|The siRNA induced post {{transcriptional}} {{gene silencing}} starts with the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The complex silences certain gene expression by cleaving the mRNA molecules coding the target genes. To begin the process, {{one of the two}} siRNA strands, the guide strand, will be loaded into the RISC while the other strand, the passenger strand, is degraded. Certain Dicer enzymes may be responsible of loading the guide strand into RISC. Then, the siRNA scans for and direct RISC to perfectly complementary sequence on the mRNA molecules. The cleavage of the mRNA molecules is thought to be catalyzed by the Piwi domain of Argonaute proteins of the RISC. The mRNA molecule is then cut precisely by cleaving the <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond</b> between the target nucleotides which are paired to siRNA residues 10 and 11, counting from the 5’end. This cleavage results in mRNA fragments that are further degraded by cellular exonucleases. The 5’ fragment is degraded from its 3’ end by exosome while the 3’ fragment is degraded from its 5’ end by 5' -3' exoribonuclease 1(XRN1). Dissociation of the target mRNA strand from RISC after the cleavage allow more mRNA to be silenced. This dissociation process is likely to be promoted by extrinsic factors driven by ATP hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|The PR-factor, {{an enzyme}} {{necessary}} {{for the production of}} protoplasts from yeast, was identified and was named phosphomannanase. The enzyme released mannan and mannan-proteins from yeasts harvested in the logarithmic phase of growth. The size of the molecules released was greater than 200, 000 daltons, which indicated that the enzyme splits very few bonds of the yeast wall. The PR-factor also depolymerized phosphomannans produced by the Hansenula species. The degradation of these substances was due to the splitting of mannosidic <b>bonds.</b> However, the <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bonds</b> present in these phosphomannans were involved in the specificity of the enzyme, and the number of mannosidic bonds cleaved was dependent on the number of <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bonds</b> present. We studied the products of degradation of Hansenula phosphomannans and were unable to identify the exact bond split by the enzyme. After enzymatic digestion and subsequent splitting of <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bonds,</b> phosphomannan Y- 2448 yielded products too complex to be separated. Phosphomannan Y- 1842 was shown to have a structure more complex than that previously proposed. The action of the enzyme on the phosphate-rich walls of Saccharomyces was studied. Mannan, containing intact <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bonds,</b> was released from the walls. Mild acid hydrolysis of this released material split the diester bonds to yield monosaccharide and polysaccharide terminated in mannose- 6 -phosphate. From these products, we deduced that the enzyme cleaved a mannosidic bond adjacent to a mannose, which is also phosphodiester linked through carbon 1.

25|$|Assembly of the virion uses two {{scaffolding}} proteins, internal scaffolding protein B {{and external}} scaffolding protein D. The function of protein B {{seems to be}} to lower the amount of protein D needed by the virion for assembly. Protein H is a multifunctional structural protein required for piloting the viral DNA into the host cell interior during the entry process. Protein E is a 91-amino acid membrane protein that causes host cell lysis by inhibiting the host translocase MraY. This inhibitory activity is located within the N terminal 29 amino acids. Protein A is a single strand endonuclease and is responsible for the initiation of viral DNA replication. It catalyses cleavage and ligation of a <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond</b> between a G and A nucleotide residue pair at the phi X origin. It may not be essential for phage viability but burst sizes are reduced by 50% when it is mutated. Protein A* inhibits host DNA replication. Unlike protein A it is capable of cleaving the phi X viral DNA in the presence of single-stranded binding protein of the host. Protein A*, like Protein A, may not be required for phage viability. Protein C increases the fidelity of the termination and reinitiation reactions and is required for the packagaing of the viral DNA in to the protein shell. Protein K has 56 amino acids and is found in the membrane of the host cell. It appears to be able to increase the burst size of the virus.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{structural feature}} of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA {{is the presence}} of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to mostly adopt the A-form geometry, although in single strand dinucleotide contexts, RNA can rarely also adopt the B-form most commonly observed in DNA. [...] The A-form geometry results in a very deep and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove. A second consequence of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule (that is, not involved in formation of a double helix), it can chemically attack the adjacent <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond</b> to cleave the backbone.|$|E
2500|$|BglII catalyses <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond</b> {{cleavage}} at the DNA backbone {{through a}} phosphoryl transfer to water. Studies on {{the mechanism of}} restriction enzymes have revealed several general features {{that seem to be}} true in almost all cases, although the actual mechanism for each enzyme is most likely some variation of this general mechanism. This mechanism requires a base to generate the hydroxide ion from water, which will act as the nucleophile and attack the phosphorus in the <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond.</b> [...] Also required is a Lewis acid to stabilize the extra negative charge of the pentacoordinated transition state phosphorus, as well as a general acid or metal ion that stabilizes the leaving group (3’-O-).|$|E
50|$|Exonucleases are {{enzymes that}} work by {{cleaving}} nucleotides {{one at a}} time from the end (exo) of a polynucleotide chain. A hydrolyzing reaction that breaks <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bonds</b> at either the 3' or the 5' end occurs. Its close relative is the endonuclease, which cleaves <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bonds</b> in the middle (endo) of a polynucleotide chain. Eukaryotes and prokaryotes have three types of exonucleases involved in the normal turnover of mRNA: 5' to 3' exonuclease, which is a dependent decapping protein; 3' to 5' exonuclease, an independent protein; and poly(A)-specific 3' to 5' exonuclease.|$|R

The intermediate is then hydrolyzed to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Thus the two end products are DAG and IP3. The acid/base catalysis requires two conserved histidine residues and a Ca2+ ion is needed for PIP2 hydrolysis. It has been observed that the active-site Ca2+ coordinates with four acidic residues and if any of the residues are mutated then a greater Ca2+ concentration is needed for catalysis.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of triplex DNA using unmodified, purine-rich oligonucleotides (ODNs) is inhibited by physiologic levels of potassium. Changing negative <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bonds</b> in a triplex forming oligonucleotide (TFO) to neutral linkages causes a small increase in triplex formation. When <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bonds</b> in a TFO are converted to positively-charged linkages the {{formation of}} triplex DNA increases dramatically. In the absence of KCl, a 17 mer TFO containing 11 positively-charged linkages at a concentration of 0. 2 microM converts essentially all of a 30 bp target duplex to a triplex. Less than 15 % of the target duplex is shifted by 2 microMolar of the unmodified TFO. In 130 mM KCl, triplex formation is undetectable using the unmodified TFO, while triplex formation is nearly complete with 2 microM positively-charged TFO. With increasing potassium, TFOs containing {{a higher proportion of}} modified linkages show enhanced triplex formation compared with those less modified. In contrast with unmodified TFOs, triplex formation with more heavily modified TFOs can occur in the absence of divalent cations. We conclude that replacement of <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bonds</b> with positively-charged phosphoramidate linkages results in more efficient triplex formation, suggesting that these compounds may prove useful for in vivo applications...|$|R

2500|$|DNA {{polymerase}} adds a new {{strand of}} DNA by extending the 3' {{end of an}} existing nucleotide chain, adding new nucleotides matched to the template strand {{one at a time}} via the creation of phosphodiester bonds. The energy for this process of DNA polymerization comes from hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate (phosphoanhydride) bonds between the three phosphates attached to each unincorporated base. [...] Free bases with their attached phosphate groups are called nucleotides; in particular, bases with three attached phosphate groups are called nucleoside triphosphates. When a nucleotide is being added to a growing DNA strand, the formation of a <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>bond</b> between the proximal phosphate of the nucleotide to the growing chain is accompanied by hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphate bond with release of the two distal phosphates as a pyrophosphate. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting pyrophosphate into inorganic phosphate consumes a second high-energy phosphate bond and renders the reaction effectively irreversible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} NHEJ {{involves}} XRCC4 {{and a number}} of tightly coupled proteins acting in concert to repair the DSB. [...] The system begins with the binding of one heterodimeric protein called Ku70/80 to each end of the DSB to maintain them close together in preparation for ligation and prevent their degradation. [...] Ku70/80 then sequesters one DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to the DNA ends to enable the binding of Artemis protein to one end of each DNA-PKcs. [...] One end of the DNA-PKcs joins to stabilize the proximity of the DSB and allow very short regions of DNA complementarity to hybridize. [...] DNA-PKcs then phosphorylates Artemis at a serine/threonine to activate its exonuclease activity and cleave nucleotides at the single strand tails that are not hybridized in a 5’ to 3’ direction. [...] Two XRCC4 proteins are post-translationally modified for recognition and localization to Ku70/80 (5). [...] The two XRCC4 proteins dimerize together and bind to Ku70/80 at the ends of the DNA strands to promote ligation. [...] XRCC4 then forms a strong complex with DNA ligase IV, LigIV, which is enhanced by Cernunnos XRCC4-like factor, Cer-XLF. [...] Cer-XLF only binds to XRCC4 without direct interaction with LigIV.
