5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion.

This problem is <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
