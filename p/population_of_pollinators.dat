40|$|Given reports <b>of</b> {{declines in}} <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollinators</b> globally, it is {{increasingly}} important to develop efficient procedures to assess the density and distribution of honey bee colonies in both agricultural and natural landscapes. One such procedure utilises the fact that drone honey bees from different colonies congregate in mating leks {{where they can be}} conveniently sampled. Genetic analysis of the captured drones can determine the number of colonies contributing to the sampled population. Here, through the use of sampling distributions derived from an agent-based model, we provide an improved procedure for estimating the density of colonies from the number of unique colonies identified from the sampled drones. We present simulations for different spatial environments and densities, and show that the number of unique colonies observed in a sample of drones collected at a drone trap covaries with the density of colonies in range of the sampled drone congregation area in a log-linear manner. As a consequence of this relationship, we find that colony densities from past surveys are likely to be lower than previously reported...|$|R
40|$|Pollinating insect populations, {{essential}} for maintaining wild plant diversity and agricultural productivity, rely on (semi) natural habitats. An increasing human population is encroaching upon and deteriorating pollinator habitats. Thus the <b>population</b> persistence <b>of</b> pollinating insects and their associated ecosystem services may depend upon on man-made novel habitats; however, their importance for ecosystem services is barely understood. We tested if man-made infrastructure (railway embankments) in an agricultural landscape establishes novel habitats that support large <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollinators</b> (bees, butterflies, hoverflies) {{when compared to}} typical habitats for these insects, i. e., semi-natural grasslands. We also identified key environmental factors affecting the species richness and abundance <b>of</b> <b>pollinators</b> on embankments. Species richness and abundance of bees and butterflies were higher for railway embankments than for grasslands. The occurrence of bare (non-vegetated) ground on embankments positively affected bee species richness and abundance, but negatively affected butterfly populations. Species richness and abundance of butterflies positively depended on species richness of native plants on embankments, whereas bee species richness was positively affected by species richness of non-native flowering plants. The density of shrubs on embankments negatively affected the number of bee species and their abundance. Bee and hoverfly species richness were positively related to wood cover in a landscape surrounding embankments. This is the first study showing that railway embankments constitute valuable habitat for the conservation <b>of</b> <b>pollinators</b> in farmland.

Therefore, sweet cherry orchards require a huge <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollinator</b> bees {{to carry out}} an adequate amount of pollen transfer between the different varieties. Our {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the differences in the richness and diversity <b>of</b> these <b>pollinators</b> within very closely located sweet cherry orchards, and to understand the underlying effects causing these differences. The study was conducted in the Sultandağı Reservoir (Turkey) which covers the towns of Sultandağı (Afyonkarahisar) and Akşehir (Konya). In order to avoid a sampling bias, Malaise traps were used to collect bee samples. Sampling collections were repeated for three years; from 2007 to 2009, between April and May. The traps were set in the bud-swell period and lifted in the green-fruit period. Climatic data were taken from meteorology stations near the orchards.

40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} mutualisms should be {{vulnerable}} to invasion by cheaters, yet mutualistic interactions are both ancient and diverse. What prevents one partner from reaping {{the benefits of the}} interaction without paying the costs? Using field experiments and observations, we examined factors affecting mutualism stability in six fig tree–fig wasp species pairs. We experimentally compared the fitness of wasps that did or did not perform their most basic mutualistic service, pollination. We found host sanctions that reduced the fitness of non-pollinating wasps in all derived, actively pollinated fig species (where wasps expend time and energy pollinating), but not in the basal, passively pollinated fig species (where wasps do not). We further screened natural <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollinators</b> for wasp individuals that did not carry pollen (‘cheaters’). Pollen-free wasps occurred only in actively pollinating wasp species, and their prevalence was negatively correlated with the sanction strength of their host species.

5|$|Although pest insects {{attract the}} most attention, many insects are {{beneficial}} {{to the environment and}} to humans. Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering plants. Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects. As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species, they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed. This greatly increases plants' ability to cross-pollinate, which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness. This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture. As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants. This helps to spread the plants, which increases plant diversity. This leads to an overall better environment. A serious environmental problem is the decline <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollinator</b> insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, orchard or greenhouse at bloom time. Another solution, as shown in Delaware, has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki. Insects also produce useful substances such as honey, wax, lacquer and silk. Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers. The silkworm has greatly affected human history, as silk-driven trade established relationships between China {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) are {{frequently}} used in agriculture for pollination services {{because of their}} abundance, generalist floral preferences, ease of management and hive transport. However, their populations are declining in many countries. Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) are being implemented in agricultural systems to combat the decline in <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollinators</b> and other insects. Despite AES being increasingly embedded in policy and budgets, scientific assessments {{of many of these}} schemes still are lacking, and only a few studies have examined the extent to which insect pollinators use the floral enhancements that are part of AES and on which floral components they feed (i. e., pollen and/or nectar). METHODS: In the present work, we used a combination of observations on honeybee foraging for nectar/pollen from the Californian annual plant Phacelia tanacetifolia in the field, collection of pollen pellets from hives, and pollen identification, to assess the value of adding phacelia to an agro-ecosystem to benefit honeybees. RESULTS: It was found that phacelia pollen was almost never taken by honeybees. The work here demonstrates that honeybees may not use the floral enhancements added to a landscape as expected and points to the need for more careful assessments of what resources are used by honeybees in AES and understanding the role, if any, which AES play in enhancing pollinator fitness. DISCUSSION: We recommend using the methodology in this paper to explore the efficacy of AES before particular flowering species are adopted more widely to give a more complete illustration of the actual efficacy of AE...|$|R

Statistically significant and positive relationships were found between the abundance <b>of</b> <b>pollinators</b> with the density of cacao trees and the leaf litter cover and remains of decomposing fruit on the ground. The relationship was negative with the abundance of timber, musaceous, fruit and palm trees, and with the presence of stones, grass and bare soil.

After sowing in spring the plants were left until flowering in late summer. Nectar was extracted using 5 -μl glass microcapillary tubes. The material was frozen and sampled at a later date. The samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the AccQtag (Waters Corp.) system. Analysis showed that the total concentration of amino acids increased significantly with increasing fertilizer treatment (P < 0. 05). Of the amino acids present glutamine showed a large and significant increase (P < 0. 01), proline showed an increase (P < 0. 05) and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) showed a decrease (P < 0. 05). No others showed a significant change. It {{is interesting to note}} that a common biosynthetic pathway (from α-ketoglutarate) links the amino acids that altered in concentration. Due to these changes the relative abundance of about half of the amino acids in the nectar was significantly altered. Glutamine showed a significant increase (P < 0. 001) in percentage of the total with most of the remaining amino acids declining in relative abundance. The results show that, in contradiction to earlier work, soil conditions can affect the amino acid complement of nectar.

Such imprecise modular sanctions allow pollen-free wasps to free-ride in figs with multiple foundresses. In Chapter Three, I use mathematical models parameterized with empirical data to examine what mechanisms are most likely to maintain the behavioural polymorphism in fig wasps. Is being a pollen-free wasp adaptive, or is this morph maladaptive but repeatedly introduced through mutations?

The transformation of agriculture in the past half-century has triggered a decline in bees and other insect pollinators. In North America, losses of bee colonies have accelerated since 2004, leaving the continent with fewer managed pollinators {{than at any time}} in the past 50  years. A number of factors linked to industrial modes of agriculture affect bee colonies and other pollinators around the world, ranging from habitat degradation due to monocultures with consequent declines in flowering plants and the use of damaging insecticides. Incentives should be offered to farmers to restore pollinator-friendly habitats, including flower provisioning within or around crop fields and elimination of use of insecticides by adopting agroecological production methods. Conventional farmers should be extremely cautious in the choice, timing, and application of insecticides and other chemicals. Here, we review the literature providing mounting evidence that the restoration of plant biodiversity within and around crop fields can improve habitat for domestic and wild bees as well as other insects and thus enhance pollination services in agroecosystems. Main findings are the following: (1) certain weed species within crop fields that provide food resources and refuge should be maintained at tolerable levels within crop fields to aid in the survival <b>of</b> viable <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollinators.</b> (2) Careful manipulation strategies need to be defined in order to avoid weed competition with crops and interference with certain cultural practices. Economic thresholds <b>of</b> weed <b>populations,</b> as well as factors affecting crop–weed balance within a crop season, need to be defined for specific cropping systems. (3) More research is warranted to advance knowledge on identifying beneficial weed species and ways to sponsor them to attract pollinators while not reducing yields through interference. (4) In areas of intensive farming, field margins, field edges and paths, headlands, fence-lines, rights of way, and nearby uncultivated patches of land are important refuges for many pollinators. (5) Maintenance and restoration of hedgerows and other vegetation features at field borders is therefore essential for harboring pollinators. (6) Appropriate management of non-cropped areas to encourage wild pollinators may prove to be a cost-effective means of maximizing crop yield...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the case of}} natural hybridization between two angiosperm species (A and B) which are mechanically and ethologically isolated (or florally isolated). What {{is the effect of}} hybridization on the pollination system, and conversely, what is the effect <b>of</b> the <b>pollinators</b> on the outcome of the hybridization? The original floral isolation is based on an interspecific differentiation in floral characters, the floral mechanisms of the parental species being specialized for pollination by different types <b>of</b> <b>pollinators</b> with different body forms and behavioral traits. F 1 hybrids of A x B have intermediate floral characters and serve as bridges for interspecific cross-pollination. The problem next shifts to the changes in floral characters and mode of pollination that are likely to occur in later generations in the hybrid <b>population.</b> The <b>pollinators</b> <b>of</b> species A and species B exert selective pressures on the hybrid population. If the normal <b>pollinator</b> <b>of</b> A is more abundant, active, and effective in the hybrid <b>population</b> than the <b>pollinator</b> <b>of</b> B, selection is expected to favor a reversion toward the floral characters and pollination system of A. The opposite condition, in which the <b>pollinator</b> <b>of</b> B is predominant, leads to the reciprocal result, reversion toward B. If the two types <b>of</b> <b>pollinators</b> are {{more or less the same}} in number of flower visits and pollination effectiveness, their combined selective pressure should produce later-generation derivatives with intermediate floral characters suited for both pollinators. Three western North American plant groups containing florally isolated species that hybridize (Ipomopsis, Diplacus, and Aquilegia) are examined in relation to these predictions. The evidence in the three groups is generally in agreement with the hypothesis...|$|R
5000|$|The {{predominant}} population {{affected by}} the snake's introduction was that of native bird species such as the Mariana fruit dove, the Guam flycatcher, the rufous fantail and the Micronesian myzomela. The introduction of the brown tree snake into Guam has resulted in extinction of twelve native bird species in total. The Guam National Wildlife Refuge is attempting to prevent the extinction of additional bird species endangered by the snake. Other species significantly {{affected by the}} invasion of these snakes were small lizards and small mammals. [...] Research has indicated a direct correlation of the spread of these snakes across the island to the decrease in the <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> these native species. Furthermore, {{the introduction of the}} brown tree snake has had an indirect, negative impact on vegetative diversity as its intense predatory nature has decreased <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> vital <b>pollinators</b> including native birds and fruit bats. Data collected from nearby islands lacking brown tree snake populations depict a significant difference in vegetative species richness, that is, islands close to and similar to Guam in which the brown tree snake has not been introduced have greater vegetative species diversity. Overall, the vertebrate fauna and native flora of Guam have suffered tremendously because of the introduction of the brown tree snake.|$|R
40|$|We {{surveyed}} for {{the presence}} and identity of Wolbachia in 44 species of chalcid wasps associated with 18 species of Panamanian figs. We used existing detailed knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>population</b> structures <b>of</b> the host wasps, {{as well as the}} ecological and evolutionary relationships among them, to explore the relevance of each of these factors to Wolbachia prevalence and mode of transmission. Fifty-nine per cent of these wasp species have Wolbachia infections, the highest proportion reported for any group of insects. Further, neither the presence nor the frequency of Wolbachia within hosts was correlated with the <b>population</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>pollinator</b> hosts. Phylogenetic analyses of wsp sequence data from 70 individuals representing 22 wasp species show that neither the close phylogenetic relationship nor close ecological association among host species is consistently linked to close phylogenetic affinities of the Wolbachia associated with them. Moreover, no genetic variation was detected within any Wolbachia strain from a given host species. Thus, the spread of Wolbachia within host species exceeds the rate of horizontal transmission among species and both exceed the rate of mutation of the wsp gene in Wolbachia. The presence and, in some cases, high frequency of Wolbachia infections within highly inbred species indicate that the Wolbachia either directly increase host fitness or are frequently horizontally transferred within these wasp species. However, the paucity of cospeciation of Wolbachia and their wasp hosts indicates that Wolbachia do not persist within a given host lineage for long time-periods relative to speciation times...|$|R
40|$|Reproduction {{of plants}} in {{fragmented}} habitats {{may be limited}} because of lower diversity or abundance <b>of</b> <b>pollinators,</b> and/or variation in local plant density. We assessed natural fruit set and pollinator limitation in ten species of woody plants in natural and restored fragments in the Pondicherry region of southern India, to see whether breeding system of plants (self-compatible and self-incompatible) affected fruit set. We tested {{whether the number of}} flowering individuals in the fragments affected the fruit set and further examined the adult and sapling densities of self-compatible (SC) and self-incompatible (SI) species. We measured the natural level of fruit set and pollinator limitation (calculated as the difference in fruit set between hand cross-pollinated and naturally pollinated flowers). Our results demonstrate that there was a higher level <b>of</b> <b>pollinator</b> limitation and hence lower levels of natural fruit set in self-incompatible species as compared to self-compatible species. However, the hand cross-pollinated flowers in SC and SI species produced similar levels of fruit set,further indicating that lower fruit set was due to pollinator limitation and not due to lack of cross-compatible individuals in the fragments. There was no significant relation between number of flowering individuals and the levels of natural fruit set, except for two species Derris ovalifolia, Ixora pavetta. In these species the natural fruit set decreased with increasing population size, again indicating pollinator limitation. The adult and sapling densities in self-compatible species were significantly higher than inself-incompatible species. These findings indicate that the low reproductive output in self-incompatible species may eventually lead to lower <b>population</b> sizes. Restoration <b>of</b> <b>pollinator</b> services along with plant species in fragmented habitats is important for the long-term conservation of biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.
