40|$|The {{chemical}} processes responsible for production of photochemical oxidants within the troposphere {{have been the}} subject of laboratory and field study throughout the last three decades. During the same period, models to simulate the atmospheric chemistry, transport and deposition of ozone (O 3) from individual urban sources and from regions have been developed. The models differ greatly in the complexity of chemical schemes, in the underlying meteorology and in spatial and temporal resolution. Input information from land use, spatial and temporally disaggregated emission inventories and meteorology have all improved considerably in recent years and are not fully implemented in current models. The development of control strategies in both North America and Europe to close the gaps between current exceedances of environmental limits, guide values, critical levels or loads and full compliance with these limits provides the focus for policy makers and the support agencies for the research. The models represent the only method of testing a range of control options in advance of implementation. This paper describes currently applied models of <b>photochemical</b> <b>oxidant</b> production and transport at global and regional scales and their ability to simulate individual episodes as well as <b>photochemical</b> <b>oxidant</b> climatology. The success of current models in quantifying the exposure of terrestrial surfaces and the population to potentially damaging O 3 concentrations (and dose) is examined. The analysis shows the degree to which the underlying processes and their application within the models limit the quality of the model products. ...|$|E

The study aims {{to develop a}} model to estimate and compare emissions at foundation construction and demonstrate its application using two case studies. A process-based quantitative method is established to estimate emissions due to materials, transportation, and equipment usage. The results are analysed under five impact categories including Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Eutrophication Potential, <b>Photochemical</b> <b>Oxidant</b> Formation Potential and Human Toxicity Potential. Analytical Hierarchy Process is employed to obtain weighting factors to assess impact categories under global and local perspectives. Results obtained an average GHG emission of 67 %, 19 % and 14 % from materials, equipment and transportation respectively. This observation signifies the relative higher percentage of emission distribution of equipment and transportation in foundation construction compared {{to that in the}} total building construction. Considerable amount of non-GHG emissions such as Nitrous Oxides and Carbon Monoxides were recorded. Global Warming Potential remained the most prominent impact potential from all the perspectives considered, with an overpowering 75 % contribution from global perspective.

Despite its renewable nature, solar power generation generates impacts that need to be adequately evaluated and managed. The objective {{of this paper is to}} estimate the socioeconomic and environmental life cycle impacts of the production of electricity by a commercial CSP plant using Multiregional Input Output Analysis. These effects have been estimated in terms of additional economic activity, value added, employment creation, climate change, acidification, <b>photochemical</b> <b>oxidant</b> formation and primary energy consumption. Additionally, the economic sectors and countries with higher effects in the value chain have been identified. The results are presented both in gross and net terms, including not only the effects of the system’s life cycle, but also the avoided effects derived from the displacement of other technologies in the Spanish electricity market. The effects of the displaced electricity have been calculated by estimating the Levelized Cost Of Energy of the mix of marginal technologies displaced by the CSP plant. The results indicate that producing electricity in a CSP plant and selling it into the Spanish electricity market results in net positive impacts on the economy, the employment and the environment both at a national and global scale. Taking into consideration the electricity technologies displaced by the CSP plant, the socioeconomic net effects amount to 167 €/MWh of goods and services generated, 87. 9 €/MWh of value added and 4. 67 h/MWh of employment creation.

The notable differences in the concentrations of ozone and nitrogen oxides depended on season, and meteorological variables showed a marked correlation to the seasonal budget of trace constituents. The weak local circulation, the land-sea breeze system, and high solar radiation in summer, which may persist at length because of the anticyclonic conditions, can produce episodes of intense photochemical reactions.

A bimodality in the atmospheric dynamics is linked to systematic variations in ozone concentration. It is concluded that during certain phases of the two circulation modes, increased wind speed reduces the resistance of the earth's surface to the deposition of ozone, and decreased ozone concentration levels result. For other phases, light winds occur, signifying high resistance to deposition and high ozone levels.

Using adaptive methods, grid resolutions of less than 20 km can be achieved in a computationally effective way.

Temperate and Mediterraean forests elsewhere have most likely been similarly impacted and current investigations of such effects are being pursued. Ozone Land its photochemically reactive precursors) has been demonstrated to occur at considerable distances downwind of major urban sources. Ozone has induced pertubations to vegetation over large areas and has therefore impacted innumerable and diverse forest ecosystems. Direct injury due to ozone has been documented to occur on numerous individual forest vegetation species but direct alterations of forest ecosystems as related to ozone induced effects have only been extensively documented in the San Bernardino Mountains of California; to a lesser degree similar studies have been done in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Due to the current sulfur dioxide (SO?) problems confronting European forests and due to the planned increased utilization of fossil fuels in much of the North American Continent, the influence of ozone in combination with SO 2 must be fully considered.
