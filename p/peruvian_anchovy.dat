The overall trend remains increasing, but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild.

40|$|International audienceOne major {{challenge}} in the emerging field of movement ecology is the inference of behavioural modes from movement patterns. This has been mainly addressed through Hidden Markov models (HMMs). We propose here to evaluate two sets of alternative and state-of-the-art modelling approaches. First, we consider hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs). They may better represent the behavioural dynamics of foragers since they explicitly model {{the duration of the}} behavioural modes. Second, we consider discriminative models which state the inference of behavioural modes as a classification issue, and may take better advantage of multivariate and non linear combinations of movement pattern descriptors. For this work, we use a dataset of > 200 trips from human foragers, <b>Peruvian</b> fishermen targeting <b>anchovy.</b> Their movements were recorded through a Vessel Monitoring System (∼ 1 record per hour), while their behavioural modes (fishing, searching and cruising) were reported by on-board observers. We compare the efficiency of hidden Markov, hidden semi-Markov, and three discriminative models (random forests, artificial neural networks and support vector machines) for inferring the fishermen behavioural modes, using a cross-validation procedure. HSMMs show the highest accuracy (80 %), significantly outperforming HMMs and discriminative models. Simulations show that data with higher temporal resolution, HSMMs reach nearly 100 % of accuracy. Our results demonstrate to what extent the sequential nature of movement is critical for accurately inferring behavioural modes from a trajectory and we strongly recommend the use of HSMMs for such purpose. In addition, this work opens perspectives on the use of hybrid HSMM-discriminative models, where a discriminative setting for the observation process of HSMMs could greatly improve inference performance...|$|R

5000|$|Spearfishing with barbed {{harpoons}} {{along the}} sea coast was widespread by the Palaeolithic. Fish ponds surrounded Sumerian temples by 2&thinsp;500 BC and a Chinese classical text credited to the 5th-century BC businessman Fan Li is {{the earliest known}} work on fish farming. A surviving fragment of Isidore of Charax's 1st-century Parthian itinerary describes locals freediving for pearls in the Persian Gulf, and Oppian's 2nd-century Halieutics relates the four main Greek and Roman fishing methods as hook-and-line, netting, passive traps, and trident. Traditional fishing boats operate in near-shore waters but, during the late Middle Ages and early Modern period, fishing on the open sea—particularly cod—became important to the economic and naval development of Northern Europe, New England, and Canada. Overfishing along the coasts of the North Sea spurred the development of deep-sea fishers such as the Brixham and otter trawlers, which might serve as motherships for longlining dories; in the 19th century, advances such as rail transport, canning, and refrigeration allowed fishing to become a full-fledged industry. Improvements in sonar during the world wars were adapted as fishfinders and, during the 1950s, great factory ships caught and processed as many fish in an hour as earlier trawlers had in a season. By the 1960s, the North Atlantic and North Pacific fisheries were close to maximal exploitation. After the catch from wild marine fisheries grew from 18 million metric tons (20 million tons) in 1950 to around 85 million metric tons ( [...] million tons) by the late 1980s, it has remained essentially constant since. Chinese economic reform led to massive growth of its fishing production, from 7% of the world total in 1961 to 35% by 2010. Scientific studies of population dynamics and nationalization of formerly shared waters are both helping to cope with overexploitation but the success of modern commercial fishing has required major corrective actions: {{the collapse of the}} Grand Banks cod fishery to less than 1% of its historic levels required a complete moratorium by Canada in 1992 and China has enforced a zero-growth policy in its wild catch since 2000, redirecting its industry towards aquaculture; its annual months-long bans on fishing in disputed areas of the South China Sea is enforced over the protest of neighboring states.As of 2006, there were an estimated 43.5 million people involved in capturing or raising seafood, 85.5% of whom lived in Asia. About [...] were fishers and the remainder fish farmers. In 2012, total global production of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons (174 million tons), of which 91.3 million metric tons (100 million tons) were caught in the wild. This is also a record if ignoring the <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy,</b> whose population can vary dramatically with the El Niño cycle. The overall trend remains increasing, but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild.

At present, the species most frequently landed are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, and salmon. A number of these, as well as large predatory fish, remain well below historical levels.Over 3 million vessels are employed in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.As well as the wild stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food products were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|<b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis ringens) stock {{abundance}} is tightly {{driven by}} the high and unpredictable variability of the Humboldt Current Ecosystem. Management of the fishery therefore cannot rely on mid- or long-term management policy alone but needs to be adaptive at relatively short time scales. Regular acoustic surveys are performed on the stock at intervals of 2 to 4 times a year, {{but there is a}} need for more time continuous monitoring indicators to ensure that management can respond at suitable time scales. Existing literature suggests that spatially explicit data on the location of fishing activities could be used as a proxy for target stock distribution. Spatially explicit commercial fishing data could therefore guide adaptive management decisions at shorter time scales than is possible through scientific stock surveys. In this study we therefore aim to (1) estimate the position of fishing operations for the entire fleet of <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> purse-seiners using the Peruvian satellite vessel monitoring system (VMS), and (2) quantify the extent to which the distribution of purse-seine sets describes anchovy distribution. To estimate fishing set positions from vessel tracks derived from VMS data we developed a methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANN) trained on a sample of fishing trips with known fishing set positions (exact fishing positions are known for approximately 1. 5 % of the fleet from an at-sea observer program). The ANN correctly identified 83 % of the real fishing sets and largely outperformed cornparative linear models. This network is then used to forecast fishing operations for those trips where no observers were onboard. To quantify the extent to which fishing set distribution was correlated to stock distribution we compared three metrics describing features of the distributions (the mean distance to the coast, the total area of distribution, and a clustering index) for concomitant acoustic survey observations and fishing set positions identified from VMS. For two of these metrics (mean distance to the coast and clustering index), fishing and survey data were significantly correlated. We conclude that the location of purse-seine fishing sets yields significant and valuable information on the distribution of the <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> stock and ultimately on its vulnerability to the fishery. For example, a high concentration of sets in the near coastal zone could potentially be used as a warning signal of high levels of stock vulnerability and trigger appropriate management measures aimed at reducing fishing effort...|$|E

Five management strategies (E 1 [...] E 5) were considered to define the total allowable catch Y* for the <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis ringens) : E 1) social quota (Y* = Ymin), E 2) ICES precautionary quota, E 3) maximum viable quota Y*=Ymax(B), E 4) maximum precautionary viable quota and, E 5) half precautionary viable quota. We used five indicators for sustainability, related to the risk of collapse and the mean and variability of yields and biomasses. Two scenarios for initial biomasses were considered (healthy stock and postcollapse recovering stock). The analyses were done with Monte Carlo simulations, with 10 000 simulations per scenario and strategy. Uncertainty was incorporated in the quota implementation, simulating the variability of discards and illegal catches. The effect of the enviroment during 1963 [...] 1984 was considered by changing the stock-recruitment parameters during El Niño events. We found that the half precautionary viable quota (E 5) could avoid the anchoveta fishery collapse in 1972 [...] 1973, allowing yields greater than the social quota. Also, the ICES precautionary strategy (E 2) did not ensure the sustainability of the stock during El Niño events. We determine that a one year fishery moratorium after the fishery collapse would have been necessary to return to the viability kernel, allowing a sustainable management thereafter.

40|$|Successful {{ecological}} forecasting of fishery yields in {{the face}} of climate variability has eluded resource managers for decades. However, recent advances in observing systems, computational power and understanding of ecosystem function offer credible evidence that the variability of the ocean ecosystem and its impact on fishery yield can be forecast accurately enough and with enough lead time to be useful to society. The tools are now in place to provide ocean managers the capability to both protect and wisely use living marine resources. Advances in space-based real time sensors, high performance computing, very high-resolution physical models, and robust ecosystem theory make possible operational forecasts of both fish availability and ecosystem health. Accurate and timely forecasts can provide the information needed to maintain the long-term sustainability of fish stocks and protect the ecosystem of which the fish are an integral part, while maximizing social and economic benefits and preventing wasteful overinvestment of economic resources.

We also investigate the impact of diagenetic changes on the isotopic composition and elemental contents of the pure ornithogenic sediments, starting with modern stratified deposits and extending to fossil guano. Where possible, 14 C systematics is used for age information. The nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition of the marine prey (<b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy)</b> of the birds is complex as it shows strong systematic variations with latitude. The detailed study of a modern profile that represents a few years of guano deposition up to present reveals systematic changes in nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition towards heavier values that increase with age, i. e. depth. Only the uppermost, youngest layers of modern guano show compositional affinity to the prey of the birds. In the profile, the simultaneous loss of nitrogen and carbon occurs by degassing, and non-volatile elements like phosphorous and calcium are passively enriched in the residual guano. Fossil guano deposits are very low in nitrogen and low in carbon contents, and show very heavy nitrogen isotopic compositions. One result of the study is that the use of guano for tracing nitrogen and carbon isotopic and elemental composition in the marine food web of the birds is restricted to fresh material. Despite systematic changes during diagenesis, there is little promise to retrieve reliable values of marine nitrogen and carbon signatures from older guano. However, the changes in isotopic composition from primary marine nitrogen isotopic signatures towards very heavy values generate a compositionally unique material. These compositions trace the presence of guano in natural ecosystems and its use as fertilizer in present and past agriculture...|$|E

40|$|How organisms {{move and}} {{disperse}} {{is crucial in}} ecology and random walk (RW) models are typical tools to describe movement patterns. Whether forager movements are better described by Lévy or alternate RW is keenly debated, mostly because of methodological shortcomings. We get around this issue using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD), which includes Brownian, exponential or Lévy as specific cases. We provide a statistically-sound definition of {{the tail of the}} move length distribution, and a robust goodness-of-fit test to sustain decision {{on the nature of the}} observed movement. Applied to <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> fishing vessels, GPD reveals that fishermen perform mostly Lévy walks in the industrial fleet (super diffusive movement) and light-tailed walks in the artisanal fleet (normally diffusive movement), and suggests this is related to different perceptions of the prey field. Fitting GPD lets the more likely RW model emerge from the data and makes easier analyzing the determinisms of movement strategies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the use of {{hyperbolic}} discounting in environmental regulation can have unfortunate consequences. In a three-period model we demonstrate that a planner who `naively` employs hyperbolic discounting and fails to anticipate problems of dynamic inconsistency, can oversee a collapse of a renewable resource. If the regeneration rate of the resource is within a given range, and stock levels are close to the `minimum viable population`, then an unforeseen collapse will result. This basic result is shown to hold in an infinite-horizon, continuous-time model with hyperbolic discounting of the sort examined in Barro (1999) and Li and Lofgren (2001). Here, the naive planner does not anticipate extinction of its resource stock because it always plans to lower consumption (but it never does). Two conclusions follow from these results. First, the model provides an explanation for resource collapses such as that of the <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> and Atlantic cod. Second, governments should think carefully before they employ hyperbolic discounting in policymaking. hyperbolic discounting, time-inconsistency, renewable resources...|$|E

Specifically, it addresses issues related to pelagic fisheries and the fish meal industry. The thesis presents a discussion and overview of the upwelling ecosystem of Peru and the <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis ringens) including quantitative analysis and forecasts for the fishery and fish meal prices. This analysis is used to demonstrate the commercial application and relationship between SST and related resource markets. The thesis establishes a bioeconomic statistical model and correlation coefficients between the variables including SST, fish catch, fish meal production, and protein meal prices. The study tests the relationship between SST observations and fish catch and fish meal production. It also {{addresses the}} potential problem of overexploitation which may result from using SST data to increase yield.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the movement of}} fishing vessels during fishing trips {{in order to understand}} how fishermen behave in space while searching for fi sh. For that purpose we used hourly geo- referenced positions of vessels, provided by a satellite vessel monitoring system, for the entire industrial fleet (809 vessels) of the world's largest single species fishery (<b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy,</b> Engraulis ringens) from December 1999 to March 2003. Observed trajectories of fishing vessels are well modeled by Levy random walks, suggesting that. shermen use a stochastic search strategy which conforms to the same search statistics as non-human predators. We show that human skills (technology, communication, or others) do not result in the fishermen's spatial behavior being fundamentally different from that of animal predators. With respect to probability of prey encounter, our results suggest that. shermen, on average, evolved an optimal movement pattern (mu = 2. 00) among the family of Levy random walks. This Lagrangian approach opens several perspectives in terms of operational management of the pelagic fish stock...|$|E
40|$|Fisheries {{governance}} {{is about}} influencing multiple actors decisions and behaviours relative to an ocean {{area and the}} resources contained therein. How these behaviours and decisions are influenced {{is a matter of}} institutions. This research uses the <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> fishery as a case study. Landings of <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> represent almost 10 % of the worlds total fishery landings. Following the well known collapse of the anchovy fishery {{at the start of the}} 1970 s, landings have recovered and have been sustained over the last two decades at around six to nine million tonnes per year. Despite this evidence of sustainability, key institutional requirements that are nowadays strongly recommended to achieve sustainable fisheries are absent in this fishery. These missing requirements for sustainability include for instance individual fishing quota shares, decentralized bottom-up management and eco-labelling. In order to explore the institutional setting of this sustainable fishery, this study adopts a broad institutional approach that considers a range of institutions, including those mentioned above and others that have rarely been considered by fisheries research. The first article of this research looks at the role and evolution of formal fisheries institutions and their relation to sustainability. Results show that General Fisheries Acts in Peru were enacted independently of trends in anchovy landings. The three Peruvian Fisheries Acts were a reflection of broader national socio-political changes and were enacted mainly to define the role of the state and private investment and to delimit foreign involvement in the fishery industry. The base-level management to deal with landings was left to secondary legislation. To guarantee stable landings, this secondary legislation operates adaptively, in response to environmental and ecological dynamics. Fisheries laws play an important role in defining access rights according to local, economic and political policies and function as an umbrella for secondary legislation and other norms to evolve towards sustainability. The second article deals with informal institutions and the connection between sustainability and adaptation to environmental variability and climate change. As shown in this article, the sustainability of the Peruvian fishery relies heavily on institutions developed to cope with environmental change. A set of eight adaptive strategies are described. These included: decentralized installation of anchovy processing factories; simultaneous ownership of fishing fleet and processing factories (vertical integration); use of low-cost unloading facilities; opportunistic utilization of invading fish populations; low cost intensive monitoring; rapid responses and flexible management; reduction of price uncertainty by restricting supply of anchovy products (fishmeal) to match market demand; and decoupling of fishmeal prices from those of other substitute commodities. These coping strategies provide an example of how the fisheries sector and central government can act positively to reduce undesirable impacts of environmental variability and change. The third article deals with fish as a common pool resource (CPR). This article considers the extent to which institutional characteristics of the Peruvian fishery conform to design principles which are considered prerequisites for long-term successful community-based CPR. This study finds that clearly defined resource boundaries, monitoring rule enforcement and conflict resolution mechanisms among users and management authorities supported the transition towards sustainability. On the other hand, clearly defined user boundaries, collective choice arrangements and nested enterprises were in this case not required to achieve sustainability. The article analyses the strengths and limitations of current and past institutional arrangements in the <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> fishery. It comments on the extent to which design principles developed in local CPR systems are transferable to a national scale...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> {{industry}} grew at {{a compound}} rate of 42 percent between 1956 and 1965, making Peru the largest fish producer in the world. Between 1967 and 1971 annual catches averaged 10. 5 million metric tons. However, in 1972 the anomalous ocean current known as El Nino combined with over-exploitation to decimate the anchovy stock. Anchovy harvests fell by 55 percent in 1972 and another 51 percent in 1973. Despite {{the efforts of the}} Institutio del Mar del Peru, an incomplete understanding of the anchovy's behavior and imperfect management practices led to severe economic hardship. This paper presents an anchovy population dynamics model implemented as a computer simulation. It incorporates aspects of several general population models in the literature, the peculiar characteristics of the anchovy ecosystem, and Peru's specific economic needs. Our goal was to find the optimal management policy that can be practically implemented and to develop a methodology that can be applied to other situations. The model indicated that Peru should limit fishing to the springtime and use quotas that favor large modern purse seiners...|$|E
40|$|Being the {{collective}} interface {{with the environment}} and the exploitation, schools and their typology represent an important life history trait of gregarious fish. Changes in the characteristics of the environment sensu largo induce changes in the school typology, which can be used as indicator of stock adaptive patterns. In order to understand the interactions between school structure and environment patterns, a first step consists in studying the school internal structure and the functioning of fish aggregation inside it and in its surroundings. The paper describes the spatial morphology and dynamics changes in <b>Peruvian</b> <b>Anchovy</b> (Engraulis ringens) schools in Peru using multibeam sonar observation on a station. Different cases of school types are extracted from a data base of around 200 recordings: from small circular well individualized schools to large aggregation surrounded by scattered targets. The internal structure of the aggregations is described at a 10 cm definition scale. The shape and dynamics of internal structures (nuclei) are described. The school edges are measured in shape and dynamics, and the relationship between the school and the fish surrounding the school are measured, using geostatistics and fractal dimensions approache...|$|E
40|$|Background: Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are {{expanding}} in the World Ocean {{as a result}} of climate change and direct anthropogenic influence. OMZ expansion greatly affects biogeochemical processes and marine life, especially by constraining the vertical habitat of most marine organisms. Currently, monitoring the variability of the upper limit of the OMZs relies on time intensive sampling protocols, causing poor spatial resolution. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using routine underwater acoustic observations of the vertical distribution of marine organisms, we propose a new method that allows determination of the upper limit of the OMZ with a high precision. Applied in the eastern South-Pacific, this original sampling technique provides high-resolution information on the depth of the upper OMZ allowing documentation of mesoscale and submesoscale features (e. g., eddies and filaments) that structure the upper ocean and the marine ecosystems.

40|$|The term "commons" {{refers to}} collectively {{exploited}} resources and their systems of usage; a synonymous term is common pool resources. Fisheries are typical common pool resources and {{also one of}} the most conspicuous examples of unsustainable use of natural resources. We examine one of the few globally important fisheries that is held to be sustainable, the <b>Peruvian</b> <b>anchovy</b> fishery, and considers the extent to which the institutional characteristics of the fishery conform to design principles that are considered prerequisites for long-term, successful, community-based common pool resources. Results showed that greater conformity to the principles was found in the sustainable phase of the fishery, compared to its unsustainable phase. For this case study, the conditions that supported the transition towards sustainability were: clearly defined resource boundaries, monitoring of rule enforcement, and conflict resolution mechanisms among users and management authorities. On the other hand, clearly defined user boundaries, collective choice arrangements, and nested enterprises were not required to achieve sustainability. The study concludes that the design principles are a valuable tool for analysis and understanding of large-scale common pool resource systems. At the same time it suggests that the application of the principles to a wider range of systems can generate new insights into what is required for successful management of common pool resources...|$|E
