For directors of a company... little or no personal discredit falls upon them if their company fails to pay a dividend to its trade creditors. It is, therefore, {{all the more important}} that the amount and manner of borrowing by a corporation should be upon a satisfactory basis... We do not consider that a company should have any greater facility for borrowing than an individual, and we think that while a company should have unrestricted <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> or charge its fixed assets and should be allowed to contract that other fixed assets substituted for those charged should become subject to the charge, and the company should also be capable of charging existing chattels and book debtsor other things in action, it ought to be rendered incapable of charging after acquired chattels, or future book debts, or other property not in existence {{at the time of the}} creation of the charge.’ Minority of the Loreburn Committee, Report of the Company Law Amendment Committee (1906) Cd 3052, 28 Especially as automatic crystallisation ceased to make floating charges an effective form of priority, the next step by businesses was to contract for fixed charges over every available specific asset, and then take a floating charge over the remainder. It attempted to do this as well over book debts that a company would collect and trade with. In two early cases the courts approved this practice. In Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd it was said to be done with a stipulation that the charge was [...] "fixed" [...] and the requirement that proceeds be paid into an account held with the lending bank. In Re New Bullas Trading Ltd the Court of Appeal said that a charge could purport to be fixed over uncollected debts, but floating over the proceeds that were collected from the bank's designated account. However the courts overturned these decisions in two leading cases. In Re Brumark Investments Ltd the Privy Council advised that a charge in favour of Westpac bank that purported to separate uncollected debts (where a charge was said to be fixed) and the proceeds (where the charge was said to be floating) could not be deemed separable: the distinction made no commercial sense because the only value in uncollected debts are the proceeds, and so the charge would have to be the same over both. In Re Spectrum Plus Ltd, the House of Lords finally decided that because the hallmark of a floating charge is that a company is free to deal with the charged assets in the ordinary course of business, any charge purported to be [...] "fixed" [...] over book debts kept in any account except one which a bank restricts the use of, must be in substance a floating charge. Lord Scott emphasised that this definition [...] "reflects the mischief that the statutory intervention... was intended to meet and should ensure that preferential creditors continue to enjoy the priority that section 175 of the 1986 Act and its statutory predecessors intended them to have." [...] The decision in Re Spectrum Plus Ltd created a new debate. On the one hand, John Armour argued in response that all categories of preferential would be better off abolished, because in his view businesses would merely be able to contract around the law (even after Re Spectrum Plus Ltd) by arranging loan agreements that have the same effect as security but not in a form caught by the law (giving the examples of invoice discounting or factoring). On the other hand, Roy Goode and Riz Mokal have called for the floating charge simply to be abandoned altogether, in the same way as was recommended by the Minority of the Loreburn Report in 1906.|$|E

Key points The Government should: Conduct a revaluation of property for Council Tax purposes with a view to gradually transforming it into a national land and property value tax, following full modelling to identify difficulties and to inform its design. Ensure the Financial Policy Committee has the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> introduce <b>mortgage</b> credit controls, and that the housing market as a whole is monitored as a threat to wider economic stability. Monitor the FSA’s new <b>mortgage</b> rules <b>to</b> ensure they do not unnecessarily exclude low risk borrowers from the housing market, collecting the necessary data to do this and formally reviewing the rules after three years. Introduce a more effective safety net for home-owners that shares responsibility fairly between home-owners, lenders and government.

40|$|In passing Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, Congress has {{effectively}} invalidated certain important provisions of existing farm mortgages. Equally significant, Congress has disabled farmers from granting binding mortgages on the full, {{value of their}} property. Although no court is likely to find the Chapter to violate the fifth amendment, the Chapter constitutes a substantial and retroactive alteration {{of the rights of}} existing mortgagees and a restriction on the powers of prospective mortgagors to grant valid mortgages. The thesis of this paper is that Congress was both wrong and shortsighted in its enactment of Chapter 12. Congress was wrong to enact a law that redistributes wealth from existing mortgagees to existing mortgagors. Congress was shortsighted to enact a law that will have the long-run consequence of diminishing the farm debtor 2 ̆ 7 s <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> his land and, thus, his capacity to buy credit...|$|E
