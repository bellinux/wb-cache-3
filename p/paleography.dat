5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{of several}} sites in Tamil Nadu and Kerala have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as {{different kinds of}} pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as stratigraphy and <b>paleography</b> have helped establish the date of these items to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the <b>paleography</b> on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E
25|$|John Meade Falkner (1858–1932), arms {{manufacturer}} and novelist. Lived in Durham from 1902, and became Honorary Reader in <b>Paleography</b> at the University of Durham, and Honorary Librarian to the Dean and Chapter Library of Durham Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|The New Testament books {{appear to}} have been {{completed}} within the 1st century. The original manuscripts of the New Testament books have not survived. The autographs were lost or destroyed a long time ago. What survives are copies of the original. Generally speaking, these copies were made centuries after the originals from other copies rather than from the autograph. <b>Paleography,</b> a science of dating manuscripts by typological analysis of their scripts, is the most precise and objective means known for determining the age of a manuscript. Script groups belong typologically to their generation; and changes can be noted with great accuracy over relatively short periods of time. Dating of manuscript material by a radiocarbon dating test requires that {{a small part of the}} material be destroyed in the process; it is less accurate than dating from <b>paleography.</b> Both radiocarbon and paleographical dating only give a range of possible dates, and it is still debated just how narrow this range might be. Dates established by radiocarbon dating can present a range of 10 to over 100 years. Similarly, dates established by <b>paleography</b> can present a range of 25 to over 125 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{discipline}} involves surveying, excavation {{and eventually}} {{analysis of data}} collected {{to learn more about}} the past. In broad scope, archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research. It draws upon anthropology, history, art history, classics, ethnology, geography, geology, literary history, linguistics, semiology, textual criticism, physics, information sciences, chemistry, statistics, paleoecology, <b>paleography,</b> paleontology, paleozoology, and paleobotany.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, Beneshevich was {{appointed}} extraordinary professor, and, shortly thereafter ordinary professor of Byzantine history. He also lectured extensively on <b>paleography,</b> and, from 1906 onwards, {{on the history}} of canon law at the University's faculty of law, at the St. Petersburg Theological Academy (19061909), at the summit of women's courses (19091917), at the Raeva (19101911), and at the Military Academy of Law (19091912).|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Li Xueqin {{moved to}} the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (later of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences). In the 1950s, he {{systematically}} collated Shang dynasty oracle bones excavated from Yinxu, studied the events and historical geography from the oracle scripts, and identified oracle bones from the Western Zhou period. In the late 1950s, he studied the bronze inscriptions, pottery inscriptions, seals, coins, bamboo and wooden slips, and silk texts from the Warring States period, facilitating {{the formation of a}} new branch of Chinese <b>paleography.</b>|$|E
25|$|During 1866, Brasseur de Bourbourg had an {{opportunity}} to examine an artefact in Madrid which was in the possession of a Spanish <b>paleography</b> professor named Juan de Tro y Ortolano, who had purchased it some six years earlier. This artefact was an old codex, a book made from paper-bark {{in the form of a}} folded screen of continuous pages, several metres in length when extended. The codex contained numerous signs and drawings, which Brasseur de Bourbourg was readily able to identify as being Mayan in origin, having seen and studied many similar markings and glyphs while in Central America.|$|E
25|$|After the Second World War, Novak {{continued}} teaching Yugoslav {{history and}} methodology {{of history at}} the Belgrade University. He was later elected to membership of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU; corresponding member in 1948 and full member in 1961) and was made head of the Department for Social Sciences of the Academy (1966–69). Novak was among founders and first director of the History Institute of SANU (Istorijski institut SANU) from 1947 to 1954. He was also praised for his books on Latin <b>paleography,</b> which are considered to be seminal works on the subject in Serbian historiography.|$|E
25|$|Nhu {{completed}} a bachelor's degree in literature in Paris and then studied <b>paleography</b> and librarianship, {{graduating from the}} École Nationale des Chartes, an archivists' school in Paris. He returned to Vietnam from France at the outbreak of World War II. He was influenced by personalism, a concept he had acquired in the Latin Quarter. It had been conceived in the 1930s by Catholic progressives such as Emmanuel Mounier. Mounier's heirs in Paris, who edited the left wing Catholic review Esprit denounced Nhu as a fraud. Personalism blamed liberal capitalism for the Great Depression and individualistic greed and exploitation, and disagreed with communism due to its opposition to spirituality.|$|E
25|$|The Turkic runiform scripts, {{unlike other}} typologically close scripts of the world, {{do not have}} a uniform palaeography as, for example, have the Gothic runes, noted for the {{exceptional}} uniformity of its language and <b>paleography.</b> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the Orkhon version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the Göktürks from the 8th century to record the Old Turkic language. It was later used by the Uyghur Empire; a Yenisei variant is known from 9th-century Kyrgyz inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and the Old Hungarian script of the 10th century.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, two further {{handwriting}} {{analyses of}} the Mar Saba MS were undertaken by two Greek graphologists {{at the behest of}} Biblical Archaeology Review. The first, Venetia Anastasopoulou, a forensic handwriting expert witness with experience in many Greek court cases, compared the Mar Saba photos with known samples of Morton Smith's Greek handwriting, and concluded that it was most probably not written by Morton Smith. However the second graphologist, Agamemnon Tselikas, a paleographer, director of the National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation and also of the Mediterranean Research Institute for <b>Paleography,</b> Bibliography and History of Texts, concluded it was a 20th-century forgery of 18th century script, and that the most likely forger was either Smith or someone in Smith's employ.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} academic {{debate over the}} real chronology of the chapters of the Quran. Carole Hillenbrand holds that there are several remaining tasks for the Orientalist Quranic scholars: Few Quranic scholars have worked on the epigraphy of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem whose foundation inscription dates to 72/692 and the antique Quran recently discovered in the Yemen, the Sana'a manuscripts. The Carbon-14 tests applied to this Quran date its parchment to 645-690 AD with 95 percent accuracy. Their real age {{may be a good}} deal younger, since C-14 estimates the time of growth of an organism, and the process from that to the final writing on the parchment involves an unknown amount of time, and parchments were also re-used often. <b>Paleography</b> has dated the San'a manuscripts to 690-750 AD.|$|E
25|$|Bianu's {{other key}} work was the three-volume Catalogul manuscriselor românești din Biblioteca Academiei, written {{with two other}} authors and {{published}} between 1907 and 1931. Bianu published {{a number of other}} books on early Romanian literature as well as textual editions, including Psaltirea Scheiană and, in 1924, the newly discovered Codicele de la Ieud. His close analysis of manuscripts and contributions to <b>paleography</b> through his study of the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet identify him as a historian; he also involved himself in disputes with Slavists over the publishing of historical sources—whether they should follow the interests of linguists or cater to historians. From 1926, he organized bibliophile exhibits at the Bellu House, on Academy grounds. Additionally, Bianu was responsible for Creșterea Colecțiunilor, the Academy's bibliographic periodical, which between 1906 and 1929 chronicled the publications received by the library. His colleagues there included Ilarie Chendi, Septimiu Albini, Alexandru Sadi-Ionescu, Vasile Pârvan, Alexandru Lapedatu, George Giuglea, George Murnu, Nicolae Cartojan, Alexandru Obedenaru, Constantin Moisil and Ioachim Crăciun.|$|E
500|$|This section {{consists}} of a single chapter regarding the treatment, classification, annotation, {{and other aspects of}} working with manuscripts and related documentation. Wellek and Warren describe tasks such as authenticating manuscripts and establishing an author and date as important ones without which [...] "critical analysis and historical understanding would be hopelessly handicapped"; however, these tasks should be preliminary to the [...] "ultimate task of scholarship", analysis, and not a goal in themselves. Wellek and Warren note the importance of identifying forgeries, a task which can be completed in numerous ways: <b>paleography,</b> bibliography, linguistics, and history may all be involved. These forgeries may spark further investigation and literary debates which can result in {{a better understanding of the}} period, the writer, or the writer's oevre.|$|E
500|$|After {{that the}} second bone {{inscription}} remained undeciphered until 2010, when Irving Finkel worked on it. In that same year the British Museum held a conference dedicated to the artifacts. Based on the serious textual errors in the inscription, including the omission {{of a large number}} of signs from the Cyrus Cylinder, Wu Yuhong argued the inscriptions were most likely copied from the cylinder while housed in the British Museum or from an early modern publication based upon it. However he acknowledged the remote possibility it was copied in late antiquity. Irving Finkel disputed this conclusion based on the relative obscurity of the Cyrus Cylinder until recent decades and the mismatch in <b>paleography</b> between the bone inscriptions and the hand copies found in early editions from the 1880's.|$|E
500|$|A {{few other}} coins that contain a {{portrait}} and a legend have been unearthed; a coin assigned to certain Kuttuvan Kotai with his portrait and the legend [...] "Kuttuvan Kotai" [...] is notable for {{the occurrence of}} the [...] "pulli" [...] in the legend. Based on <b>paleography</b> of the script, it has been assigned a date of the late 1st century to early 2nd century AD. A coin belonging to 100 AD with the legend [...] "Kollipurai" [...] and a full-body portrait of a warrior has been assigned to the king Kopperum Cheral Irumporai, as {{he was known as}} the victor of Kolli in literature. Another coin of roughly the same period of 100 AD with the legend [...] "Kolirumporaiy" [...] and a warrior portrait has been found; it has not been assigned to a single king, but based on the legend, there are at least six Chera kings who could be associated with it.|$|E

2500|$|Since its {{existence}} became widely known, the codex {{has been studied}} by many scholars and amateurs, but none has succeeded in providing a widely accepted convincing translation or interpretation of the text. [...] It was studied by the Hungarian scholar Ferenc Toldy around 1840, and later by Pál Hunfalvy and by the Austrian <b>paleography</b> expert Albert Mahl. [...] Josef Jireček and his son, Konstantin Josef Jireček, both university professors in Prague, studied 32 pages of the codex in 1884–1885. In 1885 the codex was sent to Bernhard Jülg, a professor at Innsbruck University. Mihály Munkácsy, the celebrated Hungarian painter, took the codex with him to Paris in the years 1890–1892 to study it.|$|E
2500|$|Mainstream Slavists, {{including}} Dmitri Likhachev, and Turkologists criticized Az i Ya, characterizing Suleymenov's etymological and <b>paleography</b> conjectures as amateurish. Linguists such as Zaliznyak {{pointed out}} that certain linguistic elements in Slovo dated from the 15th or 16th centuries, when the copy of the original manuscript (or of a copy) had been made. They noted this was a normal feature of copied documents, as copyists introduce elements of their own orthography and grammar, as is known from many other manuscripts. Zaliznyak points out that this evidence constitutes another argument for the authenticity of Slovo. [...] An anonymous forger {{would have had to}} imitate not only very complex 12th century orthography and grammar but also to introduce fake complex traces of the copying in the 15th or 16th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inability}} {{to find a}} manuscript in Copenhagen after Bertram's death provoked some questions as to its validity. In 1827, John Hodgson fully rejected the text as spurious on account of its absence from Bertram's papers in Copenhagen, errors in the [...] "extract"’s <b>paleography,</b> and the work's highly unusual Latin style. Enough doubts had arisen by 1838 that the English Historical Society declined to include The Description of Britain in its list of important historical works. In 1846, the German scholar Karl Wex conclusively proved at least some passages of the Description were completely spurious. He {{had been working on}} a new edition of Tacitus's Agricola and, consulting the Description, he recognized that it included transcription errors which had been introduced to editions of Tacitus by Venetian printers in the late 15th century. His work was translated into English by Poste and printed by the Gentleman's Magazine in October 1846.|$|E
2500|$|The Codex was {{originally}} solely pictorial in nature. [...] Nahuatl descriptions and details were then entered onto the documents during its review by Spanish authorities, and a Spanish {{translation of the}} Nahuatl was added. The Nahuatl text was translated by Ignacio M. Castillo and the Spanish <b>paleography</b> rendered into modern Spanish by María del Carmen Camacho. [...] The pictorial on folio 471v (p.198 of the Mexican edition) shows the Viceroy Don Luis de Velasco, with indigenous lords in colonial attire for their rank, {{as well as a}} nahuatlato or Nahuatl translator in Spanish attire. The illustration is the cover for Charles Gibson (historian)'s monumental publication, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule. Other important pictorials include depictions of Spaniards punishing indigenous (folio 474v, page 204), lists of encomienda holders, including ones reverting to the Spanish crown (folios 496v - 498r; pages 250-253); cultivation of cacti for the production of the red dye cochineal (folio 500v, p.258), and indigenous men laboring in a textile workshop or obraje (folio 500v, p.258). The last pictorial is of indigenous men laboring to extract and transport stone {{for the construction of a}} church (folio 501 v., p.342), with a written complaint that they had not been paid.|$|E
60|$|Historical {{research}} and paleographic criticism {{will no doubt}} continue their demonstrations that the New Testament, like the Old, seldom tells a single story or expounds a single doctrine, and gives us often an accretion and conglomeration of widely discrete and even unrelated traditions and doctrines. But these disintegrations, though technically interesting to scholars, and gratifying or exasperating, {{as the case may}} be, to people who are merely defending or attacking the paper fortifications of the infallibility of the Bible, have hardly {{anything to do with the}} purpose of these pages. I have mentioned the fact that most of the authorities are now agreed (for the moment) that the date of the birth of Jesus may be placed at about 7 B.C.; but they do not therefore date their letters 1923, nor, I presume, do they expect me to do so. What I am engaged in is a criticism (in the Kantian sense) of an established body of belief which has become an actual part of the mental fabric of my readers; and I should be the most exasperating of triflers and pedants if I were to digress into a criticism of some other belief or no-belief which my readers might conceivably profess if they were erudite Scriptural paleographers and historians, in which case, by the way, they would have to change their views so frequently that the gospel they received in their childhood would dominate them after all by its superior persistency. The chaos of mere facts in which the Sermon on the Mount and the Ode to Charity suggest nothing but disputes as to whether they are interpolations or not, in which Jesus becomes nothing but a name suspected of belonging to ten different prophets or executed persons, in which Paul is only the man who could not possibly have written the epistles attributed to him, in which Chinese sages, Greek philosophers, Latin authors, and writers of ancient anonymous inscriptions are thrown at our heads as the sources of this or that scrap of the Bible, is neither a religion nor a criticism of religion: one does not offer the fact that a good deal of the medieval building in Peterborough Cathedral was found to be flagrant jerry-building as a criticism of the Dean's sermons. For good or evil, we have made a synthesis out of the literature we call the Bible; and though the discovery that there is a good deal of jerry-building in the Bible is interesting in its way, because everything about the Bible is interesting, it does not alter the synthesis very materially even for the paleographers, and does not alter it at all for those who know no more about modern <b>paleography</b> than Archbishop Ussher did. I have therefore indicated little more of the discoveries than Archbishop Ussher might have guessed for himself if he had read the Bible without prepossessions.|$|E
