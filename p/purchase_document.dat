50|$|The largest area of Jewish owned {{property}} in the city was the cemetery. The cemetery had been used since about 1270 and is first mentioned in a <b>purchase</b> <b>document</b> from 1300. Until 1333 when Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian expanded the city, the cemetery lay outside the city walls. It bordered on some gardens of Saint Bartholomew's Cathedral and was walled very early in its history. In 1349, during a Succession Crisis for the Holy Roman Emperor, the city of Frankfurt declared for Günther von Schwarzburg against Charles IV. When they expected an attack from Charles, the Jewish Cemetery was fortified with eleven oriel windows. Later, in 1388 during a war between Swabia and the Salzburg Archbishop, the cemetery was again fortified.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze the influences of service quality, product quality and perceived value on the satisfaction and loyalty of the customers of Perhutani wood industry, the level of customer satisfaction and loyalty and managerial implications. Four data analysis techniques were used including the structural equation modeling partial least squares (SEMPLS) with 24 exogenous latent variable attributes and 6 endogenous latent variable attributes; CSI, CLI and IPA. SEMPLS results showed that the variables of service quality (T-statistic= 2, 79 *>T-table= 1, 96) and product quality (T-statistic= 6, 45 *>T-table= 1, 96) significantly influence the satisfaction of the customers of Perhutani wood industry. Perceived value variable (T-statistic= 0, 65 <T-table= 1, 96) doesn’t influence significantly in the form of customers satisfaction. Customer satisfaction (T-statistic= 1, 53 <T-table= 1, 96) does not significantly influence the customer loyalty. The data of CSI= 80, 85 % and CLI= 74, 12 % indicate the customers are satisfied and loyal to the service quality, product quality, and perceived value provided by Perhutani wood industry.

On the other hand, the concept of territory seen as group, a community inheritance, can help with the construction of collective projects to prevent deterritorialization...|$|R
