40|$|THE {{reaction}} of purines with <b>polycyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> was first {{revealed by the}} demonstration of the solubilizing effect which aqueous solutions of caffeine, theophylline, theobromine and xanthine exerted on benzo(a) -pyrene (3, 4 -benzopyrene) by Brock, Druckrey and Hamperl (1938). Weil-Malherbe (1946 a) made detailed quantitative investigations which showed that {{a wide range of}} purines exerted this solubilizing action towards many different <b>polycyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Other carcinogenic compounds shown to be brought into solution by purines include certain carcinogenic aromatic amines (Neish, 1948) and various dibenzocarbazoles and dibenzacridines (Booth and Boyland, 1953). The solubilities of <b>polycyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in most aqueous purine solutions, though greater than in water, are still small and hence difficult to estimate directly. Since many of these hydrocarbons are highly fluorescent, the availability of the Aminco-Bowman spectrophotofluorimeter provided a simple and sensitive method for the direct study of very dilute solutions of <b>polycyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The interaction of benzopyrene and other <b>polycyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with various purines has been re-investigated with the aid of this instrument. Previous work in this laboratory has shown that nucleic acids will also solubilize benzopyrene (Booth, Boyland, Manson and Wiltshire, 1951) and certain dibenzocarbazoles and dibenzacridines (Booth and Boyland, 1953). It was hoped to obtain some insight into possible mechanisms of interaction of the <b>polycyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with nucleic acids from a study of the purines and pyrimidines themselves. The direct studies of hydrocarbon-nucleic acid interaction will be described in a succeeding paper...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> {{aromatic}} <b>hydrocarbons</b> are oxidation {{products of}} <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> {{but have not}} been studied as extensively as <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Several studies have however shown that hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> have toxic and carcinogenic properties. They have been detected in air samples in semi urban areas and combustion {{is assumed to be}} the primary source of those compounds. To better understand the formation and occurrence of particulate hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> from residential wood log stove combustion, 9 hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and 2 hydroxy biphenyls were quantified in particles generated from four different types of wood logs (birch, spruce, pine, aspen) and two different combustion conditions (nominal and high burn rate). A previously developed method utilizing liquid chromatography photo ionization tandem mass spectrometry and pressurized liquid extraction was used. <b>Polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> were analyzed along with hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions varied significantly across different wood types and burning conditions; the highest emissions for nominal burn rate were from spruce and for high burn rate from pine burning. Emissions from nominal burn rate corresponded on average to 15 % of the emissions from high burn rate, with average emissions of 218 mu g/MJ(fuel) and 32. 5 mu g/MJ(fuel) for high burn rate and nominal burn rate, respectively. Emissions of the measured hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> corresponded on average to 28 % of <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> emissions. This study shows that wood combustion is a large emission source of hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and that not only combustion conditions, but also wood type influences the emissions of hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons.</b> There are few studies that have determined hydroxylated <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> in emissions from wood combustion, and it is therefore necessary to further investigate the formation, occurrence and distribution of these compounds as they are present in significant amounts in wood smoke particles...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The {{biodegradability}} of <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as naphthalene, fluorene, anthracene and phenanthrene by a halotolerant bacterial consortium {{isolated from}} marine environment was investigated. The <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> degrading bacterial consortium was enriched from mixture saline water samples collected from Chennai (Port of Chennai, salt pan), India. The consortium potently degraded <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (> 95 %) at 30 g/L of sodium chloride concentration in 4 days. The consortium {{was able to}} degrade 39 to 45 % of different <b>polycyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> at 60 g/L NaCl concentration. Due to increase in salinity, the percent degradation decreased. To enhance <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> degradation, yeast extract was added as an additional substrate at 60 g/L NaCl concentration. After the addition of yeast extract, the consortium degraded> 74 % of <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> at 60 g/L NaCl concentration in 4 days.

These rapidly appearing chromosomal changes may be important in cell transformation by <b>polycyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> -J Natl Cancer Inst 49 : 585 - 590, 1972.
