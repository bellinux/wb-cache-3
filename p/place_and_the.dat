5|$|After a {{short period}} of {{occupation}} duty, the 44th Infantry Division returned to the United States in July 1945 where it began training for deployment to the Pacific Theater. As part of Operation Coronet it was intended that Dean would lead the division during the planned invasion of Honshū, but the war came to an end before this took <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> operation was subsequently cancelled. Dean then oversaw the drawdown of the division until he was relieved of command on November 1, 1945. The 44th Infantry Division was disbanded {{by the end of that}} month.|$|E

5|$|As Danielle tracked westward {{into the}} open Atlantic early on August14, the storm {{encountered}} warmer water southwest of Cape Verde and began to gradually intensify, becoming a moderate tropical storm with 50mph (85km/h) winds that morning. At that point, a bout of rapid intensification began to take <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> storm was upgraded to Hurricane Danielle that evening as an eye began to form. Over a 24‑hour period ending {{in the morning of}} August15, the pressure fell from 1004 to 978mbar and the winds increased to 90mph (145km/h), making it a high-end Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E

5|$|Compounding {{the loss}} of men to {{reinforce}} 21st Army Group, on 3 July the 115th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn from the division. The brigade was earmarked for an operation to liberate the Channel Islands and was re-designated Force 135. Ultimately such an operation did not take <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> brigade was deployed to mainland Europe. During August, the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division began to disperse. On 15 August, the divisional headquarters ceased commanding any subordinate units {{and by the end}} of the month the division was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Drivers had two hours, split {{over two}} days, Friday and Saturday, to {{register}} the fastest possible time. The driver who could register the fastest time would start on pole position, giving them a headstart of eight metres over the second-fastest driver, who started {{on the opposite side}} of the track. Third place would start eight metres behind the second-fastest driver and on the side of the track where the first placed car is.

5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria.

The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room.

5|$|Kudos Film and Television {{developed}} Spooks after releasing Channel 4 medical drama Psychos in 1999, {{though the}} company initially faced friction from television networks which saw no potential in a post-Cold War spy show. The producers later successfully pitched the series to the BBC after the networks' commissioning teams were replaced. Four episodes were being written when the September 11 attacks took <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> some scenes were rewritten to take the event into account to show the audience Spooks's goal of fighting terrorism. Throughout production, the producers were advised by former intelligence officers from the Security Service, KGB and Central Intelligence Agency. Filming took place from November 2001 to March 2002.|$|E

Filming at Platform 9¾ took place at King's Cross Station, {{as it has in}} the past. A telephone booth near Scotland Yard was used as Harry and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry, while the crew closed the Westminster tube station on 22 October 2006 to allow for filming of Arthur Weasley accompanying Harry to his trial at the Ministry of Magic. Other scenes were filmed in and around Oxford, specifically at nearby Blenheim Palace in Woodstock.|$|E

5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> story is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps.

5|$|Six {{weeks from}} {{theatrical}} release, no dubbing had taken <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> score {{had not been}} written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene, leaving Horner to rewrite the music. As Gale Hurd {{did not have much}} music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the film back four weeks so he could finish the score. Horner felt that, given more time, he could get the score to 100% of his satisfaction rather than the 80% he estimated {{he had been able to}} achieve. The score was recorded in roughly four days. Despite his troubles, Horner received an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score.|$|E
