40|$|The {{aluminium}} electrolysis {{process is}} an energy-intensive alumina reduction process {{which is more}} and more suffering under the high energy cost. Under these conditions, power could become a trading asset for the aluminium industry. Partly, actual power contracts contain clauses for power supply reduction and buyback, which have to be carefully considered with regard to the compatibility of the pot technology, i. e. not harming pot life in the long term compared to making gains on the power market in the short term. To better understand the thermal and chemical impact in a pot during power cut back or modulation a dynamic lump model was used as cell simulator to predict the pot behaviour based on a 3 -hour shutdown measurement. After calibration of the thermal and chemical response of the pot in the model, the model shows good agreement with the measurement data and allows to investigate temperature development, sludge formation, alumina solubility and changes of acidity during power shortage. With this tool an optimised <b>pot</b> <b>setting</b> and preparation can be established to avoid sludging during power shortening and an anode effect after power up...|$|E

50|$|In his January 18, 2007 column, Nestor U. Torre {{expressed}} {{that the game}} show makes it so difficult for its players to win big because it’s based on sheer luck, with a player’s fate being sealed by the choice he makes of a particular briefcase to place his hopes on {{at the start of}} the game. He cited that another major factor that reduces players’ winnings is the “greed” motive that pushes contestants to reject already substantial deals from the show’s resident “banker,” because they want to make even more money by pushing the game into the next round. However, Torre does recognize that subsequent contestants were the first to benefit from the game show’s beefed-up top prize and will bring new excitement in everyone involved—the contestants, the studio audience, and the host. He mentioned that the move to double the game’s <b>pot</b> <b>sets</b> the show apart from other game programs, many of which offer a couple of million pesos in potential top winnings.

40|$|A set {{of seven}} single {{junction}} thermal converter Micropotentiometers (μ Pots) has been constructed at the National Institute for Standards (NIS), Egypt. This set {{has been built}} to cover the low ac voltage ranges from 2 mV to 200 mV at frequencies from 40 Hz up to 20 kHz. The construction of the μ <b>Pots</b> <b>set</b> has been presented and an adopted calibration method has been performed as well.

The scaling procedures have been carried out in sequential steps starting from the calibration of the 200 mV- μ pot by using DMM that is accurately calibrated at its 200 mV ac voltage range down to 2 mV- μ Pot. Furthermore, a new automatic calibration system has been established to achieve the scaling procedures. This system has been specially designed using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) software to overcome the deficiencies of manual methods. The automatic calibration has been investigated of all m Pots at different frequencies.

The first day, I was excused from entering on the duties of my office, on account of sea-sickness; but, the next morning, I set about the work in good earnest. We had a long passage, and my situation was not very pleasant. The schooner was wet, and the seas she shipped would put out my fire. There was a deck load of shingles, and I soon discovered that these made excellent kindling wood; but it was against the rules of the craft to burn cargo, and my friend the mate had bestowed a few kicks on me before I learned to make the distinction. In other respects, I did tolerably well; and, at the end of about ten days, we entered Sandy Hook.|$|R

40|$|The use of biochar as an {{agricultural}} soil improvement was tested in acid sulfate and sandy soils from Malaysia, cropped with rice and corn. Malaysia has {{an abundance of}} waste rice husks {{that could be used}} to produce biochar. Rice husk biochar was produced in a gasifier at a local mill in Kelantan as well as in the laboratory using a controlled, specially designed, top lift up draft system (Belonio unit). Rice husk biochar was applied once to both soils at two doses (2 % and 5 %), in a <b>pot</b> <b>set</b> up that was carried out for two cropping seasons. Positive and significant crop yield effects were observed for both soils, biochars and crops. The yield effects varied with biochar type and dosage, with soil type and over the cropping seasons. The yield increases observed for the sandy soil were tentatively attributed to significant increases in plant-available water contents (from 4 %– 5 % to 7 %– 8 %). The yield effects in the acid sulfate soil were likely a consequence of a combination of (i) alleviation of plant root stress by aluminum (Ca/Al molar ratios significantly increased, from around 1 to 3 – 5) and (ii) increases in CEC. The agricultural benefits of rice husk biochar application to Malaysian soils holds promise for its future use...|$|R

40|$|My {{starting}} point for this paper is a Victorian jug, bowl and chamber-pot set, that I encountered displayed in the toilet of a small Yorkshire Museum. The story of this set is the framework for an exploration of literature on how we invest personal, domestic possessions with meaning. Before starting its life in the museum, the jug, bowl and chamber <b>pot</b> <b>set</b> belonged {{to the secretary of}} the museum board. It was gifted to her by a friend 4 or 5 years ago, and she kept it in her bathroom, filled with potpourri, dried flowers and soaps. When she had her bathroom replaced, there was no longer enough surface space for displaying the set. She moved it into storage in the shed, where she still kept it on view to remind her that it needed a new home. Then she thought of putting it on display in the new museum toilet, on an old wooden cabinet she had in her conservatory. Her decision to move it out of her home and into the museum toilet was a creative and caring one, which triggered the washstand’s transformation from a personal possession, into a public historical artifact. The Victorian washstand set has an interesting -and in many ways ordinary- ‘life’ story, punctuated by transitions in meaning, value and purpose. By writing this paper I will ‘visit’ the most significant transitions, and use my visits as the basis for considering literature that discusses peoples’ relationships to their domestic possessions, and practices of keeping them that influence transitions in meaning. In particular, I am seeking instances where the physical and material properties of an object are discussed in relation to meaning-making. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Mars Exobiological Penetrator will be {{imbedded}} into several locations on the Martian surface. It contains various scientific instruments, {{such as an}} Alpha-Particle Instrument (API), Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), Evolved Gas Analyzer (EGA) and accelerometers. A sample is required for analysis in the API and DSC. To avoid impact contaminated material, this sample must be taken from soil greater than 2 cm away from the penetrator shell. This study examines {{the design of a}} dedicated sampling system including deployment, suspension, fore/after body coupling, sample gathering and placement. To prevent subsurface material from entering the penetrator sampling compartment during impact, a plug is placed in the exit hole of the wall. A U-lever device is used to hold this plug in the penetrator wall. The U-lever rotates upon initial motion of the core-grinder mechanism (CGM), releasing the plug. Research points to a combination of coring and grinding as a plausible {{solution to the problem of}} dry drilling. The CGM, driven by two compressed springs, will be deployed along a tracking system. A slowly varying load i. e., springs, is favored over a fixed displacement motion because of its adaptability to different material hardness. However, to accommodate sampling in a low density soil, two dash <b>pots</b> <b>set</b> a maximum transverse velocity. In addition, minimal power use is achieved by unidirectional motion of the CGM.
