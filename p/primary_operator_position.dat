40|$|We mainly {{study the}} Rényi entropy and {{entanglement}} entropy {{of the states}} locally excited by the descendent operators in two dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs). In rational CFTs, we prove that the increase of entanglement entropy and Rényi entropy for a class of descendent operators, which are generated by L^(-) L̅^(-) onto the <b>primary</b> <b>operator,</b> always coincide with the logarithmic of quantum dimension of the corresponding <b>primary</b> <b>operator.</b> That means the Rényi entropy and entanglement entropy for these descendent operators {{are the same as}} the ones of their corresponding <b>primary</b> <b>operator.</b> For 2 D rational CFTs with a boundary, we confirm that the Rényi entropy always coincides with the logarithmic of quantum dimension of the <b>primary</b> <b>operator</b> during some periods of the evolution. Furthermore, we consider more general descendent operators generated by ∑_ d_{n_i}{n_j}(∏_i L_-n_i∏_jL̅_-n_j) on the <b>primary</b> <b>operator.</b> For these operators, the entanglement entropy and Rényi entropy get additional corrections, as the mixing of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic Virasoro generators enhance the entanglement. Finally, we employ perturbative CFT techniques to evaluate the Rényi entropy of the excited operators in deformed CFT. The Rényi and entanglement entropies are increased, and get contributions not only from local excited operators but also from global deformation of the theory.
