50|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{improving}} labor safety and labor conditions for the miners, the company “Saknakhshiri” has purchased new equipment of $3.5 million. New wagons, bulldozers, locomotives - {{part of the new}} equipment is already located in the company yard… Schedule allocated for the mine technical re-equipment has shifted to the final stage.

This will virtually rebound the risk for miners, when conducting drilling and blasting works in mines, the mines will be mechanized, which is a step of utmost importance for improving labor safety and labor conditions.Mine monitoring, the company completed re-equipment descriptive works last year. According to the schedule, renewing and rehabilitation works will commence by the end of the year. The equipment purchased and imported for the current period of time exceeds the investment of $3 million. This is a major priority for the company and they believe this is a permanent process.

Six sets of locomotive batteries.In a series of accidents in 2010 and 2011, several workers were killed and injured in the Tkibuli coal mine, operated by the GIG subsidiary Saqnakhshiri. In January 2011, the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili accused the coal mine owners of neglecting safety norms and of covering up real reasons behind the incidents.

40|$|The {{well known}} problem {{of global warming}} due to the green house effect has {{provoked}} the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for a reduction of the CO 2 -emission, which first of all means energy saving. In colder regions the highest amount of energy is consumed by the heating of buildings. Beside a better insulation the diminishment of ventilation losses is a common way for saving energy. Unfortunately this {{increases the risk of}} mould growth. This mould growth is determined by the temperature and relative humidity of the inner wall surface. Because people have no feeling for inside rel. humidity, an appropriate ventilation system has to prevent surface conditions suited for mould. For energy saving purposes a permanent ventilation is no acceptable solution. Instead the ventilation has to take place subjected to unsteady humidification processes like cooking or bathing. The measurement of the surface temperature and humidity to control the ventilation is too expensive and needs continuous maintenance of the sensing elements. Instead the proposed innovative control system uses a thermal bridge, which is designed in such a way, that there dew water occurs just at the same time, when in problematic spaces like corners conditions for mould have been reached. The thermal bridge is equipped with a dew <b>point</b> <b>switch</b> switching the ventilator. Just when the condensation has stopped and the surface of this dew <b>point</b> <b>switch</b> has dried the ventilator will be deactivated. This ensures that the ventilation occurs only when required. Additional advantages are the simplicity and cheapness of this system combined with the lack of necessary service...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper proposes an {{asynchronous}} serialized link for NoC {{that can}} {{achieve the same}} levels of performance in terms of flits per second as a synchronous link but with a reduced number of wires in the point to <b>point</b> <b>switch</b> links and reduced power consumption. This is achieved by employing serialization in the asynchronous domain as opposed to synchronous to facilitate the removal of global clocking on the serial links. Based on transistor level simulations using 0. 12 µm foundry models {{it has been shown}} that it is possible to achieve the same level of performance as synchronous but with 75 % reduction in wires and 65 % reduction in power for a 300 MFlit/s link with 8 buffers with a switch clock speed of 300 MHz. Furthermore the paper presents the design requirements arising from interfacing switches of synchronous NoC and asynchronous serial links...|$|E

These are mainly used for train detection, transmission of information, broken train detection and transmission of return current. Especially, the return current is related to signal system, power system and catenary line, and track circuit systems. It {{is one of the most}} important component shall be dealt for the safety of track side staff and for the protection of railway-related electrical system according to electrification. Therefore, an accurate analysis of the return current is needed to prevent the return current unbalance and the system induced disorder and failure due to an over current condition. Also, if the malfunction occurred by the return current harmonics, it can cause problems including train operation interruption. In this paper, we presented measurement and analysis method at return current and it's harmonics by train operation. By the test criteria, w...|$|E

40|$|After the {{energetic}} renovation of old buildings (installation of air-tight windows) mould growth frequently occurs due to traditional ventilation habits. Mould on internal surfaces of external building elements {{can be a}} health risk for the residents. Adequate ventilation, intended to avoid mould growth, must avoid surface boundary conditions suited for mould growth. From {{the energetic}} point of view, forced permanent ventilation does not solve the problem. In this paper we will present a novel ventilation system - the dew <b>point</b> <b>switch</b> - in comparison to a ventilation system controlled by indoor relative humidity. This novel ventilation system {{is based on the}} idea to install an "artificial thermal bridge" at a selected point of the external wall with a switching dewing sensor on the internal surface. The investigations are executed in a test house with a bad insulation standard, located at the outdoor testing site of the IBP. Measuring sensors were installed at different places to determine temperature and humidity conditions as well as the energy consumption of the heating and the effectiveness of the ventilation system on the indoor climate. The test house is heated and, to comply with the requirement of a realistic moisture load, humidity is supplied to the room according to a humidity profile,which simulates a normal housing. The measurements show the influence of the different ventilation strategies on comfort, hygiene and energy demand...|$|E
40|$|Alternate realities have fascinated mankind {{since early}} {{prehistory}} {{and with the}} advent of the computer and the smartphone we have seen the rise of many different categories of alternate reality that seek to augment, diminish, mix with or ultimately replace our familiar real world in order to expand our capabilities and our understanding. This thesis presents parallel reality as a new category of alternate reality which further addresses the vacancy problem that manifests in many previous alternate reality experiences. Parallel reality describes systems comprising two environments that the user may freely switch between, one real and the other virtual, both complete unto themselves. Parallel reality is framed within the larger ecosystem of previously explored alternate realities through a thorough review of existing categorisation techniques and taxonomies, leading to the introduction of the combined Milgram/Waterworth model and an extended definition of the vacancy problem for better visualising experience in alternate reality systems. Investigation into whether an existing state of the art alternate reality modality (Situated Simulations) could allow for parallel reality investigation via the Virtual Time Windows project was followed by the development of a bespoke parallel reality platform called Mirrorshades, which combined the modern virtual reality hardware of the Oculus Rift with the novel indoor positioning system of IndoorAtlas. Users were thereby granted the ability to walk through their real environment and to at any <b>point</b> <b>switch</b> their view to the equivalent vantage point within an immersive virtual environment. The benefits that such a system provides by granting users the ability to mitigate the effects of the extended vacancy problem and explore parallel real and virtual environments in tandem was experimentally shown through application to a use case within the realm of cultural heritage at a 15 th century chapel. Evaluation of these user studies lead to the establishment of a number of best practice recommendations for future parallel reality endeavours...|$|E
