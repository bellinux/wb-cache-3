5|$|If an anaphylactoid {{reaction}} occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or {{slowed and}} antihistamines and other supportive care is administered. For example, a nebulised beta-agonist like salbutamol may be {{indicated in the}} event of significant bronchospasm (or prophylactically in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of bronchospasm secondary to acetylcysteine). It is also important to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the technical aspects, safety, and outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stent retriever in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> isolated M 2 occlusion who were included in 3 large multicenter prospective studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included patients from the Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization (STAR), Solitaire With the Intention For Thrombectomy (SWIFT), and Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME) studies, 3 large multicenter prospective studies on thrombectomy for ischemic stroke.

RESULTS We included 50 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> M 2 and 249 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> M 1 occlusion. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> M 2 occlusion were older (mean age, 71 versus 67 years; P =. 04) and had a lower NIHSS score (median, 13 versus 17; P <. 001) compared <b>with</b> those <b>with</b> <b>an</b> M 1 occlusion.

The survival rate is similar to that found with EBRT or surgery (radical prostatectomy), but with fewer side effects such as impotence and incontinence.

5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels {{faster than the}} coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E

30|$|The {{presence}} of an ARSA is a relatively rare anomaly, occurring in about 0.3 to 2.0 % {{of the general population}} [13, 16 – 18]. It is associated <b>with</b> <b>an</b> NRILN [14], as mentioned above. CT can be used to clearly detect an ARSA, which indicates the likely {{presence of}} an NRILN [14]. Most <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ARSA remain asymptomatic; however, 10 % of adult <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ARSA have compressive symptoms [19] such as dysphagia lusoria <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bayonet sign on upper GI series [20]. Moreover, 60 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ARSA also have a Kommerell diverticulum [21], which also can cause compressive symptoms [21 – 23]. NRILN has mainly been documented {{in the head and neck}} region; however, it has also been rarely reported in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> esophageal cancer, especially those undergoing thoracoscopic surgery [6, 24]. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> NRILN have a much higher possibility of iatrogenic vocal cord paralysis due to intraoperative injury of the recurrent nerve [18]. Thus, surgeons who perform esophagectomy must pay close attention to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ARSA and associated NRILN and the related complications that may occur.|$|R
