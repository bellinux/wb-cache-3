5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra {{is less than a}} third as wide as the ventral part; the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its surroundings, and by c. 1725 BC they {{constituted}} a sizable portion of the population.

5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today.

5|$|Because {{the basic}} fruit body {{structure}} in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family is essentially similar, Cyathus may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus {{that may have}} the hairy ectoperidium worn off. It distinguished from Nidula by the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.|$|E
