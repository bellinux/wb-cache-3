40|$|This thesis studies Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) in <b>process</b> <b>industries.</b> S&OP is a {{planning}} process {{which has a}} role of balancing demand and supply at an aggregate level. S&OP has traditionally been considered as a generic process meaning that it is independent from {{the context of the}} industry in which it is implemented. <b>Process</b> <b>industries</b> do; however, have specific characteristics which affect their planning and control processes, including S&OP. Therefore, the aim in this thesis is to reconcile these two contradictory stances and furthermore investigate how the specific properties in <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> should be included into an S&OP framework. Such a differentiated framework aims to support <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> to design/implement their S&OP process based on their unique requirements in relation to their markets, products and processes while it also takes into account the specific characteristics regarding the continuous production. Consequently, the <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> would realize the expected benefits from S&OP process to a greater extent. The study starts with a literature review on S&OP in <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> in order to build the knowledge foundation for subsequent studies. The results show that the underlying difference between <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> and discrete industries is the object continuity which affects the selection of production processes including resources. Thus, <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> are often hybrids in the sense that their production processes include both continuous production, when the transformed object (material) is continuous, and discrete production when the object (material) turns into discrete products after the discretization point. In other words, <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> deploy both continuous production and discrete production while discrete industries use only discrete production. The specific characteristics of <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> are actually related to the continuous production part and influence the planning processes as well. As the result of this study, the continuous production characteristics that can affect the S&OP process are identified. In the continuation of the thesis and in order to provide a typology for planning and control purposes, the object type (continuous and discrete) is combined with two other dimensions i. e. mode type (onetime, intermittent and continuous) and driver type (customer order driven and forecast driven) into {{a planning}} and control typology. The mode type addresses the repetitivity of the flow and the driver type takes into account the trigger of the flow. Each dimension has a transition point – i. e. the discretization point for the object type, mode interface point for the mode type and customer order decoupling point for the driver type – and represents a hybrid situation since different production environments are required before and after each transition point. The typology aims to illustrate how each dimension affects the planning and control issues as well as how the dimensions are interrelated and how this combination influence the managerial decisions. The typology integrates the concepts from both <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> and discrete industries and thus, is applicable for both. Thereafter the typology is applied to the S&OP process and an integrated framework is suggested based on the three dimensions with specific focus on <b>process</b> <b>industries.</b> In this framework, the effects of hybridities within each dimension and cross-hybridities between the dimensions on the S&OP process are also considered. The importance of hybridities and cross-hybridities {{lies in the fact that}} the planning of the hybrid systems is a complex task due to the varying managerial decisions before and after the transition points. Finally, implementation steps for the suggested S&OP framework are outlined for the <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> in order to position themselves in the framework, identify the implementing procedures, and obtain potential benefits based on the differentiated S&OP process...|$|R

In batch <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> it is difficult to predict the completion time, or makespan, of a set of jobs, because jobs interact at the shop floor. In this paper, we compare two different methods for predicting the makespan of job sets in batch <b>process</b> <b>industries.</b> The first method predicts the makespan of a job set by developing regression models, the second method by training neural networks. Both methods use aggregate job-set information. 1.

Plant performance is {{defined in terms of}} process changeover time, total shortages, and finished goods inventory. Two heuristics for revising the MPS are introduced and tested against a rolling horizon MPS that does not take sequence dependent changeovers into consideration. These two heuristics represent two different approaches to heuristic design: local interchange (SWAP) and global interchange (3 OPT). Simulation experiments are reported that test the performance of the two different approaches to revising the MPS in <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> with sequence dependent changeovers. The MPS designs were tested under plant conditions that are frequently encountered in <b>process</b> <b>industries.</b> The results indicate that revising the MPS in <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> sig-nificantly improves plant performance.

40|$|Production {{competence}} and competitive advantage in <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> New technological innovations and customer demands have forced <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> to adapt their traditional emphasis on operational efficiency and embrace the {{challenges faced by}} emergent manufacturers and service sectors. These will only be met if <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> are able to integrate disparate production-related functions to accommodate new technology. This paper investigates how production competence enhances technology-based competitive advantage in <b>process</b> <b>industries.</b> A survey of the literature and a preliminary study of 20 process firms raised {{a series of questions}} that were investigated further using two case studies. The analysis demonstrates that competitive advantage requires integration between operations, technology and asset management through matching production requirements with the inherent capability of equipment and an understanding of equipment of functionality. Production competence is acquired through a learning mindset, which relies on an investigation of critical unknowns. Competitive advantage derives from tacit knowledge, and complex interdependencies between novel technology and organisational elements, and is enhanced by informal exploration and testing...|$|R
