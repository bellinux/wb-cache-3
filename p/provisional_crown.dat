5|$|Andrew III of Hungary {{made his}} {{maternal}} uncle, Alberto Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in July 1299, stirring up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul Šubić, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II of Naples {{to send his}} grandson to Hungary to claim the throne in person. The king of Naples accepted the proposal and borrowed 1,300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles's journey. A Neapolitan knight of French origin, Philip Drugeth, accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles to Hungary. They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300. From Split, Paul Šubić escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Csák swore loyalty to Charles. Charles's opponent, AndrewIII of Hungary, died on 14January 1301. Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop-elect, Gregory Bicskei, crowned him with a <b>provisional</b> <b>crown</b> before 13May. However, most Hungarians considered Charles's coronation unlawful because customary law required {{that it should have}} been performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár.|$|E
5|$|With Andrew III's death, {{the male}} {{line of the}} House of Árpád became extinct, and a period of anarchy began. Charles Robert was crowned king with a <b>provisional</b> <b>crown,</b> but most lords and bishops refused to yield to him because they {{regarded}} him {{as a symbol of}} the Holy See's attempts to control Hungary. They elected king the twelve-year-old Wenceslaus of Bohemia, who was descended from Béla IV of Hungary in the female line. The young king could not consolidate his position because many lords, especially those who held domains in the southern region of the kingdom, continued to support Charles Robert. Wenceslaus left Hungary for Bohemia in mid-1304. After he inherited Bohemia in 1305, he abandoned his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{came to the}} Kingdom of Hungary {{upon the}} {{invitation}} of an influential Croatian lord, Paul Šubić, in August 1300. AndrewIII died on 14January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a <b>provisional</b> <b>crown</b> instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had no central government, the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch.

40|$|Objective This study {{compared}} the marginal gap, internal fit, fracture strength, and mode of fracture of CAD/CAM <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> {{with that of}} direct <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns.</b> Material and Methods An upper right first premolar phantom tooth was prepared for full ceramic crown following tooth preparation guidelines. The materials tested were: VITA CAD-Temp®, Polyetheretherketone “PEEK”, Telio CAD-Temp, and Protemp™ 4 (control group). The crowns were divided into four groups (n= 10), Group 1 : VITA CAD-Temp®, Group 2 : PEEK, Group 3 : Telio CAD-Temp, and Group 4 : Protemp™ 4. Each crown was investigated for marginal and internal fit, fracture strength, and mode of fracture. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software version 6. 0. Results The average marginal gap was: VITA CAD-Temp® 60. 61 (± 9. 99) µm, PEEK 46. 75 (± 8. 26) µm, Telio CAD-Temp 56. 10 (± 5. 65) µm, and Protemp™ 4 193. 07 (± 35. 96) µm (P 0. 05).

40|$|Background or Statement of Problem: As, the {{longevity}} of provisional restorations is related to, a perfect adaptation and a strong, long-term union between restoration and teeth structures, therefore, evaluation of marginal leakage of provisional restorative materials luted with cements using the standardized procedures is essential. Aims and Objectives: To compare the marginal leakage of the <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> fabricated from Autopolymerizing acrylic resin crowns and bisphenol A-glycidyl dimethacrylate (BIS-GMA) resin crowns. To compare the marginal leakage of the <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> fabricated from autopolymerizing acrylic resin crowns and BIS-GMA resin crowns cemented with different temporary luting cements. To compare the marginal leakage of the <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> fabricated from autopolymerizing acrylic resin (SC- 10) crowns cemented with different temporary luting cements. To compare the marginal leakage of the <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> fabricated from BIS-GMA resin crowns (Protemp 4) cemented with different temporary luting cements. Methodology: Freshly extracted 60 maxillary premolars of approximately similar dimensions were mounted in dental plaster. Tooth reduction with shoulder margin was planned to use a customized handpiece-holding jig. <b>Provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> were prepared using the wax pattern fabricated from computer aided designing/computer aided manufacturing milling machine following the tooth preparation. Sixty <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> were made, thirty each of SC- 10 and Protemp 4 and were then cemented with three different luting cements. Specimens were thermocycled, submerged in a 2 % methylene blue solution, then sectioned and observed under a stereomicroscope {{for the evaluation of}} marginal microleakage. A five-level scale was used to score dye penetration in the tooth/cement interface and {{the results of this study}} was analyzed using the Chi-square test, Mann–Whitney U-test, Kruskal–Wallis H-test and the results were statistically significant P < 0. 05 the power of study - 80 %. Results: Marginal leakage was significant in both <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> cemented with three different luting cements along the axial walls of teeth (P < 0. 05) confidence interval - 95 %. Conclusion: The temporary cements with eugenol showed more microleakage than those without eugenol. SC- 10 crowns showed more microleakage compared to Protemp 4 crowns. SC- 10 crowns cemented with Kalzinol showed maximum microleakage and Protemp 4 crowns cemented with HY bond showed least microleakage...|$|R
60|$|Whilst Henry was {{extending}} his conquests {{to the western}} limits of the known world, the whole fabric of his power was privately sapped and undermined, and ready to overwhelm him with the ruins, in the very moment when {{he seemed to be}} arrived at the highest and most permanent point of grandeur and glory. His excessive power, his continual accessions to it, and an ambition which by words and actions declared that the whole world was not sufficient for a great man, struck a just terror into all the potentates near him: he was, indeed, arrived at that pitch of greatness, that the means of his ruin could only be found in his own family. A numerous offspring, which is generally considered as the best defence of the throne, and the support as well as ornament of declining royalty, proved on this occasion the principal part of the danger. Henry had in his lawful bed, besides daughters, four sons, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, and John, all growing up with great hopes from their early courage and love of glory. No father was ever more delighted with these hopes, nor more tender and indulgent to his children. A custom had long prevailed in France for the reigning king to crown his eldest son in his lifetime. By this policy, in turbulent times, and whilst the principles of succession were unsettled, he secured the crown to his posterity. Henry gladly imitated a policy enforced no less by paternal affection than its utility to public peace. He had, during his troubles with Becket, crowned his son Henry, then no more than sixteen years old. But the young king, even on the day of his coronation, discovered an haughtiness which threatened not to content itself with the share of authority to which the inexperience of his youth and the nature of a <b>provisional</b> <b>crown</b> confined him. The name of a king continually reminded him that he only possessed the name. The King of France, whose daughter he had espoused, fomented a discontent which grew with his years. Geoffrey, who had married the heiress of Bretagne, on the death of her father claimed to no purpose the entire sovereignty of his wife's inheritance, which Henry, under a pretence of guardianship to a son of full age, still retained in his hands. Richard had not the same plausible pretences, but he had yet greater ambition. He contended for the Duchy of Guienne before his mother's death, which, alone could give him the color of a title to it. The queen, his mother, hurried on by her own unquiet spirit, or, as some think, stimulated by jealousy, encouraged their rebellion against her husband. The King of France, who moved all the other engines, engaged the King of Scotland, the Earl of Flanders, then a powerful prince, the Earl of Blois, and the Earl of Boulogne in the conspiracy. The barons in Bretagne, in Guienne, and even in England, were ready to take up arms in the same cause; whether it was that they perceived the uniform plan the king had pursued in order to their reduction, or were solely instigated by the natural fierceness and levity of their minds, fond of every dangerous novelty. The historians of that time seldom afford us a tolerable insight into the causes of the transactions they relate; but whatever were the causes of so extraordinary a conspiracy, it was not discovered until the moment it was ready for execution. The first token of it appeared in the young king's demand to have either England or Normandy given up to him. The refusal of this demand served as a signal to all parties to put themselves in motion. The younger Henry fled into France; Louis entered Normandy with a vast army; the barons of Bretagne under Geoffrey, and those of Guienne under Richard, rose in arms; the King of Scotland pierced into England; and the Earl of Leicester, at the head of fourteen thousand Flemings, landed in Suffolk.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the micro-hardness of an acrylic resin used for <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns.</b> Materials and methods: Five different processing techniques (direct and indirect) were assessed: (I) auto polymerizing resin in sandy stage; (II) auto polymerizing resin in plastic stage; (III) bead-brush technique; (IV) auto polymerizing resin under pressure; (V) heat-cured acrylic resin under pressure. Five specimens {{were made for}} each test group. For the initial micro-hardness test, the specimens were immersed in deionized water for 48 hours. For {{the analysis of the}} final micro-hardness, the specimens were subjected to pH-cycling to simulate the changes in the pH level which occur in the oral cavity. Results: Tests revealed that the micro-hardness was decreased after the pH-cycling. However, no statistical difference was found among the different types of acrylic resin polymerization techniques. Conclusion: It was concluded that the micro-hardness is not directly related to the polymerization technique for making <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of choice in cases of avulsed permanent teeth is the immediate reimplantation. However, this conduct does not always work favorably, either by failures in the initial approach or by inappropriate interventions. In this sense, {{the aim of this}} study is to present an alternative prosthetic rehabilitation with the use of orthodontic mini-implants in the anterior region. This case reports a ten-year-old child with history of avulsion of superior central incisors. The therapeutic approach was planned to promote physiological teeth contacts and acceptable esthetics and phonetics. First, the occlusal-gingival insertion of two orthodontic mini-implants was performed in the alveolar ridge, and, immediately after that, two <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> were attached to the implants. The interventions achieved satisfactory cosmetic and functional results. After one-year follow-up, the adjacent periodontal tissues remained without signs and/or symptoms of inflammation. The <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> presented no mobility and fractures. During radiographic examination, a healthy bone tissue appearance was observed. The simplicity of mini-implant installation makes them a promising alternative for temporary prosthetic rehabilitation of patients undergoing growth and development.

40|$|Many {{temporary}} cements are commercially available; therefore, it {{is necessary}} to indicate them for each clinical requirement with regard to the tensile strength of prosthetic retainers.

For that purpose, eighty human first premolars received full crown preparation with standardized height and taper. <b>Provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> were fabricated and luted with eight brands of temporary cements. Twenty four hours after cementation, the restorations were submitted to tensile strength test in a universal testing machine and the data submitted to ANOVA and Bonferroni tests. Mean tensile strength values ranged from 20. 1 N for Nogenol cement to 67. 5 N for Hydro C cement. Statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05) was found between Hydro C and the other groups, except for Temp Bond and Rely X Temp, which presented statistically significant difference when compared to Freegenol and Nogenol temporary cements.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} verify {{marginal}} fit {{and the effect}} of cement film thickness standardization on retention of <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> made with prefabricated acrylic cylinders on abutments, using two temporary luting agents subjected or not to mechanical cycling. <b>Provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> were made from bis-acryl (Luxatemp Fluorescence) or methyl methacrylate (Duralay) resins on acrylic cylinders and marginal fit and cement film thickness were evaluated. For retention evaluation, crowns were cemented with two temporary luting agents: non-eugenol zinc oxide (Tempbond NE) or calcium hydroxide-based (Hydcal) cements and subjected to tensile strength in a universal testing machine. After cleaning, debonded crowns were cemented again, subjected to mechanical cycling and retention was reassessed. The results of marginal fit and cement film thickness were analyzed by Student's t-test while retention of cements before and after mechanical cycling was analyzed using a mixed linear model. Methyl methacrylate crowns presented greater marginal misfit (p= 0. 001) and occlusal cement film thickness (p= 0. 003) than the bis-acryl ones. No difference was observed at axial cement film thickness (p= 0. 606). Resins (p= 0. 281) did not affect crown retention, but luting agents (p= 0. 029) and mechanical cycling (p= 0. 027) showed significant effects. The only significant interaction was mechanical cycling*luting agents, which means that luting agents were differently affected by mechanical cycling (p= 0. 002). In conclusion, the results showed that bis-acryl resin associated to calcium-hydroxide luting agent provided the best retention and lower cement thickness...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} is to assess the survival, {{marginal}} bone loss and complications around sing le-tooth implants on which immediate provisionalization was carried out. Patients and Methods: 78 implant were placed in 57 patients: 56 after extraction and 22 in healed sockets. Immediately after surgery <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> were delivered without contacts in both centric and excursive jaw movements. The final crowns were inserted between 3 to 6 months later. During the study there were 3 x-rays taken per patient. The marginal bone loss was measured and complications were recorded. The statistical analys is of the data was carried out with the STATA 10 ® software. Results: The mean duration of the study was 92 weeks. Survival rate was 98. 7 % (1 failure out of 78 implants). The mean mesial bone loss was 0. 2 ± 0. 4 mm and the mean distal bone loss was 0. 2 ± 0. 4 mm. No statistically significant diff erences were found between immediate or delayed implants. 67 implants sh owed a bone loss less than 1 mm, and 36 did not sh ow any bone loss at all. The main complications were the uncementing of the crowns (11 crowns), the presence of cement remnants (10 crowns) and the development of apical lesions around implants (6 implants). Conclusion: With the limitations of this study, it can be concluded by saying that immediate restoration with sing le-tooth implants and <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> may be cons idered as a predictable technique. © Medicina Oral S.

40|$|Background: Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{temporary}} abutments {{have been}} recently introduced for making implant-supported <b>provisional</b> single <b>crowns.</b> Little {{information is available}} in the dental literature on the durability of provisional implant-supported restorations. Purpose: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the fracture strength of implant-supported composite resin crowns on PEEK and solid titanium temporary abutments, and to analyze the failure types. Material and Methods: Three types of provisional abutments, RN synOcta Temporary Meso Abutment (PEEK; Straumann), RN synOcta Titanium Post for Temporary Restorations (Straumann), and Temporary Abutment Engaging NobRplRP (Nobel Biocare) were used, and <b>provisional</b> screw-retained <b>crowns</b> using composite resin (Solidex) were fabricated for four different locations in the maxilla. The specimens were tested in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute until fracture occurred. The failure types were analyzed and further categorized as irreparable (Type 1) or reparable (Type 2). Results: No significant difference was found between different abutment types. Only for the position of the maxillary central incisor, composite resin crowns on PEEK temporary abutments showed significantly lower (p < 0. 05) fracture strength (95 +/- 21 N) than those on titanium temporary abutments (1, 009 +/- 94 N).

The temperature was recorded during polymerization at 30 -s intervals until the peak temperature was reached. The same procedure was repeated for fabricating remaining <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns.</b> A total of 45 <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> were fabricated for each specimen. Results: Kruskal–Wallis test revealed that {{there was a significant difference}} in the temperature changes associated with the provisional restorative materials used. All the three provisional restorative materials were compared for 1. 2 mm and 1 mm wide finish line. Integrity produced the highest temperature rise and the maximum temperature recorded was 40. 2 °C in 1. 2 mm wide finish line. However, for a 1 mm wide finish line, Protemp- 4 produced the highest temperature rise and the maximum temperature recorded was 40. 3 °C. It was observed that peak temperatures with Specimen B were more when compared with Specimen A. Conclusion: Cool temp showed least temperature rise in the pulp chamber. The order of rise in intrapulpal temperature in tested provisional materials using direct technique would be Cool temp, Integrity, and Protemp- 4...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} case presentation {{demonstrates the}} successful {{use of a}} newly devel-oped oily calcium hydroxide suspension (OCHS) for root coverage. The patient presented with dental caries and severe generalized recession, and was treated with a combined periodontal/prosthetic treatment approach, using a laboratory-fabricated <b>provisional</b> <b>crown</b> and an OCHS {{in conjunction with a}} subepithelial connective tissue graft (SECTG). Six months following treatment, the final crown was delivered, and all teeth but the molar (ie, tooth # 3), which carried the <b>provisional</b> <b>crown,</b> showed 100 % root coverage and optimal healing. Learning Objectives: This article describes the use of an OCHS/SECTG approach to treat severe gingival recession. Upon completing this article, the reader should: • Better understand the etiology of gingival recession and a new method for root coverage. • Be aware of the clinical procedure used to deliver the OCHS/SECTG material.

40|$|PURPOSE The aim of {{this short}} {{communication}} was to analyze time-dependent changes of the supraimplant mucosa architecture in the esthetic zone. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five patients underwent single-tooth replacement with implant crowns in the anterior maxilla. The supraimplant soft tissue was conditioned with fixed <b>provisional</b> <b>crowns.</b> Quadrantlike digital impressions were taken with an intraoral optical scanning device at three time points: t 0, immediately after removal of the provisional (baseline); t 1, after 5 minutes; and t 2, after 10 minutes. To analyze time-dependent mucosal changes, the corresponding digital files were superimposed for each patient, and baseline (t 0) scans were compared with t 1 and t 2 scans, respectively. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for statistical calculations with a strict level of significance at P <. 01. RESULTS Mean values for supraimplant soft tissue changes were statistically significantly different after 5 minutes (5. 5...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:  A {{number of}} {{provisional}} restorative materials {{exist on the}} market. This study tested marginal fit and color stability of three provisional restorative materials and a control. Materials and Methods:  Two auto-cure materials, Protemp Garant and Integrity, and one dual-cure material, Luxatemp Solar, were tested against SNAP, a polyethyl methacrylate control. A maxillary right central incisor ivorine tooth was prepared for a full coverage all-ceramic crown, with a 1. 5 -mm chamfer margin. Four points were engraved at a point 1 mm below the facial, lingual, mesial, and distal margins, and replicas (n = 40) were produced by the manufacturer. <b>Provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> (n = 10 × 4) were fabricated on the individual replicas using a polyethylene coping template. The crowns were trimmed under magnification using an acrylic bur. The distance from the crown margins to a point tangent to the engraved markings was measured under 10 × magnification and recorded. For color stability, 10 -mm diameter × 2 -mm thick discs (n = 10 × 4) were fabricated and immersed cyclically in tea for 1 week in a Tucillo/Nielson apparatus. Color measurements were recorded for each specimen at baseline and after staining. ΔE values were calculated {{to determine the extent}} of the color change. Results:  The means of the four marginal discrepancy measurements for each specimen were analyzed using a 1 -way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc comparison. Luxatemp Solar had statistically significant marginal discrepancy (319 Μm, p < 0. 05) when compared to the other provisional materials. A significant color change (ΔE = 4. 33, p < 0. 05) was found for Protemp Garant. Conclusion:  The dual-cure temporary material (Luxatemp Solar) exhibited significantly more discrepancy at the margin than the auto-cure bis-acryl materials or acrylic control. Protemp Garant exhibited a clinically noticeable change in shade after 1 week in staining solution, whereas the other materials did not exhibit a clinically noticeable change. Clinical Implications:  <b>Provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> fabricated from SNAP, Protemp Garant, and Integrity exhibited similarly low marginal discrepancy. SNAP, Luxatemp Solar, and Integrity did not demonstrate a clinically detectable change in shade after 1 week in a staining solution...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{clinical study}} was to evaluate the changes in resonance frequency analysis (RFA), assessed by Osstell Mentor, obtaining information on the implant stability quotient (ISQ) during implants tissue integration for immediately loaded and non-loaded control implants. Materials and methods: A total of 40 implants, 20 implants with no immediate loading (control) and 20 immediately loaded implants (test), were placed in 15 patients. ISQ implants was evaluated at baseline and at 6 and 8 weeks. <b>Provisional</b> <b>crowns</b> were removed at 8 weeks, when the definitive restoration was placed. Data of control and test implants and maxillary and mandibular areas were statistically compared. Results: At 8 weeks, all implants were integrated {{and there were no}} major postoperative complications. A statistically significant difference was found only at baseline between test and control maxillary implants (p= 0. 009) but not at 6 or 8 weeks (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: Immediate loading procedures may be applied with primary stability ISQ values > 60 and inserted with a force of ≥ 30 N. The Osstell Mentor RFA may offer an objective method to determine when implant stability is adequate for immediate loading...|$|R
