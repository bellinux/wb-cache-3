40|$|AbstractThe current {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} control the root-knot nematode; Meloidogyne incognita infecting Thompson seedless grapevines by using eight treatments as follows: some bioagents (Trichoderma harzianum and Arbascular mycorrhizae), some <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> extracts (<b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> extract and jojoba <b>oil)</b> and <b>plant</b> aqueous extracts (Origanum majorana and Tagetes erecta) in comparison with oxamyl (24 % EC) on grapes infected with root-knot nematode to determine its impact on growth and yield of grapevines during two successive seasons (2009 and 2010) under field conditions. The chosen vines were 10 -year-old grown in a sandy soil in a private vineyard located in Alexandria-Cairo road, spaced at 1. 75 × 2. 75 m and irrigated by drip irrigation system where the cane was pruned and trellised by the Y shape system. Bioagents and plant aqueous extracts {{were added to the}} soil under the vines three times/week after bud burst. Results showed that all the treatments had a significant effect in reducing the total population and build up of root-knot nematodes, M. incognita in both soil and rots especially after the 3 months from the time of application. In addition they had increased the physical characteristics of both clusters and berries, vegetative growth parameters, macro nutrient content and yield of Thompson seedless grapevines during two studied seasons (2009 and 2010) under field conditions. Both jojoba <b>oil</b> and <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> extract were the most effective treatments in reducing total population and rate of build up of M. incognita in both soil and roots up to the harvesting time. They also increased cluster weight, number of clusters, yield per vine as well as enhancing the physical characteristics of berries, TSS % TSS/acidity ratio whereas, acidity was decreased in berry juice and improved vegetative growth parameters and increased the total surface area/vine, wood ripening coefficient, total chlorophyll and percentages of total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium of leaves. Data of root growth parameters showed that the extension of fine roots through the vertical direction (root density) expressed as length of the fine roots were significantly higher at (30 cm) depth in the soil profile, the horizontal extension of fine roots was more concentrated at the distance of (50 cm) from the vine trunk. All treatments recorded the highest values of medium roots and large roots in both horizontal and vertical directions as compared with the control but lower than oxamyl treatment. On the other hand, the treatments with bioagents (T. harzianum and A. mycorrhizae) were in the intermediate rank, whereas, treatments of plant aqueous extracts (O. majorana and T. erecta) were the least effective in both seasons. It can be concluded that jojoba <b>oil</b> and <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> extract were the best safe treatments compared with oxamyl (24 % EC) in reducing total population and rate of build up of root-knot nematodes, M. incognita and improving fruiting of vines yield and quality of the berries of Thompson seedless grapevines...|$|R

The toxicity of certain compounds: fenitrothion, super misrona, sour <b>orange</b> <b>oil,</b> acidless <b>orange</b> <b>oil,</b> and Bermectine in reducing the population density of P. mixta and C. vittata larvae infesting sugar beet was evaluated. The rate of infestation was higher in the sole sugar beet plants than in those intercropped with faba bean, maize and cabbage plants which caused reduction of sucking pests and P. mixta eggs in the two seasons. The intercropping of faba bean plants led to higher infestation rate of P. mixta larvae in the two seasons and C. vittata (larvae, pupae and adults) in the first season. The intercropping with maize led to a higher population density of Chrysoperla carnea, Paederus alfierii and Scymnus spp. in the two seasons. Low population density of true spiders was observed in sole sugar beet (control) when compared with faba bean, maize and cabbage plants intercropped in the two seasons. Concerning the obtained root yield, the intercropping with maize and cabbage plants reduced the resultant yield of sugar beet roots in the two seasons. Bermectine and fenitrothion were the most effective toxicants followed by super misrona and then, sour orange that induced the lowest reduction in P. mixta larvae.

However, the behavioural and biological adjustments of this response remain largely unknown. In the present study, the ovipositional responses of gravid female medflies to essential oils (i. e. the most critical resistance factor to medfly infestation) of various citrus fruits are investigated. In dual-choice (treatment versus distilled water control) experiments, females lay significantly more eggs into pre-punctured hollow oviposition hemispheres (domes) provided with 1 mu L of citrus peel <b>oil</b> from sweet <b>orange,</b> satsuma mandarin, bitter orange, grapefruit and lemon compared with odourless domes. No-choice tests show a weak effect of lemon essential oils in stimulating oviposition. The female ovipositional response to sweet <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> (the most active in eliciting oviposition) is dose-dependent. Additionally, limonene, the most abundant chemical in all citrus oils, stimulates oviposition, whereas linalool, a representative compound of immature citrus fruit associated with high toxicity against immature stages of fruit flies, has a significant deterrent effect. In further no-choice tests, females lay approximately 23 % fewer eggs in limonene (93 %) (amount found in <b>orange</b> <b>oil)</b> and 60 % fewer eggs in limonene 93 % plus linalool 3 % (approximately 10 -fold the amount found in <b>orange</b> <b>oil)</b> mixtures, relative to sweet <b>orange</b> <b>oil.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} limonene content accounts largely (but not completely) for the ovipositional responses observed in sweet <b>orange</b> <b>oil,</b> whereas high linalool proportions are capable of significantly masking and/or disrupting its stimulatory effects in citrus oils.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to compare the emission characteristics of 20 % <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> methyl ester and 80 % diesel in volumetric basis with Neat diesel in hemispherical combustion chamber and toroidal combustion chamber. Non-edible <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> is selected and utilized to prepare alternative fuel to be utilized in Diesel engine. The traditional method of transestrification is employed for preparation <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> methyl ester. The chemical properties of prepared methyl ester were determined using fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy method. Further its fuel properties were found based on American Society for Testing and Materials standards and compared with Neat diesel fuel properties. A compression ignition engine with electrical dynamometer test rig with gas analyzer has been used. It is observed that 1 % of NOx and 4 % of HC emission reduced in toroidal combustion chamber engine. However, smoke emission is found to be lower in hemispherical combustion chamber engine...|$|R
