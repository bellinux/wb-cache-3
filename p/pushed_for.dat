5|$|A {{movement}} by women arose from Seattle during the Depression. Fueled by Eleanor Roosevelt’s book It’s Up to the Women, women <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> recognition, {{not just as}} housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals Working Woman and The Woman Today, women pushed {{to be seen as}} equal and receive some recognition.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E
5|$|Baxter had {{now been}} {{governor}} {{for a year}} and was following an independent course. He began dismantling the systems put in place by the Minstrels.

5|$|Between 1907 and 1917, the League for Women's Equal Rights was {{the most}} {{important}} feminist organization in Russia. Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused on education and social welfare, but it also <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> equal rights for women, including suffrage, equal inheritance, and an end to passport restrictions. The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership in the organization. In the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{agricultural}} policy reinforced the conventional methods for organising the collective farms. Output quotas {{continued to be}} imposed centrally. Khrushchev's policy of amalgamating farms was continued by Brezhnev, because he shared Khrushchev's belief that bigger kolkhozes would increase productivity. Brezhnev <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> an increase in state investments in farming, which mounted to an all-time high in the 1970s of 27% of all state investment– this figure did not include investments in farm equipment. In 1981 alone, 33 billion U.S. dollars (by contemporary exchange rate) was invested into agriculture.|$|E

5|$|Cdr Katô Hirohasu <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> the {{adoption}} of a new /45 calibre gun that was currently under development. After trials of the new gun, which were witnessed by both the Japanese Navy and Royal Navy, the Japanese made the decision on 29 Nov 1911 to use the new gun despite the keel having already been laid down on 17 January 1911, and the resulting need to quickly make a large number of alternations to the design, so as to not prolong the construction.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed a measure {{that would have allowed}} collective bargaining for teachers.|$|E

5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{provides}} a dubious account of Darius's ascension: Several days after Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius {{and the other}} six nobles discussed {{the fate of the}} empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government; a democratic republic was strongly pushed by Otanes, an oligarchy was pushed by Megabyzus, while Darius <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> a monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military targets in the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> attacks on civilian morale. He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the South Carolina Federated Women's club {{adopted the}} Carolina wren as the {{unofficial}} state bird over the eastern mourning dove and <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> its official state adoption until 1939, when the South Carolina Legislature named the northern mockingbird {{as the state}} bird. In 1948, the legislature repealed their previous decision, and the wren became the official state bird.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Newsom <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> a {{state law}} to allow {{communities}} in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The animal control agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California.|$|E
