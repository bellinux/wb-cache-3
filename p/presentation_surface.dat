Figure 1 {{presents a}}n overview of the camera-projector system. The camera may be placed anywhere in the room such that its field of view contains the presentation area. The system first calibrates itself by exploiting knowledge of the projected image. Subsequently, computer-vision algorithms determine where the user is pointing on the <b>presentation</b> <b>surface,</b> and this provides a correspondence between the user's actions (as seen by the camera), and active regions in the image being displayed on the screen as illustrated in Figure 1. The presentation software performs programmed actions in response to the location and characteristics of the user's pointer actions. This enables users to activate "virtual buttons" on the projection screen simply by pointing, and also to "draw" directly on the <b>presentation</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|E

In Bragg-Brentano geometry the avoidance of preferred orientation, sample displacement and surface roughness would be goals of any sample presentation technique. A mixture of 90 wt % gypsum and 10 wt % corundum was prepared by miconising in a McCrone mill. Sufficient quantity of the mixture was prepared to enable more than 15 presentations on the prepared sample using an automatic sample loader for the diffractometer. The specimens were back-pressed with and without a 38 um nylon sieve mesh on the front face. For this material, the sieve mesh on removal appears to leave a <b>presentation</b> <b>surface</b> that is preferable to that produced by back-pressing without the mesh. The diffraction patterns for the sets of 15 presentations were modelled with TOPAS to determine the stability of parameters such as preferred orientation, specimen displacement, scale factors and weighted R factor...|$|E

One AS-associated single nucleotide polymorphism, rs 2248374, causes a truncated ERAP 2 protein that is degraded by nonsense-mediated decay. Approximately 25 % of the populations of European ancestry are therefore natural ERAP 2 knockouts. We investigated {{the effect of this}} associated variant on HLA class I allele <b>presentation,</b> <b>surface</b> heavy chains, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers and cytokine gene transcription in AS. Methods: Patients with AS and healthy controls with either AA or GG homozygous status for rs 2248374 were studied. Antibodies to CD 14, CD 19 -ECD, HLA-A-B-C, Valpha 7. 2, CD 161, anti-HC 10 and anti-HLA-B 27 were used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Expression levels of ER stress markers (GRP 78 and CHOP) and proinflammatory genes (tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL 6, IL 17 and IL 22) were assessed by qPCR. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} HLAclass I allele presentation or major histocompatibility class I heavy chains or ER stress markers GRP 78 and CHOP or proinflammatory gene expression between genotypes for rs 2248374 either between cases, between cases and controls, and between controls.

30|$|Migrated and {{dispersed}} products containing arsenic also form {{a potential}} health hazard during conservation practice. The conservator {{might not be}} aware that arsenic {{is likely to be}} present in, and at the surface of, varnish layers further away from the degraded arsenic-containing paint layers. In the case of paintings, conservation practice often involves the removal and replacement of discolored varnishes. In addition, when original pigment material has migrated into these varnishes, and their removal will expose friable altered paint while not improving the color of the altered pigment underneath, it may actually be prudent to consider leaving the varnish intact in these discolored regions. In the case of painted American furniture, conservation practice typically consists of leaving the full finish history of the object intact, unless the figure of the wood or the painted decoration is completely obscured. In this case the topmost layers of finish will be mechanically reduced by careful sanding, which again leads to a health hazard with arsenic species having migrated into these uppermost varnish layers. Like many photo-oxidation problems observed in artists’ pigments, often the original brightly colored paint can be observed below the discolored and flaking altered paint. This has led to the undesirable consequence of folk/vernacular art objects exhibiting this type of alteration to be “skinned” by untrained restorers, removing the artists’ original but damaged material to reveal the bright colors underneath. While such a restoration presents the owner or potential buyer with an attractive <b>presentation</b> <b>surface,</b> not only has original artist’s material been removed, but the pigments thus exposed lose the protection of the overlying alteration crust and will most likely experience rapid degradation.|$|E
40|$|Background: Burns {{injuries}} {{are recognized as}} a major health problem worldwide. In children and, particularly, in our environment where poverty, ignorance and disease are still high, they constitute significant morbidity and mortality. Previous studies on this topic in parts of Nigeria either lumped adults and children together or were retrospective. We, therefore, prospectively studied the current trends in burns in children. Patients and Methods: This prospective study of burns spanned {{over a period of}} 18 months (June 2006 -December 2007) at the Paediatric Surgery Units of the Imo State University Teaching Hospital, Orlu, and the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri, Imo State. Data were collected and analysed for age, sex, cause/type of burn, place of burn, presence or absence of adult/s, initial prehospital intervention, interval between injury and <b>presentation,</b> <b>surface</b> area and depth of burn and treatment and outcome. Results: Fifty-three patients were studied, 31 (58. 4 &#x 0025;) were male and 22 (41. 6 &#x 0025;) were female (M:F = 1. 4 : 1). Patients mostly affected were aged 2 years and below. The most common cause of burns was hot water in 31 (58. 5 &#x 0025;) patients. The vast majority of these injuries happened in a domestic environment (92. 5 &#x 0025;) and in the presence of competent adult/s (88. 7 &#x 0025;). Outcome of treatment was good: there were two (3. 8 &#x 0025;) deaths and 46 (86 &#x 0025;) patients had complete recovery. Conclusion: Burns is still a major health problem among children in south eastern Nigeria. Fortunately, outcome of appropriate treatment is good. However, we think that poor safety consciousness among parents is a major predisposing factor. Public enlightenment on measures to ensure safe home environment may be necessary to avoid or limit childhood burns...|$|E

40|$|Periodontal {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} prevalent inflammatory diseases affecting the tissues supporting and surrounding the teeth. In periodontal diseases, the inflammatory response of the periodontal tissues is induced by a polymicrobial biofilm formed at or below the gingival margin. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a Gram-negative oral pathogen identified within this biofilm, is a causative agent of both chronic and localized aggressive periodontitis. Dissemination of A. actinomycetemcomitans from the oral cavity also initiates multiple systemic infections, including soft tissues abscesses, pneumonia and endocarditis. The innate immune response is {{the first line of}} defense against bacterial infections. Dendritic cells, a group of professional antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system, express multiple surface C-type lectin receptors for the recognition of glycoproteins associated with bacterial cells. Internalization of the organism by receptor-mediated endocytosis results in phagolysosome formation and degradation of the bacteria for antigen <b>presentation.</b> <b>Surface</b> displayed antigens presented in an MHC complex to antigen-specific T lymphocytes initiate an adaptive immune response. A. actinomycetemcomitans expresses surface structures Extracellular matrix protein adhesin A (EmaA), which extends from the cell envelope, and is composed of three identical glycoproteins. The role of these structures in the interaction of A. actinomycetemcomitans with dendritic cells is understudied. A series of experiments presented here investigated the interaction of A. actinomycetemcomitans with dendritic cells and the role of EmaA in this process. A. actinomycetemcomitans was internalized and found to survive within dendritic cells. The internalization of bacteria was observed to be associated with the presence of EmaA. Fewer emaA mutant bacteria were recovered from dendritic cells when compared with the parent strain. In trans complementation of the emaA mutant strain restored the interactive and survival capability of the bacteria. These data suggest that EmaA mediates the interaction of A. actinomycetemcomitans with dendritic cells. The migration of dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes suggests that the EmaA-mediated internalization and intracellular survival is a potential mechanism for the immune evasion and in vivo dissemination of A. actinomycetemcomitans...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{important}} role wind {{is alleged to have}} in dispersal of fruits and seeds in desert plants, diaspores were collected for experimental study of 14 species from two Sonoran Desert localities of Imperial Co., California. Field observations on natural dispersal of these species also were made. Although all 14 species were not judged to be primarily adapted to anemochory, tests on air transport capability were made using a calibrated and modified seed-blowing machine. Diaspores were tested individually and results for 20 trials averaged for each experimental condition. In one series of tests, lofting ability was determined. In other tests, a Plexiglas wind tunnel was used; the bottom of the tunnel was lined with Plexiglas, wood, and sand for three types of trials respectively. Mean surface area and mean mass were determined for the seeds and fruits ofthe 14 species. These figures and the ratio between surface area and mass were compared to results from the lofting and horizontal movement tests. A high <b>presentation</b> <b>surface</b> area/mass ratio was positively correlated with ease of horizontal movement (tumbling chiefly) and ease of lofting. Excellence at transport in air appears variously countered in the anemochorous species by diaspore characteristics which seem to insure lodging in crevices or depressions. More than one kind of transport in air (e. g., tumbling, floating, skidding) can be identified and particular species may exhibit these in varying proportions. Seeds with high mass have nil wind-dispersal ability and thereby may be adapted to reaching (and staying in) depressions, washes, etc. High static friction is another mechanism which maximizes lodging ability. As Asteraceae show, anemochorous ability does not always run counter to lodging ability: capability of a diaspore to attach to hairs or skin of animals runs parallel to ability to lodge in soil crevices. In the study areas and in other desert localities, ants may play some role in movement of many kinds of seeds and fruits over short distances, but destruction by ants often is excessive...|$|E
