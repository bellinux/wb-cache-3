5|$|The Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO {{development}} program. RSIP {{enhances the}} operational {{capability of the}} E-3 radars' electronic countermeasures, and dramatically improve the system's reliability, maintainability, and availability. Essentially, this program replaced the older transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and emitter-coupled logic (MECL) electronic components, long-since out of production, with off-the-shelf digital computers that utilised a High-level programming language instead of assembly language. Significant improvement came from adding <b>pulse</b> <b>compression</b> to the pulse-Doppler mode, replacing the old 8-bit FFT with 24-bit FFTs, and the 12-bit A/D (Sign + 12-bits) with a 15-bit A/D (Sign + 15-bits). These hardware and software modifications improve the E-3 radars' performance, providing enhanced detection with an emphasis towards low radar cross-section (RCS) targets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- When {{pulse of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation impinges upon a moving plasmalneutral gas boundary, i. e., an ioniza-tion front, its frequency and duration are altered. The largest frequency upshifts and <b>pulse</b> <b>compressions</b> are obtained when radiation is incident on an ionization front moving {{at close to}} the speed of light. Such an ionization front is created when a short laser pulse photo-ionizes a gas through which it propa-gates. We have done theoretical and experimental work on the interaction of radiation with a relativistically propagating, un-derdense ionization front in a waveguide. In the experiment, 35 GHz microwave pulses were upshifted and compressed upon encountering a moving front. The frequency spectrum of the upshifted radiation was determined independently using sections of cutoff waveguides and a microwave diffraction grating. These frequency upshifts were proportional to the plasma density of the ionization front as predicted by the theory. The front density was determined using microwave interferometery. The pusewidths of the upshifted radiation were measured with fast diode detectors. These pulsewidth measurements were also in good agreement with the theory. Frequency upshifts and <b>pulse</b> <b>compressions</b> up to a factor of five were recorded in this experiment. 1...|$|R

2500|$|The pulse {{may be at}} {{constant}} frequency or a chirp {{of changing}} frequency (to allow <b>pulse</b> <b>compression</b> on reception). Simple sonars generally use the former with a filter wide enough to cover possible Doppler changes due to target movement, while more complex ones generally include the latter technique.
