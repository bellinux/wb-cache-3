40|$|Within the European Union Salmonella and Campylobacter are the {{zoonotic}} agents {{with the}} highest public health impact. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to protect the health of consumers. In the European policy, measures are adopted to battle against Salmonella in poultry which is considered the most important source of human infection. There are several sources of infortnation as regards the Salmonella situation in the pig to pork chain: in some Member States, Salmonella findings in swine are notifiable and action is taken by the official veterinarian; <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>health</b> <b>inspection</b> includes microbiological tests for salmonella of all suspect animals; laboratory findings in diagnostic examinations of clinically affected artimals are collated routinely; results of typing strains {{are available at the}} National Reference Laboratories which had been implemented in all Member States of the European Union following the provisions of the Council Directive 92 / 117 /EEC. Compulsory control programmes are in some Member States already in force to combat Salmonella in swine. Furthermore, in several countries of the European Union monitoring plans have been established, partly following the Danish approach. These plans are mainly conducted on a voluntary basis or run within highly integrated companies. Both, bacteriological and serological methods are applied. These programmes include the basal production at the farm level to estimate the Salmonella input into the food chain, the slaughterhouses and the retail level. Breeding herds are involved in some programmes as this is true for feedingstuffs...|$|E

RG had lower specific activities of GAPDH and aldolase A than NG while Vm and Km values of both enzymes were not different between groups. RG showed lower high ionic strength (HIS) and pellet protein extractabilities at 20 min <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> It also had lower low ionic strength (LIS) and HIS protein extractabilities at 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> Besides pellet protein, muscular protein extractabilities at 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> were higher than at 20 min <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> From SDS-PAGE of samples at 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem,</b> RG exhibited lower band intensities at 45 and 200 kDa, which were further identified as actin and myosin heavy chain (MHC), respectively. Western blots revealed that relative amounts of actin and MHC at 20 min <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> were not different between groups. However, RG muscles had less relative amount of actin at 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> It also indicated that amounts of actin and MHC increased with regard to <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> time...|$|R

METHODS [...] A nationwide survey of Royal College of Pathologists' district tutors (n = 216) was done by postal questionnaire. These were completed by the district tutors or passed on to their histopathologist colleagues. The results were collated after three months. After one follow up letter, an 86 % response rate, which is a significant sample, was achieved. RESULTS [...] Twenty eight per cent of respondents were performing HIV <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations. Of {{those who were not}} performing them (30 %), the lack of clinical or coroner requests was the most common explanation. All regions provide facilities for HIV <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations, as judged by the responses. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings are of singular importance as it is the first United Kingdom survey investigating the distribution of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations on HIV infected cadavers.

40|$|Huntington {{disease is}} {{associated}} with elongation of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene that results in a mutant huntingtin protein. Several studies have implicated N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments in Huntington disease pathogenesis. Ideally, these fragments are studied in human brain tissue. However, the use of human brain tissue comes with certain unavoidable variables such as <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay, artefacts from freeze-thaw cycles and subject-to-subject variation. Knowledge on how these variables might affect N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments in <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> human brain is important for a proper interpretation of study results. The effect of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay on protein in human brain is known to {{vary depending on the}} protein of interest. In the present study, we have assessed the effect of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay on N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments using western blot. We mimicked <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay in one individual control case and one individual Huntington disease case with low initial <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay. The influence of subject-to-subject variation on N-terminal huntingtin fragments was assessed in human cortex and human striatum using two cohorts of control and Huntington disease subjects. Our results show that effects of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay on N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments are minor in our individual subjects. Additionally, one freeze-thaw cycle decreases the huntingtin western blot signal intensity in the cortex control subject, but does not introduce additional N-terminal huntingtin fragments. Our results suggest that subject-to-subject variation contributes more to variability in N-terminal huntingtin fragments than <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> {{treatment}} on microbiological lamb carcass quality was studied. Suckling lambs carcasses {{were assigned to}} three different <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> treatments: conventional (2 C for 24 h), ultra-rapid (20 C for 3. 5 h then 2 C until 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem)</b> and slow (12 C for 7 h then 2 C until 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem).</b> Carcass pH and temperature were measured at 0, 3. 5, 7 and 24 h post slaughter. Lamb carcasses were sampled for total aerobic viable and Enterobacteriaceae counts just after dressing and 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> A significant effect (p< 0. 05) of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> treatment on carcasses temperature and pH was found corres-ponding the faster pH fall to slowly chilled muscles. However, {{no differences were found}} at 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> among treatments in both parameters. Regarding microbiological results, carcasses of ultra-rapid treatment had the lowest total aerobic viable and Enterobacteriaceae counts and those belonging to conventional treatment had the highest total aerobic viable counts. From 0 to 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem,</b> an increase of total aerobic viable was observed in conventional and slow treatments whilst Enterobacteriaceae counts remained con-stant in all cases. From a microbiological point of view, the ultra-rapid treatment was the only one allowed to maintain the hygienic carcasses quality.

40|$|The <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> {{room is a}} {{potential}} source of danger from contamination caused by glove punctures. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the incidence of hand injury and hand contamination during <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations. A prospective study of injury and glove puncture rate was conducted during <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations performed in 1990 on adults in Northwick Park Hospital mortuary. Four pathologists and two assistants performed a total of 44 <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations on adults. All participants completed a questionnaire after each examination, recording the total number of gloves used and the number of hand injuries and glove perforations sustained. Just over 8. 3 % of gloves were punctured; 31. 8 % of these punctures went unnoticed. Evisceration was the procedure most likely to result in hand contamination. The study highlights a significant risk which could be reduced by more care, frequent glove changes, and hand washing during <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations. In particular, gloves should be changed and hand washed when evisceration has been completed...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> mandate, an {{agreement}} used to protect some interests arising after the mandator’s death, both in Italian legal system and in Roman Law. Given that the latest doctrine has considered invalid a <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> mandate where {{the nature of the}} mandatory’s tasks is economic, as it does not comply with art. 458 Cod. Civ., this article explores the issues suggesting that the recent introduction of the ‘reverse mortgage’ within the Italian legal system could be considered as a new step towards overcoming the prohibition of agreements as to succession. After analysing the current legislation, also within the framework of European private law, the research dwells on <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> mandatum in Roman law, trying to show that such consensual contract could be considered as a succession agreement. After having demonstrated the difference between the mandatum <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> (understood as a contract) and other testamentary dispositions defined as mandatum <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> as well, a source showing the possible economic nature of the Roman mandatum <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> is considered, to conclude that there were Roman law cases, like that of Gaio in D. 17. 1. 13, proving the existence of bilateral agreements intended to fulfil an economic function casually related to the mandator’s death...|$|R

Although animal models or cell culture experiments mimic some disease aspects, human <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> brain tissue remains essential to advance {{our understanding of}} brain diseases using biochemical and molecular techniques. <b>Post</b> <b>mortem</b> artefacts must be properly understood, standardized, and either eliminated or factored into such experiments. Here we examine the influence of several premortem and <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> factors on pH, and discuss the role of pH as a biochemical marker for brain tissue quality. METHODS: We assessed brain tissue pH in 339 samples from 116 brains provided by 8 different European and 2 Australian brain bank centres. We correlated brain pH with tissue source, <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay, age, gender, freezing method, storage duration, agonal state and brain ischaemia.
