USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5A and 3.0A over the 5V <b>power</b> <b>bus</b> in addition to baseline 900mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line or they can support the full Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.|$|E
25|$|The {{most severe}} {{effect of the}} {{radiation}} were current leakages somewhere in spacecraft's <b>power</b> <b>bus,</b> most likely across brushes at a spin bearing connecting rotor and stator sections of the orbiter. These current leakages triggered a reset of the onboard computer and caused it to go into safe mode. The resets occurred when the spacecraft was either close to Jupiter or {{in the region of}} space magnetically downstream of the Earth. A change to the software was made in April 1999 that allowed the onboard computer to detect these resets and autonomously recover, so as to avoid safe mode.|$|E
25|$|Harmony, {{also known}} as Node 2, is {{the second of the}} station's node modules and the utility hub of the USOS. The module {{contains}} four racks that provide electrical <b>power,</b> <b>bus</b> electronic data, and acts as a central connecting point for several other components via its six Common Berthing Mechanisms (CBMs). The European Columbus and Japanese Kibō laboratories are permanently berthed to the starboard and port radial ports respectively. The nadir and zenith ports can be used for docking visiting spacecraft including HTV, Dragon, and Cygnus, with the nadir port serving as the primary docking port. American Shuttle Orbiters docked with the ISS via PMA-2, attached to the forward port.|$|E

5000|$|Note {{there are}} two {{different}} common alignments for the <b>power</b> <b>bus</b> strips. On small boards, with about 30 rows, the holes for the <b>power</b> <b>bus</b> are often aligned between the signal holes. On larger boards, about 63 rows, the <b>power</b> <b>bus</b> strip holes are often in alignment with the signal holes. This makes some accessories designed for one board type incompatible with the other. For example, some Raspberry Pi GPIO to breadboard adapters use offset aligned power pins, making them not fit breadboards with aligned <b>power</b> <b>bus</b> rows. There are no official standards, so the users need to pay extra attention to the compatibility between a specific model of breadboard and a specific accessory. Vendors of accessories and breadboards are not always clear in their specifications of which alignment they use. Seeing a close up photograph of the pin/hole arrangement can help determine compatibility.|$|E

40|$|Shared-bus chip multiprocessors require buses {{with long}} wires. The portion of power {{consumed}} in wires relatively increases with device scaling. In this paper, we advocate {{the use of}} bus serialization to reduce <b>bus</b> <b>power</b> consumption. <b>Bus</b> serialization decreases the number of wires, and increases the pitch between wires. The wider pitch decreases the coupling capacitances of wires, and consequently reduces <b>bus</b> <b>power</b> consumption. Evaluation results indicate that our technique can reduce <b>bus</b> <b>power</b> consumption by 30 % at 45 nm technology process. 1...|$|R
