40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform a comprehensive review of psychophysically determined maximum acceptable pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces.</b> Factors affecting pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> are identified and discussed. Recent studies show a significant decrease (compared to previous studies) in maximum acceptable forces for males but not for females when pushing and pulling on a treadmill. A comparison of pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> measured using a high inertia cart with those measured on a treadmill shows that the pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> using high inertia cart are higher for males but are about the same for females. It is concluded that the recommendations of Snook and Ciriello (1991) for pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> are still valid and provide reasonable recommendations for ergonomics practitioners. Regression equations as a function of handle height, frequency of exertion and pushing/pulling distance are provided to estimate maximum initial and sustained forces for pushing and pulling acceptable to 75 % male and female workers. At present {{it is not clear whether}} pushing or pulling should be favored. Similarly, it is not clear what handle heights would be optimal for pushing and pulling. Epidemiological studies are needed to determine relationships between psychophysically determined maximum acceptable pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> and risk of musculoskeletal injuries, in particular to low back and shoulders.

40|$|In {{addition}} to biting, {{it has been}} speculated that the <b>forces</b> resulting from <b>pulling</b> on food items may also contribute to feeding success in carnivorous vertebrates. We present an in vivo analysis of both bite and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> in Varanus komodoensis, the Komodo dragon, to determine how they contribute to feeding behavior. Observations of cranial modeling and behavior suggest that V. komodoensis feeds using bite <b>force</b> supplemented by <b>pulling</b> in the caudal/ventrocaudal direction. We tested these observations using force gauges/transducers to measure biting and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces.</b> Maximum bite force correlates with both body mass and total body length, likely due to increased muscle mass. Individuals showed consistent behaviors when biting, including the typical medial-caudal head rotation. <b>Pull</b> <b>force</b> correlates best with total body length, longer limbs and larger postcranial motions. None of these forces correlated well with head dimensions. When pulling, V. komodoensis use neck and limb movements {{that are associated with}} increased caudal and ventral oriented force. Measured bite force in Varanus komodoensis is similar to several previous estimations based on 3 D models, but is low for its body mass relative to other vertebrates. <b>Pull</b> <b>force,</b> especially in the ventrocaudal direction, would allow individuals to hunt and deflesh with high success without the need of strong jaw adductors.

50|$|A nanoFET {{works in}} a fairly {{straightforward}} manner. It consists of 3 main parts: a particle storage area, a charging pad, and an acceleration grid. To start, it transports cylindrical particles to the charging pad which then imposes a charge on the particles. As the particle gains charge, the <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> from the acceleration grid increases. Eventually, this <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> overpowers the electro-magnetic and surface adhesion forces between the particles and charging pad.

40|$|The microtubule-based motor dynein generates <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> for {{centrosome}} centration and {{mitotic spindle}} positioning in animal cells. How the essential dynein activator dynactin regulates these {{functions of the}} motor is incompletely understood. Here, we dissect the role of dynactin's microtubule binding activity, located in the p 150 CAP-Gly domain and an adjacent basic patch, in the C. elegans zygote. Analysis of p 150 mutants engineered by genome editing suggests that microtubule tip tracking of dynein-dynactin is dispensable for targeting the motor to the cell cortex and for generating robust cortical <b>pulling</b> <b>forces.</b> Instead, mutations in p 150 's CAP-Gly domain inhibit cytoplasmic <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> responsible for centration of centrosomes and attached pronuclei. The centration defects are mimicked by mutations of α-tubulin's C-terminal tyrosine, and both p 150 CAP-Gly and tubulin tyrosine mutants decrease the frequency of early endosome transport from the cell periphery towards centrosomes during centration. Our results suggest that p 150 GAP-Gly domain binding to tyrosinated microtubules promotes initiation of dynein-mediated organelle transport in the dividing one-cell embryo, and that this function of p 150 is critical for generating cytoplasmic <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> for centrosome centration...|$|R
