50|$|In the 1940s, Percy Lavon Julian {{developed}} an improved type of foam called Aerofoam. Using mechanical action, a liquid protein-based concentrate, made from soy protein, was mixed with water {{in either a}} proportioner or an aerating nozzle to form air bubbles with the free-flowing action. Its expansion ratio and ease of handling made it popular. <b>Protein</b> <b>foam</b> is easily contaminated by some flammable liquids, so care should be used so that the foam is applied only above the burning liquid. <b>Protein</b> <b>foam</b> has slow knockdown characteristics, but it is economical for post-fire security.|$|E
50|$|The {{most stable}} and volumous foams are created when the egg white {{proteins}} are near their isoelectric points. Protein adsorption is most rapid at the isoelectric point because electrostatic repulsion is reduced for proteins with a neutral net charge.

40|$|This thesis investigates how the {{properties}} of foams can be modulated {{by the addition of}} particles to the foam solution. As a model system hydrophobic and hydrophilic silica particles were used. The de-agglomeration of hydrophilic silica particles in water and surfactant solutions was studied. Two methods are investigated: ultrasound cavitation (UC) and mechanical agitation (MA). The efficiency of these two methods was compared with respect to their ability to produce foams and to de-agglomerate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic silica particles. The same particles were used as additions to <b>protein</b> and surfactant <b>foaming</b> solutions. In the experiments, the amount and types of particles, proteins and surfactants were varied in the foaming dispersions. Then UC and MA were used to foam the dispersions and the drainage, breakage and microstructure of the resulting foams were examined. In the <b>protein</b> <b>foaming</b> solutions, both casein and whey <b>protein</b> <b>foams</b> were considered. In the surfactant foaming solution, C 12 LAS and CTAB were used. Partially hydrophobic silica particles were used in pure water to generate foam. Foamability and foam stability both increased with increasing concentration of particles. Moderately hydrophobic particles gave optimum foamability whilst no foam could be produced with fully hydrophilic particles. In the foam rheology test, a transition from solid-like to liquid-like behaviour was found while the foam with addition of SCMC exhibited no such transition. ...|$|R

50|$|The flour {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the texture, structure and elasticity of an angel food cake. Minimal folding of the flour allows cell walls to form when it comes in contact with the egg <b>protein</b> <b>foam</b> and sugar mixture. If the batter is over-mixed, the egg white proteins may coagulate causing the bubbles to break during baking, or the cell walls may become too rigid, lacking elasticity. This would reduce the volume and result in a coarse texture. However, if the batter is under-mixed, a weak foam will form.|$|E

40|$|Methods were {{developed}} for {{the isolation of the}} soluble leaf proteins in as pure a form as possible and free of any phenoloxidase products. This protein material was separated into two fractions (Fraction 1 and Fraction 2 proteins). A detailed study of the foaming properties of these soluble protein fractions was made so that the conditions necessary for the production of stable foams from these solutions could be evaluated. The nature of the foams derived from bovine salivary secretions and the soluble proteins of the holotrich protozoa were also examined. The foams derived from the leaf and protozoal proteins were rigid and of high stability only when the foams were of high compressive strength. In contrast the salivary secretions produced foams of low compressive strength but high persistence. For protozoal proteins and Fraction 1 protein of white clover and red clover the optimum pH for foam production was close to pH 5. 8 to 5. 9 and for the plant Fraction 2 proteins in the range 5. 1 to 5. 4. The foams derived from bovine salivary mucoprotein was unaffected by changes in pH over the range 3. 5 to 7. 5. The foams generated in vitro from rumen liquor were of low compressive strength but extremely high persistence, and their properties were very {{different from those of the}} foams generated from either the plant or protozoal proteins except that they showed maximum foam persistence in a similar pH range. The concentration of Fraction 1 protein in the rumen liquor was below the minimum concentration required to produce stable Fraction 1 <b>protein</b> <b>foams.</b> Of this low concentration only 24 % was surface denatured in production of these very stable rumen foams. The significance of this result is discussed. Apart from the low level of Fraction 1 protein, other low molecular weight proteins together with a major component containing carbohydrate as well as protein, were observed on analysing the rumen liquor by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and cellulose acetate electrophoresis. This major component resembled salivary mucoprotein in its schlieren profile in an analytical ultracentrifuge. This material was isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation and some of its properties examined. It was not precipitated by trichloracetic acid, unlike the protozoal and plant proteins, but was precipitated by 60 % ammonium sulphate, 80 % ethanol, and an equal volume of 1 % cetavlon. The antibody to this material gave a positive precipitin reaction with the salivary mucoprotein, the sensitivity of which could be increased by incubating the salivary mucoprotein with neuraminidase, an enzyme which removes the sialic acid from the mucoprotein. molecule. The significance of these findings in relation to other work is discussed. The action of various surfactants that have been implicated in the bloat syndrome on the foaming properties of Fraction 1 <b>protein</b> <b>foams</b> was examined. Thus calcium was found to increase the rigidity of Fraction 1 <b>protein</b> <b>foams,</b> slightly increase the rigidity of Fraction 2 <b>protein</b> <b>foams</b> at high calcium concentrations only, but was without effect on salivary mucoprotein foams. Sodium polygalacturonate increased the persistence of Fraction 1 <b>protein</b> <b>foams</b> at concentration greater than 0. 04 % w/v. Two salivary secretions were examined for their effect on Fraction 1 <b>protein</b> <b>foams.</b> The first of these was bovine salivary mucoprotein, which whilst increasing the persistence of the foam, decreased its rigidity. Foams of maximum persistence were produced from solutions containing Fraction 1 protein/mucoprotein in the ratio 2 / 1, w/w. The second salivary secretion examined was the oesophageal mucin. This material did not produce stable foams by itself, but was an extremely effective stabilizing agent of Fraction 1 <b>protein</b> <b>foams.</b> The most effective antifoaming agent of the polar lipids of red clover examined in this thesis, was phosphatydyl choline which at a concentration of 50 µg ml- 1 completely inhibited the production of Fraction 1 <b>protein</b> <b>foams.</b> Addition of mucoprotein to lipid/Fraction 1 protein mixtures which would not support stable foams, resulted in production of extremely persistent foams. Both Fraction 1 protein and mucoprotein were essential for the formation of these foams which resembled the properties of the foams generated in vitro from rumen liquor. From this study it appeared that neither the plant nor the protozoal proteins by themselves could account for the properties of the rumen foams. The properties of the rumen foams could be reproduced by generating foams from mixtures of Fraction 1 protein/plant lipid and salivary mucoprotein. The soluble <b>proteins</b> and the <b>foaming</b> properties of extracts of bloat and non-bloat provoking legume pastures were examined. It was found that the temperate non-bloating legumes contained condensed tannins which precipitated the soluble leaf proteins and thus by removing the plant foaming agents from solution inhibited foam production from these extracts. These tannins were isolated from Lotus pedunculatus Cav., and were shown to form insoluble complexes, not only with the soluble leaf proteins, but with protozoal proteins, salivary mucoprotein, and the protein present in rumen liquor. Tannins were common in the Lotus species, but of the Trifolium species examined, they were found only in Trifolium arvense L [...] The significance of incorporation of tannins into bloating pastures in an attempt to eliminate bloat is discussed. The non-bloating tropical legumes, apart from the Desmodium species, did not contain tannins but were lower in soluble leaf protein, and the bloat potential could be correlated with the compressive strength of the foams derived from extracts of these plants...|$|R
50|$|A {{whipping}} aid such as modified {{soy protein}} {{can help to}} account for the decreased foaming ability of dehydrated or frozen egg whites. Modified soy protein is a soy protein in a solution which is then acidified using hydrochloric acid. Pepsin or another enzyme is then added to enhance the <b>protein</b> <b>foaming</b> abilities.

50|$|An excess {{acidifier}} is also added, {{however it}} isn’t used {{in combination with}} the sodium bicarbonate.

It also helps to create a whiter cake, which is more desirable to consumers. It is typical that the excess acidifier is the same as that used to react with the balanced chemical leavener.|$|E

50|$|Sugar {{functions}} as a sweetener, stabilizer, and tenderizer. The amount of sugar has a large impact on the overrun and stability of the foam. When sugar and egg whites are whipped together, a meringue is formed. If the amount of sugar is {{less than or equal}} to the amount of egg whites, a soft meringue is formed. A stiffer meringue is formed when there is more sugar than egg white. Angel food cakes usually have equal parts sugar and egg white. Sugar will disturb <b>protein</b> <b>foam</b> formation in a positive or negative manner. It is also important that the sugar is added slowly, so that the crystals have a chance to dissolve. It is typically added after a weak foam has been formed. This way it can help stabilize the foam instead of impeding on it, causing coagulation and collapse. When the sugar dissolves, it interacts with the proteins at the air/water interface, creating a thicker and more stable cell wall. The sugar can also assist in the denaturing and aggregation of egg white proteins, which increases overrun, giving a lighter texture. Sugar binds water through hydrogen bonds, which allows for a moist final cake and why all of the moisture does not leave during baking.|$|E
