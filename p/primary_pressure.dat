50|$|As {{previously}} described, FCI {{could lead}} to an overpressure event leading to RPV fail, and thus, <b>primary</b> <b>pressure</b> boundary fail.

In the event of lower plenum failure, debris at varied temperatures can be expected to be projected into the cavity below the core. The containment may be subject to overpressure, though this is not likely to fail the containment. The alpha-mode failure will lead to the consequences previously discussed.|$|E

Part 2 of the paper discusses in detail the use-of the SES thus characterized for generating <b>primary</b> <b>pressures.</b> This standard has been used to calibrate Spinning Rotor Gauges (SRGs) at a number of pressures in the range 0. 1 Pa to I Pa in steps of 0. 1 Pa. The Gauge Coefficient at each of these pressures, defined as equal to the ratio of the indicated pressure to the trite pressure is their plotted against the trite pressure. The resulting straight line plot has a negative slope and its intercept equals the gauge coefficient. Two SRGs, NPL- 0 and NPL- 2 thus calibrated are used (i) as a device for measuring the pressure rise in the flowmeter of the National Physical Laboratory, India (NPLI) orifice flow system and (ii) as a secondary standard for the calibration of the user gauges...|$|R

50|$|The primary {{structure}} of the BioSuit is built by placing elastic cords {{along the lines of}} non-extension. Thus, whatever pressure they provide will be constant even as the wearer moves. In this way, they can very accurately control the mechanical counter-pressure the suit applies. The rest of the suit is then built up from spandex lying between the <b>primary</b> <b>pressure</b> cords. The Bio-Suit team has thus far constructed a number of lower leg prototypes using different materials, including nylon-spandex, elastic, and urethane-painted foam. In one experimental design, kevlar fabric was used between cords for areas where the expansion was limited. At least one full-body suit has been constructed for Newman, which she has worn for numerous photo-ops; it is unknown if the entire suit meets the same counter-pressure standards that the lower-leg prototypes were designed for. Each suit has to be custom tailored for the wearer, but the complexity of this task is greatly reduced through the use of whole-body laser scans.|$|E

It {{has been shown}} that active headrest algorithms using virtual microphones are better than those using physical microphones, as they have the ability to shift the zone of quiet away from the location of the physical microphones towards the ears of the occupant. Recently, the virtual microphone arrangement based ANC method was used for an active headrest application, in which it was assumed that the <b>primary</b> <b>pressures</b> at the physical and virtual microphone locations are similar. In this paper the previous work is extended to incorporate the remote microphone technique, which is a better estimation algorithm as it incorporates an extra transfer function between the physical and virtual microphone.

5000|$|For first {{generation}} pressure cookers with a weighted valve or [...] "jiggler", the primary safety valve or regulator {{is usually a}} weighted stopper, commonly called [...] "the rocker" [...] or [...] "vent weight". This weighted stopper is lifted by the steam pressure, allowing excess pressure to be released. There is a backup pressure release mechanism that releases pressure quickly if the <b>primary</b> <b>pressure</b> release mechanism fails (e.g., food jams the steam discharge path). One such method is {{a hole in the}} lid that is blocked by a low melting point alloy plug and another is a rubber grommet with a metal insert at the center. At a sufficiently high pressure, the grommet will distort and the insert will blow out of its mounting hole to release pressure. If the pressure continues to increase, the grommet itself will blow out to release pressure. These safety devices usually require replacement when activated by excess pressure. Newer pressure cookers may have a self-resettable spring device, fixed onto the lid, that releases excess pressure.|$|E
50|$|At {{the point}} at which the corium relocates to the lower plenum, Haskin, et al relate that the {{possibility}} exists for an incident called a fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) to substantially stress or breach the <b>primary</b> <b>pressure</b> boundary when the corium relocates to the lower plenum of the reactor pressure vessel ("RPV").This is because the lower plenum of the RPV may have a substantial quantity of water - the reactor coolant - in it, and, assuming the primary system has not been depressurized, the water will likely be in the liquid phase, and consequently dense, and at a vastly lower temperature than the corium. Since corium is a liquid metal-ceramic eutectic at temperatures of 2200 to 3200 K, its fall into liquid water at 550 to 600 K may cause an extremely rapid evolution of steam that could cause a sudden extreme overpressure and consequent gross structural failure of the primary system or RPV. Though most modern studies hold that it is physically infeasible, or at least extraordinarily unlikely, Haskin, et al state that there exists a remote possibility of an extremely violent FCI leading to something referred to as an alpha-mode failure, or the gross failure of the RPV itself, and subsequent ejection of the upper plenum of the RPV as a missile against the inside of the containment, which would likely lead to the failure of the containment and release of the fission products of the core to the outside environment without any substantial decay having taken place.|$|E

40|$|Abstract � The FPG 8601 {{has become}} an {{important}} reference for many primary measurement laboratories in a pressure range from approximately 1 Pa to 15 kPa in both gauge and absolute measurement modes.
