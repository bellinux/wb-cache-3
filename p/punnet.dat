But it speedily became evident that he was a person of wide and commanding social relationships. He spoke of [...] "society" [...] being mixed in the neighbourhood and of the difficulty of getting people to work together, and [...] "do" [...] things; they were cliquish. Incidentally he alluded quite familiarly to men with military titles, and once even to someone with a title, a Lady <b>Punnet.</b> Not snobbishly, you understand, nor deliberately, but quite in passing.

50|$|The first breeder of lilac-coloured rabbits {{is thought}} to be an H. Onslow of Cambridge, England, who began exhibiting them in London in 1913. Lilac-coloured rabbits were also {{produced}} the same year by Mabel Illingworth, who crossed Blue Imperials with Havana rabbits. In 1917, a Gouda, Holland breeder named C.H. Spruty crossed Blue Beverens with Havanas to create a larger lilac rabbit called the Gouda or Gowenaar. The Cambridge Blue was created in 1922, by Cambridge University professor R.C. <b>Punnet,</b> by using the same cross as Spruty. The rabbits bred by Illingworth, Spruty and <b>Punnet</b> were merged, creating the Lilac rabbit breed.

In 1906 and 1908 Bateson and <b>Punnet</b> demonstrated that White Dorkings are homozygous for an autosomal recessive mutation which prevents appearance of color. They assigned to this mutation the symbol c, as being recessive from the normal allele (C+, chromogen) which allows normal plumage color development. This same kind of white plumage color was found by Bateson and <b>Punnet</b> in Rose Comb Bantam and in White Wyandotte. It was also found in White Cochin by Davenport in 1906, in White Langshan by Goodale in 1910, in White Plymouth Rock by Hadley in 1914, and in other breeds.|$|E

40|$|The {{benefits}} of different wrap-films for Navalinda sweet cherry, packaged in small-format (consumer packages), were analysed. A {{storage and distribution}} process entailing eight days at 4 °C plus four days at 20 °C was simulated. The cherries were packed in <b>punnets</b> and film-wrapped with one macroperforated film and two microperforated films of 0. 30 (MAP. 30) and 0. 55 (MAP. 55) μmol cm/cm 2 atm day of CO 2 permeability at 0 °C. Packing in MAP at 0 °C did not alter the subsequent respiratory intensity of the fruits at 20 °C; however, the respiratory intensity at 20 °C did increase when the storage temperature was raised to 4 °C. The concentration of CO 2 (%) inside the packets at 20 °C was proportional to the permeability of the films: MAP. 30 (21 %) and MAP. 55 (15 %). The microperforated films preserved fruit acidity and firmness while slowing down the darkening of colour, loss of quality and decay. Shelf life was most effectively prolonged with MAP. 30 film.

50|$|Dominant {{white was}} one of the first traits in aviculture which proved to be {{inherited}} according to the Mendelian laws, when in 1902 Bateson found that the cross of White Leghorns x Indian Games (or its reciprocal) gives F1 chicks with a white or a black spotted ashly white down. And that the F2 gives light and dark chicks in the 3:1 Mendelian proportion, which was confirmed by Hurst in 1905, Bateson and <b>Punnet</b> in 1906 and many others. The symbol I (inhibitor of black) to identify this mutation was introduced by Hadley in 1913. Although homozygotes I/I have always a solid white plumage color, heterozygous I/i+ chicks are generally black spotted, while the presence of black or partially black feathers on a whitish adult plumage is very common.|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} growing and {{marketing}} strawberries varies {{throughout the world}} and even within countries. Traditionally New Zealand produces strawberries on a short term cropping system where the plants may be cropped for {{only one or two}} seasons, {{as is the case in}} the Auckland province, or they may be held for three of four years as is common in the South Island. Sale is still based firmly on the local market both in fresh form and as block frozen for processing. Northern areas of New Zealand have developed a sound fresh export trade in <b>punnets</b> particularly to Australian markets and some strawberries are also exported fresh from the South Island later in the season. Strawberries are also exported in block frozen form and in the I. Q. F. (independently quick frozen) form. Latest statistics available 1 are for the 1976 year. Figures for the 1970 year are presented for comparison. The 37. 6 % reduction in production in 6 years corresponds to the 38. 7 % reduction in area. The traditional Australian market for fresh strawberries has reduced by 79 % in 6 years and represents only 40 % of all fresh strawberries exported compared with 77 % in 1970. Fresh fruit export to the U. S. A., U. K. and Hong Kong has increased and represents now 18, 10 and 10 % respectively of fresh strawberry exports. Unfortunately separate statistics are not available for export of frozen strawberries but it is estimated that it is approximately 150 - 200 tonnes per annum...|$|R
40|$|Strawberry is a {{significantly}} consumed fruit worldwide, mostly without {{being subjected to}} disinfection processes. During the harvest and transfer from farm to consumers as well as where organic farming practises have been employed, {{the surface of the}} fruit may become contaminated by pathogenic bacteria. Post-harvest strawberry fruits in <b>punnets</b> available for public consumption were thus screened for the presence of enteric bacteria in the Sunshine Coast region of Queensland, Australia. Some of the tested samples (13 %) were found to carry such bacteria and even in greater numbers if organic amendments were used (69 %). The bacteria were found to belong in the genera of Escherichia, Enterobacter, Raoultella, Klebsiella, Pantoea, Shigella, Citrobacter and Cronobacter within the family Enterobacteriaceae. Some of the isolates were found to adhere to Caco- 2 cells representing human gut epithelium as well as carrying virulence and toxin genes. Resistance mostly against sulphafurazole, cefoxitin, ampicillin and nitrofurantoin was found among 14 different antimicrobial agents tested including 100 % resistance to cefoxitin and ampicillin in the genus Pantoea. In {{the second phase of the}} study, bacteriophages were isolated against the isolates and were subsequently applied to post-harvest fruits. A significant (P ≤ 0. 001) reduction in the number of enteric bacteria was observed when a high-titre polyvalent bacteriophage suspension (× 1012 PFU/mL) was applied to the fruit surface. Bacteriophages also decreased the adhesion of the Escherichia coli isolates to Caco- 2 cells. Findings might indicate that biological control using bacteriophages might be of significant value for the industry targeting to reduce pathogenic loads of bacteria on the fruit...|$|R
40|$|This {{concept paper}} {{summarizes}} key “hotspots” for waste generation along {{the food supply}} chain and identifies a range of existing solutions/measures that can help producers, retailers and consumers {{reduce the amount of}} food that is wasted. The majority of food waste of 71 – 92 kg/head/year in Western Europe was found to originate from private households (61 %), followed by restaurants and canteens (17 %) and then supermarkets (5 %); 59 %– 65 % (of this food waste (71 – 92 kg) can be avoided and 54 % thereof are fruit and vegetables. Since ethylene accelerates fruit ripening and its accumulation can lead to fruit decay and waste and new portable instruments now enable continuous in-situ determination of ethylene along the food chain, there is a possible key to reducing food waste of perishable, fresh produce. Hence, suggested countermeasures at the field level are use of ethylene inhibitors (AVG as “Retain” or MCP as “Harvista”), the former prevents pre-mature fruit drop in pome fruit, incentives for processing fruit of industrial grade and whole crop purchase (“WCP”). Along the supply chain, applications of ethylene inhibitors (e. g., 1 -MCP as “SmartFresh”) absorber strips (e. g., “It’s Fresh”, Sensitech), bags (e. g., “Peakfresh”) as well as simply cooling and venting, and shading to avoid sun exposure. Countermeasures also include superstores no longer promoting multi-packs, e. g., “two strawberry <b>punnets</b> for the price of one”, abandon the “Display until” or “Sell by” date, conservative consumer shopping behavior, and sale of class II produce (“Wunderlinge” in Billa or “Kleine Äpfel” in REWE, “Ünique” in Coop), collection (rather than wasting) of perishable food by volunteers (“Die Tafel”), or “Food Sharing” of private household left-over perishable on social media, or any combination of the above to aid reducing fresh produce waste...|$|R

Each contestant had 45 minutes to prepare an entrée, a main and a dessert. Each course had to include {{at least one of the}} three base ingredients: blueberries, chicken and bok choy. Shannon and Michelle would be the judges, and judge each dish on presentation and taste. The winner of the challenge would win a $4500 Everdure barbecue. Sammy presented her courses first: grilled eggplant with mushroom, cottage cheese and bok choy for entrée; stir-fried snow peas, carrot, mushroom, onion, garlic and chilli with Worcestershire and soy sauces for the main course; and carb-smart ice cream with berries and vanilla essence for dessert. Tiffany was next and presented: grilled capsicum and garlic bok choy tapas with cottage cheese for entrée; mustard chicken on a bed of lime and lemon greens for main course; and vanilla blueberries and yoghurt for dessert. Cameron then served his courses: cajun chicken and mushroom for entrée; stir-fried chicken with bok choy, cabbage, onion, carrots, capsicum, with worcestershire sauce for main course; and blueberries with yoghurt and light chocolate syrup for dessert. Sharif was the favourite to win the competition, being the best chef in the house. He first presented his entrée, baby spinach salad with cottage cheese and balsamic dressing (containing red, yellow and green capsicum, Spanish onion and cherry tomatoes), but unfortunately he forgot to put bok choy in the dish. He then presented the main course: wilted bok choy with stir-fried chicken, chilli, garlic and ginger plus a squeeze of lemon. His dessert was a <b>punnet</b> of blueberries with 100g of cottage cheese and a raspberry cooler on top. The judges awarded one point each to a contestant that they felt had the best dish within each course. Sammy got both points for the entrée. Tiffany got both points for the main course. For the dessert, Shannon gave a point to Tiffany and Michelle gave a point to Sharif. Therefore, Tiffany won the challenge and the barbecue with 3 points. Shannon and Michelle also awarded the Coach's Encouragement Award to Cameron because he has improved so much.|$|E

It feels good being Through To Boot Camp. It feels very good indeed. While 4music.com emphasized on a part of the lyrics saying, [...] "It includes such gems as 'Pulling at me like the stars do / You're like gravity.'

[...] Music All Stars said [...] "Safe" [...] is good, it has Westlife's typical moving/heart-warming lyrics but I just think the Irish lads have made way better first singles in the past." [...] Entertainment Focus said: [...] "Westlife are hardly considered to be cool are they in the industry? We aren’t going to do that. Whilst we wouldn’t choose {{to go out and buy}} a Westlife single we can understand why people would. There's something so familiar about a Westlife track that the minute it starts you feel like you’re sat with an old friend you hold very dear. Safe sticks to the usual formula, and therefore guarantees that the band will be once again battling for the top spot in the charts the week of release. Soaring melodies, harmony-filled vocals and dramatic instrumentation all combine for another classic slice of Westlife. You can say many things about Westlife but one thing you can’t say is that the lads can’t sing. Each of the boys can hold their own and whilst Safe doesn’t exactly set our world on fire it’ll be held dearly to the hearts of every Westlife fan in the world. After 11 years you’ve got to admire the fact that the band are sticking with the ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’ formula don’t you?" [...] Tina Hart of MSN UK quoted, Admittedly, I was kind of over Westlife when I got over Boyzone the first time around - sorry guys, I was a fickle teenager. The Irish quartet is still churning out the tunes though as the lead single Safe from forthcoming (eleventh!) album Gravity, is a suitably nice, sentimental ballad that will undoubtedly please hardcore fans and I’m sure I’ll now end up singing ‘I will keeep you sa-a-aafe’ all day after a few plays. With an accompanying dramatic multi-storyline video featuring a fiery car crash and domestic violence, it's not definitely not your less-interesting visual Flying Without Wings but Safe doesn’t quite reach the audio-epicness of FOW either. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said: [...] "Let's just get this out the way: Westlife's new single is called 'Safe' and it's a ballad. While the jokes write themselves, anyone who remembers their dodgy Rat Pack covers record from 2004 knows that we, and they, are in a much better place now. Back then we were certain the lads were about to call time, but a further five albums down the line, it's obvious they're doing something right. Of course, their eleven years in the game has given them a knack for spotting a good ballad, but truth be told, it's difficult to drum up much excitement for this kind of thing tenth album around. Nonetheless, the pounding piano riff, fist-clenching lyrics and that key change are, as ever, all present and correct. The real test? Whether it's used during those teary moments on next year's X Factor." [...] Daily Star added: [...] "YES, it's a ballad. But, hang on? This is not slushier than a smashed-up <b>punnet</b> of out-of-season Sainsbury's strawberries. In fact - gasp! - it's kind of cool in a key change-tastic boyband ballady way. Fans are going to have a right job deciding between buying this and the JLS and Take That offerings. In fact, the ‘Loife might just mop up the Take That fans who aren’t so keen on the lads’ new Muse-esque direction.IndieLondon informed, [...] "How you going to live your life like the dream you have is real?… I will keep you safe…" [...] So sing Westlife during the chorus to their epic new power ballad, Safe. And that title tells you just about everything you need to know about the track… it's safe, conventional and passionately heartfelt in the way that you’d expect a power pop ballad to be from one of the boy bands of the moment. That is to say, a moody piano score, belated swirling string arrangements and a layered chorus that delivers each question - [...] "How you gonna love? How you gonna feel?" [...] - with passion and meaning. It's destined to sweep the hopeless romantics off their feet, and to provide the backing for several movie and/or TV scenes… but it is formulaic no matter how well done for this kind of thing (and therefore kind of average)." ...|$|E

In particular, Hardy’s criterion only require know-ing the genotype frequency. 1 Why the Hardy-Weinberg principle holds Consider the simplest situation of a monogenic Mendelian trait: a pair of alleles, one dominant A and the other recessive a, and suppose {{the frequency of the}} allele A is p and that of a is q. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Principle: Consider a population sat-isfying biological conditions 1 - 6 that are listed below. If in a certain gen-eration the allele frequencies are p and q and the genotype frequencies are p 2, 2 pq, q 2 then BOTH the genotype and allele frequencies remain the same for as many generations as conditions 1 - 6 continue to hold. Hardy implicitly and Weinberg explicitly used the reasoning of a <b>Punnet...</b>|$|E
40|$|In Queensland the {{subtropical}} strawberry (Fragaria * ananassa) breeding program aims {{to combine}} traits into novel genotypes that increase production efficiency. The contribution of individual plant traits to cost and income under subtropical Queensland conditions was investigated, {{with the overall}} goal of improving the profitability of the industry through the release of new strawberry cultivars. The study involved specifying the production and marketing system using three cultivars of strawberry that are currently widely grown annually in southeast Queensland, developing methods to assess {{the economic impact of}} changes to the system, and identifying plant traits that influence outcomes from the system. From May through September P (price; <b>punnet</b> - 1), V (monthly mass; tonne of fruit on the market) and M (calendar month; i. e. May= 5) were found to be related (r 2 = 0. 92) by the function (SE) P= 4. 741 (0. 469) - 0. 001630 (0. 0005) V- 0. 226 (0. 102) M using data from 2006 to 2010 for the Brisbane central market. Both income and cost elements in the gross margin were subject to sensitivity analysis. 'Harvesting' and 'Handling/Packing' 'Groups' of 'Activities' were the major contributors to variable costs (each > 20...|$|E
40|$|Mushrooms {{are highly}} transpiring and respiring commodities. The plastic films {{commonly}} used for fresh produce have lower water vapour permeability {{relative to the}} transpiration rate of mushrooms. Therefore, excessive moisture accumulation occurs inside the package causing condensation. Fluctuations in temperature along the supply chain aggravate the problem further. The objective {{of the present study}} was to actively control the headspace relative humidity using hygroscopic salt (NaCl) incorporated directly into the <b>punnet</b> matrix. Humidity regulating trays prepared with an active layer containing 18 % (w/w) salt were used to pack mushrooms and the amount of water absorbed/condensed was compared with trays without salt. The headspace relative humidity in the salt containing trays was 92. 7 % as compared to 100 % in control-PP tray. The salt containing tray absorbed 1. 1 g of water vapour during first day of packaging and reached its maximum capacity after 8 days (2. 2 g). This absorption capacity was far too low for the packaging of 250 g mushrooms which demanded a capacity about 5 to 10 g resulting in excessive condensation inside the humidity regulating tray. In conclusion, the humidity regulating trays have not enough capacity to absorb sufficient amount of water vapour from the package headspace containing mushrooms...|$|E
40|$|Author for Correspondence The {{study on}} the effect of pre-cooling methods on shelf life of white button {{mushroom}} was undertaken to select the suitable pre-cooling method as well as package material for extending the shelf-life of mushroom based on physico-chemical quality and sensory evaluation under different storage conditions. The white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) were pre-cooled using different methods viz. hydro cooling, room cooling, forced air cooling & vacuum cooling and packaged in polybags (Polypropylene & Polyvinyl chloride) and punnets (High impact polystyrene & Polyvinyl chloride). These pre-cooled and packaged samples were stored under ambient conditions. The analysis was carried out to estimate the quality and shelf-life of the stored mushroom during storage period. The parameters evaluated were PLW (%), colour change (ΔE), appearance (browning index), texture (firmness), tyrosinase activity, change in volume (%) and sensory evaluation. PLW (%) and colour change (ΔE), change in volume (%) and tyrosinase activity increased whereas firmness, appearance and overall acceptance (through sensory evaluation) were decreased during storage period. Based on these physic-chemical quality parameters and sensory evaluation, it was found that vacuum cooling was the best method of pre-cooling followed by forced air cooling & room cooling and <b>punnet</b> packages (HIPS & PVC) were the best packaging material followed by PP & PVC for extending the shelf-life and maintaining the quality of white button mushroom upto 4 days storage. The statistical analysis was also done to check the significance of pre-cooling time for different pre-cooling methods, colour change and firmness during storage...|$|E
