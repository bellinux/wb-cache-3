In 2006 the Nordic Chemicals Group granted funds to the Nordic <b>Product</b> <b>Register</b> Group to start a joint Nordic project on "The Nordic Product Registers and the future REACH substance database. Comparison of the registration systems and options for future developments". The objective {{of the project was}} to clarify the extent of overlap between REACH substance database and the Product Registers and characterize the added value of the Nordic Product Registers. The REACH substance database and the Product Registers are different systems. These differences are compared and discussed in this report with proposals for use of <b>Product</b> <b>Register</b> information in the implementation of REACH...|$|E
40|$|All the Nordic {{countries}} have a <b>Product</b> <b>Register.</b> The information (data collected) in the registers differ slightly, but is quite similar. For the reporting industry, a questionnaire answered earlier told us, {{it will be}} an advantage to report the same data to all the Nordic Product Registers. The Nordic Product Registers have all participated in a subgroup under the Nordic <b>Product</b> <b>Register</b> Group. The aim for the group is to harmonize the reporting to the individual Product Registers. As a new step the group has made a XML standard for use when reporting electronically. Earlier another subgroup has developed a set of Product type codes (UCN – Use Codes Nordic) which all the Nordic Product Registers have agreed to. The XML standard is a collection of entities and elements for sending/receiving information. In the table the entities and elements are explained, see also the data model description. The standard is primarily aimed at information to the Nordic Product Registers. It can be expanded to cover all chemical related information exchange.

40|$|Increased {{awareness}} {{of the effects of}} hazardous substances on {{human health and the environment}} has led to a growing demand for information regarding use and release patterns of such substances. For the past few years, Statistics Norway has been working on new statistics on the consumption and emission of hazardous substances in Norway. At present, the statistics cover the emissions of hazardous substances caused by the use of products that are subject to the duty of declaration to the Norwegian <b>Product</b> <b>Register.</b> The statistics include about 450 substances that are categorised as being CMR (may cause cancer, be mutagenic or generate reproductive disorders), chronically toxic, sensitising and/or dangerous for the environment. The emission of hazardous substances to the surroundings (including air, soil and water) is calculated by multiplying the amount consumed of a substance by an emission factor. The emission estimates include diffuse emissions. This means that not only emissions from production of products containing the substance, but also emissions from the subsequent use of these products are included. The consumption of a substance is expressed as the sum of production and import, minus export, declared to the <b>Product</b> <b>Register.</b> The emission factor represents the fraction of the substance that is not incorporated into a new product, transformed into a new compound, or handled in some other way (e. g. as waste). The fraction of a hazardous substance emitted is assumed to be dependent both on the type of product used and the sector in which it is used. The model and its emission factors have been gradually improved, incorporating an increasing amount of information. In the present model, the majority of the emission factors are specific for the combination of product type and industrial sector. Some are product-specific factors, while a few emission factors are specified for the combination of product type, industrial sector and substance. The first two groups of emission factors are obtained from two Swedish studies, while the substance-specific factors are based on consultations with relevant industry...|$|E

This is quite straight forwarded process, though it requires enabling and supporting functions in order to succeed. With these functions are referred to the organization’s business processes and information systems, which in combined enable and support organization’s sales. Organization’s offering is constantly changing and respectively {{the amount of information}} related is increasing. In addition to the changes, the business requirements and ways of working may change as well. This leads to development of business processes and information systems, which has to adapt for the change. Researched company faces challenges with product data, its management and information system renewals, and at the same time, compliance issues with its parent company. Thus, the research objective is to introduce a holistic model for product data management, which includes the known and upcoming information system renewals and as well considers the mentioned compliance issues. To create a holistic model for product data management within given requirements, a two-part research was conducted consisting of theoretical section and the empirical section. Theoretical section is based on scientific literature about research areas and the empirical section is based on qualitative data analysis, in which the analyzed data is received from total of 17 interviews. With theoretical and empirical sections, the holistic model is created. Results showed that the product data is scattered, deficiency of information, lack of documentation and large quantity of tacit knowledge. For information systems, <b>Product</b> <b>Register</b> is obsolete, ERP-system will be replaced and Sinfos has altered requirements. Recommendations include that product data related functions to be revised, documented and trained properly. In addition, segregation of duties should be revised and person in charge should be named. <b>Product</b> <b>Register</b> should be replaced with a system consisting of product master data and linkage to the new ERP-system, and it covers the changed requirements for Sinfos. Upcoming ERP renewal has to be considered when dealt with other renewals and in information systems architecture. For further research, the effect and execution of implemented solutions for depicted challenges should be studied, in contrast to the theoretical literature...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To obtain {{knowledge}} about the use and distribution of hazardous chemicals in Danish industry. This knowledge is used to regulate the occupational environment and prevent hazardous exposure. METHODS [...] A national survey {{on the use of}} chemicals was carried out in 1989 in a stratified sample of 1448 Danish businesses. 13, 000 different chemical products were reported. Information on components in the chemical products was obtained from the Danish <b>product</b> <b>register</b> data base (PROBAS) and by inquiries to suppliers and manufacturers. At {{the end of the study}} the composition of about 9400 of the products was known. A model was developed to estimate national numbers of chemical exposure events as a supplement to data on weights of chemicals used. RESULTS [...] Data are presented for 36 chemical substances with chronic toxic effects and high estimated national numbers of exposure events for the industry groups included in the survey. Seven of the 36 substances are carcinogens, 17 are reproductive toxicants, 12 are allergens, and 18 are neurotoxicants according to listings of chronic toxicants used by the Danish authorities. The largest national number of exposure events was estimated for the industry groups manufacture of fabricated metal products, and personal services, cleaning, and hair dressing. These should have special attention in further preventive work. CONCLUSIONS [...] This survey on the use of chemicals is the first nationwide investigation in Denmark to delineate the use of all chemicals. The data have been used in a project to review occupational hazards in general in Danish industry. In the future, the data may be used as a basis for measuring chemical substitution, developing chemical safety, and as reference for more specific investigations and for follow up studies. Also job exposure matrices based on actual use of chemical products can be constructed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a general theoretical {{framework within which}} a heterogeneous group taxpayers confront a market that supplies a variety of schemes for reducing tax liability, and uses this framework to explore {{the impact of a}} wide range of anti-avoidance policies. Schemes differ in their legal effectiveness and hence in the risks to which they expose taxpayers - risks which go beyond the risk of audit considered in the conventional literature on evasion. Given the individual taxpayer’s circumstances, the prices charged for the schemes and the policy environment, the model predicts (i) whether or not any given taxpayer will acquire a scheme, and (ii) if they do so, which type of scheme they will acquire. The paper then analyses how these decisions, and hence the tax gap, are influenced by four generic types of policy: * Disclosure – earlier information leading to faster closure of loopholes; * Penalties – introduction of penalties for failed avoidance; * Policy Design – fundamental policy changes that design out opportunities for avoidance; * <b>Product</b> <b>Register</b> - the introduction of GAARs or mini-GAARs that give greater clarity about how different types of scheme will be treated. The paper shows that when considering the indirect/behavioural effects of policies on the tax gap it is important to recognise that these operate on two different margins. First policies will have deterrence effects – their impact on the quantum of taxpayers choosing to acquire different types schemes as distinct to acquiring no scheme at all. There will be a range of such deterrence effects reflecting the range of schemes available in the market. But secondly, since different schemes generate different tax gaps, policies will also have switching effects as they induce taxpayers who previously acquired one type of scheme to acquire another. The first three types of policy generate positive deterrence effects but differ in the switching effects they produce. The fourth type of policy produces mixed deterrence effects.

40|$|SMED {{is short}} for Swedish Environmental Emissions Data, which is a {{collaboration}} between IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, SCB Statistics Sweden, SLU Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, and SMHI Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. On behalf of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Swedish EPA), Swedish Environmental Emissions Data (SMED), has further developed the calculation model for estimating the national emissions of NMVOC and CO 2 from use of solvents in Sweden. The model has been revised {{in order to meet}} international reporting requirements according to CLRTAP and UNFCCC as well as to support national needs. The model makes it possible to test different sets of emission factors within the solvent use sector. This function can be used to assess different actions and emission reduction potentials. Furthermore, the model can generate emissions per user category and product group. This information can be used when following-up the Swedish environmental quality objectives. The calculation model is consumption-based with a product-related approach. Amounts of NMVOC and C in solvents and solvent-based products, produced in, imported to, used in, and exported from Sweden, was derived from the Swedish <b>Product</b> <b>Register</b> hosted by the Swedish Chemicals Agency. Emission factors from the literature have been used as far as possible, but in the case when emission factors are unavailable, country specific emission factors have been developed. The most significant sources of emissions of NMVOC and CO 2 during recent years are “Other solvent use” (NFR 2. D. 3. i), “Domestic use” (NFR 2. D. 3. a) and “Coating applications” (NFR 2. D. 3. d). The new model results in reduced national emissions of NMVOC and CO 2 from solvent use in comparison with previous estimates (- 18 % 1990, - 10 % 2005 and - 28 % for 2010 for NMVOC). This is mainly due to the following changes in the model: Reallocation of activities from 2. D. 3. i “Other solvent use”. In previous estimates an emission factor of 0. 95 was used for all activities reported in this NFR-code. In the revised model the emission factor depends on which NFR-code the activity has been allocated to. Introduction of a new emission factor for products that are used diluted in water. In previous estimates these products were not treated separately, and consequently an emission factor of 0. 95 was used. In the new model an emission factor of 0. 275 is used. Simultaneously, however, the new model results in increased emissions for the following NFR-codes: “Domestic use” (NFR 2. D. 3. a) : An increase from 2002 and onwards. This is mainly due to an increased use of the following product groups: washer fluid, degreasing agents and ignition fluids. Other solvent use (NFR 2. D. 3. i) : An increase since 1995. The increase is mainly due to a greater use of the product groups preservatives, refrigerants, metal mordants/etchants and coolant agents. To conclude, the new Swedish method for estimating emissions of NMVOC and CO 2 from Solvent Use is more transparent, complete and better adapted to its purposes compared to previous methods. The design of the model makes it easy to adjust emission factors and include new years in the time series, which facilitates consistent annual updates of time series in the future...|$|E
