40|$|Humans {{respond to}} foreign antigen by {{generating}} plasma Abs and memory B cells (MBCs). The Ab response then declines, sometimes to below {{the limit of}} detection. In contrast, MBCs are generally thought to be long-lived. We tested and compared Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) -specific Ab and MBC responses in two populations of children: (i) <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> children who had documented Pf infections several years ago, but minimal exposure since then; and (ii) persistently exposed children living in a separate but nearby endemic area. We found that although Pf-specific plasma Abs were lower in <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> children compared with persistently exposed children, their cognate MBCs were maintained at similar frequencies. We conclude that serological analysis by itself would greatly underestimate the true memory of Pf-specific Ab responses in <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> children living in areas where Pf transmission has been reduced or eliminated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{contrast}} to many crickets and katydids, adult male camel crickets (Orthoptera: Raphidophoridae) do not stridulate {{and do not}} produce audible air-borne calling songs to attract females for mating. The mating behavior of most camel cricket species is undescribed; how pair-formation occurs is unknown, but chemical cues seem one likely possibility. In the camel cricket Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus Rehn, we test (1) the role of chemical cues in conspecific attraction, and (2) {{the role of the}} abdominal tubercles of adult males in producing those cues. We show (1) that virgin adult females are attracted to paper towels <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to adult males, and (2) that paper towels <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to adult males with exposed tubercles are more attractive than paper towels <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to adult males with exper-imentally closed tubercles. In addition, we present Scanning Electron Microscope photos of adult male tubercle structure that are consistent with their putative role in producing chemical cues...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to investigate the mechanism underlying the endothelium-dependent relaxations to perindoprilat, a converting enzyme inhibitor, in canine coronary arteries <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to bradykinin. Rings suspended in organ chambers were exposed to bradykinin for 3 min and washed extensively for 150 min. In rings <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to the peptide, bradykinin induced relaxations which were augmented {{in the presence of}} perindoprilat; this response was not affected by indomethacin, but nitro-L-arginine induced a rightward shift of the relaxation to the peptide without affecting its maximal effect. In canine coronary arteries <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to the peptide, perindoprilat caused endothelium-dependent relaxations (IC 50 = 7. 83), which had been observed previously at concentrations where the converting enzyme inhibitor did not augment the response to bradykinin. Carboxypeptidase B 2 but not aprotinin, impaired the relaxation to perindoprilat, suggesting a contribution of bradykinin. The relaxation to perindoprilat was not affected by the B 2 antagonist Leu 8 -des-Arg 9 -bradykinin. However, the bradykinin B 2 antagonist HOE- 140 displayed a noncompetitive antagonism against the response to perindoprilat. The response to the converting enzyme inhibitor was not affected by indomethacin but was impaired significantly by nitro-L-arginine. The present findings suggest that in canine coronary arteries <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to bradykinin, the relaxation to perindoprilat is mediated mainly by endothelium-derived nitric oxide. In addition, the response to perindoprilat may be due to factors other than just protection of bound bradykinin from degradation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Arguably, the {{majority}} of worldwide domestic disasters are well-managed by local and regional resources. The health consequences focus on the direct effects of the disaster and rarely, if ever, challenge the workforce to re-focus attention and resources on emerging indirect consequences of mortality and morbidity. That is the case, however, when disasters involve large swaths of geography, dense populations, and the intensity to compromise and <b>expose</b> <b>gaps</b> in the daily protections that the public health infrastructure and system provide. 1 True to form, these latter disasters keep us honest by revealing {{the state of the}} public health protections through exposing their vulnerabilities. 2 These vulnerabilities frequently <b>expose</b> <b>gaps</b> in the aging public health infrastructure that is easily overwhelmed or compromised by the event or has suffered budgetary lapses that would have prevented further devastation. 1 Public health emergencies only recently have come to the attention of North American disaster planners who, in the pre-Katrina era, considered themselves safely protected from the health consequences considered to be relegate...|$|R
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Individuals who saw {{pictures}} for 1 to 3 s {{in the laboratory}} were tested 17 years later by mail. Identifica-tion rates were significantly higher for fragments from these <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> targets than for novel fragments, whereas the same stimuli evoked no differences in control groups {{that had not been}} <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to the pic-tures. Priming—the memorial advantage conferred by prior perceptual experience—was stable over the years (r 5. 51). Priming was dissociated from episodic memory, in that it was present even in subjects who reported no conscious recollection of their participation in the original laboratory session. These findings suggest that the per-ceptual representation system is an invulnerable memory system functioning below conscious awareness. Over the past two decades, the longevity of implicit memory...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{find that}} {{exposure}} to different types of categories or assortments in a task creates a mind-set that changes how consumers process information in subsequent tasks. That is, these mind-sets have a spillover effect that alters consumers' decision making {{in a variety of}} subsequent and unrelated tasks, from basic cognitive behaviors (e. g., grouping) and consumer decisions (e. g., new product adoptions) to more general decision-making strategies (e. g., susceptibility to heuristics). Consumers <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to broad assortments or categorizations base their decisions on fewer pieces of information, typically those made salient by the environment. In contrast, consumers <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to narrow assortments or categorizations employ multiple pieces of information, both salient and nonsalient, without exerting any extra effort. Consequently, prior exposure to broad versus narrow categorizations leads to greater susceptibility to some common context effects and to heuristic decision making...|$|R
50|$|The same {{experiment}} {{demonstrated the}} persistence of initial affect. During a second session, participations were primed with the same characters, but these characters were preceded by a different face {{that they were not}} <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to (e.g. those <b>previously</b> <b>exposed</b> to the smiling face were now exposed to the neutral polygon). Participants continued to show preference for the characters based on the first association, even though the second exposure was preceded by a different affective stimulus. In other words, the second priming was ineffective because the effects of the first priming still remained. If the participant liked a character following exposure to a smiling face, they would continue to like the character even when it was preceded by a frowning face during the second exposure. (The experimental outcome was statistically significant and adjusted for variables such as non-affective preference for certain characters).|$|R
