5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} of extensive declines in extant populations since the introductions of humans, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> the {{larger and more}} specialized lemurs. As long as habitats continue to shrink, degrade and fragment, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E
5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Hawker Hunters deployed to Sweden in 1965 for training in air-to-ground delivery of ordnance, and intermittently thereafter, but annual training abroad for the Swiss Air Force {{did not begin}} until 1985. The use of Swiss air space for combat training became increasingly impractical as the performance of supersonic jets increased and created environmental restrictions. The Swiss modified their traditional stance of neutrality to seek other facilities, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> NATO European members, to meet their training needs.|$|E

5|$|After {{the change}} in organisation, Chetham's {{could no longer afford}} to provide {{education}} based on scholarships and other allowances, and began charging fees. In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new block was built, opening in 1955. By 1960 the numbers of boys admitted had increased significantly, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> day pupils; 230 non-boarding students attended that year, alongside 64 boarders.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> Syrians.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{critical}} acclaim, The Wire received poor Nielsen ratings, which Simon {{attributed to the}} complexity of the plot; a poor time slot; heavy use of esoteric slang, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> the gangster characters; and a predominantly black cast. Critics felt the show was testing the attention span of its audience and that it was mistimed {{in the wake of the}} launch of the successful crime drama The Shield on FX. However, anticipation for a release of the first season on DVD was high at Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

5|$|Himmler was {{interested}} in mysticism and the occult from an early age. He tied this interest into his racist philosophy, looking for proof of Aryan and Nordic racial superiority from ancient times. He promoted a cult of ancestor worship, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> members of the SS, {{as a way to}} keep the race pure and provide immortality to the nation.|$|E
5|$|Later in the century, the {{production}} declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware. However, {{the products of}} Hebron continued to be sold, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> the poorer populace, particularly by travelling Jewish traders from the city. At the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna, Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained {{an important source of}} income for Hebron with four factories making 60,000 francs per annum.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are unusual among {{primates}} {{for their}} rapid dental development, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> the largest species. For example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption. By contrast, anthropoid primates exhibit slower dental development with increased size and slower morphological development. Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, {{and have their}} full permanent dentition at weaning.|$|E

5|$|Miller's career started {{during the}} reign of behaviorism in psychology. Behaviorists {{questioned}} whether mental thought processes were fit for scientific study, not being observable. They focused on working with responses to stimuli, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> other animals. Miller disagreed. He, Jerome Bruner, and Noam Chomsky are considered the founders of the field of Cognitive Psychology that replaced behaviorism as the framework for analyzing the mind.|$|E
5|$|Musical contest, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> the Maguindanao, {{have become}} a unique feature of these kulintang performances. They occur at almost all the formal {{occasions}} mentioned above, particularly weddings. What has made the Maguindanao {{stand out from the}} other groups is that they practice solo gong contest – with individual players showcasing their skill on the various ensemble instruments – the agung, gandingan and the kulintang – as opposed to only group contest, where performers from one town and another town are pitted against each other.|$|E
5|$|The kabosy (or kabosa) is a four to six-stringed simple guitar {{common in}} the {{southern}} Highlands moving toward the east, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> the Betsimisaraka and Betsileo ethnic groups. The soundbox, which is typically square or rectangular today, was originally circular in form, first made from a tortoise shell and later from wood carved into a rounded shape. Mandolina and gitara are the Antandroy names of a popular Southern chordophone similar to the kabosy but with nylon fishing line for strings and five or seven movable frets that facilitate modification of the instrument's tuning.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{the term}} bhakti, meaning devotion, is not {{confined}} to any one deity. However, Krishna is an important and popular focus of the devotionalism tradition within Hinduism, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> the Vaishnava sects. Devotees of Krishna subscribe to the concept of lila, meaning 'divine play', as the central principle of the universe. It is a form of bhakti yoga, one of three types of yoga discussed by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{original}} theatrical release, The Wiz {{was a critical}} and commercial failure, and {{marked the end of}} the resurgence of African-American films that began with the blaxploitation movement of the early 1970s. Despite its initial failure, the film became a cult classic, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> African-American audiences, Oz enthusiasts, and fans of Michael Jackson. Certain aspects of this film adaptation influenced The Wiz Live!, a live television adaptation of the musical, aired on NBC in 2015.|$|E
5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories of sexuality so sharply defined {{by the government and}} society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E

5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> stallions.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|Following birth it was common, <b>particularly</b> <b>among</b> richer families, {{to employ}} a wet-nurse {{to care for the}} child, {{sometimes}} living in with the family. Few sources give an insight into the experiences of young children in this period. Some parents played with their children and parents demonstrated grief at their loss. The primary responsibility for bringing up young children fell on the mother. For older children, the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, {{but it is not clear}} how widely these practices were adopted.|$|E
