5000|$|... {{forcibly}} return or [...] "refoul" [...] {{refugees to}} the country they've fled from (Article 33). It is widely accepted that the prohibition of forcible return is part of customary international law. This means that even States that are not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention must respect the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> Therefore, States are obligated under the Convention and under customary international law to respect the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> If and when this principle is threatened, UNHCR can respond by intervening with relevant authorities, and if it deems necessary, will inform the public.|$|E
30|$|For example, {{states that}} are {{a party to the}} 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol are obligated not to return (refoule) a person to frontiers where they may face persecution. The {{obligation}} <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> is contained in Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and is widely recognised as a fundamental <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the Refugee Convention.|$|R
25|$|Freedom of {{domicile}} {{anywhere in}} the country (art. 24) and protection against extradition without consent (art. 25) are rights reserved to Swiss citizens. However, foreigners enjoy the guarantee <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> provided by article 25.|$|R
40|$|<b>Non-refoulement</b> is a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> {{international}} law that precludes states from returning {{a person to}} a place where he or she might be tortured or face persecution. The principle, codified in Article 33 of the 1951 Refugee Convention, is subject to a number of exceptions. This article examines the status <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> in {{international law}} in respect to three key areas: refugee law, human rights law and international customary law. The findings suggest that while a prohibition on refoulement is part of international human rights law and international customary law, the evidence that non-refoulement has acquired the status of a jus cogens norm is less than convincing...|$|R
5000|$|Though the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> is a {{non-negotiable}} {{aspect of}} international law, states have interpreted this article {{in various ways}} and have constructed their legal responses to asylum seeker in corresponding manners. The four most common interpretations are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Per Article 3(2) of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition and Article 4(5) of the 1981 Inter-American Convention on Extradition, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> {{also applies}} to {{extradition}} {{cases in which the}} person believes they will be tried or biased based specifically on one of the protected factors.|$|E
50|$|Malta has in {{the past}} {{considered}} adopting a push-back policy towards approaching migrants, pushing their boats back to Libya. Such a policy, contrary to international law and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement,</b> has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights in a case against Italy, as it does not allow prospective asylum seekers to file their claims for international protection.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{critical analysis of}} the policies aimed at deterring economic migrants on the international legal right to seek asylum enshrined in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 and the obligation <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> contained in Article 33 of the Convention on the Status of Refugees 1951...|$|R
50|$|Article 3 of the 1933 Convention {{relating}} to the International Status of Refugees contained the first mention <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> in international law and prevented party states from expelling legally-residing refugees or turning away refugees at the borders of their home countries. This treaty was ratified by only a few states and gained little traction in international law.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, Operation Sovereign Borders {{is still}} in effect, with {{international}} law allowing Australia to deny any vessel entry into their territorial waters, as long as Australia does not return these asylum seekers to a place in which they may be threatened. Australia therefore recognises there to be no violation of their international obligations, as refusing entry of asylum seekers does not equate to a breach <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> ostensibly protects {{persons from}} being {{expelled}} from {{countries that are}} signatories to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, or the 1984 Convention Against Torture. This, however, has not prevented certain signatory countries from skirting the international law principle and repatriating or expelling persons {{into the hands of}} potential persecutors.|$|E
5000|$|The rights {{promulgated by}} the Convention {{generally}} still stand today. Some {{have argued that}} the complex nature of 21st century refugee relationships calls for a new treaty that recognizes the evolving nature of the nation-state, population displacement, and modern warfare. [...] Nevertheless, ideas like the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> (Article 33) are still applied today, with the 1951 Convention being the hallmark of such rights.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Parker intervened {{on behalf}} of Salvadoran rebel {{commander}} Nidia Diaz, captured after being shot by government forces {{during the civil war}} in that country. Diaz' imprisonment and subsequently arranged surgery were widely publicized when actor Mike Farrell of M*A*S*H* fame assisted a neurosurgeon during the operation. Throughout the war, Ms. Parker participated in investigative delegations and testified in numerous forums about humanitarian law violations, as well as the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Non-refoulement (...) is a {{fundamental}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> international law which forbids a country receiving asylum seekers from returning them to {{a country in which}} they would be in likely danger of persecution based on [...] "race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion" [...] (See Article 33 below). Unlike political asylum, which applies to those who can prove a well-grounded fear of persecution based on certain category <b>of</b> persons, <b>non-refoulement</b> refers to the generic repatriation of people, including refugees into war zones and other disaster locales. It is a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> customary international law, as it applies to states that are not parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol. It is also a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the trucial law of nations.|$|R
40|$|Extract For {{decades the}} {{international}} community has conducted a delicate and politically charged balancing act trying to reconcile the inexorable increase in refugees - and the need to find permanent homes for them - with the fundamental right of all countries to have secure frontiers. While the notion <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> remains fundamental to the treatment of asylum seekers, their rights vis a vis the states in which they seek asylum are significantly circumscribed by their alien status...|$|R
50|$|These are the {{accepted}} terms and criteria as principles and a fundamental {{part in the}} 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status <b>of</b> Refugees <b>non-refoulement</b> order.|$|R
50|$|Other {{examples}} accepted or {{claimed as}} {{customary international law}} include the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> and immunity of visiting foreign heads of state. United Nations Security Council in 1993 adopted Geneva conventions as customary international law because since the time being it has transformed itself into customary international law. If any treaty or law has been called as customary international law then parties which have not ratified said treaty will be bound to observe its provisions in good faith.|$|E
5000|$|The Australian Government {{has been}} accused by the UNHCR and more than fifty Australian legal {{scholars}} of violating the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement,</b> by returning 41 Tamil and Singhalese refugees to the Sri Lankan Navy in June or July 2014, as part of Operation Sovereign Borders immigration and border protection policy. [...] This action was followed in September 2014 by a Bill tabled in the Australian Parliament that would remove Australia's non-refoulement obligations, and sought to reinterpret Australia's international treaty obligations.|$|E
5000|$|The Young Mizo Association (YMA) is a {{voluntary}} association in Mizoram whose mandate {{is to provide}} community service, which includes [...] "conservation of Mizo culture and heritage". In the past, it has issued orders forcing Chins to leave Mizoram {{because they do not}} want foreigners in their country. This breaches the international <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> because if Chins were to be sent back to Myanmar, persecution and suffering would be inevitable for them. One interviewee who spoke to the HRW recalled that members of the YMA carried sticks and went to each of the Chins' houses to ensure that they left Mizoram. The police also arrested Chins who did not leave and confined them in jail.|$|E
40|$|I {{believe that}} the {{analysis}} underlying the leveraged right to asylum is conceptually flawed. As I will show, there is no duty <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> that binds all states {{as a matter of}} customary international law and it is not the case that all persons entitled to claim protection against refoulement of some kind are ipso facto entitled to refugee rights. These claims are unsound precisely because the critical bedrock of a real international legal obligation-namely, the consent of states evinced by either formal commitments or legally relevant actions -does not yet exist...|$|R
50|$|Many Shi'a Iraqis fleeing Saddam Hussein in the 1990s {{moved to}} Lebanon. A 2007 article by the journal Middle East Report {{reported}} that Lebanon hosted around 40,000 Iraqi refugees. About 80% of Iraqi refugees live in Lebanon's capital of Beirut, contrary {{to many other}} Middle Eastern countries where Iraqi refugees are entirely concentrated in an urban center. Lebanon has instituted a policy <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> Refugees living in Lebanon cannot be forcibly deported if their lives will be in danger in their home countries. Like in other Middle Eastern host countries, Iraqi refugees in Lebanon face {{the negative effects of}} unemployment and poverty as they cannot obtain work visas.|$|R
50|$|Refugee law and {{international}} human rights law are closely connected in content but differ in their function. The main difference of their function {{is the way in}} which international refugee law considers state sovereignty while {{international human rights}} law do not. One of the main aspects of international refugee law is non-refoulement which is the basic idea that a country cannot send back a person to their country of origin if they will face endangerment upon return. In this case, a certain level of sovereignty is taken away from a country. This basic right <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> conflicts with the basic right of sovereign state to expel any undocumented aliens.|$|R
50|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> arises {{out of an}} {{international}} collective memory {{of the failure of}} nations during World War II to provide a safe haven to refugees fleeing certain genocide {{at the hands of the}} Nazi regime. Following World War II, the need for international checks on state sovereignty over refugees became apparent to the international community. During the war, several states had forcibly returned or denied admission to German and French Jews fleeing the Holocaust. After the war, millions of refugees and prisoners from the Soviet Union were forcibly returned despite concerns they would face retaliation from the Soviet government. In turn, the Soviet government tortured or killed more than two million of those sent back by Western governments.|$|E
5000|$|Syria, like Jordan, {{is not a}} {{party to}} the 1951 UNHCR Convention and 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which {{explicitly}} prohibit refoulement. However, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> is recognized as customary international law, and therefore binding on the entire international community. It is nevertheless evident that Syria has worked hard, through 2007, to take on as many refugees as possible in absence of substantial international funding. Up to this point, Syrian officials have not made any wide-scale effort to deport illegal refugees from the country. While the US may have a [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to the Iraqi refugees, under existing international law it has been difficult to establish a case that the United States bears primary legal responsibility.|$|E
50|$|According to a Tel-Aviv University {{document}} the Law {{does not consider}} the motives of the person for crossing the border and entering Israel. It also enables the establishment of Tribunals for the Prevention of Infiltration, in which judges will preside who are military officers (but who do not necessarily possess legal knowledge) and enables the tribunal to deviate from the rules of evidence. The penalties for infiltration are severe - and may reach imprisonment for five years. The author states that in practice, no uniform practice is employed in relation to persons who cross the border and apply for asylum. Some have been held for periods {{of two or three}} years in prison, others have been released from prison on various conditions, while others have not been allowed to enter Israel at all and were returned to the place from which they came (in possible breach of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement).</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, the European Commission on Human Rights {{recognized}} non-refoulement as {{a subsidiary}} of prohibitions on torture. As the ban on torture is jus cogens, this linkage rendered the prohibition on refoulement absolute and challenged the legality of refoulement {{for the purposes of}} state security. Through court cases (see Soering v. United Kingdom and Chahal v. United Kingdom) and interpretations of various international treaties in the 1980s, the European Commission on Human Rights shifted preference away from preserving state sovereignty and towards protecting persons who might be refouled. This interpretation permitted no abridgments <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> protections, even if the state was concerned a refugee may be a terrorist or pose other immediate threats to the state.|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{political}} and legal implications concerning alleged U. S. extraordinary renditions of suspect terrorists on European soil. The author considers this practice as a clear violation of the jus cogens norm <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> and, more particularly, a crime against humanity. The author highlights the inadequacy of controls of European states’ systems on internal and foreign secret services and consequently the necessity that their activities be subject to democratic control. The author excludes that those responsible for extraordinary renditions could invoke immunity as state organs and affirms the necessity {{that the relationship between}} state immunity and human rights could be defined more precisely by national and international courts. Finally, the author proposes solutions at the national and international level to avoid human rights violations caused by extraordinary renditions...|$|R
5000|$|More than 1,000 Degar (Montagnard) {{refugees}} have entered Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri, Cambodia, since 2001, raising issues of Cambodia's international law obligations toward refugees and {{its right to}} control its border. The government has a policy of deporting Degar refugees to Vietnam, viewing them as illegal immigrants to the country, and has threatened prosecution of Ratanakiri residents who aid them. [...] Human rights organizations have described this policy {{as a violation of}} Cambodia's international law obligation <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> (not forcibly returning refugees to a country in which they will be harmed). [...] Though the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has become involved processing asylum applications, refugees are often forcibly returned before they are able to apply for asylum. Many {{refugees have}} hidden in Ratanakiri's forests to avoid deportation.|$|R
5000|$|Prime Minister Joseph Muscat {{has some}} {{worrying}} reservations over [...] "some groups" [...] that promote radical sunni Islam {{in the form}} of salafism, and has largely relied on the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque's administration to help managing the crisis. The integration process of refugees within Maltese society has failed because of the large number of foreigners coming within a short period. Most refugees who arrive in Malta are from war-torn Islamic countries, some with fundamentalist ideologies, such as Libya, Somalia and Syria. Extremist remarks against western countries by muslims {{have been reported in the}} northern region of Malta. Mario Farrugia Borg, being a muslim himself, has called for drastic measures against [...] "illegal migration". The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has ruled against Joseph Muscat's opt for [...] "pushback" [...] of illegal migrants to Libya, despite the threat some refugees may present, as this goes against the fundamental human right <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> Imam Elsadi has distant himself from Islamic extremism but still supporting fundamental principles of Islam. Elsadi does not believe there are threats of terrorism in Malta but does not rule out extremism symphatisers among the local Muslim community. The Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) have taken some precautions for this matter.|$|E
5000|$|According to Article 4.6, once an {{application}} is received, the Russian authorities should issue a certificate to asylum seekers. The FMS will then conduct a Refugee Status Determination (RSD), {{a process that}} could take up to one year. The FMS will first assess the admissibility of the asylum seeker's claim and, if found admissible, then examine the individual case on the merits (substantive examination). Article 3.3 states that these determination {{must be based on}} an interview, completion of a questionnaire and examination of the credibility of the data provided. If the application is denied and the applicant does not appeal to the Russian courts, the individual becomes immediately excluded from the Law on Refugees. The Department of Passport and Visa Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs begins the process of deporting the individual. If the individual does not leave in the specified time frame, usually six months, the Ministry can detain the individual. However, Article 12.2(2) allows the FMS to grant temporary asylum to those individuals who cannot be deported for humanitarian reasons. This concept of [...] "non-refoulement", or expressly prohibiting the expulsion of a refugee into an area where she or he might be again subjected to persecution, is well documented in the 1951 Convention - but not explicitly stated in Russian law. Russia's answer to the fundamental <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> is to offer temporary asylum status, subject to revocation, to those who might again be subject to persecution.|$|E
5000|$|Podemos is {{an example}} of a strong {{resurgence}} from the left across Europe to crippling austerity measures in several countries that have left citizens homeless, jobless, and without hope. In Spain, nearly 25% of people are unemployed and evictions have reached a rate of as high as 500 per day among a wide variety of other economic issues, leading to a number of generally peaceful protests seeking change in the way the government handles them. In addition to forming the foundation of Podemos as well as Ciudadanos, another fundamentally anti-austerity and anti-corruption party, these protests have elicited multiple attempts by the government to silence them culminating in what many see as “something out of the generalissimo’s handbook”. The measures the law takes to silence the voices of the Spanish people are absolutely devastating, including unimaginably steep fines or jail time for disrespecting police officers (600 euros), taking and sharing images of state security forces that might endanger them or their operations” (30,000 euros), protesting in front of government buildings, protesting at a time or location not approved by the police (600,000 euros), or even using a hashtag in a tweet publicizing an event that breaks the rules in any way. Internet activity alone can result in up to five years behind bars. The law also extends to even more restrictive and vague measures, such as “playing games or sports in public spaces that are not designed for such activity” (1000 euros), “projecting ‘luminous devices’ (e.g. lasers) in the vicinity of public transport in a way that ‘might cause accidents’” (600,000 euros), insulting the state or “participating in the disruption of citizens’ security while using hoods, helmets, or any other article of clothing or object that covers the face, rendering identification difficult or impossible” (30,000 euros), and “failure to cooperate with law enforcement during crime investigations or in the prevention of acts that might put citizens’ security at risk” (30,000 euros). Acts of terrorism under the act include clauses as loosely defined as “the commission of any serious crime against…liberty.” According to Spain’s interior minister, Jorge Fernández Diaz, “It’s a law for the 21st Century. It provides better guarantees for people’s security and more judicial security for people’s rights.” What is allegedly an act against terrorism “to guarantee a freer and more peaceful coexistence for all Spaniards…eradicating violence,” ironically quite seriously threatens this ideal by making police and federal security personnel (who are often responsible for committing this type of violence) significantly less accountable, while expanding the role of private security forces “lacking both proper training and the proper level of public accountability” (assuming that normal police forces do indeed possess these qualities). Another problem with this policy is that it is fundamentally anti-immigrant in nature, crippling the group targeted most severely by austerity measures even more by forcing everyone to present identity documents at internet cafés, prohibitively complicating undocumented migrants’ communications outside the country. The law also contains a provision validating and formalizing the process of expulsion for Moroccans who jump the border fence into Spain’s African outposts of Ceuta and Melilla, which according to the International Federation for Human Rights “restricts the right to seek asylum and violates the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> and the prohibition of collective expulsions” as well as “exposing migrants to a serious risk of torture and ill-treatment by denying them the possibility of filing a claim against law enforcement personnel in case of abuse.” ...|$|E
40|$|If {{there are}} two groups of {{individuals}} who currently have very little support among the American people and legislature, it is surely immigrants and criminals. As a result, {{the brunt of the}} 1996 immigration reforms fell hardest upon those with criminal backgrounds. The campaign to reform the immigration laws was sold to the American public as a campaign to expel 2 ̆ 2 undeserving aliens, 2 ̆ 2 chief among them the so-called 2 ̆ 2 criminal aliens. 2 ̆ 7 However, this politically expedient reform was executed {{at the expense of the}} United States obligation <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> under the Convention Relating to Refugees. As a result, untold numbers of refugees are now eligible to be returned to certain death and imprisonment because of minor or unproven criminal histories. Every such instance of refoulement will constitute a violation of international law...|$|R
40|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the transfer of sovereignty from British to Chinese rule, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has consistently tried to maintain {{a reputation as a}} jurisdiction that enjoys an independent judiciary and the rule of law. However, over the past decade, a series of events in particular areas have challenged this perception. The status of refugees and how they are treated represents one such area. The status of asylum seekers has always been a matter of concern as Hong Kong has never been a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Additionally, recent court decisions regarding the question <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> and the absence of a government screening process for refugees make it increasingly difficult for observers to accept Hong Kong as a forward-looking, world-class city. This article examines recent decisions that deal with Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s obligations under international law regarding avoiding the ejection of refugees to jurisdictions where they will likely face persecution or torture. In particular, this article focuses on C. and Others v. Director of Immigration, in which Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s Court of First Instance considered whether an obligation <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> exists, and whether Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s government has a duty to provide a screening process to determine the status of all refugee claimants. Also explored is an earlier decision by Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s Court of Final Appeal, Secretary for Security v. Prabakar, in which a screening procedure for torture claimants was established. In light of these decisions, this article outlines the current procedures used to determine refugee status and highlights the difficulties faced by refugees while awaiting resettlement in a third country. This article argues that the administration does in fact have a legal obligation under both international and Hong Kong law to provide asylum seekers a fair and transparent means of refugee status determination...|$|R
40|$|Both {{geographic}} and normative constraints restrict access to surrogate {{international human rights}} protection for those seeking a haven from serious human rights abuses. Primary among territorial restrictions has been the fall-out from the US Supreme Court’s decision in Sale v. Haitian Council Centers in which the court explicitly ruled that nothing in US statutory law, or in the 1951 Convention on Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, precluded the interdiction of Haitian refugees in international waters and their return to the country of origin without an effective interview on their protection clams. This ruling is in transparent contradiction to the general international law norm <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> according to modern scholarship and emerging case law. This paper concludes that Sale should be overturned by statute as should related pre-screening practices. A new standard of “jurisdiction ” should be adopted which {{does not depend on}} territorial access to a signatory state but on whether the state is exercising power in fact. Similar concerns exist with respect to safe third countr...|$|R
