5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was <b>painted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{predominantly}} military character, {{the castle}} {{is one of}} the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were <b>painted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were <b>painted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess. The one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.|$|E
5|$|Following its return, Sea Cloud {{received}} a reassembled rigging in 1947, {{and a new}} set of twenty-nine sails in 1949. The vessel was painted white, and a gold eagle <b>painted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bow. The ship's reconstruction took nearly four years. Marjorie Merriweather Post retained ownership of Sea Cloud in the aftermath of her divorce from Mr. Davies, since she had originally brought the ship into the marriage. After evaluating the cost of running a year-round crew of seventy-two, Marjorie Merriweather Post decided to sell the ship.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the oldest}} sectors of Dubrovnik was {{constructed}} around a Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards {{a bit more than}} it does today. It was constructed {{on the site of the}} Pre-Romanesque cathedral and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably <b>painted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Božidarević around 1500.|$|E
