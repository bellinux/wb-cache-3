5000|$|The {{struggle}} against corroding galvanized iron pipes {{eventually led to}} a replacement by copper or <b>plastic</b> (PVC) <b>piping</b> by the 1960s. Copper and plastic do not possess that zinc layer that naturally corrodes to expose the base metal to decay. Still, however, natural substances such as hair, grease, or other oils continued {{to be an issue}} in drain clogs, and so, the development of more effective chemical drain cleaners became necessary.|$|R

The population of this area related to the use of polluted canal water. In the new filtration plant canal water passes through a concrete tank containing broken locally made bricks, then through a horizontal roughening filter, and finally a standard slow filter. Clear water is handpumped from the tank The Blue Nile project supplies the new filter to each village at a cost of about 2, 400 US dollars. The plants are constructed by the villagers and one person in each village is trained in the basic maintenance of the filter and pump.

50|$|Copper: As {{a common}} {{plumbing}} material, copper pipes and associated fittings are readily available.

50|$|Polypropylene (PP) {{is useful}} for such diverse {{products}} as reusable plastic food containers, microwave- and dishwasher-safe plastic containers, diaper lining, sanitary pad lining and casing, ropes, carpets, <b>plastic</b> moldings, <b>piping</b> systems, car batteries, insulation for electrical cables and filters for gases and liquids. In medicine, it is used in hernia treatment and to make heat-resistant medical equipment. Polypropylene sheets are used for stationery folders and packaging and clear storage bins. Polypropylene {{is defined by the}} recyclable plastic number 5. Although relatively inert, it is vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation and can degrade considerably in direct sunlight. Polypropylene is not as impact-resistant as the polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE). It is also somewhat permeable to highly volatile gases and liquids.|$|R
40|$|The {{replacement}} of metals with <b>plastics</b> in <b>piping</b> Systems {{is a well}} established practice in a vast range of public and industrial applications. However, difficulties still exist, mainly related to the limited chemical resistance of the polymers commonly used in pipe manufacturing to some conveyed fluids. This prevents using plastic pipes in important applications such as the transport of liquid hydrocarbons, particularly in oil fields. The use of chemically resistant polymers, such as fluorinated polyolefins, is precluded by high cost and poor mechanical properties. Co-extrusion of multi-layer pipes carrying an internal chemically resistant liner can be a viable alternative capable to extend the use of plastic pipes to refining and chemical industries. An experimental PE/PA multi-layer pipe has been developed whose resistance to diffusion and mechanical properties have been tested. Tests in real oil fields confirm the good performance of the new pipes...|$|R
50|$|Tapered {{threaded}} fittings {{are sometimes}} used on <b>plastic</b> <b>piping.</b> Due to the wedging {{effect of the}} tapered thread, extreme care must be used to avoid overtightening the joint. The overstressed female fitting may split days, weeks, or even years after initial installation. Therefore many municipal plumbing codes restrict the use of threaded plastic pipe fittings.|$|E

50|$|Central vacuum cleaners, {{also known}} as {{built-in}} or ducted, are a type of canister/cylinder model which has the motor and dirt filtration unit located in a central location in a building, and connected by pipes to fixed vacuum inlets installed throughout the building. Only the hose and cleaning head need be carried from room to room, and the hose is commonly 8 m (25 ft) long, allowing a large range of movement without changing vacuum inlets. <b>Plastic</b> or metal <b>piping</b> connects the inlets to the central unit. The vacuum head may be unpowered, or have beaters operated by an electric motor or by an air-driven turbine.|$|R
5000|$|Bradford Gary Corbett (October 15, 1937 - December 24, 2012) was {{the owner}} of the [...] Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball's American League from 1974 to 1980.

5000|$|The main {{use of this}} {{technology}} is in residential buildings where the demand for hot water has a large impact on energy bills. This generally means a situation with a large family, or {{a situation in which}} the hot water demand is excessive due to frequent laundry washing. Commercial applications include laundromats, car washes, military laundry facilities and eating establishments. The technology can also be used for space heating if the building is located off-grid or if utility power is subject to frequent outages. Solar water heating systems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities with water heating systems that are expensive to operate, or with operations such as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities of hot water. Unglazed liquid collectors are commonly used to heat water for swimming pools but can also be applied to large scale water pre-heating. When loads are large relative to available collector area the bulk of the water heating can be done at low temperature, lower than at swimming pool temperatures where unglazed collectors are well established in the marketplace as the right choice. Because these collectors need not withstand high temperatures, they can use less expensive materials such as plastic or rubber. Many unglazed collectors are made of polypropylene and must be drained fully to avoid freeze damage when air temperatures drop below 44F on clear nights. A smaller but growing percentage of unglazed collectors are flexible meaning they can withstand water freezing solid inside their absorber. The freeze concern only need be the water filled piping and collector manifolds in a hard freeze condition. Unglazed solar hot water systems should be installed to [...] "drainback" [...] to a storage tank whenever solar radiation is insufficient. There are no thermal shock concerns with unglazed systems. Commonly used in swimming pool heating since solar energy's early beginnings, unglazed solar collectors heat swimming pool water directly without the need for antifreeze or heat exchangers. Hot water solar systems require heat exchangers due to contamination possibilities and in the case of unglazed collectors, the pressure difference between the solar working fluid (water) and the load (pressurized cold city water). Large scale unglazed solar hot water heaters like the one at the Minoru Aquatic Center in Richmond BC [...] operate at lower temperatures than evacuated tube or boxed and glazed collector systems so they require larger more expensive heat exchangers but all other components including vented storage tanks and uninsulated <b>plastic</b> PVC <b>piping</b> reduce costs of this alternative dramatically compared to the higher temperature collector types. When heating hot water we are actually heating cold to warm and warm to hot. We can heat cold to warm as efficiently with unglazed collectors as we can heat warm to hot with high temperature collectors ...|$|R
5000|$|ABS (Acrylonitrile {{butadiene}} styrene): Another popular <b>plastic</b> <b>piping</b> material, {{more expensive}} and less common than PVC but available in the same sizes and pressure ratings.
