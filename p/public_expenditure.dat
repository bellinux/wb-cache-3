The major findings of this study are the high increase of the <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> for all the countries especially in 2009, due to a huge increase of the social protection expenditures.

This paper aims to investigate the association between the regulated wholesale prices of medicinal products and the <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> for medicinal products, and to estimate regression model for <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> for medicinal products in the non hospital consumption. In the empirical research are included 758 regulated prices for medicinal products prescribed by the outpatients’ department on a prescription (Rp) during the years 2003 – 2010, which are financed from <b>public</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The correlation and regression analyses are used {{in order to establish}} the association between the regulated wholesale prices for medicinal products and the <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> for medicinal products. The correlation analysis confirmed a strong positive correlation of the <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> for medicinal products with the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, a weak correlation with the wholesale prices for medicinal products and with the classification lists of medicinal products. The multiple regression analysis confirmed a positive significant impact of the wholesale price of medicinal products and the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, on the <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> for medicinal products. The research has confirmed the association of the <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> for medicinal products with the regulated wholesale prices for medicinal products.

It is determined that <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> in Norway follow a stabile course between 2000 and 2013, there is a settled fiscal structure, reforms are made in public administration {{for the quality of}} services released to the public to be increased, and the country is not affected from the global financial crisis.
