25|$|The west tunnel was {{the most}} {{difficult}} of the three tunnels to excavate. It was excavated using a tunnel boring machine (TBM) that took over four years to bore its way through the mountain. The TBM was launched from the Waterman Portal and tunneled in a westerly direction toward the Devil Canyon portal at a slight uphill gradient of approximately 2inches per 100 linear feet (0.17%). Crews faced many challenges during the excavation, including the 2003 Old Fire that destroyed construction equipment at the Waterman Portal and halted tunneling for ten days. Later that year, a flash flood engulfed the Waterman <b>Portal</b> <b>site</b> and submerged the TBM. It took four months to restore operations {{in the aftermath of the}} flooding.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began in October 1998 with the {{excavation}} of the Gilman Portal and dewatering work at the two intermediate shafts. Tunnel excavation was carried out from November 1999 through July 2001 using a shielded TBM. Construction {{of the tunnel}} included many challenges. The TBM had to bore its way through diverse ground conditions consisting of weak sedimentary rocks; strong, fractured metamorphic rocks; and alluvium, {{all of which were}} below the groundwater table. Special measures such as probing and grouting ahead of the TBM and, in particular, deep dewatering wells, were demonstrated to be effective for controlling adverse ground conditions. The project also showed the advantage of working from a portal. The Gilman <b>Portal</b> <b>site</b> proved to be ideal, supporting very efficient mining and muck disposal operations and also allowing long pipe sections to be installed in the tunnel, significantly reducing the amount of field welding required.|$|E

Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Jane Stevenson of the <b>portal</b> <b>site</b> Canoe concurred: [...] "What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert." [...] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: [...] "As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's [...] "surprisingly accomplished effort" [...] of Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody" [...] proved that One Direction are [...] "more than capable" [...] of evolving their sound.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Portal</b> <b>site</b> {{mediated}} adsorption is a {{model for}} site-selective activated gas adsorption in metallic catalytic systems that contain {{a variety of different}} adsorption sites. In such systems, low-coordination [...] "edge and corner" [...] defect-like sites can exhibit significantly lower adsorption enthalpies than high-coordination (basal plane) sites. As a result, these sites can serve as [...] "portals" [...] for very rapid adsorption {{to the rest of the}} surface. The phenomenon relies on the common [...] "spillover" [...] effect (described below), where certain adsorbed species exhibit high mobility on some surfaces. The model explains seemingly inconsistent observations of gas adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics in catalytic systems where surfaces can exist in a range of coordination structures, and it has been successfully applied to bimetallic catalytic systems where synergistic activity is observed.|$|E

40|$|A {{great number}} of customers, who want to watch movies usually check out online reviews before {{choosing}} what to watch a movie. The most representative online media that customers consult are <b>portal</b> <b>sites</b> and SNS (Social Network Service). Although {{there have been numerous}} studies on online eWOM (e-Word of Mouth) and the effects of online media in businesses, it remains a question that which media is best for WOM (Word of Mouth) when selecting movies. This research examines customer’s intention for consulting eWOM and for watching movies according to the number and tendency of online replies. We have compared <b>portal</b> <b>sites</b> and SNS about information of movie. The study shows {{that a large number of}} positive replies can affect the intention for WOM and choosing movies. Facebook has more influence than <b>portal</b> <b>sites</b> when choosing what to watch when replies consist of large and positive comments.

40|$|Purpose –Increasingly {{the company}} websites, {{along with the}} {{intermediary}} websites such as <b>portal</b> <b>sites</b> have become an integral component of the firms brand strategy. This study emphasises the importance of website service elements within <b>portal</b> <b>sites</b> and the impact on e-retailer brand attitudes and brand identity in an ever more competitive digital market-space. Design/methodology/approach– The research employs structural equation modeling technique to capture the relationship among website attitude, e-service quality, brand attitude and brand identity. Findings–The results from the study indicate consumer attitude perceptions toward portal website and e-service elements combine to increase brand attitude and also brand identity for e-retailers. Originality/value –Although {{there has been a}} plethora of studies evaluating corporate websites and branding interactions there is limited comprehension of the impact of intermediary <b>portal</b> <b>sites.</b> Moreover, the literature is limited in validating the link between e-services with brand attitude and brand identity within a portal website context. This study develops a framework that highlights the important influence of e-services within portal websites and the impact on the firm’s brand. ...|$|R
