40|$|Background: The use of bovine {{in vitro}} embryo {{production}} (IVP) increases the reproductive potential of genetically superior cows, enabling {{a larger scale}} of embryo production when compared with other biotechnologies. However, deleterious effects such as abnormal fetal growth, longer gestation period, increased birth weight, abortion, preterm birth and higher rates of neonatal mortality {{have been attributed to}} IVP. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the influence of in vitro embryo production and artificial insemination (AI) on gestation length, complications with birth, birth weight, method of feeding colostrum, <b>passive</b> transfer of <b>immunity,</b> morbidity-mortality, and performance in Brahman calves. Results: Whilst gestation length and birth weight were significantly increased in IVP-derived calves, no difference in weaning weight was observed between groups. The <b>passive</b> transfer of <b>immunity</b> (PT), was assessed in IVP (n = 80) and AI (n = 20) groups 24 hours after birth by determination of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and gammaglobulin activity as well as by quantification of the concentration of total protein in serum. No differences in passive transfer or incidences of dystocia and diseases at weaning were observed between groups. Birth weight, method of feeding colostrum and dystocia were not correlated with PT in either group. Conclusions: In this study, in vitro embryo production did not affect the health status, development, or <b>passive</b> transfer of <b>immunity</b> in Brahman calves...|$|R
25|$|Maternal <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> {{is a type}} of {{naturally}} acquired <b>passive</b> <b>immunity,</b> and {{refers to}} antibody-mediated immunity conveyed to a fetus or infant by its mother. Naturally acquired <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> can be provided during pregnancy, and through breastfeeding. In humans, maternal antibodies (MatAb) are passed through the placenta to the fetus by an FcRn receptor on placental cells. This occurs predominately during the third trimester of pregnancy, and thus is often reduced in babies born prematurely. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the only antibody isotype that can pass through the human placenta, and is the most common antibody of the five types of antibodies found in the body. IgG antibodies protects against bacterial and viral infections in fetuses. Immunization is often required shortly following birth to prevent diseases in newborns such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, polio, and pertussis, however, maternal IgG can inhibit the induction of protective vaccine responses throughout the first year of life. This effect is usually overcome by secondary responses to booster immunization.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} to <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> is that producing antibodies in {{a laboratory}} is expensive and difficult to do. In order to produce antibodies for infectious diseases, {{there is a need}} for possibly thousands of human donors to donate blood or immune animals' blood would be obtained for the antibodies. Patients who are immunized with the antibodies from animals may develop serum sickness due to the proteins from the immune animal and develop serious allergic reactions. Antibody treatments can be time consuming and are given through an intravenous injection or IV, while a vaccine shot or jab is less time consuming and has less risk of complication than an antibody treatment. <b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> is effective, but ephemeral (lasting a short amount of time).|$|E
25|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> is also {{provided}} through colostrum and breast milk, which contain IgA antibodies that are {{transferred to the}} gut of the infant, providing local protection against disease causing bacteria and viruses until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. Maternal antibodies protect against some diseases more than others such as measles, rubella, and tetanus compared to the protection provided against polio, and pertussis. Maternal <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> offers immediate protection, though protection mediated by maternal IgG typically only lasting {{four to six months}} after birth. Protection mediated by IgA is dependent on the length of time that an infant is breastfed, {{which is one of the}} reasons the World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for at least the first two years of life.|$|E

40|$|Risk factors {{associated}} with failure of <b>passive</b> transfer of <b>immunity</b> (FPT) were evaluated among newborn beef calves in Québec. Physical examination was performed on calves born of a normal calving and blood samples were collected for determination of health status and measurement of serum concentration of immunoglobulin (Ig) G 1. Of 225 calves, from 45 herds, 19 % showed FPT (serum IgG 1 concentration < 10. 0 g/L). Calves born in a stanchion-stall {{were more likely to}} show FPT (OR: 10. 2). Calves bottle-fed colostrum were less at risk for FPT (OR: 0. 06). Calf gender, month of birth, dam parity, and dam body condition score were not associated with FPT.

25|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> is the {{transfer}} of active humoral immunity {{in the form of}} ready-made antibodies. <b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta, and it can also be induced artificially, when high levels of antibodies specific to a pathogen or toxin (obtained from humans, horses, or other animals) are transferred to non-immune persons through blood products that contain antibodies, such as in immunoglobulin therapy or antiserum therapy. Passive immunization is used when there is a high risk of infection and insufficient time for the body to develop its own immune response, or to reduce the symptoms of ongoing or immunosuppressive diseases. Passive immunization can be provided when people cannot synthesize antibodies, and when they have been exposed to a disease {{that they do not have}} immunity against.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{observed}} from this equation that, ceteris paribus, any increase in either vaccine coverage or vaccine effectiveness, including any increase in excess of a disease's HIT, further reduces {{the number of cases}} of a disease. The rate of decline in cases depends on a disease's R0, with diseases with lower R0 values experiencing sharper declines. Vaccines usually possess at least one contraindication for a specific population for medical reasons, so it is vital for both effectiveness and coverage to be high so that herd immunity can be established to protect these individuals. Vaccine effectiveness is often, but not always, adversely affected by <b>passive</b> <b>immunity,</b> so additional doses are recommended for some vaccines while others are not administered until after an individual has lost his or her <b>passive</b> <b>immunity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Immunity can be {{acquired}} either actively or passively. Immunity is acquired actively {{when a person}} is exposed to foreign substances and the immune system responds. <b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> is when antibodies are transferred from one host to another.

In essence, immunotherapy, tested in clinical trials, relies upon provision of <b>passive,</b> humoral <b>immunity</b> by intravenous infusion of the humanized mouse monoclonal antibodies. In addition to inhibiting cells’ proliferation by blocking HER- 2, these antibodies’ efficacy could rely upon assembling of the patients’ adaptive immune response. However, in patients, exhausted by the disease and rounds of systemic therapy, and with cancer progression over {{the time needed to}} assemble that response, it is hardly possible.|$|R

Additionally, fresh frozen plasma and human albumin transfusions can help replace the extreme protein losses seen in severe cases and help assure adequate tissue healing.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate passive transfer of naturally acquired immunity to WNV to foals born in a herd of semi-feral ponies, not vaccinated against WNV, in an endemic area, with many dams having seroconverted because of natural exposure. Microwell serum neutralization titers against WNV were determined in all mares and foals. Serum IgG concentration was determined in foals by serial radial immunodiffusion. Differences in IgG concentration between seropositive and seronegative foals were examined by means of the Mann-Whitney U-test. Linear regression was used to evaluate the association between mare and foal titers. Seventeen mare-foal pairs were studied; 1 foal had inadequate IgG concentration.
