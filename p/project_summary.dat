50|$|This {{case study}} {{examined}} the political relationship established between First Nations and Canada through historical treaties. Did the treaty relationship include, either directly or indirectly, a shared {{understanding of how the}} cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples would be treated by Settlers and by the governments they established? How might this historical relationship serve Settler-First Nations relations today? Based on a careful examination of published primary and secondary materials related to treaty negotiations in central Ontario and the Northwest Territories, the study applies historical, oral-historical, and anthropological methods and attempts to identify aspects of these historic treaties which have resonance for current IP debates around topics such as property, ownership, and jurisdiction.

50|$|Hoffbauer, {{who became}} a U.S. citizen in 1941, {{continued}} his association with Disney for several years. The studio executive sent the Napoleon filmstrip and a <b>project</b> <b>summary</b> to British movie producers Alexander and Vincent Korda. While not opting for the Napoleon endeavor, they offered to employ Hoffbauer on a production of War and Peace. However, World War II soon ensued, and the project was cancelled. Hoffbauer later worked for Paramount Studios as a technical consultant on the movie Monsieur Beaucaire. In 1948, the Fairbanks Company hired him as a technical advisor and artist. In 1951, {{at the request of}} the University of California, Hoffbauer gave a lecture in French based on his father’s book Paris à Travers les Ages to commemorate the 2,000th anniversary of the founding of Paris. Reviving the possibility of a production of War and Peace, Hoffbauer contacted director Fred Zinneman about working on an upcoming Mike Todd film based on the novel. To Hoffbauer’s disappointment, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis acquired the rights to the story and made the movie without the artist’s assistance. Hoffbauer and his wife left California and moved to Rockport, Massachusetts in May 1952. In nearby Boston, Hoffbauer painted an additional mural for the New England Life Insurance Company. For the Hayden Planetarium, he painted one of his most unusual works—a tempera showing the surface of the moon with the Earth just above the moon’s horizon. Hoffbauer continued an active painting career for the remainder of his life.|$|E
50|$|Reintroduction {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} young discipline {{and continues to be}} a work in progress. There is still no general and broadly accepted definition of reintroduction success, it has been proposed that the criteria widely used to assess the conservation status of endangered taxa, such as the IUCN Red List criteria, should be used to assess reintroduction success. Successful reintroduction programs should yield viable and self-sustainable populations in the long-term. The IUCN/SSC Re-introduction Specialist Group & Environment Agency, in their 2011 Global Re-introduction Perspectives, compiled reintroduction case studies from around the world. 184 case studies were reported on a range of species which included invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, and plants. Assessments from all of the studies included goals, success indicators, <b>project</b> <b>summary,</b> major difficulties faced, major lessons learned, and success of project with reasons for success or failure. A similar assessment focused solely on plants found high rates of success for rare species reintroductions. An analysis of data from the Center for Plant Conservation International Reintroduction Registry found that, for the 49 cases where data were available, 92% of the reintroduced plant populations survived two years.The Siberian tiger population has rebounded from 40 individuals in the 1940s to around 500 in 2007. The Siberian tiger population is now the largest un-fragmented tiger population in the world. Yet, a high proportion of translocations and reintroductions have not been successful in establishing viable populationsFor instance, in China reintroduction of captive Giant Pandas have had mixed effects. The initial pandas released from captivity all died quickly after reintroduction. Even now that they have improved their ability to reintroduce pandas, concern remains over how well they captive bred pandas will fare with their wild relatives.|$|E
5000|$|You {{can find}} {{a history of the}} TAC-funded {{proposals}} on the TAC <b>Project</b> <b>Summary</b> Page. Over most of its history, the TAC program has funded proposals from faculty members modifying individual courses or a small group of courses to incorporate several of the skills listed among the TAC IT Goals. The program has also funded department-wide proposals, in which a department decides on a series of courses that will advance student technology skills in a deliberative way, as the student progresses through the program or major. Individual proposals often involved a one-year funding cycle, in which a faculty member (or a few faculty members) would design a new assignment that incorporated student technology skills, implement it during one or two semesters, and write a report back to the TAC program assessing the success of the project. Department-wide proposals often extended over multiple years, as a group of faculty members incorporated new assignments into a series of courses, providing interim and annual assessment reports for each year that the department received TAC funding. A good example of a department-wide project was the Technology in the NCC Curriculum project, in which several faculty in the New Century College developed a series of technology-based assignments, trained other NCC faculty in the use of those assignments, and described those assignments in a detailed online report. An example of a very ambitious, [...] "individual" [...] project is the U.S. History Online project, in which two faculty members developed a series of online modules for a particular course, teaching students how to think like historians and how to use various online sources and tools to interpret historical events and to analyze historical data. Individual TAC projects more typically involve a single assignment with clear, technology-based learning goals, advancing {{one or more of the}} 10 TAC IT goals.|$|E
