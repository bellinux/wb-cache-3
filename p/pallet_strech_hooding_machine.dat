5000|$|The Hood (voiced by Jess Harnell) - A {{criminal}} {{wanted for}} loan sharking, smuggling, jewel heists, and other crimes. His true identity is Lawrence Lorenzo {{who was hired}} to be the police chief. Hood and his henchmen were planning to kidnap Mayor Tilton at the Coco Bongo Club and Lt. Kellaway was appointed to head up the stakeout with his visiting mother attending. When he and his henchmen kidnap Mayor Tilton as well as Lt. Kellaway's mother, Hood reveals his identity to Mayor Tilton and states that he will dispose of him and take over Edge City. The Mask managed to find Hood's hideout in the Cornitos Chips Factory and lured every policeman there. When Hood threatens to use Mrs. Kellaway as a human shield, she manages to stomp on his foot and beat him down with her purse enough to expose Hood's identity to the other cops while Mask tricked Hood's henchmen into going into the bagging <b>machine.</b> <b>Hood</b> and his men were arrested after that.|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} a {{qualitative and quantitative}} study {{of the distribution of}} built-in appliances in Spain as well as an analysis of the trade satisfaction of the main brands of built-in appliances present in the Spanish market. The research also includes an overview of the Spanish kitchen furniture market providing data on kitchen furniture production and consumption, international trade, supply structure, distribution, sales and market share of the leading kitchen furniture manufacturers. Distribution flows of built-in appliances (supply and sales) are analysed by channel. The main is Builder/contract channel (46 %) followed by appliance chains and buying groups (28 %), kitchen and furniture retailers (14 %) and furniture chains/DIY (12 %). As far as the product is concerned (hobs, ovens, <b>hoods,</b> refrigerators, dishwashing <b>machines),</b> the report {{provides a}} breakdown by product type, reference prices as well as ranking of main brands. Brand image analysis is based on strengths and weaknesses pointed out for each built-in appliances' brand according to the following criteria: frequency/easy approach with the supplier, front staff professionalism, punctuality in delivery, post-selling technical assistance, price/quality, aesthetic qualities of product/design, wide range of products and models, innovation, brand fame/advertising, availability of merchandising material. The research is based on 90 qualitative interviews with a selected sample of built-in appliance retailers, built-in appliance wholesalers/importers, buying groups, builders, department stores, do-it-yourself stores, kitchen furniture manufacturers, kitchen furniture retailers, large appliances chains, large furniture chains, associations, media. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} {{perchloroethylene}} (127184) (PERC) exposure in commercial dry cleaning through ventilation was reviewed. Health hazards associated with PERC included {{central nervous system}} depression, liver and kidney damage, memory impairment, dermatitis, respiratory irritation, and other symptoms. Effective ventilation {{was considered to be}} one of the least expensive engineering measures for reducing worker exposures to PERC. Ventilation was used for controlling PERC exposures and thermal comfort, both of which were important in dry cleaning shops. Possible ventilation methods included local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) captured and removed the contaminant at or near the source of release, thereby reducing vapor levels in the worker's breathing zone and minimizing vapor diffusion. PERC vapor exposures were greatest during machine maintenance and loading and unloading. LEV implemented at the loading and unloading door was usually activated by a door interlocking system. The retrofitting of an external ventilation <b>hood</b> outside the <b>machine</b> door was an option for older machines lacking built in exhaust ventilation. General ventilation diluted the concentration of the contaminant before it reached the breathing zone of the worker. It was used to supply conditioned fresh air and exhaust contaminated air from the general work area. A workroom air exchange every 5 minutes involving sufficient volumes of make up air was recommended. Systems of emergency ventilation were needed to control solvent vapors resulting from solvent spills or leaks. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 [principal contributors, Gary S. Earnest, Charles S. Hayden, Daniel S.

40|$|A dryer {{fabric is}} used in the multi-cylinder dryer in order to improve the {{runnability}} of the web and to establish proper contact between the web and the hot cylinder, thus improving the heat transport. The dryer fabric separates the hot and moist paper from the ambient drying air and significantly influences the mass and heat transport. The fabric mass transfer resistance was determined experimentally. The fabric mass transfer coefficient varied in the range of 0. 0034 to 0. 011 m/s and the tortuosity factor in the range of 1. 00 to 1. 59. It was also shown that these properties and the effective thermal conductivity may be determined numerically by evaluating three-dimensional fabric models; something that will strongly facilitate the design of dryer fabrics. Fabric parameters of effective diffusivity, porosity, tortuosity, calliper, effective permeability, effective thermal conductivity, and basis weight were implemented while developing a dynamical model for mass and heat transport in dryer fabrics. Results show that the mass transport in the fabric is mainly diffusive, and that the heat transport is mainly caused by the diffusive mass transport. When the fabric is cooled below the dew point of the air-vapour mixture, water vapour will condense in the dryer fabric structure and strongly enhance the evaporation due to decrease in water vapour concentration in the fabric. The cooling technique is favourable for webs of basis weight higher than 200 g/m 2, i. e. board qualities, in the multi-cylinder dryer; it was shown that the evaporation increased by 22 % for the particular case studied having a basis weight of 400 g/m 2. A dryer fabric with a lower mass transfer resistance may also be used to increase the humidity in the <b>hood,</b> preserving the <b>machine</b> capacity and thus increasing the potential for energy recovery...|$|R
40|$|Detta examensarbete har ägt rum vid Produktionsverkstad 1 (PV 1) på Wexiödisk AB där diskmaskiner av huvtyp tillverkas. Syftet med detta examensarbete har varit att undersöka vilka lagerstyrnings{{modeller}} som är lämpliga för att styra avdelningens materialflöden med. Arbetet har genomförts i två steg. Först behandlades artiklar unika för produkterna vid PV 1, därefter artiklar gemensamma med andra produkter. Enligt modeller ur relevant litteratur utformades förslag på hur dessa kunde appliceras praktiskt. Förslagen presenterades och diskuterades med berörd personal som valde Tvåbingesystem 2. Ett test gjordes enligt principen ”den japanska sjön” vilket innebar lägre lagernivåer i lastbärarna. De problem som uppstod noterades. Resultatet blev att antalet artiklar som plockades i veckosatser minskades vilket skapat underlag för att minska administrationen av tillhörande plocklistor. Plockvagnen har kunnat tas bort vilket frigjort yta vid monteringsavdelningen. Förutsättningar finns att slå samman två plocklistor till en och därmed förenkla arbetet för förrådspersonalen. This degree {{project has}} been performed at Production unit 1 (PV 1) at Wexiödisk AB, where <b>hood</b> type washing <b>machines</b> is manufactured. The purpose of this {{project has been}} to investigate which inventory control models that could be suitable to control the section’s material supplies. The work has been accomplished in two steps. At first, items unique to products manufactured at PV 1 were treated, followed by items common with other products. According models in relevant literature, suggestions were made to how the models could be applied practically. The suggestions was presented to and discussed with the parties concerned who chose Two-bin system 2. A trial was carried out according {{to the principle of}} “the Japanese river” which implied lowered inventory levels. The problems that occurred were noted. The result was that the number of items that was weekly picked and distributed was reduced which has created a basis to also reduce the administration of the systems picking lists. The item wagon has been removed which has cleared floor space at the assembly section. Conditions have been created to merge two picking lists into one and thereby simplify the work for the inventory staff...|$|R
