40|$|Rodrigo, Chamizo, McLaren, & Mackintosh (1997) {{demonstrated}} the blocking effect in a navigational task using a swimming pool: rats initially trained to use three landmarks (ABC) {{to find an}} invisible platform learned less about a fourth landmark (X) added later than did rats trained from the outset with these four landmarks (ABCX). The aim of the experiment reported here was to demonstrate unblocking using a similar procedure {{as in the previous}} work. Three groups of rats were initially trained to find an invisible platfom in the presence of three landmarks: ABC for the Blocking and Unblocking groups and LMN for the Control group. Then, all animals were trained to find the platform in the presence of four landmarks, ABCX. In this second training, unlike animals in the Blocking group to which only a new landmark (X) was added in comparison to the first training, the animals in the Unblocking group also had a change in the <b>platform</b> <b>position.</b> In the Control group, both the four landmarks and the <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> were totally new {{at the beginning of this}} second training. As in Rodrigo et al. (1997) a blocking effect was found: rats in the Blocking group learned less with respect to the added landmark (X) than did animals in the Control group. However, rats in the Unblocking group learned about the added landmark (X) as well as did animals in the Control group. The results are interpreted as an unblocking effect due to a change in the <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> between the two phases of training, similarly to what is normal in classical conditioning experiments, in which a change in the conditions of reinforcement between the two training phases of a blocking design produce an attenuation or elimination of this effect.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) seems a promising avenue in the treatment of cerebral ischemia injury since this neurotrophin could stimulate structural plasticity and repair cognitive impairment. Several findings have displayed that the dysregulation of the CREBâ€“BDNF cascade has been involved in cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cerebral ischemia on learning and memory as well as on the levels of CREB, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), and BDNF, and to determine the effect of minocycline on CREB, pCREB, BDNF, and behavioral functional recovery after cerebral ischemia. Methods: The animal model was established by permanent bilateral occlusion of both common carotid arteries. Behavior was evaluated 5 days before decapitation with Morris water maze and open-field task. Four days after permanent bilateral occlusion of both common carotid arteries, minocycline was administered by douche via the stomach for 4 weeks. CREB and pCREB were examined by Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. BDNF was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Results: The model rats after minocycline treatment swam shorter distances than control rats before finding the platform (P= 0. 0007). The number of times the <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> was crossed for sham-operation rats was more than that of the model groups in the corresponding platform location (P= 0. 0021). The number of times the <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> was crossed for minocycline treatment animals was significantly increased compared to the model groups in the corresponding <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> (P= 0. 0016). CREB, pCREB, and BDNF were downregulated after permanent bilateral occlusion of both common carotid arteries in the model group. Minocycline increased the expression of CREB, pCREB, and BDNF, and improved cognitive suffered from impairment of permanent bilateral occlusion of both common carotid arteries. Conclusion: Minocycline improved cognitive impairment from cerebral ischemia via enhancing CREB, pCREB, and BDNF activity in the hippocampus.

Dams received an unpredictable 90 -min duration restraint stress from gestational day E 17 to E 20. Learning was examined in offspring between day P 24 and P 36 using spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, delayed alternation in the T-maze, water-maze learning and passive avoidance. Both male and female PS rats showed impairments of spontaneous and delayed alternation performances. Acquisition of a fixed <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> in the water-maze was unchanged in PS rats, but the probe test revealed a diminution {{of time spent in}} the training quadrant. Acquisition of a daily changing <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> demonstrated impaired working memory for male and female PS rats. Finally, passive avoidance deficits were observed. Pretreatment with the selective Ïƒ 1 agonist igmesine (1 â€“ 10 mg kgâˆ’ 1 i. p.) reversed the PS-induced learning deficits in offspring rats for each test. The Ïƒ 1 antagonist BD 1063 failed to affect performances alone but blocked the igmesine effect, confirming the involvement of the Ïƒ 1 receptor. PS thus induces delayed memory deficits, affecting spatial and nonspatial, short- and long-term memories in juvenile male and female offspring rats.

40|$|In {{synthetic}} aperture sonar (SAS), the <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> must be known sufficiently accurately for signals {{to be added}} coherently along the {{synthetic aperture}}. Often, the onboard navigation system is insufficiently accurate by itself, so corrections are needed. A well-known method is the displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) procedure for correcting <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> using seabed echoes. DPCA methods {{have the advantage of}} insensitivity to changing interference patterns, moving specular reflection, and changing occlusion, with aspect. However, when seabed echoes are unusable, either because they are too weak, or because they are corrupted by multipath, the seabed DCPA method may fail. Therefore, we present an alternative DPCA method using sonar echoes from a suitable navigation fix, based on an object detected after standard beamforming. In our proposed system, look angle is obtained by tracking the centroid of the rectified image of the fix object. When the standard DPCA correction equations are modified for a fixed reflector, it turns out that they provide incremental range and look-angle errors, precisely the values required when the target itself is used as the navigation fix. Moreover, the values obtained are then self-compensating for errors in estimating seabed depth or forward motion of the platform. The navigation fix is selected by bracketing in range, and beamforming overlapping subsets of the receiver array. In this paper, we present experimental results at transmitter frequencies of 25 and 100 kHz where our method enabled well-focused SAS images to be generated with little recourse to other navigation information. Hence, SAS can be carried out, even when a sophisticated inertial navigation system (INS) is not available...|$|E

In the present study we analyzed learning strategies and memory of 11 -month-old AbetaPPswe/PS 1 dE 9 (AbetaPP/PS 1) mice in the Morris water maze (MWM) task performed after nine months of dietary intervention with a control diet or a Fortasyn diet to characterize diet-induced changes in cognitive performance. The Fortasyn diet had no significant effect on MWM task acquisition. To assess hippocampus-dependent learning, the strategies that the mice used to find the hidden platform in the MWM were analyzed using the swim path data. During the fourth day of the MWM, AbetaPP/PS 1 mice on control diet more often used the non-spatial random search strategy, while on the Fortasyn diet, the transgenic animals exhibited more chaining strategy than their wild-type littermates. During the probe trial, AbetaPP/PS 1 mice displayed no clear preference for the target quadrant. Notably, in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice on Fortasyn diet, the latency to reach the former <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> was decreased compared to mice on the control diet.

40|$|International audienceSynthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) {{data collected}} over a 2 -D synthetic aperture can be processed {{to focus the}} illuminated scatterers in the 3 -D space, using a number of signal processing techniques generally grouped {{under the name of}} SAR tomography (TomoSAR). A fundamental requirement for TomoSAR processing is to have precise knowledge of the <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> along the 2 -D synthetic aperture. This requirement is not easily met in the case where the 2 -D aperture is formed by collecting different flight lines (i. e., 1 -D apertures) in a repeat-pass fashion, which is the typical case of airborne and spaceborne TomoSAR. Subwavelength <b>platform</b> <b>position</b> errors give rise to residual phase screens among different passes, which hinder coherent focusing in the 3 -D space. In this paper, we propose a strategy for calibrating repeat-pass tomographic SAR data that allows us to accurately estimate and remove such residual phase screens in the absence of reference targets and prior information about terrain topography and {{even in the absence of}} any point- or surface-like target within the illuminated scene. The problem is tackled by observing that multiple flight lines provide enough information to jointly estimate platform and target positions, up to a roto-translation of the coordinate system used for representing the imaged scene. The employment of volumetric scatterers in the calibration process is enabled by the phase linking algorithm, which allows us to represent them as equivalent phase centers. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations, in order to validate the results based on the exact knowledge of the simulated scatterers, and using real data from the ESA campaigns AlpTomoSAR, BioSAR 2008, and TropiSAR. A cross-check of the results from simultaneous P- and L-band acquisitions from the TropiSAR data set indicates that the dispersion of the retrieved flight trajectories is limited to a few millimeter...|$|E
