40|$|Xylanase is an {{exogenous}} {{enzyme that}} {{is added to}} non-ruminants diets in order to break down and ameliorate the effects that non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) have on feed digestibility. Dietary supplementary xylanase reduces viscosity of the digesta to improve feed digestibility and growth performance. Recently a study in broiler chickens (Singh et al., 2012) showed {{a significant increase in}} circulating serum peptide-YY (PYY) concentration (p< 0. 001) in response to xylanase supplementation. PYY is a satiety hormone that inhibits gastric motility, increasing digesta retention times in non-ruminants which has also been identified to occur in studies where xylanase has been supplemented. It is thought this could potentially be another mechanism by which xylanase exerts its beneficial effects on growth outcomes. Therefore the aim of the current study was to explore the effects that xylanase (16, 000 BXU/kg diet, Econase XT, AB Vista, UK) supplementation, of a wheat-based feed, has on growth performance parameters and gut/metabolic hormones that are produced from the gastrointestinal tract in pigs, and if age at supplementation affects the efficacy of the enzyme. In a preliminary trial a human multiplex assay (Human Metabolic Hormone Milliplex HMHMAG 34 k kit, Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was successfully used to measure porcine gut/metabolic hormones simultaneously, and the assay was hence used in subsequent trials. In the same trial it was determined that animals subjected to commercial slaughter (S), which had an increased time to tissue sample collection (approximately 18 hours) and exposes carcasses to a 60 °C water bath, did not affect the quality of RNA extracted from gut, pancreatic and liver tissue and subsequent relative abundance of gene transcripts over animals not subjected to this slaughter method (NS). In two trials on weaned piglets, it was found that dietary xylanase supplementation at 0 - 2 weeks <b>post-wean</b> decreased glucose-dependent insulinotrophic peptide (GIP), glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) plasma concentrations (p< 0. 05) which resulted in a tendency for insulin and C-peptide (p< 0. 08) to be decreased in these animals when bloods were analysed at 6 weeks <b>post-wean.</b> Also at this time point PYY concentrations were found to be decreased (p< 0. 01) in animals fed diets supplemented with xylanase between 2 and 6 weeks <b>post-wean.</b> In a third trial, when blood parameters were measured at 13 weeks <b>post-wean,</b> leptin and ghrelin levels were higher in animals provided with the exogenous enzyme, supplemented feed at 0 - 2 weeks <b>post-wean.</b> In conclusion, it was found growth performance in pigs fed a wheat-based diet supplemented with xylanase was not significantly improved at any age. However timing and/or duration of supplementation affected production of certain gut/metabolic hormones, in particular those produced in the pancreas or those that influence production of these hormones, suggesting dietary xylanase supplementation fed to weaned pigs may affect pancreas function and development...|$|R

5000|$|The {{quarantine}} period of animals purchased from other farms, {{an important consideration}} in swine health, is necessary to acclimate the animal and reduce immediate disease exposure. Both in the U.K., and U.S., there are no quarantine requirements and testing procedures for incoming stock, unless individual certification regulators implement barriers for animals coming from conventional farms.

Such measures usually involve sound management and are not always a result from housing and environment considerations of the animal.

Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 568 fecal samples from pre-weaned and <b>post-weaned</b> piglets were collected from eight pig farms from four areas of Heilongjiang Province. The average infection rate of Cryptosporidium was 1. 6 % (9 / 568) by microscopy. 113 samples were subjected to PCR amplification of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene of Cryptosporidium, with 55. 8 % (63 / 113) being positive for Cryptosporidium. Cryptosporidium suis (n = 31) and C. scrofarumn (n = 32) were identified by DNA sequencing of the SSU rRNA gene. Three types of C. scrofarumn were found at the SSU rRNA locus, with one novel type being detected.

Whereas the level of mRNA, encoding aminopeptidase N (relative to that of beta-actin), only varied moderately from the duodenum to the terminal ileum, the amount of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase mRNA exhibited a sharp maximum in the proximal jejunum. For both enzymes, the level of protein synthesis, studied in cultured mucosal explants, correlated well {{with the level of}} mRNA, and no major variation in post-translational processing or intracellular transport was observed along the intestine. The mRNA/specific-activity ratio for both enzymes was markedly (3 - 5 -fold) higher in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, compared with the ileum. This indicates an increased proximal turnover rate, most likely caused by the presence in the gut lumen of pancreatic proteases. In neonatal animals, the level of mRNA for lactase-phlorizin hydrolase in both proximal and distal regions of the intestine was of the same magnitude as in the proximal jejunum of the <b>post-weaned</b> pigs.

E. coli and Salmonella were isolated, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Salmonella was isolated from at least one sample from 51 (64 %) farms and was more prevalent in adult animals than young animals. The predominant serotypes were Cerro, Montevideo and Kentucky. Salmonella isolates were mostly susceptible to all antimicrobials. E. coli were commonly resistant to tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole and ampicillin. Resistance of up to 8 classes of antibiotics was observed in E. coli isolated from young animals. The blaCMY- and blaCTX-M-carrying E. coli were detected in 35 % and 5 % of the farms, respectively. The presence of multi-drug resistant E. coli suggested potential risks to human health associated with dairy farming...|$|R
