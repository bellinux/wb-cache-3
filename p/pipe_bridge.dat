A railway, which has now been dismantled, connected the site to the mine. About [...] from Stainforth, the Don turns towards the north, while the canal continues to the east, passing under the M18 motorway. As it approaches Thorne, it passes under the Sheffield to Hull Railway near Thorne North railway station. [...] Immediately beyond the bridge is Stanilands Marina, followed by Thorne Lock, with a swing bridge crossing its head. The canal turns briefly to the south, to pass under the A614 road and the [...] to [...] railway near Thorne South railway station. The railway remains close to the northern bank {{for most of the}} way to Keadby. There is another marina near Wykewell Lift Bridge, and after Moor's Swing Bridge, the canal crosses open countryside.|$|E

50|$|Cement plaster is {{a mixture}} of {{suitable}} plaster, sand, portland cement and water which is normally applied to masonry interiors and exteriors to achieve a smooth surface. Interior surfaces sometimes receive a final layer of gypsum plaster. Walls constructed with stock bricks are normally plastered while face brick walls are not plastered. Various cement-based plasters are also used as proprietary spray fireproofing products. These usually use vermiculite as lightweight aggregate. Heavy versions of such plasters are also in use for exterior fireproofing, to protect LPG vessels, <b>pipe</b> <b>bridges</b> and vessel skirts.|$|R
50|$|The Medford <b>Pipe</b> <b>Bridge</b> is a {{historic}} plate girder bridge over the Mystic River, between S. Court St. and the Mystic Valley Parkway in Medford, Massachusetts. It was built in 1897 {{as part of the}} Metropolitan Water Board's northern high and low service.|$|E

5000|$|Facilities {{initially}} provided {{included a}} 400 ft long platform, a siding, {{and a small}} ticket office. Several complaints were made over the years about the inadequacy of these facilities, with one such missive in 1895 noting that the platform was in poor shape, a barrier on the <b>pipe</b> <b>bridge</b> was required to control the flow of passengers from the racecourse on to the platform, another siding with a 40 vehicle capacity was required to handle additional traffic, and the ticket office was not suitable. By March 1896 the company had installed a barrier on the bridge and laid a new [...] long siding.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aqueduct}} carrying {{water from}} Haweswater Reservoir to Heaton Park Reservoir in Manchester follows {{the line of}} Longsleddale underground on {{the east of the}} valley, and crosses Stockdale Beck by a <b>pipe</b> <b>bridge.</b> Construction of the aqueduct was started in the 1930s and finally completed in 1976. Survey columns can still be seen on Branstree, Tarn Crag, and Great Howe below Grey Crag. [...] The tunnel is about 2m by 2m in section, and the water flow is gravity-fed. Between Haweswater and Manchester the tunnel only deviates from a straight line by less than 0.6 mi.|$|E
50|$|Four {{inverted}} siphon tunnels cross the particularly deep and wide river valleys of the Durèze, the Garon, the Yzeron and the Trion on <b>pipe</b> <b>bridges</b> raised on high arches. In these, water filled a sunken tank tower (castellum) on {{the brim of}} a slope. The tank effected a transition between open channel flow and a lead pipeline. From the castellum water was carried, now pressurized, {{in a set of}} airtight lead pipes laid side by side, with soldered joints, down the valley slope, across a bridge spanning the river—whose piers and arches are the most notable remains of the system—and up the facing slope, to a tank slightly lower than the head tank, losing just a little hydraulic head in the process. The {{inverted siphon}}s obviated the bridging of deep valleys with arcade upon arcade of arches, as at Pont du Gard, which marks the limit of such a system.|$|R

The weir and water race where used to power the Ceres flour mill once located here. Here the Capital City Trail follows the Merri Creek Trail up the Merri Creek. The Yarra River Trail crosses the Merri Creek here, passes under the Eastern Freeway and starts a long gradual up hill climb to Fairfield Hospital, before {{crossing}} the Yarra river at the pedestrian <b>Pipe</b> <b>bridge</b> at the Fairfield boathouse. The bridge is fairly narrow and {{you will need to}} walk across when it is busy. On {{the eastern side of the}} river the path climbs up steeply to Yarra Boulevard.

50|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{conditions required}} for flutter {{vary with the}} structure's external design and flexibility, but can range from very low velocities to supersonic flows.

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} bridges at this site was a wooden one built in 1767. Later, in 1771, an act was passed that provided {{for the maintenance of}} the bridge as the Queen's Bridge.
