In the Duchy of Warsaw, sejmiks elected deputies to the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw. Similarly, sejmiks of Congress Poland elected deputies to the Sejm of Congress Poland until its abolishment in 1831. Even in the Lithuanian territories incorporated into the Russian Empire, some judicial sejmiks were allowed to elect lower court judges; it was the only elective representative institution to survive in the Lithuanian territories after the <b>partition.</b> In the Prussian <b>partition</b> there were provincial sejmiks (Provinziallandtag) and powiat sejmiks (Kreistag).

The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighbors—Austria, Russia and Prussia—so as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the <b>partition</b> in 1773 during the <b>Partition</b> Sejm convened by the three powers.|$|E

In graph <b>partitioning,</b> the whole graph is divided among different computing nodes that process the graph in parallel. During the early stages of research done on graph <b>partitioning,</b> different offline <b>partitioning</b> methods were introduced; these methods create high computation cost as they process the whole graph prior to <b>partitioning.</b> Therefore, an online graph <b>partitioning</b> method called as streaming graph <b>partitioning</b> was introduced later to reduce the computation cost by assigning the edges or vertices on-the-fly to the computing nodes without processing the graph before <b>partitioning.</b> In our thesis, we presented an experimental study of different streaming graph <b>partitioning</b> methods that use two <b>partitioning</b> techniques: vertex <b>partitioning</b> and edge <b>partitioning.</b> Edge <b>partitioning</b> has proved good for <b>partitioning</b> highly skewed graphs.
