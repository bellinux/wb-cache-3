40|$|A major {{trend in}} the nuclear {{industry}} lately is towards more passive safety systems in power plants. Heat pipes are passive devices {{that have been used}} in many industries to remove heat without any electrical input. A design being examined at UC Berkeley is a fast-spectrum heat pipe reactor, called the Heat Pipe-Encapsulated Nuclear Heat Source (HP-ENHS), which utilizes sodium heat pipes to remove heat from a solid molybdenum reactor core fueled by uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>nitride.</b> This idea has been examined for space reactor applications before, and with a thermal output of 125 MW and the potential to run the reactor with 20 year refueling cycles (from the neutronics data) the HP-ENHS could be suitable for remote sites that are far from the power grid. The focus of this talk will be the ability of the heat pipes to remove heat effectively using a model that predicts the maximum throughput based on capillary limits...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the equation of state of <b>plutonium</b> <b>nitride</b> is presented. First, a simple anion defect model is applied to describe the evaporation behavior both of solid UN and PuN. It {{was found that the}} enormous pressure changes of both the metal vapor and nitrogen across the homogeneity range is represented in a satisfactory manner. Then, the extrapolation into the liquid range is carried out for PuN using a model which is based on an extension of the significant liquid structures theory. This model was developed earlier, in the context of evaluating the urania equation of state. At the present state of the art, significant data uncertainties and inconsistencies still exist, and the extrapolation to into the liquid range introduces further uncertainties. However, the present work produces results which are thermodynamically consistent, and in general agreement with the majority of measured data. (orig.) 13 refs.

40|$|The first {{fast breeder}} reactors, {{constructed}} in the 1945 - 1960 time period, used metallic fuels composed of uranium, plutonium, or their alloys. They were chosen because most existing reactor operating experience had been obtained on metallic fuels and because they provided the highest breeding ratios. Difficulties in obtaining adequate dimensional stability in metallic fuel elements under conditions of high fuel burnup led in the 1960 s to the virtual worldwide choice of ceramic fuels. Although ceramic fuels provide lower breeding performance, this objective {{is no longer an}} important consideration in most national programs. Mixed uranium and plutonium dioxide became the ceramic fuel that has received the widest use. The more advanced ceramic fuels, mixed uranium and <b>plutonium</b> carbides and <b>nitrides,</b> continue under development. More recently, metal fuel elements of improved design have joined ceramic fuels in achieving goal burnups of 15 to 20 percent. Low-swelling fuel cladding alloys have also been continuously developed to deal with the unexpected problem of void formation in stainless steels subjected to fast neutron irradiation, a phenomenon first observed in the 1960 s...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} several specific knowledge gaps {{that exist}} in the use of alternative fuel and cladding combinations in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) environment. In the switch from a UO 2 with zirconium-based cladding to any other combination, there is a multitude of questions that need to be answered. This work examines three of these knowledge gaps: (1) the disposition of weapons-grade plutonium in thorium and silicon carbide cladding, (2) economics of accident tolerant fuel (ATF) claddings and (3) breeding of <b>plutonium</b> in uranium <b>nitride</b> fuel. Burning weapons-grade plutonium in a standard pressurized water reactor (PWR) using thoria as a fuel matrix has been compared to using urania. Two cladding options were considered: a 0. 76 mm thick silicon carbide ceramic matrix composite (SiC CMC) and 0. 57 mm thick standard Zircaloy cladding. A large benefit was found in using thoria compared to urania in terms of plutonium percentage and mass burned. A slightly smaller mass of plutonium is required in a core with SiC CMC cladding, due to its lower neutron absorption compared to Zircaloy. The thorium system was also better from a non-proliferation viewpoint, resulting in less fissile mass at discharge and more fissile mass burned over an assembly's lifetime. A limited safety comparison was made for two reactivity insertion accidents: (1) highest worth rod ejection accident (REA) and (2) main steam line break (MSLB). The MSLB accident demonstrated a safe value for the minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratio. The maximum enthalpy added to the fuel during the REA was also below current regulatory limits for PWRs. This indicates that the more negative moderator temperature coefficients of thoria-plutonia and urania-plutonia fuel, compared to a typical PWR design, were not limiting. For an ATF cladding to replace zirconium alloys, it must be economically viable by having similar fuel cycle costs to today's materials. Four proposed materials are examined: stainless steel (SS), FeCrAl alloy, molybdenum (Mo) and SiC CMC, each having its own development time and costs. The chosen cladding thicknesses were dependent on strength and manufacturing constraints. It was found that all options may end up requiring higher enrichment than zirconium-based claddings for the same fuel cycle length. If the present value of avoiding a reactor accident with a large radioactivity release is estimated using past experience for LWR large accidents and if it is assumed that ATF cladding is able to prevent such release, there is a definite net economic benefit relative to typical Zircaloy cladding only in using SiC, since it only results in a small fuel cycle cost increase. There is only a marginal benefit in using SiC to prevent a core-only loss without radioactivity release (TMI-type) accident and a large loss using metallic ATF concepts. The thermal hydraulic and neutronic feasibility of a nitride fueled pressurized water reactor (PWR) breeder design were examined. Because of its higher fuel density, nitride fuel would be preferable to traditional oxide fuel in attempting to achieve breeding in a PWR. The design chosen uses large hexagonal assemblies with 14 inner seed pin rows and 4 outer blanket pin rows. In this design, reactor grade plutonium of 12. 75 wtHM was used as fuel. Nitride was also simulated as being 100 % N- 15, to limit neutronic penalties and C- 14 production. The as specified assembly model only achieved a fissile inventory ratio (FIR) value above 1. 0 when the thimble regions were assumed to be voided, which lowers the H/HM ratio in the assembly. This led to FIR values above 1. 0 for the oxide, 85 % theoretical density nitride (N 85) and 95 % theoretical density nitride (N 95). All were at an FIR of 1. 03 at 35 MWd/kgHM. However, the single batch discharge burnup of the voided assembly in MWd/kgHM was 32. 2 for N 95, 24. 5 for N 85, while only 15. 6 for the oxide. by Nathan Christopher Andrews. Thesis: Ph.
