5000|$|Electric current {{assisted}} sintering (ECAS) technologies rely on electric currents {{to densify}} powders, with {{the advantage of}} reducing production time dramatically (from 15 minutes of the slowest ECAS to a few microseconds of the fastest), not requiring a long furnace heat and allowing near theoretical densities but with the drawback of simple shapes. Powders employed in ECAS can avoid binders thanks {{to the possibility of}} direct sintering, without the need of <b>pre-pressing</b> <b>and</b> a green compact. Molds are designed for the final part shape since the powders densify while filling the cavity under an applied pressure thus avoiding the problem of shape variations caused by non isotropic sintering and distortions caused by gravity at high temperatures. The most common of these technologies is hot pressing, which has been under use for the production of the diamond tools employed in the construction industry. Spark plasma sintering and electro sinter forging are two modern, industrial commercial ECAS technologies.|$|R

40|$|Occasionally artists need to {{have their}} artwork reproduced. The problem is that most artists do not {{understand}} what {{is involved in the}} four-color prepress and printing processes and, because of this, {{do not know how to}} communicate with printers. Artists often do not realize it is very difficult to make an exact copy of their artwork when it is reproduced by four-color offset lithography and are disappointed with the final printed product. The objective of this thesis project is to educate artists about four-color printing so they can communicate more effectively with printers. A prototype for a booklet entitled An Artist 2 ̆ 7 s Guide to Four-Color Printing was created as a means toward achieving this goal. The existing literature on this subject includes two books written specifically for artists and a book specifically about reproducing artwork. All of these books are currently out of print. The author found five books written for graphic designers and print buyers (effectively an audience with little or no understanding of <b>pre-press</b> <b>and</b> printing processes) about four-color printing that an artist would probably be able to understand, but since they are not written specifically for artists, it is doubtful they would ever locate these books. Three books are written for the trade on this subject in language a person with little or no understanding of <b>pre-press</b> <b>and</b> printing processes could understand. Again it is questionable that an artist would find these works. Both books written for graphic designers and those written for trades people contain small sections about reproducing original artwork. No magazine articles were found on this subject in the leading magazines written for artists. The author theorized that artists would be more likely to read information about four-color printing if it was presented in a visual, concise manner and if it was written specifically for artists. The information for the guide was gathered primarily from two sources. The author felt she would understand the processes involved in four-color printing if she physically went through the process step-by-step. This was accomplished in a case study reproducing five pieces by Rochester artist David Lang. These pieces are hand colored black and white photographs. The case study was documented by the author 2 ̆ 7 s husband, Richard Miller, a professional photographer. Richard 2 ̆ 7 s photographs, accompanied by lengthy captions, comprise the first section of the booklet, showing the reader the <b>pre-press</b> <b>and</b> printing processes step-by-step. The second section in the booklet is entitled Specific Notes About the Reproduction of Artwork. The information for this section was gathered from seven professionals in printing and three artists who have had their artwork reproduced. The glossary was written from the author 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge about the subject except where footnoted. The author designed the booklet and produced it using knowledge about typography and desktop publishing learned at Rochester Institute of Technology. The booklet was reviewed by seven artists to determine whether such a booklet would indeed help them to understand what is involved in four-color printing. A questionnaire was used as a means of collecting responses to the booklet. These responses were tallied and recorded. The response to the booklet was favorable. All of the artists replied that they would be able to communicate with printers more effectively as a result of reading the booklet...|$|R

Compared to traditional presses, high-speed digital copiers are an order of magnitude cheaper, can print cost-efficiently runs as short as a single copy, have small warehousing requirements for the digital storage media, and eliminate the risk of volume forecasting.

To investigate this phenomenon, three different questionnaires were administered to the following groups: human resource managers selected from the top local Rochester commercial printing companies listed in the Rochester Business Journal, alumni from RIT 2 ̆ 7 s School of Print Media, and women with press operation experience. The main purpose of the first survey was to determine how many women were actually employed as press operators in Rochester, New York.

Most of the human resource managers in commercial printing in Rochester declined to answer the survey because of confidentiality issues.

40|$|The {{graphic arts}} and media sector has been {{affected}} by technological developments, particularly {{in the last years}} of the 20 th century. These developments mainly affect the traditional graphic arts companies which aim at <b>pre-press</b> <b>and</b> printing production processes and workflow. Furthermore, changes are taking place in the entire range of the media industry where the traditional graphic arts sector belongs. Because of these developments, the graphic arts and media sector as well as the print media will need to be reorientated. One of the principal components related to the existence and further development of companies are the employees: that is people and individuals that have any kind of professional relationship with the graphic arts and media sector. The changes in the production environment and the application of new technologies and workflows have led to the increase in the importance of education and training as one of the fundamental factors for sector development. This paper investigates the characteristics of print media within the new structure of the media industry and their relationship to the new electronic processes. Furthermore, the current structure and reform strategies that has been applied in education and training, mainly in European Union countries, is explored. As for the further development of the graphic arts and media sector, a new strategy concerning the future structure of education and training is discussed and suggested. This strategy is based on the development of a transnational educational training system for the graphic arts and media sector at a European level. </p...|$|R

The volume {{contains}} extensive {{text and}} 5, 500 colour illustrations and 2, 000 line drawings. It features 1, 052 buildings chosen from 75 countries including the Kuala Lumpar Airport by Kisho Kurokaw (1998) and Jae Cha’s timber and polycarbonate church in Bolivia (2000). This design project represents {{the largest and}} most complex undertaking by the researcher to date. The design strategy was to provide a simple repeatable grid and a series of data bars to contain the unusually large amount of images and information contained on each page. The latter included a cross referencing to other buildings designed by each architect, the size of each building and its cost in US dollars. The volume is zoned in terms of continents and opens with a world data section illustrating the global economic and demographic context of architectural practice. An overview of the demographic, economic and environmental factors that have shaped our built environment was also included together with projections in these areas. The final selection of architectural ‘projects’ was made late in the design process so the researcher evolved and managed a system of putting each of the ‘projects’ together with pages drawn from different files.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} study the {{influence}} of the drawback temperature of metal-ceramics composites on their mechanical properties, if composites are produced using the iron-graphite powder method. The authors have studied the microstructure of the materials and the influence that the thermal treatment produces on their strength, plastic properties and toughness. The authors have also identified specific thermal treatment parameters aimed at the improvement of mechanical properties of parts of machines and mechanisms made of the above composites. The analysis of the authors’ findings is applied to find the ways of improving the mechanical properties of machine parts produced using powder metallurgy methods. The analysis of the microstructure confirms the presence of changes in the mechanical properties of materials, namely, their plastic properties and toughness. The combination of the most efficient sintering regime (using double <b>pre-pressing)</b> <b>and</b> subsequent thermal treatment in the form of hardening and tempering can improve the mechanical properties of machine parts. The authors performed experiments to identify the best sintering conditions and improve the mechanical properties of the Fe-C composition, including its tensile and flexural strength, as well as compressive and impact strength using the above process parameters and other data obtained from the reference literature. The authors have discovered that if the sintering speed and the shrinkage ratio are maximal and vary insignificantly at the temperature near the Ac 3 value and slightly above it, the mechanical properties after sintering, for example, at 870 °C and 1100 °C will differ slightly.
