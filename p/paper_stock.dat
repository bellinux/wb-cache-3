5|$|The first 37 {{issues of}} the main series were {{released}} in thirteen digests titled G.I. Joe Comic Magazine. Subsequently, Tales of G.I. Joe reprinted the first fifteen issues of G.I. Joe on a higher quality <b>paper</b> <b>stock</b> than that used for the main comic. Four Yearbooks (1985–1988) also collected some previous stories, summarized events, and published new stories that tied into the main title, aside from the first Yearbook, which re-printed the seminal first issue. The series was also translated into several languages, including German, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, French (Canada), Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Japanese, Arabic, and Indonesian.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white <b>paper</b> <b>stock.</b> Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but it really was a goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E

A $5.50 MetroCard is available with a round-trip ticket, and a $50 MetroCard is available with a monthly pass. In addition, the machines sell separate $25 MetroCards. TVMs at Jamaica Station and Penn Station sell AirTrain JFK monthly passes {{on the back of}} LIRR tickets. All cards sold from these machines are of thick <b>paper</b> <b>stock,</b> not the normal plastic.|$|E

25|$|This last {{printing}} {{may have}} consisted of several printing runs or perhaps was contracted out to different printers. While no deliberate {{changes to the}} text block have been noted, the binding cloth and the text block's <b>paper</b> <b>stock</b> both changed at times, and flaws developed in the printing plates over time. One of the cloth variants {{is similar to the}} first printing's, but even yellower. Another shows an even weave with light, very even oatmeal coloring that can even seem faintly pink in some light. Its cloth shows deep, vivid blues in the lettering, whereas the others look obviously paler. Yet another variant carries a variegated linen-like weave wherein individual threads can stand out for several centimeters. This latter is as dark as the binding of the third printing (while lacking the yellow cast), but the coloring is so uneven that it might be mistaken as soiled even when clean. Soiling on the other variants, on the other hand, is immediately apparent.|$|E
25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a {{standard}} letter. The seven separate and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The different issues can be distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: perforation gauge, the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the printing method used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of single-line and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a special fluid). In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with China clay paper, but whether such a <b>paper</b> <b>stock</b> actually existed has become a matter of dispute.|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} is oversized {{to be as}} large as would fit within the fold of The Wall Street Journal. Its specs are [...] trim size and a 50-50 ad-to-edit ratio on a [...] <b>paper</b> <b>stock.</b> [...] The premiere issue of WSJ. had 104 pages in the U.S. and 80 pages in the Europe and Asia editions. It included 51 advertisers of which 19 are new to The Wall Street Journal franchise. The initial cover featured Diana Dondoe in a dress fabricated from The Wall Street Journal newsprint design, which the New York Observer feels is a tip of the hat to a controversy noted in the New York Times about a poverty chic photo spread in the India edition of the August 2008 Vogue.|$|E

5000|$|In February 1941 {{the company}} {{launched}} {{a series of}} [...] "long pamphlets" [...] or [...] "short books" [...] called Searchlight Books, edited by George Orwell and T. R. Fyvel.

2500|$|The textblock's <b>paper</b> <b>stock</b> for the [...] "oatmeal" [...] variant is {{brighter}} than the others. This is most apparent when comparing the text block edges of the three variants. It is known from owner inscriptions that this lighter variant appeared no later than 1946, and that the variegated linen appeared on the market no later than 1942. No dates have been seen on the yellower variant. While not enough dates have been seen to be truly useful, the relative order of the printing of the sheets associated with each binding can be discerned from the type flaws described in the table below.|$|E
2500|$|Coil stamps {{are either}} {{perforated}} horizontally, with one stamp over the other, or vertically with the stamps situated {{side by side}} along the strip of stamps. Made from the same <b>paper</b> <b>stock</b> as sheet stamps, the coil stamps were accordingly issued concurrently with the regular Washington-Franklins. The denominations for coil stamps of these series range only from 1-cent up to 10-cents. While the 1-5 cent denominations were issued almost continuously the 10-cent coils were only issued twice, once as a yellow Washington-head stamp first issued in 1908, (See: Coil stamps Table-1) and once as a 10-cent yellow Franklin-head coil that wasn't issued until 1916. (See: Coil stamps Table-2) ...|$|E
2500|$|The company {{took the}} first steps towards {{developing}} the View-Master stereoscope after a chance meeting, at the Oregon Caves in 1938, between Graves and William Gruber, an organ maker of German origin trained by Welte & Sons and an avid photographer, living in Portland. The View-Master used disk-shaped [...] "reels" [...] which are thin cardboard disks containing seven stereoscopic 3-D pairs of small color photographs on film, and its individual eyepieces immersed the viewer into the scene more fully than previous stereoscopes. [...] Mayer and Gruber had both developed devices for viewing stereo images, but Gruber had developed the idea of mounting tiny pieces of Kodachrome color transparency film into reels made from heavy <b>paper</b> <b>stock,</b> for viewing in a stereo slide viewer designed for the reels. [...] Gruber partnered with the owners of Sawyer's to develop the invention.|$|E

Caresse printed 1,000 copies of each issue, and as she had done with the Black Sun Press, gave special treatment to 100 or so deluxe copies that featured original artwork by Romare Bearden, Matisse, and others. [...] She secured contributions {{from a wide variety of}} well-known artists and writers, including: Louis Aragon, Kay Boyle, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sterling A. Brown, Charles Bukowski, Albert Camus (Letter to a German Friend, his first appearance in an English-language publication), Henri Cartier-Bresson,René Char, Paul Éluard, Jean Genet, Natalia Ginzburg, Victor Hugo, Weldon Kees, Robert Lowell, Henri Matisse, Henry Miller, Eugenio Montale, Anaïs Nin, Charles Olson, Pablo Picasso, Francis Ponge, Kenneth Rexroth, Arthur Rimbaud, Yannis Ritsos, Jean-Paul Sartre (The End of the War), Karl Shapiro, Stephen Spender, Leo Tolstoy, and Giuseppe Ungaretti. After the sixth issue, she ran out of funds and sponsors. This was her last major publishing effort.|$|E

5000|$|Although stock tickers {{identify}} a security, they are exchange dependent, generally limited to stocks and can change. These limitations {{have led to}} the development of other codes in financial markets to identify securities for settlement purposes. The most prevalent of these is the International Securities Identifying Number (ISIN). [...] An ISIN uniquely identifies a security and its structure is defined in ISO 6166. Securities for which ISINs are issued include bonds, commercial <b>paper,</b> <b>stocks,</b> and warrants. The ISIN code is a 12-character alpha-numerical code that does not contain information characterizing financial instruments, but serves for uniform identification of a security at trading and settlement.|$|R
5000|$|UCR is {{generally}} not recommended for use in printing, due to its tendency to produce dull-looking images and artwork.
