50|$|Kindergartens are {{not part}} of the German public school system. (Although the first {{kindergarten}} in the world was opened in 1840 by Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel in the German town of Bad Blankenburg, and the term Kindergarten is even a loanword from the German language). Article <b>7</b> <b>Paragraph</b> <b>6</b> of the German constitution (the Grundgesetz) abolished pre-school as part of the German school system. However, virtually all German kindergartens are public. They are either directly run by municipal governments, or contracted out, most often, to the two largest Christian churches in Germany. These municipal kindergartens are financed by taxes and progressive income-based customer fees, but are not considered part of the public school system.|$|R

This essay analyses {{some aspects of the}} European Union “nomofilachia”; the research is developed in two steps which are strictly correlated. In the first part, it will be underlined how the uniform interpretation and the uniform application of EC law go beyond the provisions of art. 234 of the EC Treat; and are supported by new kind of relations among the Court of Justice, national courts and national administrations. In {{the second part of the}} research, it will be highlighted the impact of the general principles of the European Community legal system, moulded through the “nomofilachia” function of the Luxembourg Court, as regards the activities of national administrations. The analysis gives a particular attention to the evolutionary dynamics of the proportionality principle. All these aspects work in a contemporary context of deep transformation of the traditional relations among law, courts, administrations and citizens. * This essay is the joint work of both authors with Barone primary responsible for paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and Ansaldi for <b>paragraph</b> 5, <b>6,</b> <b>7,</b> 8. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} described in this thesis is to get more insight into various aspects of bronchial responsiveness. The literature is reviewed and discussed {{in the first part of}} this thesis (chapters 2 - 5) and emphasis is placed on recent developments. In the review results from studies in animals and in humans are correlated as much as possible. Our own studies are designed to analyse various aspects of the mechanisms in bronchial responsiveness in children, as well as the role of bronchial responsiveness in the occurrence of symptoms. These studies, started in 1976, are divided into three groups: a. Dose- and time-response relationships using inhaled histamine. These are analysed and the methods for the measurement of bronchial responsiveness considered (chapter 6). b. Studies on mechanisms of: 1. The relative contribution of the autonomic and the mast cell system in the pathogenesis of bronchial responsiveness using exercise is studied by means of protective agents (<b>paragraph</b> <b>7.</b> 1). 2. The pattern of bronchial obstruction after exercise is evaluated with flowvolume curves using air and helium/oxygen mixtures (<b>paragraph</b> <b>7.</b> 2). 3. The feasibility of leucocytes as a model for hyperresponsiveness at a cellular level are performed by measuring the release of mediators (<b>paragraphs</b> <b>7.</b> 3 and 7. 4). c. The clinical significance of the relationship between bronchial responsiveness and the occurrence of bronchial obstruction after contact with allergens and after exercise (chapter 8) ...|$|R
