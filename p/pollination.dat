5|$|<b>Pollination</b> is {{the process}} by which pollen is {{transferred}} in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of <b>pollination</b> is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the <b>pollination</b> in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as <b>pollination</b> syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of <b>pollination</b> by insects is known as anthecology.|$|E
5|$|E. eastwoodiae, E. nelsonii, E. rupestris, and E. verbenacea {{are also}} pollinated by hummingbirds. These four species {{as well as}} E. cardinalis and E. nelsonii produce {{bisexual}} flowers and are self-compatible. This approximate ratio of insect vs hummingbird <b>pollination</b> holds true {{for the rest of}} the genus. There have been two separate transformations to hummingbird <b>pollination.</b> <b>Pollination</b> changes are highly affected by changes in flower morphology. E. cardinalis and its sister species E. cinnabarina likely evolved via allopatric speciation.|$|E

40|$|PREMISE: The lack {{of ability}} to measure pollen {{performance}} traits in mixed <b>pollinations</b> {{has been a major}} hurdle in understanding the mechanisms of differential success of compatible pollen donors. In previous work, we demonstrated that nonrandom mating between two accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, Columbia (Col) and Landsberg (Ler), is mediated by the male genotype. Despite these genetic insights, it was unclear at what stage of reproduction these genes were acting. Here, we used an experimental strategy that allowed us to differentiate different pollen populations in mixed <b>pollinations</b> to ask: (1) What pollen performance traits differed between Col and Ler accessions that direct nonrandom mating? (2) Is there evidence of interference competition? METHODS: We used genetically marked pollen that can be visualized colorimetrically to quantify pollen performance of single populations of pollen in mixed <b>pollinations.</b> We used this and other assays to measure pollen viability, germination, tube growth, patterns of fertilization, and seed abortion. Finally, we assessed interference competition. RESULTS: In mixed <b>pollinations</b> on Col pistils, Col pollen sired significantly more seeds than Ler pollen. Col pollen displayed higher pollen viability, faster and greater pollen germination, and faster pollen tube growth. We saw no evidence of nonrandom seed abortion. Finally, we found interference competition occurs in mixed <b>pollinations.</b> CONCLUSION: The lack of differences in postzygotic processes coupled with direct observation of pollen performance traits indicates that nonrandom mating in Arabidopsis thaliana is prezygotic, due mostly to differential pollen germination and pollen tube growth rates. Finally, this study unambiguously demonstrates the existence of interference competition...|$|R
40|$|Seeds of a cytoplasmic-nuclear {{male-sterile}} line ICPA 2039 and its maintainer were sown {{during the}} rainy season of 2006 inside an insect-proof nylon cage in a field in Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India. To study the stigma receptivity, hand <b>pollinations</b> were carried out on male-sterile plants using pollen of the maintainer line at different stages of flower bud growth of female parent. These materials and methods not only excluded the need of emasculation for controlled <b>pollinations</b> but also avoided chances of accidental self- or cross-pollination. Results revealed that the stigma of ICPA 2039 remained receptive for a total of approximately 120 h, starting at 48 h before flower opening and continued until 72 h thereafter. However, a considerable variation in pod set was observed in different days during this period. To optimize pod set in Patancheru environments, <b>pollinations</b> should be initiated a day before flower opening and continued for 3 days...|$|R
5|$|While <b>pollination</b> by ants is {{somewhat}} rare, several Myrmecia {{species have been}} observed pollinating flowers. For example, the orchid Leporella fimbriata is a myrmecophyte {{which can only be}} pollinated by the winged male ant M. urens. <b>Pollination</b> of this orchid usually occurs between April and June during warm afternoons, and may take several days until the short-lived males all die. The flower mimics M. urens queens, so the males move from flower to flower in an attempt to copulate with it. M. nigrocincta workers have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis, and are considered a potential <b>pollination</b> vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict its capacity to effect <b>pollination.</b> Foraging M. pilosula workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. Whether M. pilosula contributes to <b>pollination</b> is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder causes {{significant economic}} losses because many agricultural crops (although no staple foods) worldwide are pollinated by western honey bees. According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{the worth of}} global crops with honey bee <b>pollination</b> was estimated at close to $200 billion in 2005. Shortages of bees in the US have increased the cost to farmers renting them for <b>pollination</b> services by up to 20%.|$|E
5|$|Honey {{bees are}} not {{native to the}} Americas, {{therefore}} their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee <b>pollination,</b> except where concentrated in monoculture situationsâ€”where the <b>pollination</b> need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to examine the}} {{breeding}} system and natural history of the Maguire primrose (Primula cusickiana var. maguirei). Maguire primrose is an endemic, threatened subspecies found only along a narrow corridor within Logan Canyon in northern Utah, USA. This plant displays distinct flower distyly, with clear distinction of pin and thrum morphologies (morphs). The timing of Maguire primrose flower blooms was disparate between upper and lower canyon populations, and the flowers experienced cool temperatures occasionally. I captured eight different species of flying insects visiting Maguire primrose flowers, and made 67 observations of insect visitation. Inter-morph outcrossing hand <b>pollinations</b> were the most successful hand <b>pollinations</b> performed, but were usually not as successful as those that were naturally pollinated. Selfing rates were quite low compared to outcrossing reproductive scenarios. Morph-specific fecundity differences were detected in my hand <b>pollinations,</b> but not in the naturally pollinated maternal plants. I did not observe clear fecundity differences based on the canyon location of Maguire primrose...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from self-incompatibility to self-compatibility {{is a common}} transition in angiosperms often reported in populations {{at the edge of}} species range limits. Geographically distinct populations of wild tomato species (Solanum section Lycopersicon (Solanaceae)) have been described as polymorphic for mating system with both self-incompatible and self-compatible populations. Using controlled <b>pollinations</b> and sequencing of the S-RNase mating system gene, we test the compatibility status of a population of S. peruvianum located near its southern range limit. <b>Pollinations</b> among plants of known genotypes revealed strong self-incompatibility; fruit set following compatible <b>pollinations</b> was significantly higher than following incompatible <b>pollinations</b> for all tested individuals. Sequencing of the S-RNase gene in parents and progeny arrays was also as predicted under self-incompatibility. Molecular variation at the S-RNase locus revealed a diverse set of alleles, and heterozygosity in over 500 genotyped individuals. We used controlled crosses to test the specificity of sequences recovered in this study; in all cases, results were consistent with a unique allelic specificity for each tested sequence, including two alleles sharing 92 % amino-acid similarity. Site-specific patterns of selection at the S-RNase gene indicate positive selection in regions of the gene associated with allelic specificity determination and purifying selection in previously characterized conserved regions. Further, there is broad convergence between the present and previous studies in specific amino-acid positions inferred to be evolving under positive selection...|$|R

5|$|Since U.S. {{beekeeper}} Nephi Miller {{first began}} moving his hives to {{different areas of}} the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America. Bee rental for <b>pollination</b> is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone. U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for <b>pollination</b> than they do from honey production.|$|E
5|$|Some species {{including}} honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are {{adapted for}} feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source {{and the latter}} primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee <b>pollination</b> is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of <b>pollination</b> by commercially managed hives of honey bees.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} the German {{academic}} and natural historian Joseph KÃ¶lreuter (1733â€“1806) extended this work by noting {{the function of}} nectar in attracting pollinators {{and the role of}} wind and insects in <b>pollination.</b> He also produced deliberate hybrids, observed the microscopic structure of pollen grains and how the transfer of matter from the pollen to the ovary inducing the formation of the embryo. One hundred years after Camerarius, in 1793, Christian Sprengel (1750â€“1816) broadened the understanding of flowers by describing the role of nectar guides in <b>pollination,</b> the adaptive floral mechanisms used for <b>pollination,</b> and the prevalence of cross-pollination, even though male and female parts are usually together on the same flower.|$|E
40|$|Postpollination nonrandom mating among {{compatible}} mates is {{a widespread}} phenomenon in plants and is genetically undefined. In this study, we used the recombinant inbred line (RIL) population between Landsberg erecta and Columbia (Col) accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to define the genetic architecture underlying both female- and male-mediated nonrandom mating traits. To map the genetic loci responsible for male-mediated nonrandom mating, we performed mixed <b>pollinations</b> with Col and RIL pollen on Col pistils. To map the genetic loci responsible for female-mediated nonrandom mating, we performed mixed <b>pollinations</b> with Col and Landsberg erecta pollen on RIL pistils. With these data, we performed composite interval mapping to identify two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control male-mediated nonrandom mating. We detected epistatic interactions between these two loci. We also explored female- and male-mediated traits involved in seed yield in mixed <b>pollinations.</b> We detected three female QTLs and one male QTL involved in directing seed number per fruit. To our knowledge, {{the results of these}} experiments represent the first time the female and male components of seed yield and nonrandom mating have been separately mapped...|$|R
40|$|Pollen {{limitation}} {{is predicted to}} be particularly severe in tundra habitats. Numerous reproductive patterns associated with alpine and arctic species, particularly mechanisms associated with reproductive assurance, are suggested {{to be driven by}} high levels of pollen limitation. We studied the reproductive ecology of Parrya nudicaulis, a species with relatively large sexual reproductive investment and a wide range of floral pigmentation, in tundra habitats in interior montane Alaska to estimate the degree of pollen limitation. The plants are self-compatible and strongly protandrous, setting almost no seed in the absence of pollinators. Supplemental hand <b>pollinations</b> within pollinator exclusion cages indicated no cage effect on seed production. Floral visitation rates were low in both years of study and particularly infrequent in 2010. A diversity of insects visited P. nudicaulis, though syrphid and muscid flies composed the majority of all visits. Pollen-ovule ratios and levels of heterozygosity are consistent with a mixed mating system. Pollen limitation was severe; hand <b>pollinations</b> increased seed production per plant five-fold.

50|$|Cornus {{florida is}} easily {{propagated}} by seeds, which are sown {{in the fall}} into prepared rows of sawdust or sand, and emerge in the spring. Germination rates for good clean seed should be near 100% if seed dormancy is first overcome by cold stratification treatments for 90 to 120 days at 4 C. Flowering dogwood demonstrates gametophytic self-incompatibility, meaning that the plants canâ€™t self-fertilize. This is important for breeding programs as it means {{that it is not}} necessary to emasculate (remove the anthers from) C. florida flowers before making controlled cross-pollinations. These <b>pollinations</b> should be repeated every other day, as the flowers must be cross-pollinated within one or two days of opening for <b>pollinations</b> to be effective.|$|R
5|$|The {{flowers are}} fed at by {{a range of}} {{nectarivorous}} birds: mainly honeyeaters, including the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), white-cheeked honeyeater (P. nigra), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), singing honeyeater (Lichenostomus virescens), tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops) and red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata). Lorikeets have also been observed feeding at the flowers, as have insects, including ants, bees, and aphids. Of these, evidence suggests that only birds are effective pollinators. Insects apparently play no role in <b>pollination,</b> since inflorescences do not form follicles when birds are excluded in pollinator exclusion experiments; and <b>pollination</b> by mammals has never been recorded in this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is particularly important}} for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion. In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee <b>pollination</b> was estimated to exceed $15 billion. Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop. Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in <b>pollination</b> services.|$|E
5|$|This {{meets the}} birds' high energy requirements, the most {{important}} determinants of flower choice. In Mimulus, an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of <b>pollination</b> by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee <b>pollination.</b> Therefore, red pigments in the flowers of Mimulus cardinalis may function primarily to discourage bee visitation. In Penstemon, flower traits that discourage bee <b>pollination</b> may be more influential on the flowers' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird' adaptations, but adaptation 'towards' birds and 'away' from bees can happen simultaneously. However, some flowers such as Heliconia angusta appear not to be as specifically ornithophilous as had been supposed: the species is occasionally (151 visits in 120 hours of observation) visited by Trigona stingless bees. These bees are largely pollen robbers in this case, but may also serve as pollinators.|$|E

40|$|In the Brassicaceae, {{targeted}} exocytosis to the stigmatic papillar {{plasma membrane}} under the compatible pollen grain is hypothesized to be essential for pollen hydration and pollen tube penetration. In contrast, polarized secretion is proposed to be inhibited in the stigmatic papillae during {{the rejection of}} self-incompatible pollen. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we performed a detailed time-course of post-pollination events to view the cytological responses of the stigmatic papillae to compatible and self-incompatible <b>pollinations.</b> For compatible <b>pollinations</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, vesicle secretion was observed at the stigmatic papillar plasma membrane under the pollen grain while Brassica napus stigmatic papillae appeared to use multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for secretion. Exo 70 A 1, {{a component of the}} exocyst complex, has been previously implicated in the compatible pollen responses, and disruption of Exo 70 A 1 in both A. thaliana and B. napus resulted in a loss of secretory vesicles/MVBs at the stigmatic papillar plasma membrane. Similarly, for self-incompatible <b>pollinations,</b> secretory vesicles/MVBs were absent from the stigmatic papillar plasma membrane in A. lyrata and B. napus; and furthermore, autophagy appeared to be induced to direct vesicles/MVBs to the vacuole for degradation. Thus, these findings support a model where the basal pollen recognition pathway in the stigmatic papilla promotes exocytosis to accept compatible pollen, and the basal pollen recognition pathway is overridden by the self...|$|R
30|$|It is {{commonly}} observed {{that not all}} flowers produce fruit and not ovules in a flower mature seeds in flowering plants (Stephenson 1981; Wiens 1984; Sutherland 1986; Lee 1988). Two main proximate limiting factors, pollen limitation and resource limitation, have been proposed to explain these common phenomena (Haig and Westoby 1988). Pollen limitation, because of insufficient pollinator service, is usually tested {{by the addition of}} supplemental pollen to stigmas experimentally; reproduction of plants is considered pollen-limited if fruit or seed set is elevated by hand <b>pollinations</b> relative to natural <b>pollinations</b> (Burd 1994; Larson and Barrett 2000; Ashman et al. 2004; Knight et al. 2005; Wesselingh 2007). Resource limitation can be tested by the comparison of fruit and seed production between plants of different size (Griffin and Barrett 2002) or plants grown at different levels of physical resources (Lee and Bazzaz 1982).|$|R
5|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of wasps play no role in <b>pollination,</b> a few species can effectively transport pollen and pollinate several plant species. Since wasps generally do not have a fur-like covering of soft hairs and a special body part for pollen storage (Pollen basket) as some bees do, pollen does not stick to them well. However {{it has been shown that}} even without hairs, several wasp species are able to effectively transport pollen, therefore contributing for potential <b>pollination</b> of several plant species.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} Cucurbita have 20 pairs of chromosomes.

5|$|Although pest insects {{attract the}} most attention, many insects are {{beneficial}} {{to the environment and}} to humans. Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering plants. <b>Pollination</b> is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects. As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species, they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed. This greatly increases plants' ability to cross-pollinate, which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness. This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture. As well as <b>pollination</b> ants help with seed distribution of plants. This helps to spread the plants, which increases plant diversity. This leads to an overall better environment. A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for <b>pollination</b> management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, orchard or greenhouse at bloom time. Another solution, as shown in Delaware, has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki. Insects also produce useful substances such as honey, wax, lacquer and silk. Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop <b>pollination</b> is becoming more significant for beekeepers. The silkworm has greatly affected human history, as silk-driven trade established relationships between China {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{variation}} of floral morphology and its ef-fect on the flower visitors of Polygala vayredae Costa (Polygalaceae), a narrow endemic species from the Or-iental pre-Pyrenees, were examined. First, {{to account for}} the main floral reward (i. e., nectar), the relationship between the dimensions of the nectar gland and nectar production was investigated. Second, floral traits varia-tion was assessed within and between the three most representative populations of the species. Finally, the role of several floral traits in the female fitness was evaluated. Furthermore, as nectar robbing was highly frequent, preferences of robbers for specific floral traits and their impact on legitimate <b>pollinations</b> were also evaluated. The flowers of this species are characterized by significant variations in floral characteristics and nectar rewards. A significant and positive correlation between the nectar gland dimensions and nectar pro-duction per flower was observed, with the gland dimensions being a good measure to infer the rewards offered by the flowers of P. vayredae. In general, corolla traits were significant and positively correlated with each other. Nectar was revealed to be an important trait in flowerâ€“visitor interactions, with legitimate <b>pollinations</b> being primarily influenced by this floral reward. Nega-tive correlations between robbing frequency and legiti-mate <b>pollinations</b> were observed in two of the studied populations, and positive correlations between flower size and robbing frequency were observed in one pop-ulation. An indirect negative selection over phenotypic floral traits mediated by nectar robbers is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Flowering {{synchrony}} {{is essential}} for plant reproductive success, {{especially in the case}} of small-sized populations of self-incompatible species. Closely related to synchrony, flowering intensity influences pollinator attraction and pollinator movements. Thus, a high flowering intensity may increase pollinator attraction but, at the same time, may also increase the probability of geitonogamous <b>pollinations.</b> Depending on the mating system, the female fitness of plants in small populations may be affected by both the positive effects of higher flowering synchrony and pollinator attraction and the negative effects of geitonogamous <b>pollinations</b> induced by a high flowering intensity. It was hypothesized that different-sized plants in a population would show contrasting flowering patterns, resulting in differences in pollinator behaviour. These influences could result in differences in mating and female reproductive success. This hypothesis was tested by studying the flowering pattern of Erodium paularense (Geraniaceae), a rare and endangered endemic of central Spain. The temporal distribution of flower production was explored throughout the reproductive season, and the probability of xenogamy and geitonogamy and their relationship to plant size and fitness components were calculated. The analysis of this partially self-compatible species showed diverse flowering patterns related to different plant sizes. Small plants produced a larger number of seeds per fruit in spite of having lower values of flowering synchrony. By contrast, large plants produced a larger number of seeds from geitonogamous <b>pollinations.</b> The effect of different flower displays and outcrossing rates on seed set varie...|$|R
5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for <b>pollination.</b> The greatly reduced <b>pollination</b> rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E

More fruit were initiated after cross-pollination, and rates of abortion were greater after selfing, resulting in lower final fruit set.

However, at this stage it is difficult to differentiate between late-acting self-incompatibility and genetic load.
