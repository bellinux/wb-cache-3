50|$|In the 1940s, Percy Lavon Julian {{developed}} an improved type of foam called Aerofoam. Using mechanical action, a liquid protein-based concentrate, made from soy protein, was mixed with water {{in either a}} <b>proportioner</b> or an aerating nozzle to form air bubbles with the free-flowing action. Its expansion ratio and ease of handling made it popular. Protein foam is easily contaminated by some flammable liquids, so care should be used so that the foam is applied only above the burning liquid. Protein foam has slow knockdown characteristics, but it is economical for post-fire security.|$|E

The selection of relevant piping follows from the engineering correlations linking the pressure loss with the flow rate of a concentrate, for specified temperature (usually 20 °C) and pipe size. Undocumented reports exist in industry that such correlations are often inaccurate, resulting {{in the design of}} underperforming suppression systems. To illustrate the problem, we introduce two correlations, sourced from industry and developed for the same alcohol-resistant concentrate, which describe, respectively, effective viscosity and pressure loss as functions of flow rate and pipe diameter. We then investigate the internal consistency of each data set. We demonstrate that neither of the data sets displays internal consistency, and suggest possible errors in data processing and unit conversion that might have led to the observed discrepancies. We correct the original data to produce correlations that are internally consistent and are characterised by realistic rheology. We then investigate three other pressure-loss correlations (one for Newtonian and two for non-Newtonian concentrates), obtained from a different manufacturer, to demonstrate the widespread existence of inaccurate correlations in industry...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMany {{signaling}} systems show adaptation—the {{ability to}} reset themselves after responding to a stimulus. We computationally searched all possible three-node enzyme network topologies {{to identify those}} that could perform adaptation. Only two major core topologies emerge as robust solutions: a negative feedback loop with a buffering node and an incoherent feedforward loop with a <b>proportioner</b> node. Minimal circuits containing these topologies are, within proper regions of parameter space, sufficient to achieve adaptation. More complex circuits that robustly perform adaptation all contain {{at least one of}} these topologies at their core. This analysis yields a design table highlighting a finite set of adaptive circuits. Despite the diversity of possible biochemical networks, it may be common to find that only a finite set of core topologies can execute a particular function. These design rules provide a framework for functionally classifying complex natural networks and a manual for engineering networks.

40|$|Ambitionen med projektet har varit att skapa en tillbyggnad som tydligt relaterar till huvudbyggnaden på flera nivåer. Projektet genomfördes genom att studera tidsandan, idéer och företeelser som låg till grund för museets födelse, arkitekten Stülers tankar kring vad ett museum är och hur en museibyggnad bör utformas, förstå huvudbyggnadens form och <b>proportioner</b> samt analysera platsen.  Friedrich August Stüler ansåg att museet i lika hög grad som dess innehåll var konst. Stüler formulerade fyra punkter om hur byggnaden på bästa sätt kunde visa upp och komplettera sitt innehåll 1. Undvikande av en för stor anhopning av likartade konstverk 2. En i möjligast mån mångfaldig utformning av rummen med olika uppställnings- och belysningsmotiv för konstverken 3. Samverkan de olika konsterna emellan för rumsintrycket 4. Framhävandet av samlingens förnämsta verk antingen genom speciellt ordnade platser eller genom isolering i mindre rum, där uppmärksamheten inte skingras för mycket Med Stülers tankar i bakhuvudet har jag resonerat i samma banor. Byggnaden visar inte bara upp konsten som utställningsföremål utan ger betraktaren en förståelse för hur konstverken hanteras och om hur museet fungerar. En gång löper från museet in i magsinet där besökarna betraktar hyllplanen med föremål och ibland skymtar vad som händer i ateljéerna genom fönster i magasinets vägg. Tillbyggnaden skall vara en tydlig del av nationalmuseum och förstärka och förtydliga huvudbyggnadens form och <b>proportioner.</b> Genom att använda mig av samma konstruktionsrytm och <b>proportioner</b> som huvudbyggnaden har jag försökt skapa en byggnad som på ett tydligt sätt relaterar till huvudbyggnaden. Tillbyggnaden är placerad över Hovslagargatan, den mindre vägen som är en fortsättning på Blasieholmsgatan. En tunnel löper genom byggnaden så att fl ödet inte rubbas samtidigt som byggnaden ger Blasieholmsgatan ett värdigt slut. The {{ambition}} {{with this}} project was to create an annex that clearly, and in several aspects corresponds to {{the characteristics of the}} main building. This was achieved by studying the spirit of the age; the ideas and phenomena that was the basis of the foundation of the museum; the thoughts of the architect Stüler regarding what a museum is, and how a building for such a museum should be designed; and furthermore by understanding the form and proportions of the main building and by analyzing the local environment. Friedrich August Stüler considered the museum to be an object of art to the same extent as its contents. He formulated 4 paragraphs regarding how the building could exhibit, and complement, its contents in the optimal way: 1. To avoid too large accumulations of similar works of art. 2. To strive for a diverse design of the rooms, with different exhibition- and illumination-alternatives for the works of art. 3. To strive for interaction between the different forms of art, {{for the sake of the}} impression of the room. 4. To highlight the collection’s finest works, either by specially arranged places or by isolating them in smaller rooms – where the attention is not scattered between too many other objects With Stülers thought in mind, I have reasoned in a similar way. The building does not only exhibit the art as merely objects of a museum, but also gives the viewer an understanding of how the works of art is handled and how the museum works. A pathway leads the visitors into the depository, where they can view the storage shelves with their objects and occasionally glimpse the ongoing activity in the studios, through windows in the wall. The annex is positioned over the Hovslagargatan, the minor road that forms a continuation of the Blasieholmsgatan. A tunnel runs through the building so that the flow is not disrupted, while the building in the same time gives the Blasieholmsgatan a worthy endpoint. ...|$|E

Målet är att klargöra hur dagsljusinsläppets <b>proportioner</b> och placering påverkar hur det infallande ljuset uppträder i rummet och hur det inverkar på hur rummet upplevs. Studien är tänkt att kunna användas av planerare för att i trivsamhetssyfte skapa ett så bra dagsljusinsläpp som möjligt. Följande frågeställningar formulerades: Hur påverkar placeringen av dagsljusinsläppen upplevelsen av ett rum? Hur påverkar proportionerna av dagsljusinsläppen upplevelsen av ett rum? Hur mycket ljus kommer in i rummet med hänsyn till <b>proportioner</b> och placering av dagsljusinsläppen? Undersökningen inleddes med ett förexperiment där fönsterutformningar observerades i en modell för att sedan testas i ett fullskaleexperiment. Under experimentet gjordes enkätundersökningar på en urvalsgrupp om 20 personer som fick svara på frågor om rumsupplevelse, och därefter gjordes ljusmätningar i samtliga fyra experimentrum. Resultatet visar att stora dagsljusinsläpp ger en hög ljusnivå men bidrar till låg rumslighet, försämrade kontrastförhållanden och ökad risk för bländning. Mindre, lågt placerade horisontella dagsljusinsläpp ger i princip samma ljusnivå men skapar en bättre rumslighet och minskar risken för bländning. Med högt placerade horisontella dagsljusinsläpp visar resultatet en försämring av rumsupplevelsen då rummet upplevs slutet och instängt. Det har visat sig att fönsterytans area påverkar, men inte varit avgörande för hur dagsljusinsläppet påverkar upplevelsen av rummet, det ser ut som att placeringen istället haft mycket större påverkan på rumsupplevelsen.

Studien visar att testpersonerna trivdes bäst i rummet med lågt horisontellt placerade dagsljusinsläpp.  The {{background to}} this report is based on how architectural art through times been treating daylight with greatest precision {{to take advantage of}} its good quality, and how the technical revolution with artificial lighting affects our way of working with daylighting today. The purpose of the study is to contribute to the knowledge how the daylight opening affects the perception of a room. The aim is to clarify how proportions and placement affects how the incident light occurs in the room and how that affects on how the room is perceived. The study is meant to be used by lighting planners, and in terms of pleasantness, be able to create the best possible daylight environment. The following questions were formulated: How do the positions of daylight openings affect the perception of a room? How do the proportions of daylight openings affect the perception of a room? How much light enters the room as a result of proportions and placements of daylight openings? The investigation began with a pre-experiment where window configurations were observed in a scale model and then tested in a full-scale experiment. During the experiment surveys were made in a sample group of twenty people who had to answer questions about spatial experience, followed by lighting calculations that were made in all four experimental settings. The result shows that large daylight openings provide a high level of light but contribute to low spatiality, deterioration of contrasts and increased risk of glare. Smaller, low-set horizontal daylight openings tend to give the same levels of light but create a better sense of space and reduce glare. With high positioned horizontal daylight openings the result shows a deterioration of spatial experience and the room is perceived closed and stuffy. A vertical daylight opening is shown to make the room feel small and high, and the level of light is low, the contrast ratio and the completeness experienced worsening. The result shows that the window surface area affects the experience but is not essential how the daylight openings affect the perception of the room, it looks like the matter of placement have greatest impact on the room experience. It also shows that the darker rooms have higher spatiality than the lighter ones. The study shows that the test group liked the room with low-set horizontal daylight openings better. ...|$|E
