5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's <b>pass-band</b> response.|$|E
5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the <b>pass-band.</b> At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A coplanar-{{waveguide}} fed ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) stop-band resonators is intro-duced for the 3 – 10 GHz band. The symmetrically placed SIW cavities provide dual-stop-band characteristics due {{to their}} TE 101 and TE 102 res-onance modes. Thus, the entire UWB {{is divided into three}} <b>pass-bands</b> which cover the frequency ranges 4. 23 – 4. 62 GHz, 6. 6 – 8. 175 GHz, and 9. 39 – 10. 7 GHz.

5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the <b>pass-band.</b>|$|E
25|$|Compared with a Chebyshev Type I/Type II filter or an {{elliptic}} filter, the Butterworth filter has {{a slower}} roll-off, and thus {{will require a}} higher order to implement a particular stopband specification, but Butterworth filters have a more linear phase response in the <b>pass-band</b> than Chebyshev Type I/Type II and elliptic filters can achieve.|$|E
500|$|Zobel {{invented the}} m-derived (or m-type) filter section in 1920, the {{distinguishing}} {{feature of this}} design being a pole of attenuation close to the filter cut-off frequency. The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. To use a well known quaint engineer's expression it [...] "goes off like {{the side of a}} house". A fast transition between <b>pass-band</b> and stop-band was one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.|$|E

[...] These anomalies in the <b>pass-band</b> {{can be caused by}} mismatched line segments as described above. [...] Dips can also be caused by ground temperature variations.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} effect {{that needs to}} be compensated for is that at some cut-off frequency the line response starts to roll-off like a simple low-pass filter. [...] The effective bandwidth of the line can be increased with a section that is a high-pass filter matching this roll-off, combined with an attenuator. [...] In the flat part of the <b>pass-band</b> only the attenuator part of the filter section is significant. [...] This is set at an attenuation equal {{to the level of the}} highest frequency of interest. [...] All frequencies up to this point will then be equalised flat to an attenuated level.

2500|$|One may imagine {{two such}} cavities, each {{in its own}} {{isolated}} radiative and thermodynamic equilibrium. One may imagine an optical device that allows radiative heat transfer between the two cavities, filtered to pass only a definite band of radiative frequencies. If {{the values of the}} spectral radiances of the radiations in the cavities differ in that frequency band, heat may be expected to pass from the hotter to the colder. One might propose to use such a filtered transfer of heat in such a band to drive a heat engine. If the two bodies are at the same temperature, the second law of thermodynamics does not allow the heat engine to work. It may be inferred that for a temperature common to the two bodies, the values of the spectral radiances in the <b>pass-band</b> must also be common. This must hold for every frequency band. [...] This became clear to Balfour Stewart and later to Kirchhoff. Balfour Stewart found experimentally that of all surfaces, one of lamp-black emitted the greatest amount of thermal radiation for every quality of radiation, judged by various filters.|$|E

In addition to this, accurate physical models of the dusty shells are presented in which the re-processing of radiation from the central stars is calculated. The resulting spectral energy distribution (SED) is examined to show how important features evolve with time. The SEDs are then convolved with the IRAS filters to obtain the flux in various <b>pass-bands</b> for individual AGB stars of different, mass, chemical composition, and age. The comparison is made by means of SSPs along which AGB stars of the same age but different initial masses are located.
