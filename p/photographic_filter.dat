50|$|Optical {{filters are}} used in various areas of science, {{including}} in particular astronomy; they are {{essentially the same as}} <b>photographic</b> <b>filters,</b> but in practice often need far more accurately controlled optical properties and precisely defined transmission curves than <b>filters</b> exclusively for <b>photographic</b> use. <b>Photographic</b> <b>filters</b> sell in larger quantities at correspondingly lower prices than many laboratory filters.

50|$|<b>Photographic</b> <b>filters</b> are a {{particular}} case of optical filters, {{and much of the}} material here applies. <b>Photographic</b> <b>filters</b> do not need the accurately controlled optical properties and precisely defined transmission curves of filters designed for scientific work, and sell in larger quantities at correspondingly lower prices than many laboratory <b>filters.</b> Some <b>photographic</b> effect <b>filters,</b> such as star effect filters, are not relevant to scientific work.|$|R

50|$|A warm filter is a <b>photographic</b> <b>filter</b> that {{improves}} {{the color of}} all skin tones and absorbs blue cast often caused by electronic flash or outdoor shade. They add warmth to pale, washed-out flesh tones and are ideal for portraits as they smooth facial details while adding warmth to skin tones (for color imaging).|$|E
50|$|Photographers and cinematographers use {{information}} provided by these meters to decide what color balancing {{should be done to}} make different light sources appear to have the same color temperature.

50|$|Glass with {{addition}} of thorium dioxide has high refraction and low dispersion {{and was in}} use since before World War 2, but its radioactivity led to its replacement with other compositions. Even during WW2, Kodak managed to make high-performance thorium-free optical glass for use in aerial photography, but it was yellow-tinted. In combination with black and white film, the tint was actually beneficial acting as a <b>photographic</b> <b>filter</b> improving contrast.|$|E
50|$|Using the {{technique}} involves zooming while the shutter is {{open with a}} relatively slow shutter speed, generally below 1/60 of a second. For this reason low light or small apertures are required. It is also possible to achieve a similar effect with either computer software like Adobe Photoshop (after the photo has been shot) or a <b>photographic</b> <b>filter.</b> In these cases the shutter speed can be as fast as necessary.|$|E
50|$|A {{diffusion}} filter is {{a translucent}} <b>photographic</b> <b>filter</b> {{used for a}} special effect. When used {{in front of the}} camera lens, a diffusion filter softens subjects and generates a dreamy haze. This can also be improvised by smearing petroleum jelly on a UV filter or shooting through a nylon stocking. Diffusion filters may be uniform or may have a clear center area to create a vignette of diffused area around the clear center subject.|$|E

5000|$|Although the inelastic {{scattering}} of light was predicted by Adolf Smekal in 1923, {{it was not}} observed in practice until 1928. The Raman effect was named after one of its discoverers, the Indian scientist Sir C. V. Raman, who observed the effect by means of sunlight (1928, together with K. S. Krishnan and independently by Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam). Raman won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930 for this discovery accomplished using sunlight, a narrow-band <b>photographic</b> <b>filter</b> to create monochromatic light, and a [...] "crossed filter" [...] to block this monochromatic light. He found that {{a small amount of}} light had changed frequency and passed through the [...] "crossed" [...] filter.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} {{infrared}} is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700 nm and 800 nm, but {{the boundary between}} visible and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR lasers, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm, and will be perceived as red light. Intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050 nm {{can be seen as}} a dull red glow, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing <b>photographic</b> <b>filter,</b> it is possible to see the Wood effect that consists of IR-glowing foliage.|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of <b>photographic</b> <b>filter</b> {{placed over the}} lens and the color filter array on image sensor induces differences in red, green, and blue channel sensitivities. Spectrally selective single-shot HDR (S 4 HDR) imaging treats this as an exposure bracketing. Optimally exposed regions of low dynamic range red/green/blue color components are merged in a principled manner to yield a single HDR color image. Though not expected to yield results superior to the traditional time multiplexing counterparts, the single-shot HDR solution we propose is a robust alternative that can be realized with conventional camera hardware. 1...|$|E

30|$|Non-denaturing PAGE for gels with an {{acrylamide}} {{mass fraction}} of 15 % was performed at 4 °C at 300 V; gels containing an acrylamide mass fraction of 12 % were run at 4 °C and 250 V. The electrophoresis running buffer was either 0.01 TMgTB buffer or 0.01 KMgTB buffer. Gels were UV-shadowed, imaged by UV transillumination, or stained with Sybr Green I dye by soaking the gels for 10 to 20 min. All gels were {{wrapped in plastic}} wrap prior to imaging. UV shadowing was accomplished using a handheld UV lamp and standard digital imaging device. Transillumination to visualize NMM fluorescence was performed using a standard UV transilluminator device equipped with an ethidium bromide <b>photographic</b> <b>filter.</b> Images were processed (background subtraction, contrast adjustment) using ImageJ software. Sybr Green I-stained gels were scanned on a laser-based fluorescence imaging device and analyzed using the instrument-supplied software.|$|E

50|$|Conversion of a {{color image}} to {{grayscale}} is not unique; different weighting {{of the color}} channels effectively represent the effect of shooting black-and-white film with different-colored <b>photographic</b> <b>filters</b> on the cameras.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>photographic</b> <b>filters</b> {{can cause}} flare, {{particularly}} ghosts of bright lights (under central inversion). This can be eliminated by not using a filter, and reduced by using higher-quality filters or narrower aperture.|$|R
5000|$|Certain <b>photographic</b> <b>filters</b> are {{inconvenient}} without line {{of sight}} through the taking lens - notably, graduated neutral density filters are hard to use with a TLR, {{as there is no}} easy way to position the filter accurately.|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} has influenced numerous trends in contemporary photography, such as advertising photography, {{where it is}} used to highlight the advertised object in question. An extreme variation of the red shirt school is focal color photography, where optical and/or digital <b>photographic</b> <b>filters</b> are used to preserve color in only a single focal object or region of the photograph.|$|R
5000|$|... "Circular" [...] {{polarizing}} <b>photographic</b> <b>filters</b> {{consist of}} a linear polarizer on the front, with a quarter-wave plate on the back.
