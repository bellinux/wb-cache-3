50|$|An intracavernous (or intracavernosal, intradicular) {{injection}} is {{an injection}} {{into the base}} of the penis. This injection site is often used to administer medications to check for or treat erectile dysfunction in adult men (in e.g. combined intracavernous injection and stimulation test). The more common medications administered in this manner include Caverject, Trimix (prostaglandin, papaverine, and <b>phentolamine),</b> Bimix (papaverine and <b>phentolamine),</b> and Quadmix (prostaglandin, papaverine, <b>phentolamine,</b> and either atropine or forskolin). These medications are all types of vasodilators and cause tumescence within 10-15 minutes.Common side effects include, but are not limited to, priapism, bruising, fibrosis, Peyronies, and pain.|$|E
50|$|After abandoning ImmuMax, Zonagen {{moved on}} to its third drug: Vasomax a {{disintegrating}} oral formulation of <b>phentolamine.</b> Realizing that Pfizer's Viagra {{was going to be}} a hit product, Zonagen hoped to ride its coattails with an erectile dysfunction drug of its own. However, unlike Pfizer, Zonagen repeated its experience from ImmuMax; it got a forty-year-old generic drug, <b>phentolamine,</b> dressed it up as something new, and acted as if it was a genuine Viagra competitor. While <b>phentolamine</b> was never proven to create erections by itself, Zonagen claimed that its formulation, simply <b>phentolamine</b> administered orally instead of in pill form, would work. Despite a failed Phase II trial in 1996 for Vasomax, the company proceeded to Phase III trials anyway. Once Schering-Plough pulled out of its partnership with Zonagen for Vasomax, Zonagen abandoned its New Drug Application for Vasomax. The company was left with little more than a corporate shell and a bunch of lawsuits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phentolamine</b> {{also has}} {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic roles in complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy).|$|E
50|$|It {{also has}} {{usefulness}} {{in the treatment}} of cocaine-induced cardiovascular complications, where one would generally avoid β-blockers (e.g. metoprolol), as they can cause unopposed α-adrenergic mediated coronary vasoconstriction, worsening myocardial ischemia and hypertension. It {{is important to note that}} <b>phentolamine</b> is not a first-line agent for this indication. <b>Phentolamine</b> should only be given to patients who do not fully respond to benzodiazepines, nitroglycerin, and calcium channel blockers.|$|E
50|$|Non-selective α-blockers {{can cause}} a much more {{pronounced}} reflex tachycardia than the selective α1 blockers. Like the selective α1 blockers, <b>phentolamine</b> causes a relaxation of systemic vasculature, leading to hypotension. This hypotension is sensed by the baroreceptor reflex, which results in increased sympathetic nerve firing on the heart, releasing norepinephrine. In response, the β1 adrenergic receptors on the heart increase its rate, contractility, and dromotropy, which help to offset the decrease in systemic blood pressure. Unlike the α1 selective blockers, <b>phentolamine</b> also inhibits the α2 receptors, which function predominantly as presynaptic negative feedback for norepinephrine release. By abolishing this negative feedback <b>phentolamine</b> leads to even less regulated norepinephrine release, which results in a more drastic increase in heart rate.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{application}} for <b>phentolamine</b> {{is for the}} control of hypertensive emergencies, most notably due to pheochromocytoma.|$|E
50|$|Another {{treatment}} regimen is injection therapy. One {{of the following}} drugs is injected into the penis: papaverine, <b>phentolamine,</b> and prostaglandin E1.|$|E
50|$|If extravasation occurs local tissue {{death may}} result. The {{medication}} <b>phentolamine</b> can be injected {{at the site}} to try to decrease the risk of tissue death.|$|E
50|$|Alprostadil is also {{available}} as a generic. The major cost is {{that it must be}} mixed by a compounding pharmacy and supplies may be difficult to obtain. The different formulations, including Bimix and Trimix, may include papaverine and/or <b>phentolamine.</b> A typical mix might be 30 mg of papaverine, 2 mg of <b>phentolamine,</b> and 20 μg alprostadil. As a generic, it is much less expensive than the packaged injectables. It is premixed and must be kept refrigerated and the user must load a syringe with the quantity needed.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{commonly}} used in cryopreservation of blood vessels {{along with the other}} glycosaminoglycans and protein suspensions. Functions as a vasodilator during cryopreservation when used in conjunction with verapamil, <b>phentolamine,</b> nifedipine, tolazoline or nitroprusside.|$|E

50|$|Because of its vasoconstrictive effect, {{phenylephrine}} {{can cause}} severe necrosis if it infiltrates the surrounding tissues. Because of this, {{it should be}} given through a central line if at all possible. Damage may be prevented or mitigated by infiltrating the tissue with the alpha blocker <b>phentolamine</b> by subcutaneous injection.|$|E
50|$|Nitric-oxide {{mediated}} vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin and nitroprusside, {{are effective}} at lowering {{blood pressure and}} reversing coronary arterial vasoconstriction, but not heart rate. Nitroglycerin is useful for cocaine-induced chest pain, but the possibility of reflex tachycardia must be considered. Alpha-blockers such as <b>phentolamine</b> have been recommended and {{may be used to}} treat cocaine-induced hypertension and coronary arterial vasoconstriction, but these agents do not reduce heart rate. Furthermore, <b>phentolamine</b> is rarely used, not readily available in many emergency departments, and many present-day clinicians are unfamiliar with its use and titratability. Calcium channel blockers may also be used to treat hypertension and coronary arterial vasoconstriction, but fail to lower tachycardia based on all cocaine-related studies. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channels blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil are preferable, as dihydropyridine agents such as nifedipine have much higher risk of reflex tachycardia.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, slow heart rate, and anxiety. Other side effects include an {{irregular}} heartbeat. If it leaks {{out of the}} vein at the site it is being given, norepinephrine can result in limb ischemia. If leakage occurs the use of <b>phentolamine</b> in the area affected may improve outcomes. Norepinephrine works by binding and activating alpha adrenergic receptors.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} alpha to beta {{blockade}} {{depends on whether}} labetalol is administered orally or intravenously (IV). Orally, the ratio of alpha to β blockade is 1:3. Intravenously, alpha to β blockade ratio is 1:7. Thus, the labetalol can be {{thought to be a}} beta-blocker with some alpha-blocking effects. By comparison, labetalol is a weaker β-blocker than propranolol, and has a weaker affinity for alpha-receptors compared to <b>Phentolamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{worsening}} kidney function, an irregular heartbeat, chest pain, vomiting, headache, or anxiety. If it enters {{into the soft}} tissue around the vein local tissue death may occur. The medication <b>phentolamine</b> can be given to try to decrease this risk. It is unclear if dopamine is safe to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. At low doses dopamine mainly triggers dopamine receptors and β1-adrenergic receptors while at high doses it works via α-adrenergic receptors.|$|E
50|$|In the dog, an i.v. dose of 16 μg/kg {{caused an}} ~ 80% {{decrease}} in heart {{rate in the}} same cardioaccelerator nerve assay, compared to an ~ 8% decrease produced by dopamine. DMDA caused vasoconstriction in several isolated vascular preparations from the rabbit. The pressor activity of DMDA was partially inhibited by the α-antagonist <b>phentolamine.</b> From these and other observations, the investigators concluded that there were significant species-related differences between the responses to DMDA of dogs and cats, with adrenergic effects being predominant in dogs.|$|E
50|$|Trimix is an {{injectable}} three-drug {{prescribed medication}} {{used to treat}} erectile dysfunction. The active ingredients in the mixture are usually alprostadil, papaverine, and <b>phentolamine.</b> The injection must be compounded by a pharmacy and administered via intracavernosal injection (an injection at either side, not the base, of the penis). Trimix is typically compounded by a pharmacy in a sterile environment and then frozen. The compound is stable {{for up to six}} months while stored frozen and for one month if stored refrigerated beginning at the time of manufacture.|$|E
50|$|If accidentally ingested, {{standard}} {{methods to}} remove unabsorbed drugs should be considered. There is no specific antidote for oxymetazoline, although its pharmacological effects may be reversed by α adrenergic antagonists such as <b>phentolamine.</b> In {{the event of}} a possibly life-threatening overdose (such as a hypertensive crisis), benzodiazepines should be considered to decrease the likelihood of seizures and convulsions, as well as reduce anxiety and to lower blood pressure. In children, oxymetazoline may produce profound central nervous system depression due to stimulation of central α2 receptors and imidazoline receptors, much like clonidine.|$|E
5000|$|Acute methamphetamine {{intoxication}} {{is largely}} managed by treating the symptoms and treatments may initially include administration of activated charcoal and sedation. There {{is not enough}} evidence on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in cases of methamphetamine intoxication to determine their usefulness. [...] Forced acid diuresis (e.g., with vitamin C) will increase methamphetamine excretion but is not recommended as it may {{increase the risk of}} aggravating acidosis, or cause seizures or rhabdomyolysis. Hypertension presents a risk for intracranial hemorrhage (i.e., bleeding in the brain) and, if severe, is typically treated with intravenous <b>phentolamine</b> or nitroprusside. [...] Blood pressure often drops gradually following sufficient sedation with a benzodiazepine and providing a calming environment.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{for special}} {{vasodilation}} mechanisms {{was reported by}} Mellander and his colleagues (Mellander, Andersson, Afzelius, & Hellstrand. 1982). They studied buccal segments of the human facial veins in vitro. Unlike veins from {{other areas of the}} skin, facial veins responded with an active myogenic contraction to passive stretch and were therefore able to develop an intrinsic basal tone. Additionally Mellander et al. showed that the veins in this specific area were also supplied with beta-adrenoceptors in addition to the common alpha-adrenoceptors. These beta-adrenoceptors could exert a dilator mechanism on the above-described basal tone of the facial cutaneous venous plexus. Mellander and his colleagues propose that this mechanism is involved in emotional blushing. Drummond has partially confirmed this effect by pharmacological blocking experiments (Drummond. 1997). In a number of trials, he blocked both alpha-adrenergic receptors (with <b>phentolamine)</b> and beta-adrenergic receptors (with propranolol introducedtranscutaneously by iontophoresis). Blushing was measured at the forehead using a dual channel laser Doppler flowmeter. Subjects were undergraduate students divided into frequent and infrequent blushers according to self-report. Their mean age was 22.9 years, which is especially favorable for assessing blushing, since young subjects are more likely to blush and blush more intensively. The subjects underwent several procedures, one of which was designed to produce blushing. Alpha-adrenergic blockade with <b>phentolamine</b> had no influence on the amount of blushing in frequent or in infrequent blushers, indicating that release of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone does not substantially influence blushing. This result was expected since vasoconstrictor tone in the facial area is known to be generally low (van der Meer. 1985). Beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol on the other hand decreased blushing in both frequent and infrequent blushers. However, despite complete blockade, blood flow still increasedsubstantially during the embarrassment and blushing inducing procedure. Additional vasodilator mechanisms must therefore be involved.|$|E
5000|$|These are {{drugs that}} block {{the effects of}} noradrenergic alpha receptors while having little or no effect on beta receptors. [...] Drugs {{belonging}} to this group can have very different effects, however, depending on whether they primarily block alpha-1 receptors, alpha-2 receptors, or both. Alpha-2 receptors, as described elsewhere in this article, are frequently located on norepinephrine-releasing neurons themselves and have inhibitory effects on them; consequently blockage of alpha-2 receptors usually results {{in an increase in}} norepinephrine release. [...] Alpha-1 receptors are usually located on target cells and have excitatory effects on them; consequently blockage of alpha-1 receptors usually results in blocking some of the effects of norepinephrine. [...] Drugs such as <b>phentolamine</b> that act on both types of receptors can produce a complex combination of both effects. In most cases when the term [...] "alpha blocker" [...] is used without qualification, it refers to a selective alpha-1 antagonist.|$|E
5000|$|This {{approach}} has conceptual and pragmatic advantages. On the conceptual side, securing organs at optimum times {{does not require}} us to constantly redefine death and when it occurs so that persons who would normally be thought alive are now dead, and thus may have their organs taken. It would also allow us {{to say that when}} a physician removes life-support and the patient dies that the physician caused patient's death. Many think this is more natural than saying that all the physician did was to return the patient to an untreated disease state and that state caused the death. Finally, we thereby avoid the proliferation of definitions of death with differing times in different jurisdictions, different definitions of death for different purposes (the cardiocirculatory definition of death discussed in this article is only valid for DCD), and arbitrary rulings such as declaring anencephalic infants with heartbeat dead. [...] On the pragmatic side, rejecting the rules in question would have advantages for recipients and donors in transplant programs. Because there will now be no necessary interval between pulselessness and the declaration of death, there can be a reduction in warm ischemia time, and so an improvement in {{the quality and quantity of}} transplantable organs. [...] It will also be possible to give the donor drugs such as heparin and <b>phentolamine,</b> which can hasten death but also maximize organ preservation. Finally, it will eliminate the possibility that patients will experience discomfort as they are withdrawn from ventilator support by allowing potentially fatal doses of morphine that are not titrated to signs of distress.|$|E
40|$|A rapid liquid chromatographic {{method is}} {{validated}} for the quantitative analysis of <b>phentolamine.</b> <b>Phentolamine</b> exists in three forms for this investigation: as a mesylate salt, hydrochloride salt, and free base. In solution, <b>phentolamine</b> dissociates from its salt and is chromatographed as free <b>phentolamine.</b> This validation confirms {{the analysis of}} each form, which is simply based upon molar mass differences encountered in weighing. As such, both the United States Pharmacopeia hydrochloride and mesylate standards are used throughout this validation to demonstrate this equivalency.

40|$|<b>Phentolamine</b> mesylate accelerates {{recovery}} from oral soft tissue anesthesia {{in patients who}} have received local anesthetic injections containing a vasoconstrictor. The proposed mechanism is that <b>phentolamine,</b> an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, blocks the vasoconstriction associated with the epinephrine used in dental anesthetic formulations, thus enhancing the systemic absorption of the local anesthetic from the injection site. Assessments of the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and <b>phentolamine,</b> {{and the impact of}} <b>phentolamine</b> on the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine with epinephrine were performed to characterize this potentially valuable strategy. The blood levels of <b>phentolamine</b> were determined following its administration intraorally and intravenously. Additionally, the effects of <b>phentolamine</b> mesylate on the pharmacokinetics of intraoral injections of lidocaine with epinephrine were evaluated. Sixteen subjects were enrolled in this phase 1 trial, each receiving 4 drug treatments: 1 cartridge lidocaine/epinephrine followed after 30 minutes by 1 cartridge <b>phentolamine</b> (1 L 1 P), 1 cartridge <b>phentolamine</b> administered intravenously (1 Piv), 4 cartridges lidocaine/epinephrine followed after 30 minutes by 2 cartridges <b>phentolamine</b> (4 L 2 P), and 4 cartridges lidocaine/epinephrine followed by no <b>phentolamine</b> (4 L). Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for <b>phentolamine,</b> lidocaine, and epinephrine included peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to the last time point (AUClast) or from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf), elimination half-life (t 1 / 2), clearance (CL), and volume of distribution (Vd). The <b>phentolamine</b> Tmax occurred earlier following the intravenous administration of 1 Piv (7 minutes than following its submucosal administration in treatment 1 L 1 P (15 minutes) or 4 L 2 P (11 minutes). The <b>phentolamine</b> t 1 / 2, CL, and Vd values were similar for 1 L 1 P, 1 Piv, and 4 L 2 P. The Tmax for lidocaine occurred later and the Cmax for lidocaine was slightly higher when comparing the 4 L 2 P treatment and the 4 L treatment. The phentolamine-induced delay of the lidocaine Tmax likely represents phentolamine's ability to accelerate the systemic absorption of lidocaine from oral tissues into the systemic circulation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phentolamine</b> {{caused a}} rhythmic {{contraction}} concentration-dependently without affecting resting tone in the detrusor muscle. Prazosin, yohimbine, propranolol, noradrenaline, clonidine or isoprenaline failed {{to cause the}} rhythmic contraction. These agents did not modify the response to <b>phentolamine</b> suggesting no involvement of alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors in the response to <b>phentolamine.</b> Chlorpheniramine, cimetidine, methysergide, SK&F 83566, atropine, bretylium, hemicholinium or tetrodotoxin failed to inhibit the response to <b>phentolamine.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} effect of <b>phentolamine</b> is not mediated through histaminergic, 5 -hydroxytryptaminergic, dopaminergic or cholinergic systems, or through transmitter release from nerve endings. Prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha), arachidonic acid but not ATP caused rhythmic contractions which resembled the response to <b>phentolamine.</b> Potassium also caused a contraction with increasing resting tone. Following treatment with nifedipine, or incubation in a Ca 2 +-free medium, the responses to <b>phentolamine,</b> PGF 2 alpha, arachidonic acid and potassium were markedly inhibited or abolished. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as indomethacin, aspirin and corticosterone inhibited or abolished the responses to <b>phentolamine</b> and arachidonic acid but did not inhibit the response to PGF 2 alpha. The results suggest that the phentolamine-induced rhythmic contraction may, at least in part, result from the cyclo-oxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid in guinea-pig detrusor muscles and a consequent increase in the transmembrane Ca 2 +-influx...|$|E
40|$|Administration {{of local}} {{anesthesia}} {{is an integral}} procedure prior to dental treatments to minimize the associated pain. It is learned that its effect stays more than the time required for the dental procedure to be completed. This prolonged soft tissue anesthesia (STA) can be detrimental, inconvenient, and unnecessary. <b>Phentolamine</b> mesylate, a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug essentially serves the purpose of faster recovery from numbness {{at the site of}} local anesthesia. This article reviews the development of the drug <b>phentolamine</b> mesylate and its indication as a local anesthetic reversal agent. A literature search for <b>phentolamine</b> mesylate as a STA reversal agent was conducted in PubMed using the terms "dental local anesthesia reversal, <b>phentolamine</b> mesylate" up to March 2014. The search was limited to articles published in English. The search revealed 13 PubMed indexed articles stating the development and application of <b>phentolamine</b> mesylate. <b>Phentolamine</b> mesylate is an important step in the progress of developing patient care as well as an aid to the dental clinician...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phentolamine</b> (0. 1 - 10 microM) {{caused an}} {{anomalous}} rightward {{shift of the}} relationship between the number of electrical field pulses and tachycardia in the rabbit isolated right atrium. <b>Phentolamine</b> was apparently acting as a presynaptic agonist on sympathetic nerve endings to inhibit transmitter release. The effect was prevented by benextramine treatment and antagonized 10 fold by yohimbine (1 microM) but not by prazosin (0. 1 microM). In ganglion-blocked (mecamylamine) conscious or anaesthetized rabbits, <b>phentolamine</b> (3 - 1000 micrograms kg- 1) caused a dose-related rise in blood pressure that was antagonized by yohimbine (1 mg kg- 1). These pressor and inhibitory cardiac sympathetic nerve effects of <b>phentolamine</b> are not found in similar preparations from the guinea-pig or rat. Therefore, these rabbit-specific agonist effects of <b>phentolamine</b> at sites similar to alpha 2 -adrenoceptors make this drug unsuitable as an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist in rabbits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Using {{methacrylic acid}} (MAA) as monomer, {{ethylene}} glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linker and <b>phentolamine</b> as template molecule, we synthesized phentolamine–molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP). Using phentolamine–MIP as molecule recognizates, based on the oxidation reaction between KMnO 4 and phenolamine in acidic, {{we set up a}} flow-injection chemiluminescence (FI-CL) sensor for <b>phentolamine</b> determination. The sensor was fabricated by packing the MIP particles into a V-shape flow cell. <b>Phentolamine</b> could be selectively on-line adsorbed by the MIPs and then sensed by the oxidation reaction between KMnO 4 and phenolamine in acidic. The CL intensity was linear to <b>phentolamine</b> concentration in the range from 2. 0 × 10 − 8 to 6. ...|$|E
40|$|Since exogeneous catecholamines potentiate ADP-induced {{aggregation}} in vitro, {{and this}} effect is blocked directly by <b>phentolamine,</b> {{it was assumed that}} platelets from patients with pheochromocytoma would be unusually sensitive to ADP and that this sensitivity would be reduced in the presence of <b>phentolamine.</b> Findings in four patients with pheochromocytoma were compared to results in 20 normals. <b>Phentolamine</b> had no immediate effect in either group. Pheochromocytoma platelets became more responsive to ADP after standing and this increase in responsiveness was inhibited by <b>phentolamine.</b> These results: 1) suggest that catecholamine concentrations in the plasma of patients with pheochromocytoma are not high enough to potentiate ADP aggregation and 2) may be explained by assuming that pheochromocytoma platelets are saturated with catecholamines...|$|E
40|$|Microdialysis {{technique}} {{was used to}} {{study the effects of}} the locally applied alpha adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and antagonist <b>phentolamine</b> on the basal noradrenaline efflux {{as well as on the}} noradrenaline uptake inhibitor desipramine-elicited noradrenaline efflux in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of freely moving rats. Tetrodotoxin reduced basal noradrenaline efflux by 72 %, whereas desipramine increased it by 204 %. Phenylephrine reduced the basal noradrenaline efflux by 32 % and <b>phentolamine</b> blocked this effect. <b>Phentolamine</b> elevated the basal noradrenaline efflux by 150 % and phenylephrine counteracted this effect. The desipramine-elicited noradrenaline efflux was not affected by phenylephrine, but enhanced by <b>phentolamine.</b> Desipramine counteracted the effects of phenylephrine and potentiated those of <b>phentolamine.</b> These results indicate that the accumbal noradrenaline efflux is under inhibitory control of alpha adrenoceptors that are suggested to be presynaptically located on adrenergic nerve terminals in the NAc. Furthermore, this study suggests that the conformational state of alpha adrenoceptors varies across the available amount of noradrenaline. The clinical impact of these data is discussed...|$|E
