40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the order of magnitude of the maximum achievable separation for decontaminating a natural gas well using a gas centrifuge. Previously established analytical approximations are not applicable for natural gas decontamination. Numerical simulations based on the batch case show that although the separative strength of the centrifuge is quite good, its throughput is very limited. Both enrichment and throughput are only a function of length and <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocity.</b> A centrifuge with a length of 5 m and a <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocity</b> of approximately 800 m/s, would have a throughput of 0, 57 mol/s and a product flow of 0, 17 mol/s.

Under conditions similar to those of the batch case the production is approximately half compared to the batch case, i. e. 0, 08 mol/s.

40|$|The {{thicknesses}} of {{the films}} of lubricant formed between two steel discs in rolling and sliding contact have been estimated from measurements of the electrical capacity between the two discs. As the slide/roll ratio increased above a certain level the experimental values of the film thickness became progressively greater than the values predicted by conventional isothermal elastohydrodynamic theory. Ultimately the discs were operated satisfactorily with equal and opposite <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocities,</b> although the conventional theory would then predict the complete absence of a hydrodynamic film. These discrepancies are observed when the <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocities</b> of the discs are in opposite directions and they are explained in principle by {{the effect of the}} variation of the temperature of the oil across the film in the inlet zone. The conventional theory of film thickness in elastohydrodynamic lubrication has been modified to take this effect into account. I t was not possible to obtain an exact theory for the general case but two extreme conditions could be defined and exact solutions found for them. Most of the experimental film thicknesses fell within the range of these extremes, and the variation with conditions of the position of the experimental points was approximately as expected on general grounds.

30|$|The large {{mass flow}} of the steam needed to satisfy the pump's demand for the driving power causes {{the volume of the}} outlet steam mass flow to {{increase}} significantly, which results in a large annulus area and, consequently, in high blades of the last turbine stage. In the case of high power units, the relatively high rotation speeds of the boiler feed pump (up to as much as 7, 300 rotations per minute) are not suitable for the condensing steam turbine. Due to the high rotation speed required by the pump, the <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocities</b> of the last stages differ considerably from the optimum values that ensure the highest efficiency. Combining high <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocities</b> with high blades often causes mechanical problems. To avoid them, some manufacturers offer turbines with the flow separated in the last stage into two stages with a smaller diameter. This sometimes solves mechanical problems with high blades, but due to the flow losses resulting from the separation of the steam mass flow, no improvement in efficiency is achieved. In fact, the efficiency of condensing turbines which drive boiler feed pumps is often by 6 % to 7 % points lower than that of the main steam turbine [4]. Some manufacturers offer reaction-type condensing turbines with a fully separated flow with the steam inlet in the middle and symmetrical outlets. This leads to the rotor elongation, which is not a problem in the case of reaction constructions because they solve the mechanical problems related to long blades and ensure an efficiency level which is 2 % to 3 % points, different from the efficiency of the main turbine [4]. However, such machines are very expensive.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of numerical solutions modified by the Reynolds equation of laminar unsteady lubrication of a cylindrical slide journal bearing. The particular solutions are limited to isothermal models of bearing with infinite length, lubricated by Newtonian oil with the dynamic viscosity dependent on pressure. The disturbances are related with unsteady velocity of oil flow on the sleeve and on the journal. The results are shown in the diagram of hydrodynamic pressure and capacity forces in the dimensionless form in time intervals of displacement duration. In particular modified Reynolds equation and hydrodynamic pressure, capacity forces and numerical results are presented in the paper. The results confirm that the perturbation of velocity influence is stronger when the oil viscosity depends stronger on pressure. Summary pressure and perturbation pressure change are periodical equal to perturbation of velocity period and the size of change depends on perturbation of velocity. When the perturbation of velocity on the pin has the same direction as <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocity</b> of the pin, the perturbation pressure is positive.

It is used to store the energy when the demand of energy of energy is less and deliver it when the demand of energy is high. The current paper is focused on the analytical design of arm type of flywheel which is used for punching press operation. Now in regard to the design of flywheel it is required to decide the mean diameter of the flywheel rim, which depends upon two factors such as availability of space and the limiting value of <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocity</b> of the fly wheel. However the current design problem is formulated for punching machine which has to be make holes of 30 holes/minute in a steel plate of 18 mm thickness with space limitation that is the diameter of flywheel should not exceed 1000 mm, hence it can be observed that the design of the flywheel is to be carried out (based) on the availability of space limitation and accordingly the fluctuation of energy, dimensions of the flywheel, stresses induced in the flywheel are determined. Finally after detail analysis it is observed that the induced diameter of the flywheel is less than the allowable/permissible diameter and hence it can be concluded that the design is safe from availability of space point of view.

40|$|A new inverse {{inviscid}} method {{suitable for}} the design of rotating blade sections lying on an arbitrary axisymmetric stream-surface with varying streamtube width is presented. The geometry of the axisymmetric stream-surface and the streamtube width variation with meridional distance, the number of blades, the inlet flow conditions, the rotational speed and the suction and pressure side velocity distributions as functions of the normalized arc-length are given. The flow is considered irrotational in the absolute frame of reference and compressible. The output of the computation is the blade section that satisfies the above data. The method solves the flow equations on a (phi 1, psi) potential function-streamfunction plane for the velocity modulus, W and the flow angle beta; the blade section shape can then be obtained as part of the physical plane geometry by integrating the flow angle distribution along streamlines.

Nature 475, 71 - 74; Fischer, G. et al. [2011]. Nature 475, 75 - 77) produced dramatic perturbations to stratospheric temperatures, winds and composition at mbar pressures that persisted {{long after the}} tropospheric disturbance had abated. Thermal infrared (IR) spectroscopy from the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS), supported by ground-based IR imaging from the VISIR instrument on the Very Large Telescope and the MIRSI instrument on NASA's IRTF, is used to track {{the evolution of a}} large, hot stratospheric anticyclone between January 2011 and March 2012. The evolutionary sequence can be divided into three phases: (I) the formation and intensification of two distinct warm airmasses near 0. 5. mbar between 25 and 35 °N (B 1 and B 2) between January-April 2011, moving westward with different zonal velocities, B 1 residing directly above the convective tropospheric storm head; (II) the merging of the warm airmasses to form the large single 'stratospheric beacon' near 40 °N (B 0) between April and June 2011, disassociated from the storm head and at a higher pressure (2 mbar) than the original beacons, a downward shift of 1. 4 scale heights (approximately 85. km) post-merger; and (III) the mature phase characterised by slow cooling (0. 11. ±. 0. 01. K/day) and longitudinal shrinkage of the anticyclone since July 2011. Peak temperatures of 221. 6. ±. 1. 4. K at 2. mbar were measured on May 5 th 2011 immediately after the merger, some 80. K warmer than the quiescent surroundings. From July 2011 to the time of writing, B 0 remained as a long-lived stable stratospheric phenomenon at 2. mbar, moving west with a near-constant velocity of 2. 70. ±. 0. 04. deg/day (- 24. 5. ±. 0. 4. m/s at 40 °N relative to System III longitudes). No perturbations to visible clouds and hazes were detected during this period. With no direct tracers of motion in the stratosphere, we use thermal windshear calculations to estimate clockwise <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocities</b> of 200 - 400 m/s at 2 mbar around B 0. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocities</b> of the two original airmasses were smaller (70 - 140 m/s). In August 2011, the size of the vortex as defined by the peripheral collar was 65 ° longitude (50, 000 km in diameter) and 25 ° latitude. Stratospheric acetylene (C 2 H 2) was uniformly enhanced by a factor of three within the vortex, whereas ethane (C 2 H 6) remained unaffected. The passage of B 0 generated a new band of warm stratospheric emission at 0. 5 mbar at its northern edge, and there are hints of warm stratospheric structures associated with the beacons at higher altitudes (p< 0. 1 mbar) than can be reliably observed by CIRS nadir spectroscopy.

The evolutionary sequence can be divided into three phases: (I) the formation and intensification of two distinct warm airmasses near 0. 5 mbar between 25 and 35 N (one residing directly above the convective storm head) between January-April 2011, moving westward with different zonal velocities; (II) the merging of the warm airmasses to form the large single 'stratospheric beacon' near 40 N between April and June 2011, dissociated from the storm head and at a higher pressure (2 mbar) than the original beacons; and (III) the mature phase characterized by slow cooling and longitudinal shrinkage of the anticyclone since July 2011, moving west with a near-constant velocity of 2. 70 +/- 0. 04 deg/day (- 24. 5 +/- 0. 4 m/s at 40 N). Peak temperatures of 220 K at 2 mbar were measured on May 5 th 2011 immediately after the merger, some 80 K warmer than the quiescent surroundings. Thermal winds hear calculations in August 2011 suggest clockwise <b>peripheral</b> <b>velocities</b> of 200400 mls at 2 mbar, defining a peripheral collar with a width of 65 degrees longitude (50, 000 km in diameter) and 25 degrees latitude. Stratospheric acetylene (C 2 H 2) was uniformly enhanced by a factor of three within the vortex, whereas ethane (C 2 H 6) remained unaffected. We will discuss the thermal and chemical characteristics of Saturn's beacon in its mature phase, and implications for stratospheric vortices on other giant planets...|$|R
