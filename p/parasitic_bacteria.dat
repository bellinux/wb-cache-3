25|$|Many {{bacteria}} are parasitic, though since {{the result is}} infection and disease, sometimes leading to death, they are generally thought of as pathogens instead. <b>Parasitic</b> <b>bacteria</b> are extremely diverse, and infect their hosts {{by a variety of}} routes. To give a few examples, Bacillus anthracis, the cause of anthrax, is spread by contact with infected domestic animals; the bacillus's spores, which can survive for years outside the body, can enter a host through an abrasion or may be inhaled. Borrelia, the cause of Lyme disease and relapsing fever, is transmitted by a vector, ticks of the genus Ixodes, from the diseases' reservoirs in animals such as deer. Campylobacter jejuni, a cause of severe enteritis (gut inflammation), is spread by the fecal-oral route from animals, or by eating insufficiently cooked poultry, or by contaminated water. Haemophilus influenzae, an agent of bacterial meningitis and respiratory tract infections such as influenza and bronchitis, is transmitted by droplet contact. Treponema pallidum, the cause of syphilis, is spread by sexual intercourse.|$|E

50|$|Mycoplasma genitalium, a <b>parasitic</b> <b>bacterium</b> which {{lives in}} the primate bladder, waste {{disposal}} organs, genital, and respiratory tracts, {{is thought to be}} the smallest known organism capable of independent growth and reproduction. With a size of approximately 200 to 300 nm, M. genitalium is an ultramicrobacterium, smaller than other small bacteria, including rickettsia and chlamydia. However, the vast majority of bacterial strains have not been studied, and the marine ultramicrobacteria Sphingomonas sp strain RB2256 is reported to have passed through a 220 nm ultrafilter. A complicating factor is nutrient-downsized bacteria, bacteria that become much smaller {{due to a lack of}} available nutrients.|$|R

50|$|Genome {{evolution}} in bacteria is well understood {{because of the}} thousands of completely sequenced bacterial genomes available. Genetic changes may lead to both increases or decreases of genomic complexity due to adaptive genome streamlining and purifying selection. In general, free-living bacteria have evolved larger genomes with more genes so they can adapt more easily to changing environmental conditions. By contrast, most <b>parasitic</b> <b>bacteria</b> have reduced genomes as their hosts supply many if not most nutrients, so that their genome does not need to encode for enzymes that produce these nutrients themselves.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first draft}} of Candidatus Micrarchaeum acidiphilum ARMAN-2 is ≈1 Mb (3 scaffolds, Baker et al.). PNAS 2010. [...] The ARMAN-2 has {{recently}} been closed using 454 and Solexa sequencing of other biofilms to close the gaps and is being prepared for submission to NCBI. The genomes of ARMAN-4 and ARMAN-5 (roughly 1 Mb as well) have unusually average genes sizes, similar to those seen in endosymbiotic and <b>parasitic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> This may be signature of their inter-species interactions with other Archaea in nature (Baker et al. 2010 [...] ). Furthermore, the branching of these groups near the Euryarchaea/Crenarchaea divide is reflected in them sharing many genetic aspects of both Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea. Specifically they have many genes that had previously only been identified in Crenarchaea. It is difficult to elucidate many of the commonly known metabolic pathways in ARMAN due to the unusually high number of unique genes that {{have been identified in}} their genomes.|$|E
50|$|HTT {{has been}} shown to occur between species and across continents in both plants and animals (Ivancevic et al. 2013), though some TEs have been shown to more {{successfully}} colonize the genomes of certain species over others. Both spatial and taxonomic proximity of species has been proposed to favor HTTs in plants and animals. It is unknown how the density of a population may affect the rate of HTT events within a population, but close proximity due to parasitism and cross contamination due to crowding have been proposed to favor HTT in both plants and animals. Successful transfer of a transposable element requires delivery of DNA from donor to host cell (and to the germ line for multi-cellular organisms), followed by integration into the recipient host genome. Though the actual mechanism for the transportation of TEs from donor cells to host cells is unknown, it is established that naked DNA and RNA can circulate in bodily fluid. Many proposed vectors include arthropods, viruses, freshwater snails (Ivancevic et al. 2013), endosymbiotic bacteria, and intracellular <b>parasitic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In some cases, even TEs facilitate transport for other TEs.|$|E
50|$|Bacterial genomes are {{generally}} smaller and less variant in size among species {{when compared with}} genomes of animals and single cell eukaryotes. Bacterial genomes can range in size anywhere from about 130 kbp to over 14 Mbp. A study that included, but was not limited to, 478 bacterial genomes, concluded that as genome size increases, the number of genes increases at a disproportionately slower rate in eukaryotes than in non-eukaryotes. Thus, the proportion of non-coding DNA goes up with genome size more quickly in non-bacteria than in bacteria. This {{is consistent with the}} fact that most eukaryotic nuclear DNA is non-gene coding, while the majority of prokaryotic, viral, and organellar genes are coding. Right now, we have genome sequences from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. Second-generation sequencing has yielded many draft genomes (close to 90 % of bacterial genomes in GenBank are currently not complete); third-generation sequencing might eventually yield a complete genome in a few hours. The genome sequences reveal much diversity in bacteria. Analysis of over 2000 Escherichia coli genomes reveals an E. coli core genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000 different gene families. Genome sequences show that <b>parasitic</b> <b>bacteria</b> have 500-1200 genes, free-living bacteria have 1500-7500 genes, and archaea have 1500-2700 genes. A striking discovery by Cole et al. described massive amounts of gene decay when comparing Leprosy bacillus to ancestral bacteria. Studies have since shown that several bacteria have smaller genome sizes than their ancestors did. Over the years, researchers have proposed several theories to explain the general trend of bacterial genome decay and the relatively small size of bacterial genomes. Compelling evidence indicates that the apparent degradation of bacterial genomes is owed to a deletional bias.|$|E
50|$|Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus is a gram-negative obligate aerobic and epibiotic <b>parasitic</b> <b>{{bacterium}}</b> with {{a curved}} comma shape. The bacterium {{attaches to the}} surface of green algae of the genus Chlorella. V. chlorellavorus is an extracellular parasite and remains attached to the cell wall. Once attached to its host, V. chlorellavorus divides by binary fission, destroying its host in the process by “sucking out” all of the cellular contents via peripheral vacuoles much like a vampire (hence the name Vampirovibrio). V. chlorellavorus leaves behind only the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of Chromatium along with a few intracytoplasmic inclusions. V. chlorellavorus will not grow in axenic cultures, depending on access to living cells of its preferred algae host, Chlorella vulgaris for reproduction. The Vampirovibrio life cycle consists of: prey location, attachment, ingestion, binary division, and release.|$|R
50|$|The great {{majority}} of Bryobia mites are asexual (although certain species do reproduce sexually). Their populations are all female, and individuals reproduce by thelytoky, a form of parthenogenesis. They emerge from unfertilized eggs. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the asexual species in the genus are not a monophyletic group; indicating that asexual reproduction evolved several times or that sexuality re-evolved. The asexual species have {{a high level of}} genetic diversity considering that they are clones; this may have arisen through hybridization and mutation. In at least two species, namely Bryobia kissophila and B. praetiosa, asexuality is caused by the <b>parasitic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Wolbachia. This bacterium causes functional apomixis in the mites, so that a female produces only offspring that are identical to her. It is possible that Wolbachia could influence the reproductive processes of most bryobia mite species.|$|R
