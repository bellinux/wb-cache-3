25|$|Many public toilets do {{not have}} soap for washing hands, or towels for drying hands. Many people carry a {{handkerchief}} with them for such occasions, and some even carry soap.

25|$|A {{paper towel}} {{has the same}} {{purposes}} as conventional towels such as drying hands, wiping windows, dusting, cleaning up spills. However, <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> can only be used once after they blot wet surfaces. A school teacher in Ashland, Ohio, named Kurt Klier, gave students individual paper squares, so that the single towel in the bathroom would not be infected with germs.

40|$|As {{environmental}} concerns increase, scientists, politicians, and laypersons {{are looking for}} ways to decrease our footprint on the earth. One method is to reduce the amount of waste produced. This study utilizes the Reasoned Action Model (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010) to predict intentions to use a singular <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> Results support the validity of the model for accurately predicting intentions. To investigate the validity of the model for predicting behavior, past power towel usage was used as a proxy to future behavior. Personal norms and intentions combined to account for the most variance in <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> usage. Additionally, participants were randomly assigned to watch a persuasive video on using a single <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> or a control video.

25|$|Before any procedures, the oreo {{cookies are}} frozen for 3 hours {{and the oil}} is {{preheated}} to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

The coated oreo cookies are then dropped into hot oil until the cookies turn golden brown. The cookies are removed from the oil and placed on a sheet pan with <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> for draining the excessive oil.

25|$|If a {{fluorescent}} lamp is broken, {{a very small}} amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment. About 99% of the mercury is typically contained in the phosphor, especially on lamps that are {{near the end of}} their life. The broken glass is usually considered a greater hazard than the small amount of spilled mercury. The EPA recommends airing out the location of {{a fluorescent}} tube break and using wet <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> to help pick up the broken glass and fine particles. Any glass and used towels should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag. Vacuum cleaners can cause the particles to become airborne, and should not be used.|$|E
25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of <b>paper</b> <b>towels.</b> While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of the}} scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E

25|$|Faint bloodstains in {{the main}} hallway of the {{apartment}} indicate {{at least one of}} the victims had been attacked as he entered the apartment. Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked bath towel and <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom. The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, towels, and clothing. Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two machetes from the apartment, but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the television show The Wonder Years. Homer's flashbacks to his childhood were based on the plot of the film Stand By Me, which in turn is based on Stephen King's novella The Body. However, the scenes in the quarry were based on the coming of age film Breaking Away, directed by Peter Yates. Burly, the brand of <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> featured in the episode, is based on the real brand Brawny <b>Paper</b> <b>Towels.</b> The model for Burly <b>paper</b> <b>towels,</b> called Chad Sexington, was based on the Brawny paper towels' logo; however, the logo, within [...] "a year or two of [...] ", was changed into a more [...] "right-of-center" [...] looking brunette, according to Dean Moore.

On Born to Run (1975), Weinberg's drumming evoked {{two of his}} idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> to capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand of <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> to use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the [...] "rock and roll lifestyle"; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, [...] "Show up, do a good job, and give them more than their money's worth." [...] One compromise Weinberg did have to make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as [...] "the Mighty Max". Weinberg started a long practice of keeping his eyes on Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, [...] "What nobody understands is {{that not only is}} Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce's mind. You can't learn that." [...] Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.|$|E

They find that the pipe leads to a ladder which, in turn, leads to Mr. Burns's office. They confront him about the body, but he insists he did not murder anyone. He tells them that the dead man is Smithers' father, Waylon Smithers Sr. He shows an old surveillance tape, filmed during the imminent meltdown in which Smithers' father goes into an unstable reactor core to prevent the meltdown. He succeeds in saving the city, but he dies in the process due to exposure to large amounts of radiation. Burns tells them that he kept the truth from Waylon Jr.; Smithers then enters the room, having heard the entire story. Burns apologizes to him, saying he wanted to spare him from telling the story about his father's real death. However, Smithers admits that he is glad that his father died as a real hero rather than from a tribe of savage Amazon women, which Burns told him earlier. Declaring the case of the haunted quarry solved, Homer stores the skull in his [...] "Memories" [...] box, despite Marge's insistence to give it to Smithers.|$|E
