2500|$|The GT-1 {{was usually}} {{released}} from its carrier aircraft {{at an altitude}} of this provided a standoff range of as much as [...] under ideal conditions. The GT-1's warload consisted of a Mark 13 Mod 2A aerial torpedo. The GT-1 was fitted with a paravane, trailing [...] below {{the main body of the}} craft; upon the paravane's striking the surface of the water, explosive bolts would fire to release the torpedo, which would then execute a <b>preset</b> <b>search</b> pattern to locate and destroy its target.|$|E

The 5 -wire resistive touch screen applying a constant current from {{the four corners of}} the lower conductive layer, and all current flowing out from upper conductive layer. When positioning touch coordinates, first set initial preset point. Then measure the actual diagonal voltage of the touch point. Use the opposition searching method to calculate the theoretical diagonal voltage about <b>preset</b> and <b>searching</b> point. Take the theoretical minimum error diagonal voltage point as the new preset point and then searching repeatedly so that the touch point can be approached finally. The method solves the problem about nonlinear equations solution and distortion correction of the 5 -wire resistive touch screen without the compensation electrode. It can narrow the frame of the 5 -wire resistive touch screen and broaden its applications in a small screen...|$|R
