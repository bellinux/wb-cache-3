Nell, Karim Errouaki and Alain Chanlat the Centre Humanism, Management & Globalization (HMG) at HEC-Montreal. The aim of HGM was {{to support}} {{projects}} and develop programs based on policies that would humanize {{the process of}} globalization across its many dimensions- economic, ecological, social, political, cultural and organizational. Responsibility for putting humanism into practice rests largely {{on the shoulders of}} our leaders and managers. They are the link between macroscopic, societal phenomena and everyday activities that, in contrast are resolutely microscopic in nature. The Mission of HGM was to link these two levels of concern. The approach was to present and disseminate management ideas and practices that are inspired by values and ethics that respect the principles of both universal and <b>pluralist</b> <b>humanism.</b> This {{is the only way to}} make a real contribution and create a true Culture of Peace.|$|E
