5|$|Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye {{return to}} the United States where {{they set up a}} base of {{operations}} in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as the premier U.S. special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the <b>President</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President's DNA and confirms that he is Zartan. They escape after a confrontation with Firefly and Zandar (Matt Gerald), the head of the U.S. Secret Service's Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, the Parliament of Kazakhstan {{approved}} {{a constitutional amendment}} which would allow Nazarbayev to seek re-election {{as many times as}} he wishes.

5|$|The {{constitution}} {{makes no}} mention of a lieutenant governor; if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor. If more than one year remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a new election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the Senate <b>President</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the Speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by the state attorney general, the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order of term, that are in residence in the state {{at the time of the}} vacancy.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012 Republican {{primaries}} the Republican Party of Iowa {{partnered with}} various news {{organizations such as}} Fox News to bring a series of debates that were nationally televised, but directed toward voters in Iowa. This national attention is a potential political boon for a small Midwestern state and attracts attention politically to a state that may otherwise not receive such attention. The caucuses also give power to the party members in the electorate. In this the average GOP voter in Iowa can {{set the tone for}} the entire primary campaign, which gives local voters tremendous control over who the next <b>president</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lastly {{once the}} President of Singapore has arrived (after the playing of the Presidential Fanfare by the Fanfare Trumpeters of the SAF), the Parade Commander will {{call for a}} full (Presidential) salute, during which the National Anthem, Majulah Singapura, will be played {{accompanied}} by a fly-past of the State Flag, and from 2011, would also require raising it as well on a separate flagpole. After that (and the following aerial salute by the RSAF), the Parade Commander will request that the President inspects the parade. During this inspection, the <b>President</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> accompanied by the Chief of Defence Force and the Parade Commander, and the Army GOH Contingent Commander would later join them once they approach the Guard-of-Honour (recent parades have seen a motorized inspection by the President while riding a Land Rover). A presidential 21-gun salute is also given to the President during this time by a select battery from the Singapore Artillery. It is customary that the President speaks to {{some members of the}} Guard-of-honor contingents as he passes by. After the inspection ends, the President will return to the podium before the Guard-of-honor contingents presents a Feu-de-Joie led by the Parade Commander.|$|E

2500|$|In Federalist No. 70, Hamilton {{counters}} {{claims of}} his desire to recreate the monarchy by outlining the structural {{ways in which the}} president’s power is more limited than the power of a king. He points out that the decisive <b>president</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> balanced and checked by a slow and deliberate legislative branch and that the president and the legislative branch will share responsibilities. For example, the president will make appointments and negotiate treaties, while the Congress will possess legislative powers and fund and set rules for the military. [...] The Senate serves as a final check by providing (or not providing) its consent for appointments and treaties.|$|E

50|$|According to a The Washington Quarterly article {{written by}} Ian Bremmer and Samuel Charap in 2006-2007, {{at the start}} of his presidency, Vladimir Putin {{announced}} that he would consolidate political powers in Russia into the so-called power vertical. However, despite being considered successful by many, this controversial endeavour partially backfired and led to the increasing factionalism within the president's inner circle. Although other institutions now became largely irrelevant, disputes and clashes between Kremlin factions, rather than the <b>president's</b> <b>will,</b> <b>are</b> getting more and more important in determining major policy outcomes, Bremmer and Charap write.|$|R
2500|$|It {{is legally}} unclear whether {{removal of a}} {{government}} {{with the consent of}} the President would constitute a coup, as that term is usually understood. According to the Constitution of Fiji, under certain conditions if a state of emergency is declared, the <b>President</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to legally appoint an interim government. However, it is uncertain that the President chose of his free will to remove the Prime Minister, rather than simply appearing to accede {{to the demands of the}} military. In 2007, following the [...] military coup, six Australian and New Zealand judges resigned from the court. They were replaced by two Malaysian judges, [...] "with more appointments from Asia expected to follow soon". The legality of the actions of the military was subject to review by a High Court in 2008 and the Court of Appeals in 2009, the consensus of legal opinion was that the actions of the Fijian military constituted an illegal act. Given that one of the grievances of the military was the alleged leniency of the treatment of the perpetrators of the 2000 coup, the irony of the situation has provoked comment from a number of observers.|$|E
2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the <b>president</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law. [...] I think the president has the right to be a candidate, the governor has the right to be a candidate - I'm not criticizing it, I just ask - how is this possible?" ...|$|E

But on the very day of the outbreak a body of our troops will begin a march to the capital from every town as soon as the local victory has been won.

60|$|But how am I {{to excuse}} the Constitution on those points {{as to which}} it has, as I have said, fallen through, in respect to which it has shown itself to be inefficient by the {{weakness}} of its own words? Seeing that all the executive power is intrusted to the President, it is especially necessary that {{the choice of the}} President should be guarded by constitutional enactments; that the President should be chosen in such a manner as may seem best to the concentrated wisdom of the country. The President is placed in his seat for four years. For that term he is irremovable. He acts without any majority in either of the legislative houses. He must state reasons for his conduct, but he is not responsible for those reasons. His own judgment is his sole guide. No desire of the people can turn him out; nor need he fear any clamor from the press. If an officer so high in power be needed, at any rate the choice of such an officer should be made with the greatest care. The Constitution has decreed how such care should be exercised, but the Constitution {{has not been able to}} maintain its own decree. The constituted electors of the President have become a mere name; and that officer is chosen by popular election, in opposition to the intention of those who framed the Constitution. The effect of this may be seen in the characters of the men so chosen. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, the two Adamses, and Jackson were the owners of names that have become known in history. They were men who have left their marks behind them. Those in Europe who have read of anything, have read of them. Americans, whether as Republicans they admire Washington and the Adamses, or as Democrats hold by Jefferson, Madison, and Jackson, do not at any rate blush for their old Presidents. But who has heard of Polk, of Pierce, of Buchanan? What American is proud of them? In the old days the name of a future President might be surmised. He would probably be a man honored in the nation; but who now can make a guess as to the next President? In one respect a guess may be made with some safety. The next <b>President</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a man whose name has as yet offended no one by its prominence. But one requisite is essential for a President; he must be a man whom none as yet have delighted to honor.|$|E
