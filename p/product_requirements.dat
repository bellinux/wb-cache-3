500|$|Distillation {{is one of}} {{the unit}} {{operations}} of chemical engineering. Continuous distillation is used widely in the chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled. Such industries are the natural gas processing, petrochemical production, coal tar processing, liquor production, liquified air separation, hydrocarbon solvents production and similar industries, but it finds its widest application in petroleum refineries. In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a very complex multicomponent mixture that must be separated and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected, only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, which are called fractions. [...] These fractions are the origin of the term fractional distillation or fractionation. [...] It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these fractions any further based on <b>product</b> <b>requirements</b> and economics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Product</b> {{and process}} <b>requirements</b> are closely linked; a <b>product</b> <b>requirement</b> {{could be said}} to specify the {{automation}} required to support a process requirement while a process requirement {{could be said to}} specify the activities required to support a <b>product</b> <b>requirement.</b> For example, a maximum development cost requirement (a process requirement) may be imposed to help achieve a maximum sales price <b>requirement</b> (a <b>product</b> requirement); a <b>requirement</b> that the <b>product</b> be maintainable (a <b>product</b> <b>requirement)</b> often is addressed by imposing requirements to follow particular development styles (e.g., object-oriented programming), style-guides, or a review/inspection process (process requirements).|$|R

40|$|AbstractProduct {{requirement}} modeling is {{a process}} that the <b>product</b> <b>requirement</b> information is collected, analyzed, structured and converted to the design specification, it is the determinant of the ability to quickly respond to the diverse requirements of customers. This paper presents a <b>product</b> <b>requirement</b> modeling method based on configuration design, which uses “tabular layouts of article characteristics” (SML) technology to conduct the formal expression of <b>product</b> <b>requirement</b> information element. The function structure model and its optimization algorithm are proposed. Enterprises can use the model to interact with customers about requirements and obtain the model which can be manufactured. The customer individual requirements can be satisfied according to the mapping rules of models. Finally, an example of enterprise application is given to illustrate practical application of the research...|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>product</b> <b>requirements</b> or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that [...] "selling arrangements" [...] would be presumed to {{not fall into}} TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected {{them in the same}} manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as [...] "in law and in fact" [...] it was an equally applicable [...] "selling arrangement" [...] (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so {{did not need to be}} justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect [...] "in fact" [...] particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were [...] "the only effective form of promotion enabling [...] to penetrate" [...] the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' [...] "traditional social practices and to local habits and customs" [...] to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory [...] "race to the bottom", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.|$|E
