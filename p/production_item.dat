40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{chip on board}} assembly design for an integrated power switch, based on high power density 800 V silicon lateral insulated-gate bipolar transistor (Si LIGBT) technology. LIGBTs offer much higher current densities (5 - 10 X), significantly lower leakage currents, and lower parasitic device capacitances and, gate charge compared to conventional vertical MOSFETs commonly used in LED drivers. The higher voltage ratings offered (up to 1 kV), the development of high voltage interconnection between parallel IGBTs, self-isolated nature and absence of termination region unlike in a vertical MOSFET makes these devices ideal for ultra-compact, low bill of materials (BOM) count LED drives. Chip on-board LIGBTs also offer significant advantages over MOSFETs due to high ambient temperatures seen {{on most of the}} LED lamps as the LIGBTs on-state losses increase only marginally with temperature.

40|$|The goal of depot {{transformation}} is variability elimination over the production life-cycle. Forced to “ride the bike while we fix it, ” the depot must transform the current batch and queue production style to a lean, cellular paradigm. Major challenges include transforming the infrastructure, work force, facilities, and supply chain. Further, unlike manufacturing production where the “work content ” in a <b>production</b> <b>item</b> has been engineered {{from the ground}} up, work content for a repair item is highly variable and creates a ripple effect across the production system. This paper describes depot-MRO transformation according {{to a series of}} carefully designed transitions that mitigate variability and provide the modeling needs and requirements that, if met, would enable effective modeling and analysis of MRO production scenarios, providing engineers with a Transformation Design Assistant [TDA] for designing and testing production control strategies.

40|$|Case {{hardening}} is a {{metallurgical process}} typically {{to increase the}} fatigue and wear resistance of steel components. The case refers to the hardened layer that is formed in this process, {{and the depth of}} the case is critical to the components’ performance. Currently, to inspect the quality of a batch of material that has gone through the hardening process, {{one or more of the}} parts are sectioned with an abrasive wheel, polished flat and the hardness profile measured using a microhardness indenter. This method of inspection can take several hours, often with the production line stopped, until the results are known. It does have the advantage of measuring directly the desired material properties but has the obvious disadvantages of costly manufacturing down-time, unnecessary scrappage of a <b>production</b> <b>item</b> and assumes that the material properties of other samples in the batch are similar to the one inspected. As a promising alternative approach, nondestructive inspection (NDI) permits a 100 % inspection of the batch which is not economically viable using destructive inspection methods. Generally, NDI methods are based on inferring case depth indirectly through measuring electromagnetic or mechanical properties of the part using eddy current or ultrasonic probes [1 – 4]. Eddy current systems are commonly used for case depth measurements and are known to be reliable for many applications [4]. However, they lack sensitivity if the case depth is deep (e. g. greater than 5 mm in steel parts) and custom probes are required for inspection of components with different geometries...|$|E
40|$|In 1922 Eleanor and David Carroll Churchill founded Churchill Weavers in Berea, Kentucky, and {{it still}} {{continues}} as a unique American handweaving company over 80 years later. While a missionary in India, D. C. Churchill tackled problems within handweaving, the country’s second largest industry next to agriculture. He put to use his MIT education, adapting the loom’s fly-shuttle attachment for greater efficiency. After abandoning his short teaching career at Berea College, the Churchills began a business to employ local people that had few job opportunities. D. C. manufactured the loom he had designed in India and compartmentalized weaving tasks. Eleanor designed items, managed the operation, and marketed the production. Churchill Weavers became known for an amazing array of items—blankets of all sizes and types, fashion accessories, household textiles, and baby items. The production showed inventiveness in design, good color, and a variety in weave structures and fibers. Eleanor Churchill saved one complete piece from each <b>production</b> <b>item,</b> which now forms an outstanding archive of the business, attesting to the creativity of their designers. Churchill Weavers marketed their products {{through a variety of}} retail outlets, including specialty shops, department stores, and their own retail venues.
