40|$|Present study {{deals with}} {{a brief review of}} the quality control tests for the eye <b>preparations</b> as per the {{different}} pharmacopoeias. The quality control tests for eye <b>preparations</b> are different in the different pharmacopoeias like IP, BP, and USP. Eye <b>preparations</b> are sterile liquid, semi-solid or solid <b>preparations</b> intended for administration upon the eyeball and/or to the conjunctiva, or for insertion in the conjunctival sac. It is necessary to know the quality requirements of the different pharmacopoeias for the eye <b>preparations</b> as it is required and important to guarantee the quality product and their supply in different markets of the world. The main aim of the study is to compare the quality control tests for eye <b>preparations</b> as per the IP, BP and USP. The formulations which are taken in to consideration are eye drops, eye ointments, powders for eye drops and eye lotions, semi-solid eye <b>preparations,</b> ophthalmic inserts and eye lotions (or) eye solutions. The types of tests/parameters, procedures and the pharmacopoeial limits/specifications for eye <b>preparations</b> were compared. The quality control tests for different eye <b>preparations</b> are more elaborately given in IP and BP in comparison to USP.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} concentration of diphenylmethane- 4, 4 '-diisocyanate (4, 4 '-MDI) in commercial test <b>preparations</b> was so low that patch testing with the same was not reliable. The stability of 4, 4 '-MDI in petrolatum (pet.) was compared with pet. <b>preparations</b> of polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (PMDI), which consists of a complex mixture of monomeric isomers and oligomers of MDI. <b>Preparations</b> of 4, 4 '-MDI and PMDI were stored under 3 different conditions, i. e. at room temperature, refrigerated and frozen. They were analysed continuously during 1 year {{with regard to the}} content of 4, 4 '-MDI, 3 -ring oligomers and 4 -ring oligomers using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. PMDI <b>preparations</b> kept frozen were stable for a year. All other <b>preparations</b> failed to fulfil the requirements of stability, i. e. +/- 20 % of the initial concentration. Storage in a freezer prolonged the lifetime for 4, 4 '-MDI. The decrease in concentration for <b>preparations</b> kept at room temperature and refrigerated was less rapid in PMDI <b>preparations</b> than in 4, 4 '-MDI <b>preparations.</b> PMDI <b>preparations</b> are better suited for patch testing patients exposed to MDI because they are more stable and homogeneous than 4, 4 '-MDI <b>preparations.</b> They better reflect possible allergens that workers are exposed to because products used in industry contain both monomers and oligomers...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition and classical biologic activities of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; phenol-water) and endotoxin (butanol-water) <b>preparations</b> from virulent Treponema hyodysenteriae and avirulent Treponema innocens were examined. The LPS and endotoxin <b>preparations</b> from T. hyodysenteriae B 204 contained approximately 80. 9 and 35. 2 % hexose, 0. 12 and 0. 45 % thiobarbituric acid-reactive compound, {{and less than}} 1 and 11. 3 % protein, respectively. The LPS and endotoxin <b>preparations</b> of T. innocens B 1555 a contained approximately 56. 3 and 37. 8 % hexose, 0. 45 and 0. 4 % thiobarbituric acid-reactive compound, and less than 1 and 26 % protein, respectively. A silver-stained 7. 5 to 15 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel showed four bands for the T. hyodysenteriae <b>preparations,</b> while the T. innocens <b>preparations</b> failed to resolve into discrete bands on electrophoresis. We determined by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay that the treponemal <b>preparations</b> had comparable amounts of endotoxin activity when Escherichia coli LPS {{was used as a}} standard. The 50 % lethal doses of LPS and endotoxin from T. hyodysenteriae for BALB/cByJ mice were 380 and 80 micrograms, respectively. The treponemal <b>preparations</b> were poor adjuvants, failed to induce a dermal Shwartzman reaction, and were not pyrogenic. The treponemal LPS <b>preparations,</b> unlike the endotoxin <b>preparations,</b> were not mitogenic for murine spleen cells.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{synthetic}} lipid A analogs on murine spleen cells was studied. The <b>preparations</b> represented D-glucosamine and D-glucosaminyl-beta 1, 6 -D-glucosamine disaccharide derivatives substituted in different combinations by ester- and amide-bound fatty acids and by phosphate groups. Significant mitogenic activity was demonstrated {{with a number}} of synthetic disaccharide preparations; however, their potency was lower than that of lipid A. The synthetic <b>preparations</b> were not mitogenic for spleen cells from C 3 H/HeJ mice. Furthermore, the mitogenicity of the synthetic <b>preparations</b> was abolished after binding with polymyxin B. The results indicate that for expression of mitogenicity, a phosphate group at position 1 of the reducing glucosamine and amide-bound acyloxyacyl residues are important factors. Some of the synthetic <b>preparations</b> containing the diglucosamine backbone and expressing relatively low mitogenicity suppressed B-cell mitogenicity of lipid A. Although these <b>preparations</b> were lytic for erythrocytes, they did not affect the viability of the splenic lymphocytes. Suppression was seen when the synthetic <b>preparations</b> were added simultaneously with or after the lipid A mitogen, but optimal suppression was expressed when the <b>preparations</b> were added to the system 3 h before lipid A. Washing of the cells before the addition of lipid A did not affect the results. The suppression was not due to the induction of suppressor cells by the synthetic <b>preparations.</b> The disaccharide <b>preparations</b> did not inhibit T-cell mitogenicity of concanavalin A. In contrast to the disaccharide <b>preparations,</b> the monosaccharide <b>preparations</b> suppressed mitogenicity of both lipid A and concanavalin A, probably because of their direct toxicity for lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{clarify the}} {{usefulness}} of preservative-free ophthalmic <b>preparations</b> equipped with a filter. Methods: A total of 1, 615 samples of in-use ophthalmic <b>preparations</b> were examined for microbial contamination. Results: Of 1, 094 samples of preservative-containing ophthalmic <b>preparations,</b> 31 (2. 8 %) showed microbial contamination. Of 289 samples of preservative-free ophthalmic <b>preparations</b> without a filter, 6 (2. 1 %) were contaminated, consisting of 4 (13. 8 %) of 29 samples of hospital <b>preparations</b> and 2 (0. 8 %) of 260 samples of commercially available new quinolone antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, the microbial contamination rate in preservative-free ophthalmic <b>preparations</b> equipped with a filter was 0 % (0 of 232 samples). The major contaminants detected in these preservative-containing ophthalmic <b>preparations</b> and preservative-free ophthalmic <b>preparations</b> without a filter were glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas fluorescens, Acinetobacter spp., and P. aeruginosa, coagulase (-) staphylococci, and Candida spp. The contaminant level was 10 - 99 colony forming units (CFU) /mL in 37. 8 % (14 of 37 samples), and 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 6 CFU/mL in 62. 2 % (23 of 37 samples).
