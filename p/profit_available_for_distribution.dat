40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the conception of capital and income in the changing economic circumstances of the late nineteenth century. This issue arises as a matter of interest from the confusing accounting for capital assets then followed, and which has become the subject of a small but significant literature. Methodologically the issue, and the literature it has provoked, provide a &# 039;set&# 039; in which an accounting calculation is identified, its context considered and consequences evaluated. It introduces the idea that accounting had macroeconomic implications, and meets Hopwood&# 039;s (1983) injunction that accounting ought to be considered in the context in which it arises. The study illustrates the significance of a flawed accounting founded on an inadequate definition of capital to adversely affect economic life by reference to the legal debate and litigation in English courts about the definition of <b>profit</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> as dividends that occurred {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. The study explores nineteenth century understanding of the concept of capital in economic philosophy on the basis that it would be in that body of philosophic literature that such ideas would have to be examined. The study finds that, for most of the nineteenth century, understanding of the nature of capital and income derived from the works of William Petty and Adam Smith. It held that capital and income were separate states of wealth. This conception of capital continued in the work of David Ricardo, Marx and J. S. Mill, and is evident also in the work of Alfred Marshall. The modern, twentieth century, understanding of capital and income as antithetical states of wealth is identified in the study as deriving from the work of the American economist Irving Fisher in 1896. The contribution of this thesis is to • Establish that the crisis in late nineteenth century financial reporting derived from the prevailing conception of capital and its relationship to income, • note that the conception in legislative requirements determining profit were consistent with that definition, and • identify the origin of the modern, twentieth century understanding of capital and income as antithetical states of wealth. The study provides an in-principle view that nineteenth century capital accounting had the capacity to cause misallocation of resources within an economy...|$|E
40|$|Historical cost {{accounting}} properly interpreted, {{referred to as}} the monetary model, is critically evaluated as the main source of financial information relevant for assessment of money capital maintenance, and also as a major component of accountability of directors to shareholders. The formal representation of the elements of the accounting equation in the double entry calculus (DEC) portrays the relationships between the elements. Changes in assets and liabilities comprise the primitives of the system. General postulates provide the means for deriving a specific interpretation of the DEC from information needs of users. Money capital maintenance and stewardship of money funds are the needs recognised as relevant in the monetary model. In this interpretation, capital is the money amount of the paid in capital, or 2 ̆ 2 money equivalent 2 ̆ 2 for assets contributed in a form other than money. Interpreted consistently within this framework, monetary profit takes on a unique and definite meaning, although due to future uncertainty its periodic measurement can be no more than a test reading. Central to this explanation is the identification of property rights as the qualitative, property for conferring meaning on the elements of the DEC. For the money capital maintenance information need, ownership is the relevant aspect of property rights. As ownership (of property rights) is changed by contracts, contracts provide the means for the interpretation of changes in assets and liabilities - the primitives of the system. Contracts express the consideration as an amount of money. On execution, contracts give rise to transactions, with their consideration providing the quantity for recording the changes in the elements. The acceptance of transactions (via the money consideration) as the fundamental measurements (Willett, 1987, 1988) contributes to the transactions based research Furthermore, the contracts written by the company include those initial transactions with shareholders, the beneficial owners, when the money capital was contributed. Hence the link to money capital, and to the legal concept of money capital maintenance {{for the protection of the}} right of creditors to precedence over shareholders in the settlement of their debts. Writers from both sides of the Atlantic, economists and lawyers as well as accountants, over a long period of time have supported the need for financial information disclosing <b>profits</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution.</b> Due to its future orientation, the concept of economic income does not appear suitable for this purpose. The economic context identified as relevant for this research is Post Keynesian economics, in which future uncertainty, contracts, transactions, money, and time - past, present and future - are specifically recognised for their role in the economic system. Current cash equivalents (CCEs) are selected as an alternative interpretation of the DEC contrast with the monetary model. Due to the emphasis of the property right to dispose of assets, assets and liabilities were interpreted as wealth. Although providing relevant information for the information needs selected (debt paying potential, potential for adaptation, and calculation of net exchangeable asset backing per share), CCEs do not appear to meet measurement theory criteria. However, CCEs do qualify under the conditions suggested by Vickrey (1970). Moreover, a series of surveys initiated by Chambers provided evidence of support for disclosure of measurement of the wealth of a company. Such disclosure would complement the disclosure of the traditional profit statement and balance sheet prepared using the monetary model. Each of these two models provides financial information relevant to different purposes...|$|R
