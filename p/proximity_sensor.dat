25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to user inputs, the device also has several sensors {{that give the}} phone information about its orientation and external conditions. These include a three-axis gyroscope, an accelerometer, a <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor,</b> and an ambient light sensor. The [...] is stated to have 200hours standby time, 8hours talk time on 3G, 14hours talk time on 2G, 6hours 3G browsing, and 9hours Wi-Fi browsing. Additionally, it can sustain up to 10hours of video playback or 40hours of audio playback.|$|E
2500|$|The initial ERS-110 AIBO's {{hardware}} {{includes a}} 64-bit RISC processor, 16 megabytes of RAM, sensors (touch, camera, range-finder, microphone, acceleration, angular velocity), a speaker and actuators (legs, neck, mouth, tail). As the series developed, more sensors and actuators were added. Wi-Fi was available as an add {{on for some}} second-generation AIBOs. The third and final family of AIBOs, the ERS-7s, have multiple head and body sensors, clicking ear actuators, a chest-mounted <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor,</b> expressive [...] "Illume-Face" [...] and Wi-Fi.|$|E

2500|$|Some users {{reported}} a yellow discoloration {{of the screen}} that disappeared after several days, which was attributed to the glass lamination glue that was used. It {{did not have time}} to dry fully before the unit reached consumers due to the speed of manufacturing. Another issue reported by some users within days of the iPhone 4 release was that during calls the <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> can be insensitive, so that facial contact with the touchscreen can end calls, mute calls, and dial other numbers. Some users reported that, particularly in low-light conditions, photos taken on the iPhone 4 sometimes contained blue or green [...] "splotches." [...] Issues with white balance were also discovered, particularly when using the flash.|$|E
2500|$|Ubuntu Edge was a {{proposed}} smartphone with high-end specifications, often called a [...] "superphone". Edge {{would have been}} powered by a multi-core processor and at least 4GB of RAM. The internal storage would have been 128GB. A micro-SIM slot {{would have been a}}vailable. An 8 MP rear camera and 2 MP front-facing camera would also be available. The screen would have been a 4.5" [...] sapphire crystal display (claimed to be scratchable only by diamond) with 1280 x 720 HD resolution. On the connectivity side Edge would have included Dual-LTE, dual-band 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4 and NFC. GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor,</b> compass, barometer etc. would be included from the input side. It would have had Stereo speakers with HD audio and allowed use of a dual microphone recording system with active noise cancellation. Edge would have had an 11-pin connector providing simultaneous MHL and USB OTG. A 3.5mm jack would have been included and a silicon-anode Li-Ion battery would power the device.|$|E
2500|$|The S4 was {{originally}} released with Android 4.2.2 and Samsung's TouchWiz Nature UX 2 interface. Head tracking features have been extended on the S4; the new [...] "Smart Scroll" [...] feature {{can be used}} to scroll while looking at the screen by slightly tilting head or phone forward or backward, and [...] "Smart Pause" [...] allows the video player to pause videos if the user is not looking at the screen. [...] "Air View" [...] and [...] "Air Gestures" [...] implement gestures and other functionality (such as previewing images or messages) by holding or swiping a hand or finger slightly above the screen, similarly to Samsung's Galaxy Note series, and adds a feature known as [...] "Quick Glance", which uses the <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> to wake the phone so it can display notifications. The [...] "Group Play" [...] feature allows ad hoc sharing of files between Galaxy phones, along with multiplayer games and music streaming between S4 phones. The S4 also introduces Knox in the Android 4.3 update, a suite of features which implements a sandbox for enterprise environments that can co-exist with a user's [...] "personal" [...] data. Knox incorporates use of the ARM TrustZone extensions and security enhancements to the Android platform.|$|E

50|$|<b>Proximity</b> <b>sensors</b> {{can be used}} to {{recognise}} air {{gestures and}} hover-manipulations. An array of proximity sensing elements can replace vision-camera or depth camera based solutions for the hand gesture detection. In particular, a car infotainment system (7 inch - 14 inch) in vehicle can employ the <b>proximity</b> <b>sensors</b> to cover the sensing area over the screen. For example, LG Electronics has recently filed several patents addressing this advanced technology.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{features}} {{may include}} a heated seat, {{which may be}} adjustable from 30°C to 40°C; an automatic lid equipped with a <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor,</b> which opens and closes based on {{the location of the}} user. Some play music to relax the user's sphincter [...] (some Inax toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 Frühlingslied by Felix Mendelssohn). Other features are automatic flushing, automatic air deodorizing, and a germ-resistant surface. Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user to stand back up after use. A soft close feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have air conditioning below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone {{standing in front of the}} toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).|$|E
50|$|A <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> often emits an {{electromagnetic}} field or {{a beam of}} electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), and looks {{for changes in the}} field or return signal. The object being sensed {{is often referred to as}} the proximity sensor's target. Different <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> targets demand different sensors. For example, a capacitive or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> always requires a metal target.|$|E
