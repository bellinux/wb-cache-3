40|$|Abstract—The {{efficient}} {{operation of}} any biological treatment process requires <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> incompatible pollutants such as acids, bases, oil, toxic substances, etc. which hamper {{the treatment of}} other major components which are otherwise degradable. The <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> alkaline waste-waters, generated from various industries like textile, paper & pulp, potato-processing industries, etc., having a pH of 10 or higher, is essential. The pre-treatment, i. e., neutralization of such alkaline waste-waters {{can be achieved by}} chemical as well as biological means. However, the biological pretreatment offers better package over the chemical means by being safe and economical. The biological pre-treatment can be accomplished by using a blend of microorganisms able to withstand such harsh alkaline conditions. In the present study, for the proper <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> alkaline waste-waters, a package of alkalophilic bacteria is formulated to neutralise the alkaline pH of the industrial waste-waters. The developed microbial package is cost-effective as well as environmental friendly. Keywords—alkaline, alkalophilic bacteria, biological, pollutants, textile. T I...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: High-dose {{chemotherapy}} using methotrexate (MTX) frequently induces {{side effects}} such as mucositis {{that leads to}} intestinal damage and diarrhea. Several natural compounds have been demonstrated of their effectiveness in protecting intestinal epithelial cells from these adverse effects. In this paper, we investigated the protection mechanism of lutein against MTX-induced damage in IEC- 6 cells originating from the rat jejunum crypt. Methods: The cell viability, induced-apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential in IEC- 6 cells under MTX treatment were examined in {{the presence or absence}} of lutein. Expression level of Bcl 2, Bad and ROS scavenging enzymes (including SOD, catalase and Prdx 1) were detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: The cell viability of IEC- 6 cells exposed to MTX was decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. MTX induces mitochondrial membrane potential loss, ROS generation and caspase 3 activation in IEC- 6 cells. The cytotoxicity of MTX was reduced in IEC- 6 cells by the 24 h <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> lutein. We found that <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> lutein significantly reduces MTX-induced ROS and apoptosis. The expression of SOD was up-regulated by the <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> lutein in the MTX-treated IEC- 6 cells. These results indicated that lutein can protect IEC- 6 cells from the chemo-drugs induced damage through increasing ROS scavenging ability. Conclusion: The MTX-induced apoptosis of IEC- 6 cells was shown to be repressed by the <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> lutein, which ma...|$|R
40|$|Several common protein {{extraction}} protocols {{have been}} applied on seaweeds, but extraction yields have been limited. The aims {{of this study were}} to further develop and optimize existing extraction protocols and to examine the effect <b>of</b> enzymatic <b>pre-treatment</b> on bioaccessibility and extractability of seaweed proteins. Enzymatic <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> seaweed samples resulted in a three-fold increase in amino acids available for extraction. Combining enzymatic pre-treatment with alkaline extraction resulted in a 1. 6 -fold increase in the protein extraction yield compared to a standard alkaline extraction protocol. A simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion model showed that enzymatic <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> seaweed increased the amount of amino acids available for intestinal absorption 3. 2 -fold. In conclusion, enzymatic <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> seaweeds is effective for increasing the amount of amino acids available for utilization and may thus be an effective means for increasing the utilization potential of seaweed proteins. However, both the enzymatic pre-treatment protocol and the protein extraction protocol need further optimization in order to obtain optimal cost-benefit and results from the in vitro gastrointestinal digestion model need to be confirmed in clinical models...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{aldosterone}} on connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was examined in rat embryonic ventricular myocytes.

Aldosterone treatment resulted in activation of ERK 1 / 2, p 38 MAPK, and JNK pathways with a more transient pattern in p 38 MAPK.

40|$|Soil aquifer {{treatment}} (SAT) using primary effluent (PE) is {{an attractive}} option for wastewater treatment and reuse {{in many developing countries}} with no or minimal wastewater treatment. One of the main limitations of SAT of PE is rapid clogging of the infiltration basin due to high suspended solid concentrations. Some <b>pre-treatment</b> <b>of</b> PE before infiltration is likely to reduce this limitation, improve performance of SAT and help to implement this technology effectively. The effects <b>of</b> three <b>pre-treatment</b> options namely sedimentation (SED), coagulation (COAG) and horizontal roughing filtration (HRF) on SAT were analyzed by conducting laboratory-scale batch and soil column experiments. The sedimentation and coagulation pre-treatments led to less head loss development and reduction of clogging effect. The head loss development in soil column using PE + COAG and PE + SED was reduced by 85 and 72 %, respectively, compared to PE alone without any pretreatment. The overall dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal <b>of</b> <b>pre-treatments</b> and soil column collectively were 34, 44, 51 and 43. 5 % for PE without any pre-treatment, PE + SED, PE+ COAG and PE + HRF, respectively.
