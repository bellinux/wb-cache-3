Despite reportedly heavy automobile traffic on the busy street, no vehicles were struck, and nobody aboard the airliner was seriously injured. The crash was attributed to poor braking action on the rain-slicked runway.|$|E
25|$|McCulloch's force {{consisted}} of a cavalry brigade under Brigadier General James McIntosh, an infantry brigade under Col. Louis Hébert, and a combined force of Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole cavalry under Brig. Gen. Albert Pike. McCulloch's troops swung west on the Ford Road and <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> elements of the Federal army at a small village named Leetown, where a fierce firefight erupted.|$|E

25|$|On August 31, 1986, Aeroméxico Flight 498 on {{approach}} to Los Angeles International Airport {{was struck by}} a small Piper aircraft that had strayed into an air traffic control zone reserved for commercial flights. 82 people died, including 15 people on the ground. The Piper crashed onto Cerritos Elementary School's unoccupied playground, but the Douglas DC-9 fell inverted (upside-down) out of the sky and <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> dense residential zones, immediately flattening four houses. Eight more houses were destroyed by the subsequent fire before firefighters could bring it under control. The incident is memorialized with a new sculpture installed in the Cerritos Sculpture Garden.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2001, seven DIA {{employees}} {{lost their}} lives along with 118 other victims at the Pentagon in a terrorist attack when American Airlines Flight 77 piloted by five Al-Qaeda hijackers <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> {{the western side of}} the building, as part of the September 11 attacks. The death of seven employees at once was the largest combined loss in DIA's history. On September 11, 2009, DIA dedicated a memorial to the seven employees lost in the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon. The memorial is located in the garden at the Defense Intelligence Agency Analysis Center in Washington D.C.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. Time passed {{with no sign}} of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith {{suggested}} that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they heard the sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.|$|E
50|$|The {{investigating}} board {{ruled that}} the crash occurred because the first landing had damaged the control system, and that Kelly sacrificed himself to avoid <b>plowing</b> <b>into</b> the encampment.

25|$|Following his {{discharge}} from the military, Macpherson returned to Oregon where his father, Hector Macpherson, Sr., operated a dairy farm in rural Linn County, Oregon. The idea of farming held {{an appeal to the}} returning flight navigator and father and son entered into a business partnership in the fall of 1945. Funds accumulated during the war years were <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> the business. At the end of a pre-arranged one-year partnership, his father sold son Huck the 180-acre homestead for a modest sum. A growing family and farm consumed the next quarter century, with the farm expanded and modernized {{during the second half of}} the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|As Marcognet's {{division}} crested the ridge, the 2nd Scots Greys Dragoons <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> it and routed it. Emerging on the {{far side}} of Marcognet's shattered division, the Greys spotted Durutte's 1st Brigade and galloped toward it. The French closed ranks and the sides faced outward to receive cavalry. Coming on in dispersed order, the Greys were thoroughly repulsed and many saddles were emptied. Soon after, a so-far unengaged squadron of the 1st Royal Dragoons attacked the brigade as a disciplined body and smashed into its left flank, which was only 12-ranks deep. This time, the brigade collapsed in panic as the troops fled in every direction and a number of them surrendered.|$|E
25|$|On September 18, 2017, {{during the}} morning rush hour, a private tour bus moving at a high speed {{collided}} {{with the back of}} a Q20 bus turning from Main Street onto Northern Boulevard in Flushing. The bus then <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> a Kennedy Fried Chicken restaurant {{at the corner of the}} intersection. The accident killed 3 people including the tour bus driver, and injured at least 17. The private charter bus company had been repeatedly cited for reckless driving. The charter driver was a former MTA bus driver, until he was fired in April 2015 after a crash in his personal automobile in which he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and leaving the scene of the crash.|$|E

Pictor A is X-ray source designated H 0517-456 and 3U 0510-44.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} sometimes created dangerous {{situations in}} which cars would be racing near wrecked cars, with possibly injured drivers, and prevent the safety team from reaching the stricken cars quickly. Also, there were numerous situations where cars racing back to the caution nearly, {{or in some cases}} did, become part of the crash by <b>plowing</b> <b>into</b> slow or stopped cars on the track.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Plowing</b> <b>Into</b> the Field of Love {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, achieving a 76/100 on Metacritic based on 21 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". Kyle Greco of Smash Cut Reviews gave the album a positive review calling it [...] "one {{of the more}} inventive and replayable punk records of the year." [...] He gave the album a score of 8.8/10.|$|R
25|$|At {{this moment}} Saint-Cyr {{arrived at the}} front to witness the {{collapse}} of the first attack. The French commander immediately directed Souham's 10 battalions to angle to their left and assault Reding's right flank. He also sent Pino's second brigade, the three battalions each of the 1st Light and 6th Line, to rush the Spanish center. Fontane continued to distract the enemy's left flank with his two battalions. Souham's heavy column <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> and ruptured Reding's line. Meanwhile, Pino's second brigade pressed back the Spanish center. With the Spanish position unraveling, Saint-Cyr ordered the Italian light cavalry under Carlo Balabio to charge up the main highway. As the horsemen galloped up the hill, the entire Spanish force bolted to the rear.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to smaller circuits, road racing drivers {{rely heavily on}} the use of flags. As it is impractical to have spotters covering all segments of a winding race track, the first indication to drivers of local hazards almost always comes from marshals stationed at various flag stations around the course. Missing or disregarding a flag can have critical consequences, as Mario and Michael Andretti discovered during a 1991 CART race in Detroit, Michigan. Michael came around a blind corner at high speed, without heeding the yellow flag being displayed—and <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> the back of a CART safety truck tending to another disabled car. Fifteen seconds later, his father Mario disregarded the same madly waving yellows and crashed into the car the safety vehicle was trying to assist.|$|E
25|$|The one-car {{approach}} paid immediate dividends as Almirola {{recorded a}} top ten {{finish in the}} 2017 Daytona 500. However, in the season's eleventh race, the 2017 Go Bowling 400, Almirola lost control of his car in a path of debris left by Joey Logano. Almirola's car <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> Logano's and {{the back end of}} the car left the ground. Almirola was then immediately airlifted to a hospital, where he would later be diagnosed with a shattered T5 vertebrae, for which he would miss eight to twelve races. Regan Smith was named as the replacement for the Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race, racing until the AAA Drive for Autism at Dover. Roush Fenway Racing's Xfinity Series driver Darrell Wallace Jr. made his Cup Series debut in the No. 43, driving the car until Almirola was fit to return to racing. Ford sports car racer Billy Johnson drove the No. 43 at Sonoma. Almirola returned to the car at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in July.|$|E
500|$|More {{exciting}} for planetary astronomers {{was that the}} best orbital calculations suggested that the comet would pass within [...] {{of the center of}} Jupiter, a distance smaller than the planet's radius, meaning that there was an extremely high probability that SL9 would collide with Jupiter in July 1994. Studies suggested that the train of nuclei would <b>plow</b> <b>into</b> Jupiter's atmosphere over a period of about five days.|$|R
50|$|Triggered by {{the death}} of Krusty's father, Lisa becomes obsessed with {{protecting}} her own father, Homer, from getting hurt. She wraps him in bubble wrap, which ends up saving his life when Otto's school bus <b>plows</b> <b>into</b> the garden. Eventually Marge and Bart talk some sense into Lisa, that while it is nice of her to be concerned for her father, she should not force Homer to take it easy on himself and just let him live his life.|$|R
25|$|The Rex Smith Biplane {{was used}} in the {{successful}} April 3, 1911 U.S. Army Signal Corps experiments in wireless communications. Potomac river pontoon experiments on April 5, were not as successful, with the aircraft <b>plowing</b> <b>into</b> the water headfirst nearly drowning the test pilot Jannus. Just two days later the machine was ready again. Janus took up actor Nat M. Wills, and later two female passengers at the same time. Marking the first time an aircraft flew with more than one passenger.|$|R
25|$|Suddenly, the 2nd Scots Greys Dragoon Regiment {{appeared}} {{behind the}} 92nd and <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> Marcognet's division. The effect was catastrophic. The British cavalrymen, mounted on large horses, rained sword-cuts on the French foot soldiers as they hewed a bloody {{path through the}} formation. During the one-sided melee, the 45th Line lost its eagle. The Scots Greys rode completely through the 3rd Division, but were repulsed by one of Durutte's brigades. Those Frenchmen who were untouched by British heavy cavalry swords immediately fled back toward their own lines chased by the British and Netherlands infantry. Altogether, about 3,000 prisoners were gathered up from d'Erlon's four divisions, {{all of which were}} broken by cavalry. Late in the day, Marcognet got together a rump of his division in order to support the final assault on La Haye Sainte. Shortly before the defeat of the Old Guard's final attack, the remnant of the 3rd Division rallied to attack one last time.|$|E
25|$|The bulk {{of modern}} {{commercial}} production uses the plasticulture system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year, fumigated, {{and covered with}} plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, {{in order to encourage}} the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. At the end of the harvest season, the plastic is removed and the plants are <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> the ground. Because strawberry plants more than a year or two old begin to decline in productivity and fruit quality, this system of replacing the plants each year allows for improved yields and denser plantings. However, because it requires a longer growing season to allow for establishment of the plants each year, and because of the increased costs in terms of forming and covering the mounds and purchasing plants each year, it is not always practical in all areas.|$|E
25|$|But {{help was}} on the way. Receiving news of the Spanish invasion, Édouard Milhaud marched his cavalry to Baza. He {{reaching}} there early on 4 November 1810 and united his horsemen with Rey's 2,000 French infantry. Milhaud brought 1,300 cavalrymen, including the 5th, 12th, 16th, 20th, and 21st Dragoon Regiments and the Polish lancers of the Legion of the Vistula. The French also had two horse artillery batteries. Blake had 12 guns {{in addition to the}} 1st and 2nd Divisions of the Army of the Center. Arranging his troopers {{on both sides of the}} main highway, Milhaud ordered a cavalry charge. The French horsemen <b>plowed</b> <b>into</b> Blake's horsemen and scattered them. As the Spanish cavalry fled, they rode through their own infantry formations. When the French dragoons and Polish lancers galloped toward the disordered Spanish infantry, the men took to their heels. The Imperial French horsemen completely smashed Blake's vanguard, hacking down scores of soldiers and capturing hundreds of others. When the French came upon Blake's second division deployed in difficult terrain, they stopped their charge. Blake quickly ordered a retreat. In the Battle of Baza the French lost 200 killed and wounded. The cavalry won the battle and Rey's infantry suffered negligible losses. Blake's army lost 500 killed and wounded and 1,000 soldiers captured.|$|E
