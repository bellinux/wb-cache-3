5000|$|At {{an initial}} time a blocking-type {{circulation}} pattern establishes in the troposphere. This blocking pattern causes Rossby waves with zonal wavenumber 1 and/or 2 {{to grow to}} unusually large amplitudes. The growing wave propagates into the stratosphere and decelerates the mean zonal winds. Thus the polar night jet weakens and simultaneously becomes distorted by the growing planetary waves. Because the wave amplitude increases with decreasing density this easterly acceleration process is not effective at fairly high levels. If the waves are sufficiently strong the mean zonal flow may decelerate sufficiently so that the winter westerlies turn easterly. At this point planetary waves may no longer penetrate into the stratosphere [...] ). Hence further upward transfer of energy is completely blocked and a very rapid easterly deceleration and the polar warming occur at this critical level, which must then move downward until eventually the warming and zonal wind reversal affect the entire <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b>|$|E

The mechanisms that drive {{the changes in the}} SH troposphere are not fully understood, but most previous hypotheses have focused on the role of atmospheric dynamics rather than that of radiation. This study quantifies the radiative response of temperatures in the SH polar troposphere to the forcing from long-term temperature and ozone trends in the SH <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> A novel methodology is employed that explicitly neglects changes in tropospheric dynamics and hence isolates the component of the tropospheric temperature response that is radiatively driven by the overlying stratospheric trends. The results reveal that both the amplitude and seasonality of the observed cooling of the middle and upper SH polar troposphere {{over the past few decades}} are consistent with a reduction in downwelling longwave radiation induced by cooling in the SH <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> The results are compared with analogous calculations for trends in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Both the observations and radiative calculations imply that the comparatively weak trends in the NH <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> have not played a central role in driving NH tropospheric climate change. Overall, the results suggest that radiative processes play a key role in coupling the large trends in SH polar stratospheric temperatures to tropospheric levels.

40|$|According to the 'downward control' principle, the extratropical mean {{vertical}} velocity {{on a given}} {{pressure level}} is approximately proportional to the meridional gradient of the vertically integrated zonal force per unit mass exerted by waves above that level. In this paper, a simple numerical model that includes parameterizations of both planetary and gravity wave breaking is used to {{explore the influence of}} gravity wave breaking in the mesosphere on the mean meridional circulation and temperature distribution at lower levels in the <b>polar</b> winter <b>stratosphere.</b> The results of these calculations suggest that gravity wave drag in the mesosphere can affect the state of the <b>polar</b> winter <b>stratosphere</b> down to altitudes below 30 km. The effect is most important when planetary wave driving is relatively weak: that is, during southern winter and in early northern winter. In southern winter, downwelling weakens by a factor of 2 near the stratospause and by 20 % at 30 km when gravity wave drag is not included in the calculations. As a consequence, temperatures decrease considerably throughout the <b>polar</b> winter <b>stratosphere</b> (over 20 K above 40 km and as much as 8 K at 30 km, where the effect is enhanced by the long radiative relaxation timescale). The polar winter states obtained when gravity wave drag is omitted in this simple model resemble the results of simulations with some general circulation models and suggest that some of the shortcomings of the latter may be due to a deficit in mesospheric momentum deposition by small-scale gravity waves...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} the Arctic <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is {{observed}} to be similar in many respects {{to that of the}} Antarctic <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> where an ozone hole has been identified. Most of the available chlorine (CHl and ClONO 2) was converted by reactions on polar stratospheric clouds to reactive ClO and Cl 2 O 2 thoroughout the Arctic polar vortex before midwinter. Reactive nitrogen was converted to HNO 3, and some, with spatial inhomogeneity, fell out of the stratosphere. These chemical changes ensured characteristic ozone losses of 10 to 15 percent at altitudes inside the polar vortex where polar stratospheric clouds had occurred. These local losses can translate into 5 to 8 percent losses in the vertical column abundance of ozone. As the amount of stratospheric chlorine inevitably increases by 50 percent over the next two decades, ozone losses recognizable as an ozone hole may well appear...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} {{that control the}} temperature of the <b>polar</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> during spring is key to understanding ozone loss in the Arctic polar vortex. Spring ozone loss rates are directly tied to polar stratospheric temperatures by the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, and the conversion of chlorine species to reactive forms on these cloud particle surfaces. In this paper, we study those factors that control temperatures in the <b>polar</b> lower <b>stratosphere.</b> We use the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) /NCAR reanalysis data covering the last two decades to investigate how planetary wave driving of the stratosphere is connected to polar temperatures. In particular, we show that planetary waves forced in the troposphere in mid- to late winter (January-February) are principally responsible for the mean polar temperature during the March period. These planetary waves are forced by both thermal and orographic processes in the troposphere, and propagate into the stratosphere in the mid and high latitudes. Strong mid-winter planetary wave forcing leads to a warmer Arctic lower stratosphere in early spring, while weak mid-winter forcing leads to cooler Arctic temperatures...|$|R
