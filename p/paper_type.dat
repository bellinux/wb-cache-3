25|$|In {{the early}} Washington-Franklin issues (1908–11), every design {{incorporated}} {{a pair of}} olive branches surrounding {{one or the other}} of the two profiles. From 1912 on, however, the Franklin-head issues would instead appear with Oak leaves near the bottom of the oval in the image. Olive branches and Oak leaves are often used as symbols for peace (Olive branches) and strength (Oak leaves), though no significance was officially acknowledged in their use here. The Washington-Franklins were issued in denominations ranging from 1-cent to 5-dollars, each value printed in different color ink. The two engravings of either Washington or Franklin are employed in five basic design themes (i.e., framework, ornaments, lettering) which in turn were used to print more than 250 separate and distinct stamp issues over a fourteen-year period. During this time seven separate series of the Washington-Franklins appeared in succession, each series differing somewhat from its predecessor in physical characteristics (i.e., <b>paper</b> <b>type,</b> perforation size, etc.), while some series would also introduce new denominations printed with new colors. Produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington D.C., these issues were generally printed by the flat-plate process, but several of the issues also employed other new and experimental printing methods, including use of the revolutionary rotary printing press and the offset printing process. The first Washington-Franklin postage stamp to be released was a two-cent stamp issued on November 16, 1908. Other denominations soon followed and would continue to appear through the first World War years, with the last Washington-Franklin postage stamp issued in 1923. The series thus survived for almost fifteen years, longer than any previous U. S. Postage Stamp series produced by a single printing organization.|$|E

60|$|This {{fragment}} {{of a literary}} dialogue I translate from 'Entretiens sur les Contes de Fees,' a book which contains more of old talk about books and booksellers than about fairies and folk-lore. The 'Entretiens' were published in 1699, about sixteen years after the Elzevirs ceased to be publishers. The fragment is valuable: first, because it shows us how early the taste for collecting Elzevirs was fully developed, and, secondly, because it contains very sound criticism of the mania. Already, in the seventeenth century, lovers of the tiny Elzevirian books waxed pathetic over dates, already they knew that a 'Caesar' of 1635 was the right 'Caesar,' already they were fond of the red-lettered passages, as in {{the first edition of}} the 'Virgil' of 1636. As early as 1699, too, the Parisian critic knew that the editions were not very correct, and that the <b>paper,</b> <b>type,</b> ornaments, and FORMAT were their main attractions. To these we must now add the rarity of really good Elzevirs.|$|E
60|$|A book, even Audubon (I {{believe the}} biggest known), {{is smaller than}} a man; but, in {{relation}} to space, I entertain more proximate apprehension of pressure upon available space from the book population than from the numbers of mankind. We ought to recollect, with more of a realized conception than we commonly attain to, that a book consists, like a man, from whom it draws its lineage, of a body and a soul. They are not always proportionate to each other. Nay, even the different members of the book-body do not sing, but clash, when bindings of a profuse costliness are imposed, as too often happens {{in the case of}} Bibles and books of devotion, upon letter-press which is respectable journeyman's work and nothing more. The men of the Renascence had a truer sense of adaptation; the age of jewelled bindings was also the age of illumination and of the beautiful miniatura, which at an earlier stage meant side or margin art,[3] and then, on account of the small portraitures included in it, gradually slid into the modern sense of miniature. There is a caution which we ought to carry with us more and more as we get in view of the coming period of open book trade, and of demand practically boundless. Noble works ought not to be printed in mean and worthless forms, and cheapness ought to be limited by an instinctive sense and law of fitness. The binding of a book is the dress with which it walks out into the world. The <b>paper,</b> <b>type</b> and ink are the body, in which its soul is domiciled. And these three, soul, body, and habilament, are a triad which ought to be adjusted to one another by the laws of harmony and good sense.|$|E

The goal of this work is to present a fast and successful methodology for identifying different <b>paper</b> <b>types.</b> In this way, undesirable <b>paper</b> <b>types</b> can be refused, thus improving the runnability of the paper machine {{and the quality of the}} paper manufactured. In this work we examine various <b>types</b> of <b>paper</b> using information obtained by an appropriate chemometric treatment of infrared spectral data.

We recorded Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra with the aid of an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) module and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra by means of fiber optics. Both techniques proved expeditious and required no sample pretreatment. The primary objective of this work was to develop a methodology for the accurate identification of samples of different <b>paper</b> <b>types.</b> For this purpose, we used the chemometric discrimination technique extended canonical variate analysis (ECVA) in combination with the k nearest neighbor (kNN) method to classify samples in the prediction set.
