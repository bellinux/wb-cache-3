Recently, the need for modern management has increased due to technologies and superior materials appearance, as patient’s demands. Research goal is to increase efficiency by evaluating dental medical office cost categories in real pricing procedures. Empirical research is based on guided study that includes information about the association between categories of cost <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> therapeutic <b>procedures</b> commonly used in dental offices. Due to the obtained results to identify all the labours that make up a settled procedure costs were determined for each procedure.

40|$|The {{underlying}} reasoning of much {{red tape}} research {{is that the}} level of rule burden, in terms of resources expended at implementing and complying with specific rules, is the main driver of red tape perceptions. In this study we challenge this claim and argue that stakeholder red tape perceptions are also affected by the favourability of the outcome. More specifically, if a certain rule or procedure has a positive outcome for a certain stakeholder, then this stakeholder will perceive lower levels of red tape, irrespective of rule burden. Using a survey experiment (n= 81), we show how variations in red tape perceptions are affected in equal measure by rule burden and outcome. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for red tape scholars, in particular the need to further understand the relationships between red tape <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> rule <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> outcomes...|$|R

C. B.

William P. Alston presents his own analogy argument from religious experience in Perceiving God.

In doing so, Alston maintains that sense <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> certain kinds of religious experience that count as perception?mystical perception?produce justified beliefs in very similar ways. Thus, Alston defuses Martin's objection by arguing that both kinds of <b>perception</b> have testing <b>and</b> checkup <b>procedures</b> available to them, procedures which are necessary to defeat the prima facie justification of perceptual beliefs. However, I argue that because there are apparently inconsistent core beliefs in the practice of forming beliefs on the basis of Christian mystical perception, the analogy between sense <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> mystical <b>perception</b> is threatened.

It {{is based on a}} microscopic array {{of hundreds of thousands of}} lenses that form a single apparatus, providing streaming 3 D imaging without the side effects of previous 3 D systems. This study analyzed the VS- 1 system in terms of operative results and surgeon satisfaction compared with the standard two-dimensional (2 D) imaging system. Eighty-eight patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery of different difficulty levels, performed by three different surgeons, graded as novice or experienced, were randomly assigned for the VS- 1 3 D or the standard 2 D imaging systems, 44 patients in each group. Results showed that, when using the 3 D VS- 1 system, surgery duration was reduced for both novice and experienced surgeons. Surgeons reported having good depth <b>perception,</b> anatomic understanding <b>and</b> <b>procedure</b> efficiency, as well as physician confidence and efficiency during complicated maneuvers.

40|$|Laparoscopy is a {{minimally}} invasive alternative to traditional abdominal surgery. Unlike traditional surgery, a laparoscopic procedure {{can be completed}} using small incisions. The use of these small incision results in reduced pain to the patient, shorter recovery times, and less trauma to skin, muscle and other tissues. However, these benefits to the patient are offset by the increased difficulty to the surgeon performing the procedure. These difficulties include reduced dexterity, reduced <b>perception,</b> <b>and</b> longer <b>procedure</b> times. The use of small in vivo robotic devices in {{minimally invasive}} surgery is one possible solution to these problems. The movement of these devices is not constrained by {{the position of the}} entry incision, because the devices would be completely intracorporeal. In addition to improving the quality of minimally invasive surgery, devices such as these could be used to perform supervised autonomous surgical tasks over a high latency communications channel. This dissertation discusses the contributions of the author towards the goal of creating surgical robots that can perform supervised autonomous surgical tasks. First, the design and testing of several in vivo robotic devices is described. Next, experimental results using visual quality metrics comparing in vivo cameras to laparoscopes are presented. Next, experiments conducted with the cooperation of NASA during the NEEMO 9 mission are discussed. These experiments compared the usefulness of in vivo robots to laparoscopes in simulated surgical tasks. Next, a sterilizable camera device was designed, and then tested in three survivable pig surgeries. The device was shown to cause no tissue damage or infection, and was used as the sole visual feedback device for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Finally, a prototype system was developed to demonstrate that a dexterous manipulator device could be used to perform supervised autonomous surgical tasks. A closed loop controller using visual feedback was implemented to control the robot. Benchtop tests demonstrating supervised autonomous task completion are presented. The author believes this work represents some work in using in vivo surgical robots to automate surgical tasks. ...|$|R

While the {{technique}} developed women's self <b>perception</b> changed <b>and</b> the <b>procedure</b> was not only regarded as a means to improve fertility but also to relieve symptoms. Today, laparoscopic myomectomy has become an accepted technique [2, 3] and nearly all fibroids can be removed endoscopically independent of their size or their position within the uterus [4 – 6]. In a randomised study intensitivity of postoperative pain was found to be significantly lower, and full recuperation was reached earlier, after laparoscopic myomectomy than after abdominal myomectomy [7]. Other well designed studies showed that compared to abdominal myomectomy laparoscopic myomectomy is more cost effective, associated with shorter hospital stays, less blood loss, less postoperative complications, and lower frequency of adhesions, though rate of recurrence is higher and operative time is longer [7 – 12]. Laparoscopic myomectomy is regarded as a procedure of medium severity [13 – 15], because it demands complete laparoscopic haemostasis and closure of the operative site to avoid uterine rupture in a potential future pregnancy. Little is known about the learning aspect of this surgical method. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the factors considered for proficiency and to estimate the number of procedures necessary in a teaching setting to achieve competence.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a comparative study between free choice of hospital in Denmark and Norway. The {{starting point for}} the study is that the Scandinavian health care system has historically been dominated by a decentralized welfare state tradition. There has been a strong emphasis on equity and regional democratic control through the county institutions. To introduce free choice of hospital in this type of system is a challenge for a number of existing <b>perceptions,</b> structures <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> in the Scandinavian system. From a system level perspective the planning capacity and the strong link between a given regional population and chosen level of public service are weakened. From a user perspective the relationship between the individual citizen and the health care system changes in the sense that patients become more empowered, when they can choose hospital. With this starting point the paper present an analysis of the arguments and the policy process for introducing free choice in the two countries. The analysis is made from two theoretical perspectives. First, from a rational perspective and second from a garbage can perspective. The results of the study show that even if there are large similarities between the two countries there are also large differences. That concerns timing, rhetoric and content of legislation. The explanation to the differences can help us to understand who it was possible to introduce free choice of hospital in the two countries. In Denmark it was possible because of the general consensus on the fashionable idea of choice that opened a political window for action. While in the Norwegian case it was possible because the government wanted to put pressure on the health sector in order to create better planning and use of resources. In Denmark the initial implementation of choice was adjusted to the dominant policy objectives of macroeconomic control through regional planning, while in Norway the chosen solution reflects a more limited concern for expenditure control and a greater willingness to experiment...|$|R

Although a great deal of research has been carried out on the subject of wrongful conviction generally, this has focussed, in the main, on legal, procedural and structural causes of wrongful conviction, and, in particular, on a small number of ‘high profile’ cases. This research examines <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs held as knowledge by individuals claiming to be factually innocent, wrongly accused/convicted persons, and the results of attempts to employ such <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs to maintain claims of innocence. Further, the experiences of family and friends of the wrongly convicted, whose lives continue in the community following the conviction of their family member, are examined, with particular attention to the interface of beliefs <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> between such families and the wider community. To a lesser extent, the role of the media, in shaping public opinion, the effects of media coverage on trial <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> outcomes, and non-reporting or selective reporting is also addressed. A series of semi-structured interviews was carried out throughout the UK, with wrongly accused/convicted persons, family members of those individuals, and members of groups and organisations working to highlight the problems of wrongful accusation and conviction. A survey aimed at examining key <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs, held as factual knowledge about the CJS within the wider public, was also conducted. The analysis of the data indicated that not only do individuals and families attempt to employ erroneous <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs as factual knowledge in cases of wrongful accusation and conviction, but that such attempts feed into and support the case against the wrongly accused (in direct opposition to the aims and objectives of those employing them). Furthermore, knowledge of the actual workings of the CJS (held by CJS actors) can be, and is, used to exploit the ignorance of those so accused, and their family members. This is made possible because legal meanings of key words and phrases are vastly different from their commonly understood meanings, a factor known only to CJS actors, and not, generally, to the wider public. Political rhetoric and media representations support and reinforce those commonly held understandings, simultaneously maintaining the inaccessible code of actual CJS processes, thereby influencing public perceptions of those who are accused and convicted...|$|R
