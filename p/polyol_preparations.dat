40|$|The {{application}} {{of raw materials}} derived from renewable feedstock {{has given rise to}} growing interest recently, as it can be exploited for the production of bio-based materials from vegetable oils. Their availability, biodegradability and low prices have been taken into account. In this work, vegetable oil-based polyols as a prospective replacement for petroleum polyols were investigated. A two-stage method for <b>polyol</b> <b>preparation</b> by incomplete epoxidation of natural oils and subsequent complete oxirane ring opening under microwave irradiation is presented. The course of epoxidation and oxirane ring-opening process was determined analytically by an evaluation of iodine, epoxy and hydroxyl values. The samples of oils and their derivatives were also analyzed by FT-IR and characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in order to calculate their functionalities. Finally, polyols with two different hydroxyl values were obtained and used for the synthesis of flexible polyurethane (PUR) foams. The scope of this research includes the determination {{of the relationship between the}} rapeseed oil-based polyol content and the properties of the resulting materials. It was found that applying bio-based polyols in conjunction with petroleum-based polyols for PUR foams formulations resulted in materials with good mechanical properties and a higher number of cells with smaller dimensions...|$|R

40|$|Mabea fistulifera Mart. (Euphorbiaceae) is an {{arboreal}} {{plant with}} height varying from 5 to 14 m, typical of secondary vegetation of sandy lands, mainly savannah. In Brazil, {{it is found}} in the Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and São Paulo States. Soxhlet extraction of M. fistulifera seeds with hexane provided an oil rich in tryacylglycerides of linolenic and linoleic acids, presenting iodine index of 182. 15 g of I 2 per 100 g of oil. In this study, the synthesis of polyols from M. fistulifera oil using an in situ hydroxylation procedure is described. Univariate assays were applied to determine the optimal reaction time of 720 min. In addition, a 2 ² factorial central composite design was carried out containing 12 experimental assays that allowed the investigation of different molar ratios of the reagents used in polyol synthesis, as well as the applicability of <b>polyols</b> for the <b>preparation</b> of rigid polyurethanes...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{traditional}} polyol {{was partially}} replaced with green, environmentally friendly cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). The effects of CNF {{on the performance}} of CNF-reinforced polyurethane foam nanocomposites were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and a compression test. The results showed that the introduction of CNF into the polyurethane matrix not only created stronger urethane bonding between the hydroxyl groups in the cellulose chain and isocyanate groups in polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate, but also developed an additional filler–matrix interaction between CNF and polyurethane. With the increase of the CNF replacement ratio, a higher glass transition temperature was obtained, and a higher amount of char residue was generated. In addition, an increase of up to 18 -fold in compressive strength was achieved for CNF-PUF (polyurethane foam) nanocomposites with a 40 % CNF replacement ratio. CNF {{has proved to be a}} promising substitute for traditional <b>polyols</b> in the <b>preparation</b> of polyurethane foams.

40|$|Manganese oxides {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} groups of materials in energy storage science. In order to fully leverage their application potential, precise control of their properties such as particle size, surface area and Mn x + oxidation state is required. Here, Mn 3 O 4 and Mn 5 O 8 nanoparticles as well as mesoporous α-Mn 2 O 3 particles were synthesized by calcination of Mn(II) glycolate nanoparticles obtained through an economical route based on a <b>polyol</b> synthesis. The <b>preparation</b> of the different manganese oxides via one route facilitates assigning actual structure–property relationships. The oxidation process related to the different MnO x species was observed by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements showing time- and temperature-dependent phase transformations occurring during oxidation of the Mn(II) glycolate precursor to α-Mn 2 O 3 via Mn 3 O 4 and Mn 5 O 8 in O 2 atmosphere. Detailed structural and morphological investigations using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and powder XRD revealed the dependence of the lattice constants and particle sizes of the MnO x species on the calcination temperature and the presence of an oxidizing or neutral atmosphere. Furthermore, to demonstrate the application potential of the synthesized MnO x species, we studied their catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in aprotic media.

40|$|Epoxidized {{soybean oil}} (ESO) and isopropanolamine {{were used to}} {{synthesize}} a new <b>polyol</b> mixture for <b>preparation</b> of bio-based polyurethanes. The chemical synthetic route for reaction of ESO with isopropanolamine was analyzed by H- 1 -NMR. The results suggested that both ester groups and epoxy groups in ESO had reacted with amino group of isopropanolamine through simultaneous ring-opening and amidation reactions. Epoxy groups in various situations exhibited different reactivity, and the unreacted epoxy groups were further opened by hydrochloric acid. The synthesized polyol mixture had high hydroxyl number of 317. 0 mg KOH/g. A series of polyurethanes were prepared by curing the synthesized polyol mixture with 1, 6 -diisocyanatohexance along with different amount of 1, 3 -propanediol (PDO) as chain extender. Tensile tests showed that yield strengths of the polyurethanes ranged from 2. 74 to 27. 76 MPa depending {{on the content of}} PDO. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis displayed one glass transition temperature in the range of 24. 428. 7 degrees C for all of the polyurethane samples, and one melt peak at high content of PDO. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that thermal degradations of the polyurethanes started at 240255 degrees C. In consideration of simple preparation process and renewable property of ESO, the bio-based polyurethane would have wide range of applications. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

40|$|Rose, Michael J., Jr. (Veterans Administration Hospital, Washington, D. C.), Stephen A. Aron, and Bernard W. Janicki. Effect {{of various}} {{nonionic}} surfactants on growth of Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 1863 – 1868. 1966. —Escherichia coli cultivated in media containing 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, or 4. 0 % concentrations of surface-active polyoxyethylene derivatives of formaldehyde polymers of octyl phenol (Triton WR- 1339; Macrocyclon) or of sorbitan mono-fatty acid esters (Tween 20, 40, 60, and 80) exhibited significantly retarded growth {{only at the}} highest concentration. To determine the mechanism of bacteriostasis, certain derivatives and compounds related to the surfactants were investigated. Experiments with compounds related to the Triton-type agents demonstrated that incorporation of monomeric substances (Triton X- 205, X- 305, Igepal CA- 730, or Dowfax 9 N 20) into the medium at a concentration of 4. 0 % did not inhibit the growth of E. coli. It was concluded that the formaldehyde polymer was essential for growth inhibition by the polyoxyethylene derivatives of octyl phenol. The inhibitory activity of the Tween compounds, in contrast, appeared to result from the unesterified fatty acids which contaminate the commercial <b>preparations.</b> <b>Polyol</b> (60), the sorbitan polyoxyethylene derivative of Tween 60 and the basic structural unit of all the Tween-type compounds, and a Tween 80 preparation which was purified by extraction of the unesterified oleic acid, were not inhibitory. Moreover, the amount of free oleic acid present as a contaminant of Tween 80 {{was found to be}} sufficient to cause significant growth inhibition. These results and the observation that E. coli does not appear to hydrolyze the esterified fatty acid of Tween 80 led to the conclusion that growth inhibition obtained with various Tween compounds probaby is a function of their respective fatty acid contaminants...|$|R
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} mainly {{about the}} preparation, modification {{and application of}} a premium precursor of silica [...] hyperbranched Polyethoxysiloxane (PEOS), which was firstly developed by DWI and has very good high temperature stability, good miscibility {{with most of the}} solvents and possibility to be modified easily. PEOS, which was used as a basic-material in all the synthesis of modified PEOS, and isobutyl modified PEOS (iBPEOS) and n-octyl modified PEOS (OPEOS), were synthesized via a one-pot catalytic condensation reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), with or without isobutyltriethoxysilane or n-octyltriethoxysilane as comonomers, with acetic anhydride. The low fraction of volatile compounds in the product was removed completely by passing through a vacuum thin-film evaporator. Amino groups modified PEOS (NH 2 -PEOS) and other amino modified silica precursors with different amino contents (2 ~ 10 % and > 20 %, relative to ethoxy groups) were prepared via four different methods. An amphiphilic PEOS modified by both 10 % amino groups and 10 % n-octyl groups was synthesized. By means of in situ sol-gel technology using iPP with PEOS, iPP/silica composites were prepared on a 15 ml co-rotating twin-screw microcompounder via melt-blending. By varying the PEOS fed content, the dimension of the resulting silica particles, which are homogeneously distributed in the iPP matrix, varied from 100 nm to several micrometers. iPP/silica composites showed improved thermal stability under nitrogen and higher crystallinity degree. The compatibility between PEOS and molten iPP matrix was significantly improved with the modification of n-octyl groups on PEOS. Benefited from the better compatibility, the resulting composites have a much better transparency. Precondensed 3 -aminopropyl triethoxysilane (PAPTES) was applied in iPP and significant positive effect to the thermal stability under air was detected. Pure PEOS was also used as an assistant to the exfoliation of layered silicate in iPP matrix. NH 2 -PEOS and other amino modified silica precursors were applied in the flexible polyurethane (PU) foams preparation. Three different methods were conducted: Polyol with dissolved-in NH 2 -PEOS or other amino modified silica precursors; isocyanate with dissolved-in PEOS or NH 2 -PEOS; Polyol with build-in NH 2 -PEOS or other amino modified silica precursors. When NH 2 -PEOS was dissolved in polyol, the transesterification between ethoxy groups and OH groups under the catalysis of NH 2 groups cannot be prevented. For the second route, unmodified PEOS can hardly be dissolved in MDI / PMDI because of its low reactivity with isocyanate groups and the very different polarity. Concerning the complexity of the chemical structures of these mixtures, moving to next method of Polyol with build-in NH 2 -PEOS or other amino modified silica precursors would be needed to produce a series of product with predictable structures. NH 2 -PEOS and other amino modified silica precursors were firstly built in PolyIsocyanate PolyAddition (PIPA) polyol which is very commonly used in PU foam industry. PEOS with 3 ~ 10 % amino groups were applied in IP 585 and CP 4702 with TDI as crosslink agent. With IP 585, the weight content of NH 2 -PEOS varied from 8 wt% to 12 wt%. With CP 4702 as the base resin <b>polyol</b> for PIPA <b>preparation,</b> weight content of NH 2 -PEOS varied from 4 wt% to 16 wt% and different final PIPA particles can be achieved. Since amino groups can catalyze the reaction between ethoxy groups in PEOS and OH groups in polyol, NH 2 -PEOS themselves may act as the crosslinking agent with polyol as base resin. Weight content of NH 2 -PEOS varied from 2 to 10 wt% and homogeneous liquids were obtained when the NH 2 [3 ~ 10]-PEOS hydrolyzed in acidic environment. Two blends were selected for foam preparation and the foams were too sticky and weak. Shown by TGA measurements, polyol with build-in NH 2 -PEOS has a better thermal stability both in air and nitrogen. Moreover, higher amino content may influence the thermal stability positively. Different procedures were applied to increase the stability of the polyol/PAPTES blends and three best samples with 20 wt% PAPTES or 20 % fully hydrolyzed APTES were chosen for the foam preparation. However, only two blends with 20 wt% PAPTES were successfully applied in the flexible PU foams and all the foams containing PAPTES failed the Cal 117 and Crib 5 tests. On the other hand, the adding of PAPTES may bring positive influence on the compression set resistance, the hysteresis and comfort index. Using a method similar to PEOS synthesis, polyalkoxytitanate (PAOT) as a precursor of TiO 2 was prepared. PAOT has a much higher stability comparing with the monomer Ti(O-iPr) 4 and can easily be stored in a solvent such as chloroform without use of any additional protections. With this precursor, a smooth TiO 2 film can be prepared by spin-cast followed with H 2 plasma-curing...|$|R
