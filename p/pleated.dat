5|$|Most aikido systems add {{a pair of}} wide <b>pleated</b> {{black or}} indigo {{trousers}} called a hakama (used also in kendo and iaido). In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (dan) ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a hakama regardless of rank.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} less-common species of Marasmius with which M.rotula might be {{confused}} due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics {{to distinguish between}} them. For example, Marasmius capillaris has a pale tan cap with a white center, and grows on oak leaves without forming clusters. Furthermore, its cap is evenly rounded, unlike the <b>pleated</b> and furrowed cap of M.rotula, and its stem is somewhat thinner (usually less than 0.3mm) and slightly darker in color.|$|E
5|$|Those Famennian strata {{represent}} {{the top of}} the Paleozoic series <b>pleated</b> with north dipping. Above, the transgressive Upper Cretaceous overlies horizontally with unconformity. It includes from the bottom to the top a paleozoic boulder conglomerate mixed with a sandy and glauconitic marl matrix, coarse clayey and glauconitic sands, containing Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana, Praeactinocamax plenus and finally marl with Terebratulina gracilis. These strata belong to the Cenomanian-Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago, during a transgressive phase.|$|E
5000|$|Accordion <b>pleats</b> or knife <b>pleats</b> are a form {{of tight}} <b>pleating</b> which allows the garment to expand its shape when moving. Accordion <b>pleating</b> is also used for some dress sleeves, such as <b>pleating</b> {{the end of the}} elbow, with the {{fullness}} of the <b>pleat</b> gathered closely at the cuff. This form of <b>pleating</b> inspired the [...] "skirt dancing" [...] of Loie Fuller. Accordion <b>pleats</b> may also be used in hand fans.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, true <b>pleats</b> {{can be made}} by {{folding the}} knitted fabric over and {{knitting}} the matching stitches together pairwise. Any style of <b>pleat</b> can be made in this way, e.g., knife <b>pleats</b> or box <b>pleats.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Kingussie <b>pleats,</b> {{named after}} the town in Scotland, are a very rarely seen type of <b>pleat</b> used in some Scottish kilts. [...] They consist of a single {{centrally}} located box <b>pleat</b> {{in the rear of}} the kilt with knife <b>pleats</b> fanning out on either side.|$|R
5|$|Currently, male {{students}} wear white studded shirts with Traditional Chinese {{characters of the}} school name on it in red. Navy blue shorts are worn for years one and two, and long pants for upper secondary levels. The six metal buttons bearing the school name is sewed onto the shirt as a modification to the traditional design adopted by other traditional Chinese schools, where rings were used to secure the buttons. Fe{{male students}} wear white blouses bearing the Traditional Chinese characters of the school name on it in red, with navy blue <b>pleated</b> skirts. During Assemblies and important functions, every student will wear a red-coloured school tie.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{serve to}} help distinguish Parasola auricoma from similar coprinoid mushrooms that grow in woodchips, including {{a lack of}} deliquescence, {{and the lack of}} a veil. Microscopically, it is characterized by the long, gold-pigmented, thick-walled setae on the cap, and ellipsoid spores with a germ pore. The distinctly grooved and <b>pleated</b> cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricoma—none of them have setae on the cap.|$|E
5|$|The pupal {{transformation}} into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings {{visible on the}} outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and <b>pleated</b> from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pleats</b> {{just below}} the {{waistband}} on the front typify many styles of formal and casual trousers, including suit trousers and khakis. There may be one, two, three, or no <b>pleats,</b> which may face either direction. When the <b>pleats</b> open towards the pockets they are called reverse <b>pleats</b> (typical of most trousers today) and when they open toward the fly they are known as forward <b>pleats.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Box <b>pleats</b> are knife <b>pleats</b> back-to-back, {{and have}} a {{tendency}} to spring out from the waistline. [...] They have the same 3:1 ratio as knife <b>pleats,</b> and may also be stacked to form [...] "stacked-" [...] or [...] "double-box pleats". [...] These stacked box <b>pleats</b> create more fullness {{and have a}} 5:1 ratio. [...] They also create a bulkier seam. Inverted box <b>pleats</b> have the [...] "box" [...] on the inside rather than the outside.|$|R
5|$|St George's can admit up to 380 pupils annually. Upon admission, pupils are {{allocated}} a mixed ability form, {{where they}} are registered, taught Life Skills and have access to pastoral support from their tutors. For all the other lessons, the pupils are set by ability. Each year group has a progress manager with responsibility for the students in that year. Since the Education Act 2002, years 7, 8 and 9 have been grouped into Key Stage 3 and years 10 and 11 into Key Stage 4, which co-ordinates how the National Curriculum is taught. At St George's, a manager is assigned to each Key Stage for pastoral support. Before the conversion to Academy status, the school uniform consisted of a navy-blue blazer with the school emblem sewn on, a white shirt, navy-blue tie and dark-grey trousers (girls could wear plain-blue skirts) for all pupils in years 7–10; year 11 pupils could wear a dark-blue jumper, shirt and grey trousers. Since 2010, girls no longer wear ties, and must wear a revere collar blouse. Dark-grey trousers or a <b>pleated</b> dark-grey skirt are available for girls to wear; boys have dark-grey trousers. All pupils wear a blue blazer, but those in Key Stage 3 have bright blue piping on their lapels; shirts are white until Year 11, when thin blue stripes are worn.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing in a dark room, dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing a flowing maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a <b>pleated</b> red organza dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic arrangements are intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue {{down on the floor and}} leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the camera pans out. She proceeds to wave to a distant person and then plucks the petals out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} Kandyan (osaria) style {{consists of}} a full blouse which covers the midriff completely and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The final tail of the sari is neatly <b>pleated</b> rather than free-flowing. This is rather similar to the <b>pleated</b> rosette used in the Dravidian style noted earlier in the article.|$|E
50|$|Jackets {{designed}} for active outdoor wear frequently have <b>pleats</b> (usually inverted box <b>pleats)</b> {{to allow for}} freedom of movement. Norfolk jackets have double-ended inverted box <b>pleats</b> at the chest and back.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pleating</b> or {{plaiting}} {{is a type}} {{of gathering}} in which the folds are usually larger, made by hand and pinned in place, rather than drawn up on threads, but very small <b>pleats</b> are often identical to evenly spaced gathers. <b>Pleating</b> is mainly used to make skirts, but can have other uses.(See main article <b>Pleat.)</b> ...|$|R

25|$|For {{the college}} section, boys wear white shirts and long white pants while girls wear medium-sleeved, <b>pleated</b> white blouses and a short, <b>pleated</b> green skirt, with some {{choosing}} to wear shorts along with it. Uniform for Year 5-6 boys is largely {{similar to that}} for Year 1-4 boys, except in the pleats in the pants {{and the back of}} the shirt and the cotton material. The college badge is identical to RI's pre-1990s design; during that period RI slightly modified its badge design.|$|E
25|$|Black tie {{trousers}} {{traditionally have}} no cuffs (turn-ups in British English) or belt loops. The outer seams are usually {{decorated with a}} single braid of silk or a material that matches the lapel facing. Traditionally, braces (suspenders), hidden by the waistcoat, are used to support the trousers. Belts should not ever be worn with black tie trousers. Evening trousers can be flat-fronted or <b>pleated</b> today; pleats first coming into fashion in the 1930s. Whilst flat-fronted trousers are more fashionable at present, <b>pleated</b> trousers may be considered more comfortable by men who have wider hips and a narrow waist.|$|E
5000|$|Any <b>pleat</b> is {{characterized}} by depth and width. The portion of the <b>pleat</b> that protrudes under the overlying <b>pleat</b> is the size or width. The <b>pleat</b> width is selected based {{on the size of}} the sett and the amount of fabric to be used in constructing the kilt, and will generally vary from about 1/2" [...] to about 3/4".|$|R

30|$|This was {{the result}} of there not being any {{increase}} in ease on the circumference area for the pants. Most menswear brands developed the pants lining patterns by increasing the circumference about 0.5  cm at each end of pattern. There were several brands, however, which reduced the pant’s overall ease when the pants design had <b>pleats,</b> because <b>pleat</b> design had the ease built into it already. These brands reduced the <b>pleat</b> amount or converted the two <b>pleats</b> into one <b>pleat</b> when developing the lining pattern.|$|R
25|$|The mantua, {{made from}} a single length of fabric <b>pleated</b> to fit with a long train, was ideal for showing the designs of the new elaborately {{patterned}} silks that replaced the solid-colored satins popular in mid-century.|$|E
25|$|Shirts {{were made}} of linen, had {{attached}} collars, and were worn with stocks or wrapped in a cravat tied in various fashions. <b>Pleated</b> frills at the cuffs and front opening went out of fashion {{by the end of}} the period.|$|E
25|$|Modern Odissi male {{performers}} wear dhoti – a broadcloth {{tied around}} waist, <b>pleated</b> for movement, and tucked between legs; usually extends to knee or lower. Upper body is bare chested, {{and a long}} thin folded translucent sheet wrapping over one shoulder and usually tucked below a wide belt.|$|E
50|$|The depth is {{the part}} of the <b>pleat</b> which is folded under the {{overlying}} <b>pleat.</b> It depends solely {{on the size of the}} tartan sett even when <b>pleating</b> to the stripe, since the sett determines the spacing of the stripes.|$|R
2500|$|To give extra {{fullness}} to the back, {{there are}} often <b>pleats</b> where the back panel joins to the yoke. [...] On some fittings these are not needed, and handmade shirts may feature the extra fabric being worked continuously into the seam. [...] In America, a box <b>pleat</b> is common (two <b>pleats</b> together in the centre), while in Britain the <b>pleats</b> are placed wider out under the shoulders.|$|R
2500|$|Cartridge <b>pleats</b> {{are used}} to gather {{a large amount of}} fabric into a small {{waistband}} or armscye without adding bulk to the seam. [...] This type of <b>pleating</b> also allows the fabric of the skirt or sleeve to spring out from the seam. [...] During the 15th and 16th centuries, this form of <b>pleating</b> was popular in the garments of men and women. [...] Fabric is evenly gathered using two or more lengths of basting stitches, and the top of each <b>pleat</b> is whipstitched onto the waistband or armscye. [...] Cartridge <b>pleating</b> was resurrected in 1840s fashion to attach the increasingly full bell-shaped skirts to the fashionable narrow waist.|$|R
25|$|Silk {{emitted by}} the {{silkworm}} {{consists of two}} main proteins, sericin and fibroin, fibroin being the structural center of the silk, and serecin being the sticky material surrounding it. Fibroin {{is made up of}} the amino acids Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala and forms beta <b>pleated</b> sheets. Hydrogen bonds form between chains, and side chains form above and below the plane of the hydrogen bond network.|$|E
25|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Exidia thuretiana are {{similarly}} coloured, but are typically more opaque and often appear <b>pleated.</b> They do not (or very rarely) contain white, granular inclusions. Microscopically, E.thuretiana {{can be distinguished}} by its sessile (not stalked) basidia. Fruit bodies of several gelatinous Tremella species may also appear similar, but never contain granular inclusions. All can be distinguished microscopically by their non- spores.|$|E
25|$|Aesthetic {{appearance}} is {{of paramount importance}} for modern pointe shoes. To achieve an elegant appearance, the shoe's more decorative outer fabric is prominently featured, covering the maximum possible area of the shoe's visible surfaces. To this end, the sole is made of thin material to give it a minimal profile, and a margin of satin is artfully <b>pleated</b> around it so that the sole covers only part of the bottom of the shoe.|$|E
50|$|Like the Lotus wheel, the BFB wheel also {{displays}} wide shallow <b>pleats</b> at its outside diameter, with narrower steeper <b>pleats</b> {{towards the}} centre (see image).|$|R
25|$|Shirts and blouses {{typically}} have <b>pleats</b> {{on the back}} to provide freedom of movement and on the arm where the sleeve tapers to meet the cuff. The standard men's shirt has a box <b>pleat</b> {{in the center of}} the back just below the shoulder or alternately one simple <b>pleat</b> on each side of the back.|$|R
