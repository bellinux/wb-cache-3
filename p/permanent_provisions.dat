6000|$|The {{possibility}} that Defoe acted independently in this writing cannot be discounted.[15] Defoe had praised Marlborough {{since the beginning}} of his career {{and the extent to which}} he and Godolphin adopted William's policies added to Defoe's admiration; admiration is clear in this pamphlet. Defoe had worked for Godolphin and Sunderland, and may have used [...] "by an Old Officer in the Army" [...] as a disguise from Harley or even as a means of publishing independently. That Defoe resented attacks on his hero can hardly be doubted--the Review and his pamphlets are a catalog of the general's triumphs, and no where does he attack unequivocably; even in No Queen he puts chief blame on rumors and on Marlborough's party. Harley's failure to make <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions</b> for Defoe may suggest some dissatisfaction, but even if the {{possibility that}} the Life was not expressly ordered by Harley is considered, it is noteworthy that nothing in it is offensive to Harley, and, more important, remarkable that it serves Harley's needs and ends at the time so well.|$|E

50|$|In the Old Republic era (Republica Velha), {{that lasted}} from 1889 until 1930, the Constitution adopted on February 24, 1891 {{established}} that the first presidential term would finish in 1894; the president and vice-president for the first presidential term would be elected by the Constitent Congress {{as soon as the}} Constitution was promulgated under the transitional provisions of that document (the first presidential inauguration took place on 26 February 1891). Subsequent presidents were, as per the <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Constitution, elected by direct popular ballot. Presidential elections were held on 1 March {{in the last year of}} a presidential term, and new presidents were inaugurated on 15 November (the anniversary of the Proclamation of the Republic). Accordingly, 15 November was inauguration day during the Old Republic era. The first inauguration under the <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Constitution took place on 15 November 1894.|$|E

50|$|The {{transitional}} constitutional provisions however {{stipulated that}} {{the mandate of}} the then serving President of the Republic would continue until he completed five years in office. Accordingly, the transitional provisions of the Constitution established that the first presidential elections under the Constitution, by direct popular ballot, would be held in 1989 and that the president and vice-president elect would be sworn-in on 15 March 1990. A 1993 Constitutional Amendment reduced the presidential term of office from five to four years. Accordingly, President Collor, the first president elected under the 1988 Constitution was sworn-in on 15 March 1990, but his presidential term would only end on 31 December 1995. Collor resigned the presidency in December 1992 and, was succeeded by Itamar Franco. His term of office was shortened by the Constitutional Amendment that reduced the duration of presidential terms from five to four years. As a result, Itamar Franco served until 31 December 1994, and, since 1995, Inauguration Day has been on 1 January as dictated by the <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Federal Constitution. Fernando Henrique Cardoso was the first President of Brazil to be inaugurated on January 1, the current Inauguration Day under the <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Constitution adopted in 1988.|$|E
50|$|The {{merit of}} clearly {{establishing}} these distinctions belongs to Boretius. He has doubtless exaggerated {{the difference between}} the Capitula missorum and the Capitula per se scribenda; among the first are to be found provisions of a general and permanent nature, and among the second temporary measures are often included. But the idea of Boretius is nonetheless fruitful. In the capitularies there are usually <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions</b> and temporary provisions intermingled; and the observation of this fact has made it possible more clearly to understand certain institutions of Charlemagne, e.g. military service.|$|E
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1930 Revolution, the Constitution adopted on 16 July 1934, in its {{transitional}} provisions, empowered the Constituent Assembly to elect the president for the first presidential term. Chosen by the Constituent Assembly, Getúlio Vargas, until then Head of the Provisional Government, took office as president on 20 July 1934. Subsequent presidents would be elected by direct popular ballot and the next president would take office on 3 May 1938. Accordingly, 3 May would be Inauguration Day under the 1934 Constitution. This Constitution was however short-lived due to the presidential coup d'etát of 10 November 1937, so that no presidential elections were held under its <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions.</b>|$|E

His presidency, which lasted from 15 November 1894 until 15 November 1898, was marked by the War of Canudos, a campesinant revolt in the northeast of the country that was crushed by the Brazilian Army. He also had to face a break in diplomatic relations with Portugal that was successfully mediated by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Only [...] "general and permanent" [...] {{laws are}} codified in the United States Code; the Code does not usually include {{provisions}} that {{apply only to}} {{a limited number of}} people (a private law) or for a limited time, such as most appropriation acts or budget laws, which apply only for a single fiscal year. If these limited provisions are significant, however, they may be printed as [...] "notes" [...] underneath related sections of the Code. The codification is based on the content of the laws, however, not the vehicle by which they are adopted; so, for instance, if an appropriations act contains substantive, <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions</b> (as is sometimes the case), these provisions will be incorporated into the Code even though they were adopted as part of a non-permanent enactment.|$|E

40|$|In late 1959 a {{spectrophotometer}} laboratory {{was established}} at JPL {{to be used}} as a support for temperature-control programs. The immediate task was spectroradiometric measurements of light sources to be used in a simulated-deep-space environment chamber. It was also necessary to have <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions</b> for measuring reflectances of surfaces for the calculation of solar absorptance alpha, and thermal emittance epsilon. The spectral distribution of an unknown source, in this case a Ventarc carbon-arc lamp, was derived from the ratio of detector outputs (with monochromatic light) of the arc lamp and a tungsten lamp, and the spectral intensity of the tungsten lamp. The tungsten lamp is a ribbonfilament lamp calibrated from 0. 25 to 2. 6 microns. A recording of pen deflection (linearly proportional to detector output) of each source over the visible and near infrared range is made with all parameters (slit width, amplifier gain, and source focusing) identical; then the ratios are computed at discrete wavelengths from these recordings. Because the spectral intensities of the tungsten lamp and a solar simulator are very different in most of the range, an adjustable slit is placed immediately in front of the detector to obtain comparable pen deflections for the two sources. This slit is set by means of a feeler gage, and the attenuation coefficient is evaluated by a transmission measurement...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{mortgage}} foreclosure crisis, whose economic effects are well known, transformed state legal structures governing the {{mortgage foreclosure}} process. What {{had been a}} relatively routine system of default judgments and auction sales {{has evolved into a}} negotiation and workout practice in which homeowners contest foreclosures, demand loan modifications and short sales, and propose other alternatives to foreclosures. A profusion of state laws and court orders were adopted between 2008 and 2014 with the aim of promoting negotiated foreclosure alternatives. These laws have produced a variety of experiments in the “laboratories of democracy. ” The defaults—whether home loans are renegotiated, defaults are cured, or homes are sold at auction—have varied tremendously among the states. We can now begin to assess the desirability of these new laws and procedures, and more importantly, identify the foreclosure reforms that merit wider adoption. One of the most effective legal innovations has been the use of mandatory pre-foreclosure mediation, introduced in about half the states during this period. The Uniform Home Foreclosure Procedures Act (UHFPA), approved by the Uniform Law Commission in 2015, incorporates <b>permanent</b> <b>provisions</b> for pre-foreclosure mediation in all residential mortgage foreclosure cases. The uniform law provisions are modeled on the most successful state programs and were drafted with the aid of judges, mediators, and attorneys with experience in several state foreclosure mediation programs. This article begins with a brief history of the foreclosure crisis and the progressive adoption of foreclosure mediation programs in various states. Next, it will summarize the empirical research and data measuring the effectiveness of those programs. Both the benefits of mediation and the costs, including delay, will be considered and compared. The article will then discuss the ways in which foreclosure mediation may or may not differ from conventional mediation standards embodied in the Uniform Mediation Act, and in particular, how and why courts enforce a duty to mediate in good faith. Finally, the mediation provisions of the new UHFPA and the case for their adoption will be presented...|$|E
