Pirkey Station wet limestone flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system to evaluate options for achieving high sulfur dioxide removal efficiency. The Pirkey FGD system includes four absorber modules, each with dual slurry recirculation loops {{and with a}} perforated <b>plate</b> <b>tray</b> in the upper loop. The options tested involved the use of dibasic acid (DBA) or sodium formate as a performance additive. The effectiveness of other potential options was simulated with the Electric Power Research Institute`s (EPRI) FGD PRocess Integration and Simulation Model (FGDPRISM) after it was calibrated to the system. An economic analysis was done to determine the cost effectiveness of the high-efficiency options. Results are-summarized below...|$|E
40|$|Fibre-based {{materials}} is a material group that contains many varied materials and {{is widely used}} in packaging and printing industry with the various packaging types. The aim of this thesis is to summarize different three-dimensional forming methods and equipment of fibre-based materials in China, which include {{the principle of the}} method, the forming process of the method, which material or materials are suitable for the method, the research status of the method, the comparison of different methods, and the existing problems of the method. The summary and analysis of the literatures and company information are the main research methods used in this thesis. Pulp molding is an easy method to form pulp molding products with various shapes such as <b>plate,</b> <b>tray</b> and cushioning pad. Thermoforming (form-fill-seal) is a fast-growing forming method and widely used with plastic-coated paper for the manufacturing of pouches. Folding and gluing is the most common forming method and suitable for various fibre-based materials to form different packaging types like cartons, bags and boxes. Paper cups forming method is mainly for the forming of paper cups and similar structured containers. Die cutting is also mentioned and the digital die cutting and laser die cutting would have an improvement in the future. There is still a great gap for packaging machinery in China comparing with advanced countries and regions like Germany and the United States. Although the equipment manufactured by China is economical, the automation level, flexibility, production efficiency and low energy consumption of the packaging equipment need to be improved to promote the market competitiveness...|$|E

50|$|The {{fruit is}} edible for humans, {{as are the}} palm hearts. Other human uses for the plant include wood for walking sticks, bows, and fishing rods. The fruits are fed to pigs. It is {{occasionally}} processed for oil. It {{is a very important}} fiber plant for many local peoples. The Wounaa and Emberá peoples and native groups of African ancestry, such as Afro-Colombians and Afro-Ecuadorians, are familiar with the plant. The fibers come from the leaves. They are used to make furniture, pitchers, <b>plates,</b> <b>trays,</b> coasters, vases, bags, hats, jewelry and accessories, hammocks, and fishing nets. Fibers from the opened leaves are used to make mats, while less robust fibers from the immature leaves are used for basketry.|$|R

5000|$|Hot air ovens are {{electrical}} devices which use dry heat to sterilize. They were originally developed by Pasteur. [...] Generally, {{they can be}} operated from 50 to 300 °C, using a thermostat to control the temperature. Their double walled insulation keeps the heat in and conserves energy, the inner layer being a poor conductor and outer layer being metallic. There is also an air filled space in between to aid insulation. An air circulating fan helps in uniform distribution of the heat. These are fitted with the adjustable wire mesh <b>plated</b> <b>trays</b> or aluminium trays and may have an on/off rocker switch, as well as indicators and controls for temperature and holding time. The capacities of these ovens vary. Power supply needs vary from country to country, depending on the voltage and frequency (hertz) used. Temperature sensitive tapes or biological indicators using bacterial spores {{can be used as}} controls, to test for the efficacy of the device during use.|$|R
25|$|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch {{surfaces}} {{can prevent}} frequently touched surfaces from serving as reservoirs for {{the spread of}} pathogenic microbes.

These microbes can often survive on surfaces for surprisingly long periods of time (sometimes more than 30 days).|$|R
50|$|Trayed towers {{consist of}} a {{vertical}} column with liquid flowing in the top and out the bottom. The vapor phase enters {{in the bottom of}} the column and exits out of the top. Inside of the column are <b>trays</b> or <b>plates.</b> These <b>trays</b> force the liquid to flow back and forth horizontally while the vapor bubbles up through holes in the trays. The purpose of these trays is to increase the amount of contact area between the liquid and vapor phases.|$|R
50|$|Many {{disposable}} foodservice {{products can}} be made of plastic or plastic-coated paper: cups, <b>plates,</b> bowls, <b>trays,</b> food containers and cutlery, for example. Plastics are used because the material is lightweight and holds the temperature of hot/cold food and beverages. Polystyrene is {{in one of the}} most common types of plastics used for foodservice packaging. In its foamed form, expanded polystyrene is often sometimes referred to as Styrofoam. Non-foamed polystyrene is sometimes also used for utensils or plastic plates. Polyethylene and other plastics are also used.|$|R

50|$|Molded pulp, {{also named}} moulded pulp or molded fibre, is a {{packaging}} material, typically {{made from recycled}} paperboard and/or newsprint. It is used for protective packaging or for food service trays and beverage carriers. Other typical uses are end caps, <b>trays,</b> <b>plates,</b> bowls and clamshell containers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} day, {{there will}} be a kind of starch-paste {{on the bottom of the}} bowl, with a more or less clear liquid on top, which has to be discarded. Once the liquid has been removed, a small amount of the paste can then be poured into a flat <b>plate</b> or <b>tray,</b> and spread evenly in a thin layer. The whole plate is placed into a large pot full of boiling water, where it is steamed for a couple of minutes, and the resulting [...] "pancake" [...] cut into long pieces vaguely resembling noodles.|$|R
500|$|Another way of {{improving}} the separation in a distillation column {{is to use a}} packing material instead of trays. [...] These offer the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to <b>plates</b> or <b>trays),</b> beneficial when operating under vacuum. [...] If a distillation tower uses packing instead of trays, the number of necessary theoretical equilibrium stages is first determined and then the packing height equivalent to a theoretical equilibrium stage, known as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP), is also determined. [...] The total packing height required is the number of theoretical stages multiplied by the HETP.|$|R
50|$|The column can {{be filled}} with random dumped packing (creating a random packed column) or with {{structured}} packing sections, which are arranged or stacked (creating a stacked packed column). In the column, liquids tend to wet {{the surface of the}} packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Packing material can be used instead of trays to improve separation in distillation columns. Packing offers the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to <b>plates</b> or <b>trays),</b> which is beneficial while operating under vacuum. Differently shaped packing materials have different surface areas and void space between the packing. Both of these factors affect packing performance.|$|R

These being removed, we dipped hands in Biryani, a meat pillaw, abounding in clarified butter; Kimah, finely chopped meat; Warak Mahshi, vine leaves filled with chopped and spiced mutton, and folded into small triangles; Kabab, or bits of roti spitted in mouthfuls upon a splinter of wood; together with a Salatah of the crispest cucumber, and various dishes of water-melon cut up into squares.|$|R
2500|$|Expanded {{polystyrene}} (EPS) is a {{rigid and}} tough, closed-cell foam. It is usually white {{and made of}} pre-expanded polystyrene beads. EPS is used for many applications e.g. <b>trays,</b> <b>plates,</b> bowls and fish boxes. Other uses include molded sheets for building insulation and packing material ("peanuts") for cushioning fragile items inside boxes.

50|$|A <b>plate</b> column (or <b>tray</b> column) is a {{chemical}} equipment {{used to carry}} out unit operations where {{it is necessary to}} transfer mass between a liquid phase and a gas phase. In other words, it is a particular gas-liquid contactor. The peculiarity of this gas-liquid contactor is that the gas comes in contact with liquid through different stages; each stage is delimited by two plates (except the stage {{at the top of the}} column and the stage at the bottom of the column).|$|R
5000|$|Although {{small size}} units, mostly made of glass, {{can be used}} in laboratories, {{industrial}} units are large, vertical, steel vessels (see images 1 and 2) known as [...] "distillation towers" [...] or [...] "distillation columns". To improve the separation, the tower is normally provided inside with horizontal <b>plates</b> or <b>trays</b> as shown in image 5, or the column is packed with a packing material. To provide the heat required for the vaporization involved in distillation and also to compensate for heat loss, heat is most often added {{to the bottom of the}} column by a reboiler, and the purity of the top product can be improved by recycling some of the externally condensed top product liquid as reflux. Depending on their purpose, distillation columns may have liquid outlets at intervals up the length of the column as shown in image 4.|$|R
5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large <b>plates</b> or <b>trays)</b> of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to provide for their neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|R
