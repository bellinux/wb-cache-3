500|$|The main plot of [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was panned by critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V.

[...] He resumed: [...] "Nobody cares about {{any member of the}} Griffin family the way we care about every last Simpson. I feel bad about Meg becoming the scapegoat. Not because she’s a good character, but because instead of tweaking and working to make her appreciated or comically valuable, Family Guy spent years going down the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> and simply joined the fan chorus of hatred.

Similarly, Terron Moore of Ology felt that much of the episode was wasted. In his review, Moore stated that [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was [...] "an episode that {{spends a lot of time}} addressing something that didn’t need to be addressed." [...] He gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten points. TV Fanatic Kate Moon was less negative of the episode, stating that even though Meg confronting her family in regards to her treatment was long overdue, she concluded that it felt contrived and uninteresting.|$|E
2500|$|The Santa Anas are {{katabatic}} winds—Greek for [...] "flowing downhill", arising {{in higher}} altitudes and blowing down towards sea level. Santa Ana winds originate from high-pressure airmasses over the Great Basin and upper Mojave Desert. Any low-pressure area over the Pacific Ocean, {{off the coast}} of California, can change the stability of the Great Basin High, causing a pressure gradient that turns the synoptic scale winds southward down {{the eastern side of the}} Sierra Nevada and into the Southern California region. Cool, dry air flows outward in a clockwise spiral from the high pressure center. This cool, dry airmass sweeps across the deserts of eastern California toward the coast, and encounters the towering Transverse Ranges, which separate coastal Southern California from the deserts. The airmass, flowing from high pressure in the Great Basin to a low pressure center off the coast, takes the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> by channeling through the mountain passes to the lower coastal elevations, as the low pressure area off the coast pulls the airmass offshore.|$|E

The Vesnin brothers easily won the contest with a Brutalist, simple design emphasizing the structural grid of reinforced concrete and wraparound glazing. Moisei Ginzburg criticized the ‘’Arcos’’ draft as lacking any true novelty, which {{was expected of}} constructivist architecture: it {{was little more than}} a traditional office block wrapped in modern materials.

2500|$|Infiltration {{occurs when}} an IV fluid or {{medication}} accidentally enters the surrounding tissue {{rather than the}} vein. It may occur when the vein itself ruptures (the elderly are particularly prone to fragile veins due to a paucity of supporting tissues), when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device, when the device is not sited correctly, from increased vein porosity or when the entry point of the device into the vein becomes the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> (e.g. if a cannula is in a vein for some time, the vein may scar and close {{and the only way}} for fluid to leave is along the outside of the cannula where it enters the vein). Infiltration is an inadvertent administration of a nonvesicant solution/drug into the tissue, which happens so often when the tourniquet isn't removed in a timely fashion. [...] Infiltration is characterized by coolness and pallor to the skin as well as localized swelling or edema. It is treated by removing the intravenous access device and elevating the affected limb so that the collected fluids can drain away. Sometimes injections of hyaluronidase can be used to speed the dispersal of the fluid/drug. Infiltration {{is one of the most}} common adverse effects of IV therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue, most commonly a vesicant or chemotherapeutic agent, in which case it is called extravasation and extensive necrosis can occur.|$|E

As we have said before in this chapter, he {{would prefer not to}} remember, because he has made up his mind not to repent.

And so indeed it is, as all of us can attest who have been for years past trying to cut into the swollen and windy corpulence of the modern compromise, that is at once cosy and cruel. For there is really in our world to-day the colour and silence of the cushioned divan; and that sense of palace within palace and garden within garden which makes the rich irresponsibility of the East. Have we not already the wordless dance, the wineless banquet, and all that strange unchristian conception of luxury without laughter? Are we not already in an evil Arabian Nights, and walking the nightmare cities of an invisible despot? Does not our hangman strangle secretly, the bearer of the bow string?

It is the presence of the sin that is sealed with pride and impenitence; the story of how the Sultan got his throne.

60|$|Claud Fresnay, Viscount Harbinger was, {{at the age}} of thirty-one, {{perhaps the}} least {{encumbered}} peer in the United Kingdom. Thanks to an ancestor who had acquired land, and departed this life one hundred and thirty years before the town of Nettlefold was built on a small portion of it, and to a father who had died in his son's infancy, after judiciously selling the said town, he possessed a very large income independently of his landed interests. Tall and well-built, with handsome, strongly-marked features, he gave at first sight an impression of strength--which faded somewhat when he began to talk. It was not so much the manner of his speech--with its rapid slang, and its way of turning everything to a jest--as the feeling it produced, that the brain behind it took naturally the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance.</b> He was in fact one of those personalities who are often enough prominent in politics and social life, by reason of their appearance, position, assurance, and of a certain energy, half genuine, and half mere inherent predilection for short cuts. Certainly he was not idle, had written a book, travelled, was a Captain of Yeomanry, a Justice of the Peace, a good cricketer, and a constant and glib speaker. It would have been unfair to call his enthusiasm for social reform spurious. It was real enough in its way, and did certainly testify that he was not altogether lacking either in imagination or good-heartedness. But it was over and overlaid with the public-school habit--that peculiar, extraordinarily English habit, so powerful and beguiling that it becomes a second nature stronger than the first--of relating everything in the Universe to the standards and prejudices of a single class. Since practically all his intimate associates were immersed in it, he was naturally not in the least conscious of this habit; indeed there was nothing he deprecated so much in politics as the narrow and prejudiced outlook, such as he had observed in the Nonconformist, or labour politician. He would never have admitted for a moment that certain doors had been banged-to at his birth, bolted when he went to Eton, and padlocked at Cambridge. No one would have denied that there was much that was valuable in his standards--a high level of honesty, candour, sportsmanship, personal cleanliness, and self-reliance, together with a dislike of such cruelty as had been officially (so to speak) recognized as cruelty, and a sense of public service to a State run by and for the public schools; but it would have required far more originality than he possessed ever to look at Life from any other point of view than that from which he had been born and bred to watch Her. To fully understand harbinger, one must, and with unprejudiced eyes and brain, have attended one of those great cricket matches in which he had figured conspicuously as a boy, and looking down from some high impartial spot have watched the ground at lunch time covered from rope to rope and stand to stand with a marvellous swarm, all walking in precisely the same manner, with precisely the same expression on their faces, under precisely the same hats--a swarm enshrining the greatest identity of, creed and habit ever known since the world began. No, his environment had not been favourable to originality. Moreover he was naturally rapid rather than deep, and life hardly ever left him alone or left him silent. Brought into contact day and night with people to whom politics were more or less a game; run after everywhere; subjected to no form of discipline--it was a wonder that he was as serious as he was. Nor had he ever been in love, until, last year, during her first season, Barbara had, as he might have expressed it--in the case of another 'bowled him middle stump. Though so deeply smitten, he had not yet asked her to marry him--had not, as it were, had time, nor perhaps quite the courage, or conviction. When he was near her, it seemed impossible that he could go on longer without knowing his fate; when he was away from her it was almost a relief, because there were so many things to be done and said, and so little time to do or say them in. But now, during this fortnight, which, for her sake, he had devoted to Miltoun's cause, his feeling had advanced beyond the point of comfort.|$|E

In an {{unobstructed}} environment, water and people flow; people might drift and wander while water takes {{a more direct}} route, but both generally follow <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance.</b> These <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> are shaped by fine grained elements of built environments, climatic zones, subtle changes in topography and widening and narrowing <b>of</b> a <b>path.</b> Yet, the infrastructure that binds us together and the architecture within it appear large: networks and nodes of roads, energy, and communication reach widely to offer services but in doing so, divide space. The closer you look, the more you see, {{and the work of}} several designers and urban thinkers, specifically Irenee Scalbert, Lucius Burckhardt, The Situationists and Robin Dripps, inspire us to look more closely at how space is shaped by infrastructure; a careful and thorough inspection of our surroundings inspires site-specific amendments. The path {{is as important as the}} destination. In contrast to Rem Koolhaas' "The Problem of Large," what are the advantages of small? How can infrastructure be used to shape space at a site scale and to facilitate small moments in our urban landscape against a backdrop of infrastructural larger intentions? This thesis focuses specifically on the intersection between walking and space: how might each be used to inform the other and ultimately what is the effect of our social constructions of space on the quality of our walking? More specifically, how can walking be used as a way to transcend the way space has been circumscribed with lines intended to control, and reveal a whole landscape? Ultimately this project will explore design interventions that challenge how we perceive the space around us in order to facilitate pedestrian movement through the landscape of Western Lake Union. In the following section I will explore mapping strategies for visually communicating the many meanings of place. I will then look at design projects that focus on the experience of walking with special attention to scale of intervention, route and destination and connection to the landscape. Additionally, I will zoom out to explore examples of larger landscape infrastructure projects intended to connect the site to a larger urban framework. The design examples I have found the most inspiring are those that are responding to qualities of the land on a small scale, while maintaining a vision for how the site interventions will aggregate and function at a larger scale...|$|R

40|$|Ultrafast {{outflows}} (UFOs) from {{supermassive black}} holes (SMBHs) {{are thought to}} regulate the growth of SMBHs and host galaxies, resulting {{in a number of}} observational correlations. We present high-resolution numerical simulations of the impact of a thermalized UFO on the ambient gas in the inner part of the host galaxy. Our results depend strongly on whether the gas is homogeneous or clumpy. In the former case all of the ambient gas is driven outward rapidly as expected based on commonly used energy budget arguments, while in the latter the flows of mass and energy decouple. Carrying most of the energy, the shocked UFO escapes from the bulge via <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance,</b> taking with it only the low-density phase of the host. Most of the mass is however in the high-density phase, and is affected by the UFO much less strongly, and may even continue to flow inwards. We suggest that the UFO energy leakage through the pores in the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) may explain why observed SMBHs are so massive despite their overwhelmingly large energy production rates. The multiphase ISM effects reported here are probably under-resolved in cosmological simulations but may be included in prescriptions for active galactic nuclei feedback in future simulations and in semi-analytical models.

40|$|Background: Oil yield from avocado fruit may be {{influenced}} by fruit pre-treatment and extraction method. Unripe and ripe avocado fruit pieces were deep-frozen at − 20 ◦C and either freeze-dried or oven-dried (80 ◦C). Oil yield from these samples was determined after extraction with hexane and supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2). The fruit samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy before and after oil extraction. RESULTS: Average oil yield from ripe fruit (freeze-dried and oven-dried combined) was 72 g kg− 1 higher than from unripe fruit for SC-CO 2 extracts and 61 g kg− 1 higher for hexane extracts. This may be due to enzymatic degradation of parenchyma cell walls during ripening, thus making the oil more available for extraction. Freezedried samples had a mean oil yield 55 g kg− 1 greater than oven-dried samples for SC-CO 2 extracts and 31 g kg− 1 higher for hexane extracts. However, oil yields from ripe fruit (freeze-dried and oven-dried) subjected to hexane extraction were not significantly different. All hexane extracts combined had a mean oil yield 93 g kg− 1 higher than SC-CO 2 extracts. CONCLUSION: SC-CO 2 may be more selective and may create <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> through the plant material. Hexane, on the other hand, is less selective and permeates the whole plant material, leading to more complete extraction and higher oil yields under the experimental conditions...|$|R

It is shown that this process <b>of</b> flow <b>path</b> optimization can be reasoned on the basis of principle: the maximization of global performance subject to finite-size constraints. One example is the generation of tree-shaped flow pat terns, as <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> between one point (source, sink) and an infinity of points (area, volume), as in the circulatory, respiratory and nervous systems. Another is the generation of regular spacing's in heat generating volumes, such as swarms of honey - bees. The optimized tree-flow geometries ac count for allometric laws, e. g., the relation ship between the total tube contact area and the body size, the proportionality between metabolic rate and body size raised to the power 3 / 4, the proportionality between breathing and heart beating times and body size raised to the power 1 / 4, and the proportionality between the cruising speed of flying bodies (in sects, birds, air planes) and body mass raised to the power 1 / 6. The optimized flow structures constitute robust designs, and robustness improves as the complexity of the system increases. Flow architectures that are more efficient look more natural...|$|R
