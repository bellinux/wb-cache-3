While Bayesian incentives are impractical, the insights from their properties can be combined with practical non-Bayesian mechanisms for application to transmission pricing. This combination suggests an approach based on the distinction between ultra-short, short and long periods.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to focus}} on the {{deep-seated}} ideological, economic, and social roots of the notion and practice of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> in French enterprise, from a historical perspective. Although this practice is legally mandated in France today, this paper seeks to identify the historical roots of such practices and to locate them in the ideological, social, and economic domains of discourse. Design/methodology/approach – The authors provide a brief review of the literature on <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> and identify the current knowledge on the relationship between <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> and firm performance, in addition to the motivations for implementing <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> and its non-financial consequences. Findings – From the mid-nineteenth century onwards, <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> entailed more than just a few anecdotal experiments and actually raised a number of deep-seated ideological, economic and social questions. The French practice of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> has a profoundly “social responsibility” argument at its base. De Gaulle's argument for this was embedded in a broader rhetoric of finding a third alternative between unbridled capitalism and unrestricted socialism, and one that could ameliorate the human condition. Research limitations/implications – Psychological ownership among employees can be promoted through <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> and employee ownership programs. Practical implications – It is critical for managers to ensure the success of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> schemes by providing for higher levels of employee voice and including employee involvement programs. Social implications – Whereas the ideological basis (social responsibility), had a dominant impact in France, in the evolution of such practices leading up to their legislation other countries focused more on the instrumental and utilitarian benefits. Originality/value – The authors use the approach of historical analysis of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> practices in France to draw cross-national lessons for today's managers around the globe.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} prior studies {{investigating}} {{the determinants of}} <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plan adoption fail to consider the effect of current earnings changes on future expected compensation payments under <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> that underlie the success of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> in motivating employees. When current earnings changes are caused by factors that make earnings too volatile then the payments under <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> are volatile and their predictability is reduced. In this situation, <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> {{is not expected to}} be successful in motivating employees and would not be a preferred means of compensation. In contrast, if earnings changes are caused by factors that produce more sustainable effects on earnings, rendering them more reliable and predictable, then compensation payments under <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> will be more predictable and representative of employees' efforts. In this case, <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> would be more successful in motivating employees and {{is more likely to be}} adopted as a preferred compensation scheme. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that a positive association exists between the level of permanence of current earnings changes and the adoption of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plans. Permanence of earnings changes is measured by the level of earnings persistence which is computed using two alternative time-series models: IMA (1, 1) and ARIMA (2, 1, 0). A Logit model is used to evaluate the effect of earnings persistence and control variables on the probability of adoption of employee <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plans. <b>Profit</b> <b>sharing</b> data is extracted from the U. S. IRS 5500 Form while financial data for the sample firms are retrieved from Compustat. The final sample includes 298 firms that are equally split between <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> and non-profit sharing firms.

Earnings persistence is positively associated with the probability of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plan adoption. This result is robust when the alternative measure of earnings persistence is used and the control variables are included. These results should lead to a richer model of employee <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plan adoption and use...|$|R
