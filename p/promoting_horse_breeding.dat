Key Words: incentive programs, parimutuel horse racing, subsidy, tax, Subsidy policies for agricultural commodities have long been used as a means to stabilize supply and augment demand. Thoroughbred breeder/owner incentive programs are state ad-ministered subsidy policies designed to pro-mote regional race <b>horse</b> <b>breeding</b> and own-ership. Currently, 28 states operate incentive programs that transfer one-hundred million dollars annually to Thoroughbred breeders and owners (American Horse Council). Breeder/owner incentive programs are funded through a tax levied on parimutuel wa-gering pools. This share of tax revenue is transferred to owners and breeders under a va-riety of alternative subsidy programs. The state of Washington operated an incentive pro-gram as early as 1945, and many states initi-ated incentive programs in the 1960 s and The authors are assistant professor and associate pro-fessor, respectively, with the Equine Industry Program...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{trend of}} capital {{investments}} is increasing in <b>horse</b> <b>breeding,</b> {{as one of}} the major livestock branches in the Republic of Croatia. A long tradition of <b>horse</b> <b>breeding</b> and natural resources eligible for <b>horse</b> <b>breeding</b> contributed to the creation of great potential for Croatia. Besides, state financial subventions are also helping <b>horse</b> <b>breeding</b> development. All forms of <b>horse</b> <b>breeding</b> are showing an increasing trend of development, which influences an increase in numerical trend of horses as well as their quality. Interest in <b>horse</b> <b>breeding,</b> sports or just in keeping horses as hobby animals is increasing each year. Main investors and movers are owners, breeders, sportsmen and horse lovers themselves. Help through state financial subvention is significant, but still very far from necessary funds. The regulative for financial subvention and other official acts are regulated for <b>horse</b> <b>breeding</b> through subvention groups. This is an efficient measurement to help breeders, but in the future changes will be necessary, mainly through different developing projects. Besides the only state stu...|$|R

40|$|<b>Horse</b> <b>breeding</b> is {{a branch}} of animal {{husbandry}} that keeps loosing its importance in BiH, in particular in the postwar period. Horse population number tends to decline constantly. In 1990, horse population in BiH was about 99. 803, in 2004 about 27. 156, in 2006 about 25. 699, while in 2009 the number decreased to 21. 185 with the objective tendency of further decline. These data support the opinion of many livestock <b>breeding</b> experts that <b>horse</b> <b>breeding</b> surely became the most endangered livestock breeding in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Currently, horse population has an estimate of 1000. Only thanks {{to a number of}} enthusiasts in <b>horse</b> <b>breeding,</b> <b>horse</b> population has been surviving, sometimes under unbelievable circumstances lacking food, water and adequate accommodation.
