40|$|Chloroplast DNA {{sequences}} are {{of great}} interest for population genetics and phylogenetic studies. However, only a small set of markers are commonly used. Most {{of them have been}} designed for amplification in a large range of Angiosperms and are located in the Large Single Copy (LSC). Here we developed a new set of 100 primer pairs optimized for amplification in Monocotyledons. Primer pairs amplify coding (exon) and non-coding regions (intron and intergenic spacer). They span the different chloroplast regions: 72 are located in the LSC, 13 in the Small Single Copy (SSC) and 15 in the Inverted Repeat region (IR). Amplification and sequencing were tested in 13 species of Monocotyledons: Dioscorea abyssinica, D. praehensilis, D. rotundata, D. dumetorum, D. bulbifera, Trichopus sempervirens (Dioscoreaceae), <b>Phoenix</b> canariensis, P. <b>dactylifera,</b> Astrocaryum scopatum, A. murumuru, Ceroxylon echinulatum (Arecaceae), Digitaria excilis and Pennisetum glaucum (Poaceae). The diversity found in Dioscorea, Digitaria and Pennisetum mainly corresponded to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) while the diversity found in Arecaceae also comprises Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR). We observed that the most variable loci (rps 15 -ycf 1, rpl 32 -ccsA, ndhF-rpl 32, ndhG-ndhI and ccsA) are located in the SSC. Through the analysis of the genetic structure of a wild-cultivated species complex in Dioscorea, we demonstrated that this new set of primers is {{of great interest}} for population genetics and we anticipate that it will also be useful for phylogeny and bar-coding studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} invasions represent today {{a serious}} ecological problem, {{and is one}} of the main threats to biodiversity, in Italy as in the rest of the world. In the last century several species of palm trees have been introduced in gardens, parks and lanes of great part of Italy, where climate allows their life and growth. Among the others <b>Phoenix</b> canariensis, P. <b>dactylifera,</b> Washingtonia robusta, W. filifera, Jubaea spectabilis and Trachycarpus fortunei. All of these species are exotic, as the only indigenous palm in Italy is the dwarf fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), which occurs along the tirrenian coast from Sicily to Liguria, in Sardinia and most of the smaller islands. Palm trees have become by now part of the Italian landscape, as do pine tree in Rome or cypress in Tuscany. Recently, two different species of exotic insects where recorded for the first time in Italy: the south American moth Paysandisia archon and the chinese beetle Rhynchophorus ferrugineus. Both of them lay their eggs on palm trees, and their larvae feed into the stem and kill the palms. Both arrived in Italy and in other Mediterranean countries as larvae or eggs hidden into the plants imported from the native regions. These insects are rapidly spreading through Italy, following palm plantations, and destroying palms from north to south, with a huge economic damage. Furthermore, they are locally changing probably for ever the Italian landscape. More recently, there is evidence of infestation on dwarf fan palm by both the moth and the beetle. This could cause a local extinction of the palm...|$|R
25|$|Table sugar (sucrose) {{comes from}} plant sources. Two {{important}} sugar crops predominate: sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and sugar beets (Beta vulgaris), in which sugar {{can account for}} 12% to 20% of the plant's dry weight. Minor commercial sugar crops include the date palm (<b>Phoenix</b> <b>dactylifera),</b> sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), and the sugar maple (Acer saccharum). Sucrose is obtained by extraction of these crops with hot water, concentration of the extract gives syrups, from which solid sucrose can be crystallized. In 2013, worldwide production of table sugar amounted to 175 million tonnes.|$|E
25|$|The oases to {{the west}} and north of the range have the easiest access. Where {{mosquitoes}} do not abound, they support several villages, such as Zouar, where indigenous plant species have largely been replaced by some 56,000 date palms (<b>Phoenix</b> <b>dactylifera)</b> for the production of dates. These are harvested between late July and early August. In winter, when reserves are depleted, {{it is not uncommon for}} the cores of the dates and the fiber of the palms to be ground into a paste and consumed. These palm groves can also grow millet and corn, but the crop is spotty and sometimes swept away by early flooding. The banks of the enneris grow desert gourd (Citrullus colocynthis), which are collected in October to extract the bitter seeds which, after being washed, are ground to make flour. Horticulture is practiced on a small scale using traditional irrigation methods. Goats and, more rarely, sheep number 50,000 heads, and 8,000 camels and 7,000 donkeys are raised in the range. Chickens are also numerous, although the consumption of meat is rare, usually done so through salting.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the area}} {{dedicated}} to palms {{one can find}} Chamaerops humilis, the only palm [...] native to Sicily, and numerous exotic palms, in which the gardens are particularly blessed. [...] Amongst both potted and fully cultivated specimens, [...] one can count a good 34 genera and around 80 species. The genus Washingtonia is represented by W. filifera, that flowered in Palermo {{for the first time}} ever, [...] and by W. robusta. In the genus Phoenix, apart from the common date [...] (<b>Phoenix</b> <b>dactylifera)</b> there are also P. rupicola, P. reclinata, [...] P. canariensis, [...] P. roebelinii and P. teophrastii. There are also many other genera: Chamaedorea, Brahea, Sabal, Erythea, Livistona, Howea and Trachycarpus.|$|E
40|$|Alien {{species have}} been {{introduced}} both accidentally and intentionally. The last are and have been motivated by economic, environmental and social considerations (NOBANIS, 2010), {{as in the case}} of many palm species (<b>Phoenix</b> canariensis, P. <b>dactylifera,</b> Washingtonia filifera, W. robusta) in Sicily. These Arecaceae are important in the urban areas and they contribute to the typical Sicilian Panorama. On the other hand the accidental introduction of invasive alien species can be one a cause of the loss of native biodiversity, especially severe on islands and other isolated ecosystems. Phytophagous insects can cause biodiversity losses and may also have a strong impact on the economy of the island and on the landscape. The adverse effects of invasive alien insects are illustrated by specific examples from Sicily, including the multiple impacts of the invasive weevil Rhynchophourous ferrugineus (Manachini et al., 2012), native to Malesia but quickly spread throughout Europe where it preferably attacks P. canariensis. It is noted that RPW aggressively spreads from P. canariensis to other not native hosts (eg. Washingtonia spp., Sabal spp.) and to native palm Chamaerops humilis L. (Arecaceae). This poses a threat to natural plant communities, biodiversity and landscape (Manachini et al., 2012). There is evidence that in a new territory the invasive species populations for some time exist in a kind of latent state, during which due to repeated invasions and hybridization as well as the mutations the level of genetic diversity is restored, which is usually reduced due to genetic processes occurring in the course of invasion (genetic drift, bottleneck, founder effect) (McRay & Latta 2002). Moreover there was reported that change in the host preferences could lead or due to genetic differences and to a formation of different species or sub-species (Dr√®s & Mallet, 2002). It is known that for weevil species, host choice did not only depend on host phenology, but also on other physical and chemical factor, and this could be link to genetic differentiation. To make a clear assignment of weevil species or race independently of possible morphological plasticity, we decided to use molecular markers. These tools have the additional advantage of being applicable to both immature and adult individuals. We used a mitochondrial and a nuclear marker, because comparison between the two can detect also hybridization. The mitochondrial marker was the COI gene, which encodes for the first subunit of the cytochrome oxidase, one of the most frequently sequenced genes used in insect phylogeny (Caterino et al., 2000), already identified by the authors for RPW. Mitochondrial and nuclear sequences data showed that RPWs collected in different areas can be recognised at all different instars by molecular analysis and that all weevils came from different hosts belong to the same specie, and closed population, this lead to recognised the potential risk of extend its attack more on C. humilis. Biological data on the RPW form different infested palms confirm this potential danger that can lead to a change in the native biodiversity sustained by the presence of C. humilis...|$|R
