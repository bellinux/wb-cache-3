40|$|Abstract. I analyze a {{sequential}} bargaining {{model in}} which players are optimistic about their bargaining power (measmred as the probabihty of making offers), but learn as they play the game. I show that there exists a uniquely <b>predetermined</b> <b>settlement</b> date, such that in equilibrium the players always reach an agreement at that date, but never reach one before it. Given any discount rate, if the learning is sufficiently slow, the players agree immediately. I show that, for any speed of learning, the agreement is delayed arbitrarily long, provided that the players are sufficiently patient. Therefore, although excessive optimism alone cannot cause delay, it can cause long delays if the players are expected to learn...|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{real estate}} {{documents}} are signed and the transactions are closed at a <b>predetermined</b> <b>settlement</b> location, {{such as an}} escrow firm, a title company or an attorney's office. If the time or place is not convenient {{for one of the}} parties, then a courtesy signing may be arranged, in which documents are forwarded to and signatures are taken by another office or party who is not handling the actual settlement. If, for example, a real estate transaction is closing at a title company in California, but a seller is in New Jersey, the documents may be sent to that title company's affiliate in New Jersey for signature. That office will perform a courtesy signing and return the signed documents to the California office for the closing.|$|R

50|$|Given {{the same}} time, the macroviscous fluid is settled 6/5 unit length {{compared}} to the unit length settlement of the grain-inertia fluid as measured from the nose-tip of the flowfront that has already settled to {{the back side of}} the debris. Therefore, the macroviscous fluid settles (completely stops to flow) 20% faster than the grain-inertia fluid. Due to the dispersive pressure in grain-inertia fluid, the settlement process is delayed by 20% for the grain-inertia fluid than for the macroviscous fluid. This is meaningful because particles are more agitated due to higher dispersive pressure in grain-inertia fluids than in macroviscous fluids. Once the material comes close to rest, these dispersive forces (induced by the quadratic shear rate), are still active for grain-inertia fluid but macroviscous fluid settles relatively faster because it is less dispersive. This provides a tool to approximate and estimate the final <b>settlement</b> <b>time</b> (the time at which the entire fluid body is at rest). These are mechanically important relationships concerning the <b>settlement</b> <b>time</b> and the <b>settlement</b> lengths between the grain-inertia and the macroviscous fluids.|$|R

An aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) based on PEG 2000 and sodium citrate was investigated for the recovery of phenolic compounds that could act as natural antioxidants for applications including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food additives and other industrial applications.

The four secondary resources, stone, wood, iron, and mana, are used to support the military; if their production is insufficient, gold income will be decreased to accommodate. Resources are produced in settlements or in mines; mines can only be placed in <b>predetermined</b> locations. <b>Settlements</b> {{have a number of}} slots to be occupied by one of eight components; each produces a particular resource, or gives another benefit to the settlement. Settlements also determine the support limit, which represents the number of companies the player can support.|$|R

50|$|The north-flowing Vermilion River and the south-flowing Middle Fork Vermilion River run on what {{is close}} to a {{straight}} line between Oglesby and Danville. In presettlement times, the two rivers drained an upland marsh near Roberts. It is possible that early settlers regarded these as a single river that flowed in two directions. It is also possible that, in early <b>settlement</b> <b>times,</b> these rivers formed a canoe route between the Illinois River and Wabash River, with a portage through the marshes near Roberts.
