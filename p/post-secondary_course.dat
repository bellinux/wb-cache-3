50|$|Once {{limited to}} high-achieving students, such programs, {{specifically}} College in the Schools, are increasingly {{seen as a}} means to support the postsecondary preparation of average-achieving students. CIS simulates a truer college experience, as unlike AP courses, students are already enrolled in a college institution and need only to earn a quality grade throughout the course, rather than the potential for college credit being based solely on the score of a cumulative final exam. The United States Department of Education recommends expanding accelerated learning options that offer true <b>post-secondary</b> <b>course</b> work so that students enter higher education with a minimum of six college credits already earned, as students who fail to earn 20 college credits by the end of their first year were less likely to graduate from college.|$|E

Less than ten years later, its preparatory school moved out and eventually became a legally separate institution, St. Francis Preparatory School, and is now located in Queens.As the U.S. moved closer to its entrance into World War II, 240 students were enrolled at St. Francis. While the student body remained mostly Irish, the changing demographics of working class Brooklyn were reflected by the growing number of Italian-American students. By the spring semester of 1944, when the war was at its peak, the number of students enrolled dropped to 45. Most of those still enrolled were members of the Franciscan order and those exempt from military service (12 SFC students gave their lives to the war effort). After the War and {{with the passage of the}} G.I. Bill, which paid tuition for returning soldiers, enrollment at St. Francis increased to 878 students. In 1957, the Regents of the University of the State of New York granted an absolute Charter to the Trustees of the College making it a separate legal entity from the St. Francis Monastery. The new corporate status enabled St. Francis students to qualify for federal financial aid. Shortly after, in 1959, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education accredited St. Francis College. After these developments the College embarked on an expansion program. In 1961, the college purchased the Herman Behr Mansion in Brooklyn Heights to serve as a residence for the Franciscan Brothers and signaled the move from Cobble Hill to Brooklyn Heights.|$|E

Section 1 describes Virtual-U itself. Key research issues are presented in section 2. These range from user interface design questions such as navigation support and use of multimedia to the pragmatics of communication and social interaction in shared workspaces. Addressing these issues necessitates a broad cross-disciplinary research approach that informs the design process in an iterative testing/design cycle described in section 3.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{delivery}} of post-secondary courses is undergoing extraordinary change. Like many phenomena related to communication, it has undergone progressive evolution in the post-war era, with explosive growth {{in the five years}} of commercial Internet availability. A <b>post-secondary</b> <b>course</b> could traditionally be taken either by correspondence or in a ‘conventional ’ place-based format; the Internet has created a confluence where courses can be delivered on a technological continuum. Remote learners can now interactively participate in online seminars with {{some or all of the}} learning process delivered in an asynchronous mode. Course designs, in turn, can be a slightly modified version of past methods using novel technology for delivery or radically redesigned to accommodate some new media opportunity. This paper outlines the evolution and current revolution, discusses a challenge in the evaluation of effectiveness of alternative modes of delivery, and concludes with a proposed empirical design to approach the evaluation. 1...|$|E

40|$|Boyd Hunter and Jerry Schwab analyse {{recent trends}} in the {{engagement}} of Indigenous people with the Australian education system between 1986 and 2001. Against the backdrop of a Commonwealth government policy emphasis on 2 ̆ 7 practical reconciliation 2 ̆ 7 since 1996, the analysis shows that while {{there have been some}} absolute improvements in Indigenous educational outcomes over the period 1986 to 2001, these gains are less evident when measured relative to non-Indigenous outcomes. The lack of improvement relative to the non-Indigenous population is seen not only in the proportion of the population with post-secondary qualifications, but also in the proportion of Indigenous teenagers staying at school. By any measure the Indigenous population remains severely disadvantaged. Another finding is that for younger age groups the non-Indigenous population has a higher participation rate in post-secondary education than the Indigenous population. On a more positive note, older Indigenous people are actually more likely to be enrolled in a <b>post-secondary</b> <b>course</b> than their non-Indigenous counterparts [...] probably {{as a response to the}} history of disadvantage within the education sector...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and determine the competency relationships between secondary and post-secondary agriculture and natural resources curriculum and entry-level job competencies. A mixed-method, action research design was used to collect the necessary information concerning Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s secondary agricultural curriculum, post-secondary agriculture and natural resources introductory and capstone coursework, and entry-level job descriptions. ^ Data was collected from Nebraska secondary agricultural education teachers regarding the importance, knowledge, performance, and the students 2 ̆ 7 ability to perform (consequence) on 409 achievement indicators representing ten subject matter content areas. The study was conducted at the conclusion of the 2000 – 01 school year with 83 teachers completing five of the ten randomly assigned subject matter sets. Record analysis was completed on 131 <b>post-secondary</b> <b>course</b> syllabi and 11 job descriptions. ^ Secondary teachers and students were found to be knowledgeable and satisfactorily skilled in the areas of agribusiness, agricultural sales and marketing, agricultural mechanics, animal science, leadership, and plant and soil science. There was duplication of content between secondary and post-secondary introductory course work in the areas of agribusiness, animal science, and plant and soil science. Secondary programs were not preparing students for introductory course work in the areas of food science, natural resources and horticulture. Post-secondary programs were providing the necessary technical competencies for entry-level positions though there was no mention of interpersonal and communication skills in exit course requirements. As well, graduates entering into sales positions were not receiving formal or technical preparation in sales. ^ The following recommendations were made: conduct a Delphi study of secondary teachers, post-secondary faculty, and business and industry representatives to further identify the exit level competencies of secondary and post-secondary programs leading to a seamless, articulated curriculum; add a technical sales course to post-secondary curriculum; design and implement competency outcomes and assessments for interpersonal and communication skills in capstone courses; and provide pre-service and in-service training in the areas of companion animals, food science, horticulture, and natural resources. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis was twofold. Firstly, to map the situation in one-year post- secondary courses of English organised by private language schools in the Czech Republic and to recommend teaching methods and materials suitable for the given age group and {{the aims of the}} courses.
