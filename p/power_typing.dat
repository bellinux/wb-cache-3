40|$|Summary. A {{comparative}} study of biotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility, whole-cell protein analysis, plasmid analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA and polymerase chain reaction with arbitrary primers of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from three large hospitals was performed {{to determine the best}} markers for epidemiological purposes. Ninety-two isolates were included: 38 belonged to a previously described outbreak and 54 were randomly selected from sporadic cases of infection. Biotyping, whole-cell protein and plasmid analysis were the least discriminatory methods, whereas antimicrobial susceptibility and polymerase chain reaction with arbitrary primers showed moderate discriminatory <b>power.</b> <b>Typing</b> based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA appeared to be the best discriminatory method (discrimination index of 0. 9623). The addition of polymerase chain reaction with arbitrary primers or antimicrobial susceptibility to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA did not further increase the discriminatory power...|$|E
40|$|The {{relational}} model is accepted for its simplicity and ele-gance. At {{the other side}} the simplicity causes the problem, that most semantic type constructs are not representable as a simple relation. Variant and heterogeneous structures belong to those constructs not adequatly supported by the simple {{relational model}}. In this paper we give {{an overview of the}} model of flexible relations that allows to model and process arbitrary heterogeneous structures, while preserving the relational philosophy of operating with a single construc-tor. As flexible relations support both the modeling and the operational aspect of variant structures seamlessly, our model truly helps to further bridge the gap between seman-tic and operational data models. We discuss the structural part of the model and introduce an algebra for flexible relations. Further we examine a sub-class of flexible relations, that can be processed as efficiently as the simple relational model, and show that this subclass possesses desirable structural normal form properties. In ad-dition, we point out that our approach exceeds the object-oriented paradigm in modeling <b>power,</b> <b>typing</b> precision, and query optimization potential. ...|$|E

However, we see that L_p spaces are p-uniformly convex, for 1 < p< 2, and are 2 -uniformly convex, for p> 2.

40|$|Subject: Proof {{theory and}} logical {{foundations}} of computer science. Castagna, Ghelli and Longo [1] provide a theoretical foundation for object-oriented programming via λ-calculi with overloading. However, their full calculus exposes {{a new form}} of impredicativity for which no denotational semantics was available. In this talk we introduce the system OTN of explicit mathematics based on elementary separation, product, join and weak <b>power</b> <b>types.</b> In such theories types are represented by names, and these are first order values. Hence they can be used in computations which is the key to model overloading. We present a set-theoretical model for OTN, and we develop in OTN a theory of impredicative overloading. Together this yields {{a solution to the problem}} of impredicativity mentioned above. The use of <b>power</b> <b>types</b> in explicit mathematics has always been doubted. Glass [2] showed that weak <b>power</b> <b>types</b> add nothing to the proof-theoretic strength of various systems of explicit mathematics without join, and Jäger[3] proved the inconsistency of strong <b>power</b> <b>types</b> with elementary comprehension. Our work also provides a first example of an application of <b>power</b> <b>types</b> in explicit mathematics...|$|R
