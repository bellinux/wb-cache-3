5|$|Aerith makes several {{appearances}} in the CGI film , as Cloud's spiritual guide, urging him {{to move on with}} his life and to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control, telling him that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully and kindheartedly <b>poking</b> <b>fun</b> at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past. However, she also acknowledges his suffering and offers kind words of support. One of Aerith's interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game's party helps in Cloud's final attack against Bahamut SIN; she appears as the last party member to assist Cloud. She also appears in the final scene of the movie, along with Zack Fair, where she gives Cloud more words of encouragement before she and Zack walk into the light. Near the end of the film, it is discovered that water mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith's church, which manifests itself as a cure for Geostigma.|$|E

25|$|In 1779, Casanova found Francesca, an uneducated seamstress, {{who became}} his live-in lover and housekeeper, and who loved him devotedly. Later that year, the Inquisitors {{put him on}} the payroll and sent him to {{investigate}} commerce between the Papal states and Venice. Other publishing and theater ventures failed, primarily from lack of capital. In a downward spiral, Casanova was expelled again from Venice in 1783, after writing a vicious satire <b>poking</b> <b>fun</b> at Venetian nobility. In it he made his only public statement that Grimani was his true father.|$|E
25|$|On February 8, 1994, Manilow sued Los Angeles {{radio station}} KBIG (104.3 FM), seeking $13 {{million in damages}} and $15 million in punitive damages, {{claiming}} {{that one of their}} advertisements was causing irreparable damage to his professional reputation. The ad, a thirty-second spot which began airing on January 31, suggested that people listen to KBIG because it does not play Manilow's music. The lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior Court by Los Angeles attorney C. Tucker Cheadle. Two days later, KBIG/104.3 FM agreed to drop the commercial <b>poking</b> <b>fun</b> at the singer, but a lawyer representing his business interests stopped short of agreeing to withdraw a $28 million lawsuit.|$|E

25|$|The Church {{emphasized}} love {{as more of}} {{a spiritual}} rather than sexual connection. There is a possibility that other writings not associated with the Church over courtly love were made {{as a response to the}} Catholic Church’s ideas about love. Many scholars believe Andreas Capellanus’ work, De arte honeste amandi, was a satire <b>poking</b> <b>fun</b> at the Church. In that work, Capellanus is supposedly writing to a young man named Walter, and he spends the first two books telling him how to achieve love and the rules of love. However, in the third book he tells him that the only way to live his life correctly is to shun love in favor of God. This sudden change is what has sparked the interest of many scholars.|$|E
