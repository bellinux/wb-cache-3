40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} was carried out to assess the anticancer {{activity}} of methanol extracts of internal bone of L. duvauceli and S. pharaonis for cell viability and toxicity on HepG 2 liver cancer cells. The bone extracts had significant cytotoxicity on HepG 2 cell in different concentrations (100, 500, 1000 µg/ml). Methanol fraction of squid bone powder showed cell death at a higher concentration of 1000 µg. 27 % toxicity was observed at 100 µg/ml and 37 % at 1000 µg/ml. The viability of cuttlefish bone powder ranged from 58 % (1000 µg/ml) to 68 % (100 µg/ml). Hep G 2 cells experienced {{a significant decrease in}} viability at low concentration with an eventual decline at the highest concentration. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> of cuttle bone extracts varied from 32 to 42. Minimum toxicity of 32 % was observed at 100 µg and maximum of 42 % was observed at 1000 µg concentration and IC 50 at a concentration of> 1000 µg. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> showed increasing trend with increasing concentration of the extract. The result suggested that the cephalopods bone is a source to be considered in the discovery of drug development for cancer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{environmental}} impacts of the dregs disposal in cement kiln and conventional production were contrastively evaluated by life cycle assessment (LCA) in this study. The {{results showed that the}} environmental load ratio of both cement productions followed the order of energy depletion potential (EDP) > depletion potential (ADP) > global warming potential (GWP) > acidification potential (AP) > human toxicity (HT) > photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). The comprehensive environmental load of disposal dregs was 14. 465 × 10 - 12 /a, which was 3. 98 % lower than that of the conventional cement production. Moreover, the reduced <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the environmental load followed the order of HT> AP> POCP> EDP> ADP> GWP, which indicated that the reduced <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> human <b>toxicity</b> and acidification reached 10. 62 % and 10. 06 % respectively. Thus, considering the environmental benefits, it would be a better method to dispose dregs instead of limestone in cement kiln...|$|R
30|$|In general, {{there has}} been {{increased}} scrutiny over the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> nanoparticles due to increased use in various industries. Not only in the application, {{but also in the}} manufacturing of nanoparticles as those who manufacture the nanoparticles will experience the most exposure. Silver NPs have been analyzed to determine their toxicity when manufactured. Based on a continuous 3 -day exposure assessment, it was evident that workers were exposed to high levels of nanoparticles on a day-to-day basis; similar results were also found for other metallic and carbon NP manufacturing [78]. While the exact <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> long-term overexposure are still completely unknown, a recent study by Das et al. [79] looks at the potential toxicity to mammalian germ cells and developing embryos from engineering nanoparticles such as gold, silver, fullerenes, and chitosan. They summarize various toxicities based on nanoparticle uptake and internalization mechanisms. The major emphasis of the study is that while some nanoparticles may not have any acute toxicity, {{there is a possibility that}} there is some long-term toxicity or effect to germ lines to consider. The authors disclose that a large <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> these <b>toxicities</b> are mostly dependent on NP size and surface modifications. Taking those variables into consideration when designing and engineering nAbts can aid in ameliorating the possible toxicities that may arise.|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} thyroidal {{influence}} on the stress-related metabolic response in fish, we studied the metabolic pattern of airbreathing teleost, Anabas testudineus after exposing the fish to nuvacron, a monocrotophos pesticide (MCP). Significant changes in the levels of some diagnostically important metabolites and serum triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) were observed after MCP exposure in euthyroid, hyperthyroid and hypothyroid fish. Forty-eight hour exposure of perch to MCP while significantly increasing the levels of glucose, urea, triglycerides in the serum, total protein and RNA in the liver, and the activity of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase in the serum and liver, reduced the concentration of liver glycogen and the activity of aspartate aminotransferase in theserum and liver. MCP exposure decreased the levels of serum T 3 but not T 4 levels. Analysis <b>of</b> the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> MCP <b>toxicity</b> on each parameter among the groups indicates that MCP had its maximum effect in the hyperthyroid fish when compared with stimulation by MCP was significantly less in hypothyroid perch.

Sands were agitated for 8 h after adding filtered seawater (4 : 1 volume/weight) and decanted for 4 h. Biotests were performed at the Institute Pasteur Lille (IPL), France by exposing oyster embryo larvae to five concentrations of elutriates prepared from both samples (20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 % elutriates + control). Elutriates were stored at + 4 °C until the chemical analysis was undertaken. Mature genitors (C. gigas) {{were obtained from the}} Guernsey Sea Farms hatchery. These genitors were carefully cleaned and immersed in unfiltered reference water at 18 °C for 30 min before a thermal shock (28 °C, 30 min). After the emission of gametes, fecundation was monitored under a microscope; then, after dilution, the larvae were transferred to Iwaki microplates (final volume 3 mL, number 300 larvae/well) and placed in culture with sand extracts at 24 ± 1 °C for 24 h. After incubation and after reaching the typical stage D [33], the larvae were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde and decanted. The abnormality rate, including dead larvae, was determined {{on the basis of a}} count of 100 larvae/well (two tests, three replicates per concentration). Abnormalities in controls were 6.16 ± 2.4 %.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} potential cardiotoxicity as exerted by Erbicin-derived-immunoagents (EDIAs), novel human anti-ErbB 2 immunoagents engineered by fusion {{of a human}} anti-ErbB 2 scFv, Erbicin, with either a human RNase or the Fc region of a human IgG 1. EDIAs are strongly cytotoxic on ErbB 2 -positive cells in vitro and in vivo and bind to an epitope {{different from that of}} Herceptin, a humanized anti-ErbB 2 mAb effective in the therapy of breast carcinoma, but cardiotoxic in a high <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> cases. <b>Toxicity</b> and apoptosis were tested in vitro by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thizolyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), DNA fragmentation, and immunoblotting analyses. Echocardiography was measured in mice after treatment with each immunoagent. Cardiac fibrosis and detection of apoptosis were examined by Sirius red staining of collagen and TUNEL assay, respectively. EDIAs were found in vitro to have no adverse effects on cardiac cells for which Herceptin is severely toxic. In vivo studies on a mouse model showed that the EDIAs did not alter cardiac function, whereas Herceptin and doxorubicin, used as positive controls, significantly reduced the fractional shortening parameter. Cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis were not significantly affected in mice treated with EDIAs. Thus, EDIAs could fulfill the therapeutic need of patients ineligible for Herceptin treatment due to cardiac dysfunction...|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} in the current study, the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> {{acetamiprid}} is evident at low concentrations for P. aeruginosa BCRC 11864 bacteria.

30|$|In {{addition}} to physico-chemical analyses, maturity {{can also be}} {{measured in terms of}} germination index (GI) which is based on relatively simple phytotoxicity tests. Phytotoxicity tests are actually germination bioassays that quantify seed growth after the application of compost liquid extracts to the seeds; GI is calculated by the root length and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> germination of selected test plant seeds compared to a control (control is commonly tested using deionized water). The GI of any compost aids in determining the level <b>of</b> <b>toxicity,</b> i.e., low levels <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> mainly affects root growth, while high levels <b>of</b> <b>toxicity,</b> affect seed germination. Therefore, GIs lower than 100 % indicate potential phytotoxicity, while values greater than 100 % indicate a positive effect on seed growth, and thus signify a mature compost. A phytotoxicity test does not reveal the underlying reasons for the compost’s toxicity but serves only as an indirect measure for quantification <b>of</b> the <b>toxicity</b> for seed growth. Phytotoxicity in the compost extract can be typically due to the presence of partially degraded organic acids, fermentation intermediates, ammonia, salts and heavy metals.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{chemical}} analyses and ecotoxicity tests were {{applied for the}} assessment of a heavily hydrocarbon-contaminated soil prior and after the application of a remediation procedure that consisted in the stimulation of soil autochthonous populations of hydrocarbon degraders in static-ventilated biopiles. Terrestrial bioassays were applied in mixtures of test soils and artificial control soil and studied the survival and reproduction of Eisenia fetida and the avoidance response of E. fetida and Folsomia candida. Effects on aquatic organisms were studied by means of acute tests with Vibrio fischeri, Raphidocelis subcapitata, and Daphnia magna performed on aqueous elutriates from test soils. The bioremediation procedure led to a significant reduction in the concentration of hydrocarbons (from 34264 to 3074 mg kg- 1, i. e., 91 % decrease) and toxicity although bioassays were not able to report a <b>percentage</b> decrease <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> as high as the percentage reduction. Sublethal tests proved the most sensitive terrestrial bioassays and avoidance tests with earthworms and springtails showed potential as monitoring tools of hydrocarbon remediation due to their high sensitivity and short duration. The concentrations of hydrocarbons in water extracts from test soils were 130 and 100 µg L- 1 before and after remediation, respectively. Similarly to terrestrial tests, most aquatic bioassays detected a significant reduction in toxicity, which was almost negligible {{at the end of the}} treatment. D. magna survival was the most affected by soil elutriates although toxicity to the crustacean was associated to the salinity of the samples rather than to the concentration of hydrocarbons. Ecotoxicity tests with aqueous soil elutriates proved less relevant in the assessment of hydrocarbon-contaminated soils due to the low hydrosolubility of hydrocarbons and the influence of the physicochemical parameters of the aquatic mediumPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
