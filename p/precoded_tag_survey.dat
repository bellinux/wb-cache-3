There is no consen-sus {{as to how to}} establish feasibility. Method The feasi-bility of a new assessment – the Threshold Assessment Grid (TAG) – for use when making referrals to mental health services was tested by training mental health teams in using the TAG and other standardised assess-ments, asking referrers to ten mental health services in London also to complete a <b>TAG,</b> <b>surveying</b> <b>TAG</b> users, and evaluating a feedback meeting at which TAG data were presented. Results One hundred and one (61 %) mental health staff received training, and 445 (74 %) re-ferrers of 600 patients completed TAGs. Sixty-five (65 %) questionnaires from TAG users were completed, and 24 (80 %) people attending feedback meetings evaluated the TAG. These allowed {{the extent to which the}} TAG is brief, simple, relevant, acceptable, available and valuable to be investigated. Conclusion The TAG exhibited good feasibility when used by mental health staff, and mode-rate feasibility when used by referrers.

40|$|In eukaryotes, {{determination}} of the subcellular location of a novel protein encoded in genomic or transcriptomic data provides useful clues as to its possible function. However, experimental localization studies are expensive and time-consuming. As a result, accurate in silico prediction of subcellular localization from sequence data alone is an extremely important field of study in bioinformatics. This is especially so as genomic studies expand beyond model system organisms to encompass the full diversity of eukaryotes. Here we review {{some of the more}} commonly used programs for prediction of proteins that function in mitochondria, or mitochondrion-related organelles in diverse eukaryotic lineages and provide recommendations on how to apply these methods. Furthermore, we compare the predictive performance of these programs on a mixed set of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins. Although N-terminal targeting peptide prediction programs tend to have the highest accuracy, they cannot be effectively used for partial coding sequences derived from high-throughput expressed sequence <b>tag</b> <b>surveys</b> where data for the N-terminus of the encoded protein is often missing. Therefore methods that do not rely on the presence of an N-terminal targeting sequence alone are extremely useful, especially for expressed sequence tag data. The best strategy for classification of unknown proteins is to use multiple programs, incorporating a variety of prediction strategies, and closely examine the predictions with an understanding of how each of those programs will likely handle the data...|$|R
40|$|The Benguela Current is {{considered}} to be a major biogeographic barrier for tropical and warm-temperate marine fish, but there is limited knowledge regarding its influence on population sub-structuring of in more cold-tolerant species. Employing genetic variation within the mitochondrial DNA Control Region and six cross-specific nuclear microsatellite markers, a preliminary study was conducted to investigate population sub-structuring in Argyrosomus inodorus, a highly exploited, cold temperate migratory species, across the Benguela Current region. Results revealed evidence of incipient genetic differentiation (mtDNA ?ST = 0. 092; nuclear FST = 0. 036 and DST = 0. 104, P < 0. 05) between the two sampling sites, suggesting the presence of two regional populations. Estimates of contemporary migration rates between populations were low, and similar in range to those reported in <b>tagging</b> <b>surveys.</b> Although preliminary, these results suggest that the oceanographic features of the Benguela Current may have influenced the evolutionary history of A. inodorus, and that the species is likely to be composed of two populations in the Benguela region.

This study analyzed the growth pattern of the species. The determination of age was done by observing and analyzing whole otoliths (sagitta), there by obtaining the mean lengths at age for males and females in the year 1998 (from 11 - 54 cm TL and 0 - 8 years for the whole population). Additionally, the growth parameters in both sexes were obtained according to the von Bertalanffy equation: L∞ = 58 cm (constrained using as reference the largest individual observed from commercial length distribution samples), K = 0. 169 and to = 0. 668 that would be compared with those obtained by other authors in other areas of distribution of the species. Through the interpretation of the otolith and its edge, a sequence of annual rapid and slow growth rings was observed, otoliths with the opaque edge (rapid growth) showing the highest percentages in the period from June to September. Otolith total diameters, from valid readings, were measured and seems to follow an allometric model: TL = aODb (a = 24. 25, b = 1. 12 and r 2 = 0. 82).

It demonstrates that the {{undulate ray}} can be found all along the French coast from the Loire estuary to the Spanish boarder, forming several isolated units, the more important being likely in {{the central part of the}} Bay of Biscay (Pertuis Charentais – Gironde area). Even in this latter limited area, the population is structured in sub-units with a low exchange rate between them. This population structure allowed to estimate abundance by mark-recapture in the Gironde estuary, using a Petersen estimate. The conditions that must be respected for such closed population abundance estimate are analysed. The conclusions are that as long i) long-line catch of rays longer than 65 cm are used to the be sure to have an equal capture probability and no recruitment effect, ii) recaptures are within 4. 5 month from the tagging date in winter to neglect tag losses and iii) number of tagged rays is corrected for emigration and mortality, an abundance estimate can be provided. The biomass of undulate rays longer than 65 cm in the inner Gironde estuary can thus be estimated to range from 51 to 70 t in the 2013 - 2014 winter (95 % confidence interval is 30 - 124 t).

40|$|The first {{generation}} of large-scale chemical <b>tagging</b> <b>surveys,</b> in particular the HERMES/GALAH million star survey, promises to vastly expand {{our understanding of the}} chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy. This, however, is contingent on our ability to confidently perform chemical tagging on such a large data-set. Chemical homogeneity has been observed across a range of elements within several Galactic open clusters, yet the level to which this is the case globally, and particularly in comparison to the scatter across clusters themselves, is not well understood. The patterns of elements in coeval cluster members, occupying a complex chemical abundance space, are rooted in the evolution, ultimately the nature of the very late stages, of early generations of stars. The current astrophysical models of such stages are not yet sufficient to explain all observations, combining with our significant gaps in the understanding of star formation, makes this a difficult arena to tackle theoretically. Here, we describe a robust pair-wise metric used to gauge the chemical difference between two stellar components. This metric is then applied to a database of high-resolution literature abundance sources to derive a function describing the probability that two stars are of common evolutionary origin. With this cluster probability function, {{it will be possible to}} report a confidence, grounded in empirical observational evidence, with which clusters are detected, independent of the group finding methods. This formulation is also used to probe the role of chemical dimensionality, and that of individual chemical species, on the ability of chemical tagging to differentiate coeval groups of stars.

40|$|The Eastern Hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis) is a large, fully aquatic {{salamander}} that inhabits clean, cool, well-oxygenated {{rivers and}} streams of the Eastern and Midwestern United States. Eastern Hellbenders occupy higher trophic levels within lotic ecosystems and are believed to regulate and maintain aquatic invertebrate communities. However, Eastern Hellbender populations have suffered precipitous declines throughout their range {{over the last three}} to four decades. The Midwestern United States, in particular, have experienced severe Eastern Hellbender population declines. In Indiana, recent empirical data indicate Eastern Hellbender densities are much lower than historical estimates and that the population consists of older adults with little to no spatial overlap. ^ State and federal agencies are now focusing on captive-rearing and translocation efforts for juvenile and adult Eastern Hellbenders to supplement existing populations. To track the success of these efforts, individuals are often marked with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. This ensures that individuals can be identified during surveys to monitor populations. However, traditional survey methods can damage habitat, especially nesting habitat, which can cause abandonment. I sought to: 1) determine the efficacy of using a PIT tag scanner to detect marked Eastern Hellbenders under limestone boulders, 2) compare the effectiveness of PIT <b>tag</b> <b>surveys</b> to radio-telemetry and rock-lifting and snorkeling surveys, and 3) estimate survival rates using a known-fates model to evaluate the efficacy of translocating captive-reared juvenile and wild adult Eastern Hellbenders. Specifically, I wanted to estimate survival rates, determine whether survival rates were significantly different between resident adults and translocated adults, and relate potential explanatory variables to the survival rates. ^ Rock thickness detection tests revealed the PIT tag reader and antenna could detect a 23. 0 mm PIT tag under rocks nearly twice as thick (i. e., 35. 6 cm versus 19. 2 cm) compared to a 12. 5 mm PIT <b>tag.</b> Detectability <b>surveys</b> conducted by naïve surveyors exhibited considerable variation in detection and CPUE. The duration of radio-telemetry was 1. 9 person-hours and resulted in 100. 0 % detection and a catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9. 6 Eastern Hellbenders/person-hour. The duration of PIT tag scanning was 5. 3 person-hours and resulted in 33. 3 % detection and a CPUE of 1. 1 Eastern Hellbenders/person-hour. The duration of rock-lifting and snorkel sampling was 51. 5 person-hours and resulted in 38. 9 % detection and a CPUE of 0. 1 Eastern Hellbenders/person-hour. Radio-telemetry detection was higher than both PIT tag scanning and rock-lifting and snorkel <b>surveys.</b> PIT <b>tag</b> scanning detection was comparable to rock-lifting and snorkel sampling, but was an order of magnitude more efficient in CPUE. ^ Cox proportional hazard models indicated differential survival rates when all 42 individuals were included in the analysis, age class was the only significant explanatory variable (i. e., adults had higher survival). Survival rates did not vary depending on resident status or site location. The overall survival rate was 0. 60 and ranged from 0. 23 (juveniles) to 0. 82 (adult males). Adult male Eastern Hellbenders had higher annual survival than adult females (0. 82 vs. 0. 65), although the difference in survival rates was not statistically significant. There {{were no significant differences in}} survival rates between resident adults and translocated adults at either study site. This study: 1) demonstrates the effectiveness and potential utility of PIT <b>tag</b> technology for <b>surveying</b> and monitoring marked Eastern Hellbenders in a less invasive manner than traditional survey methods, 2) provides baseline survival data for captive-reared juvenile Eastern Hellbenders released in Indiana, and 3) emphasizes the importance of translocations in herpetofauna conservation and management. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{artificial}} gravel augmentation {{of river}} channels is increasingly {{being used to}} mitigate the adverse effects of river regulation and sediment starvation. A systematic framework for designing and assessing such gravel augmentations is still lacking, notably on large rivers. Monitoring is required to quantify the movement of augmented gravel, measure bedform changes, assess potential habitat enhancement, and reduce the uncertainty in sediment management. Here we present {{the results of an}} experiment conducted in the Rhine River (French and German border). In 2010, 23 000 m 3 of sediments (approximately the mean annual bedload transport capacity) were supplied in a by-passed reach downstream of the Kembs dam to test the feasibility of enhancing sediment transport and bedform changes. A 620 -m-long and 12 -m-wide gravel deposit was created 8 km downstream from the dam. Monitoring included topo-bathymetric surveys, radio-frequency particle tracking using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, bed grain size measurement, and airborne imagery. Six surveys performed since 2009 have been described (before and after gravel augmentation, and after Q 2 and Q 15 floods). The key findings are that (i) the augmented gravel was partially dispersed by the first flood event of December 2010 (Q 1); (ii) PIT tags were found up to 3200 m downstream of the gravel augmentation site after four years, but the effects of gravel augmentation could not be clearly distinguished from the effects of floods and internal remobilization on more than 3500 m downstream; (iii) linear and log-linear relationships linking bedload transport, particle mobility, and grain size were established; and (iv) combined bathymetry and PIT <b>tag</b> <b>surveys</b> were useful for evaluating potential environmental risks and the first morpho-ecological responses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This article compares {{characteristics}} of physicians who {{have invested in}} health care business (joint ventures) to {{characteristics of}} physicians who have not, based on a survey of Florida physicians. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING. In early 1990, a survey was mailed to a stratified random sample of 1, 000 Florida physicians. Half {{were randomly selected from}} lists of joint-ventured physicians who had been identified as owners in a previous study by the Florida Health Care Cost Containment Board. The remaining half were assumed to be non-joint-ventured (although incomplete results from the previous study meant that some of these physicians would be joint ventured as well). We <b>tagged</b> <b>survey</b> variables with additional variables from the same year representing exogenous influences. STUDY DESIGN. The survey was mailed to a stratified random sample of physicians across specialty and geographic area, with half to identified joint-ventured physicians and half to a control group, some of whom were expected to be joint-ventured. Thus, results regarding differences would be understated. Key variables include referring versus nonreferring physician, to shed light on motivation for joint-venturing; clientele served, to see if systematic differences had implications related to access for poor or underserved persons; geographic area, to see if joint-ventures were undertaken to increase access in rural areas; and other practice variables such as size and type of practice. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS. Data from all received surveys were encoded and analyzed using SPSS. Incomplete surveys were also encoded so that all information would be available for possible use. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Results indicate that joint-ventured physicians are more likely than non-joint-ventured physicians to be referring physicians. Also, joint-ventured physicians report serving lower proportions of Medicaid and self-pay (uninsured) patients and higher proportions of Medicare patients. Joint-ventured physicians {{are also more likely to}} practice in urban areas, to practice full time, to be members of larger practices, and to practice in group practices. Further, joint-ventured physicians are more likely to practice in areas with high proportions of Medicare patients. CONCLUSIONS. Policymakers should continue to regard physician joint ventures as problematic, since results of this study indicate that physicians who engage in a joint venture almost always have the ability to refer patients to that joint venture due to the nature of their practices. Results also show that joint ventures are associated with decreased access: that is, they provide care to lower proportions of poor and underserved patients and rural patients than their non-joint ventured counterparts...|$|R
40|$|The project {{examined}} {{whether the}} seasonal {{closure of the}} traditional cod fishing grounds off Greencastle, Co. Donegal, could be an effective alternative management measure. The project was instigated by the local fishing industry and operated in cooperation between industry, the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. The main objectives of the project were to demonstrate the change in yield likely to result from seasonal closure, and, to determine the pattern of movement of cod from the Greencastle fishery. Each winter from 2003 to 2005 the fishery was closed by Statutory Instrument. This was achieved with the voluntary commitment of the local industry. During this period over 13, 000 cod were tagged and released by Marine Institute and BIM staff working aboard chartered fishing vessels. The closure itself provided a significant conservation benefit. During 2000 - 2002 50 % of the Irish catch weight of cod in Division VIa (> 60 % by number) was taken in the winter. The closure will therefore have markedly reduced the fishing mortality on cod that would otherwise have occurred from 2003 to 2005. As the Greencastle codling fishery is a mixed whitefish fishery, any benefits flowing from the closure {{are likely to have}} extended to other whitefish stocks. Growth was extremely variable but averaged around 17 cm per annum for cod at liberty for extended periods. During the winter <b>tagging</b> <b>surveys</b> the repeated recapture of recently tagged cod on the grounds indicated the retention of cod on the grounds during winter. Tagged cod at liberty for extended periods were subsequently recaptured on, or near the Cape grounds. This strong fidelity towards the Cape grounds during winter coupled with high growth rates may mean that a short winter fishing season, with a delayed opening, may yield a similar total weight of codling than the traditional fishery but with the catch of a reduced number of cod. Such schemes may reduce current fishing mortality rates. However, the stock status of Division VIa cod is so poor that a complete closure of the fishery is warranted. It is recommended that continuation of the project be considered as a mechanism for maintaining a closure of most of the Irish fishery, whilst simultaneously improving the quality of data available for stock assessment.

40|$|Abstract Background wFleaBase is a {{database}} {{with the necessary}} infrastructure to curate, archive and share genetic, molecular and functional genomic data and protocols for an emerging model organism, the microcrustacean Daphnia. Commonly known as the water-flea, Daphnia 's ecological merit is unequaled among metazoans, largely because of its sentinel role within freshwater ecosystems and over 200 years of biological investigations. By consequence, the Daphnia Genomics Consortium (DGC) has launched an interdisciplinary research program to create the resources needed to study genes that affect ecological and evolutionary success in natural environments. Discussion These tools include the genome database wFleaBase, which currently contains functions to search and extract information from expressed sequenced <b>tags,</b> genome <b>survey</b> sequences and full genome sequencing projects. This new database is built primarily from core components of the Generic Model Organism Database project, and related bioinformatics tools. Summary Over the coming year, preliminary genetic maps and the nearly complete genomic sequence of Daphnia pulex will be integrated into wFleaBase, including gene predictions and ortholog assignments based on sequence similarities with eukaryote genes of known function. wFleaBase aims to serve a large ecological and evolutionary research community.

Ubiquitin expression is unusual: it is encoded and expressed as multimeric head-to-tail repeats (polyubiquitins) that are post-translationally cleaved into monomers, or fused with ribosomal proteins L 40 and S 27 a. The ubiquitin moiety is removed from these fusion proteins, but is thought {{to act as a}} chaperone in ribosome biogenesis prior to cleavage. Here we show that the chlorarachniophyte algae express several novel ubiquitin fusion proteins. An expressed sequence <b>tag</b> (EST) <b>survey</b> revealed ubiquitin fusions with an unidentified open reading frame (ORF), ribosomal protein P 1 and, most interestingly, actin. Actin is an essential component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and is involved in a variety of cellular processes. In other eukaryotes, actin genes only exist as stand-alone ORFs, but in all chlorarachniophytes examined, actin is always encoded as a ubiquitin fusion protein. The variety of ubiquitin fusion proteins in these organisms raises interesting questions about the evolutionary origins of ubiquitin fusions, as well as their possible biochemical functions in other processes, such as cytoskeletal regulation...|$|R
40|$|Brazil’s {{plans to}} host the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics have {{provoked}} both euphoria and criticism domestically. Some believe that hosting successful games will cement the country’s position as a world power and economic player, but others object to the government’s extravagant spending on lavish stadia while basic social services remain neglected. We must then ask: if Brazil already faced daunting tasks in improving its public programs and increasing development, why did it eagerly vie {{to take on the}} additional burdens of hosting the two largest sporting events in the world? I argue that Brazil has justified hosting with three promises: an economic boost, infrastructural impetus, and “feel-good” effect for Brazilians (for example, national pride and unity). In this paper, I evaluate the claim that Brazilians value the abstract benefits of hosting mega-events enough to justify their high price <b>tags.</b> Original <b>survey</b> data and an analysis of views published in a Brazilian newspaper’s letters to the editor support my hypothesis that Brazilians generally do not value hosting the World Cup and Olympics while more pressing social concerns remain unaddressed. Considering the opaque process of bidding for mega-events, it seems plausible that Brazilian boosters overstated the domestic support for hosting, and that Brazil’s taxpayers will subsidize mostly private gains from the games.

40|$|SummaryCryptomonad algae {{acquired}} their plastids by {{the secondary}} endosymbiotic uptake of a eukaryotic red alga. Several other algal lineages acquired plastids through {{such an event}} [1], but cryptomonads are distinguished by the retention of a relic red algal nucleus, the nucleomorph [2]. The nucleomorph (and its absence in other lineages) can reveal {{a great deal about}} the process and history of endosymbiosis, but only if we know the relationship between cryptomonads and other algae, and this has been controversial. Several recent analyses have suggested a relationship between plastids of cryptomonads and some or all other red alga-containing lineages [3 – 6], but we must also know whether host nuclear genes mirror this relationship to determine the number of endosymbiotic events, and this has not been demonstrated. We have carried out an expressed sequence <b>tag</b> (EST) <b>survey</b> of the cryptomonad Guillardia theta. Phylogenetic analyses of 102 orthologous nucleus-encoded proteins (18, 425 amino acid alignment positions) show a robust sister-group relationship between cryptomonads and the haptophyte algae, which also have a red secondary plastid. This relationship demonstrates that loss of nucleomorphs must have taken place in haptophytes independently of any other red alga-containing lineages and that the ancestor of both already contained a red algal endosymbiont...|$|R
40|$|In {{preparation}} for the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph (HERMES) chemical <b>tagging</b> <b>survey</b> of about a million Galactic FGK stars, we estimate the number of independent dimensions of the space defined by the stellar chemical element abundances [X/Fe]. This leads to a way to study the origin of elements from observed chemical abundances using principal component analysis. We explore abundances in several environments, including solar neighbourhood thin/thick disc stars, halo metal-poor stars, globular clusters, open clusters, the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. By studying solar-neighbourhood stars, we confirm the universality of the r-process that tends to produce [neutron-capture elements/Fe] in a constant ratio. We find that, especially at low metallicity, the production of r-process elements {{is likely to be}} associated with the production of alpha-elements. This may support the core-collapse supernovae as the r-process site. We also verify the overabundances of light s-process elements at low metallicity, and find that the relative contribution decreases at higher metallicity, which suggests that this lighter elements primary process may be associated with massive stars. We also verify the contribution from the s-process in low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars at high metallicity. Our analysis reveals two types of core-collapse supernovae: one produces mainly alpha-elements, the other produces both alpha-elements and Fe-peak elements with a large enhancement of heavy Fe-peak elements which may be the contribution from hypernovae. Excluding light elements that may be subject to internal mixing, K and Cu, we find that the [X/Fe] chemical abundance space in the solar neighbourhood has about six independent dimensions both at low metallicity (- 3. 5 less than or similar to [Fe/H] less than or similar to - 2) and high metallicity ([Fe/H] greater than or similar to - 1). However the dimensions come from very different origins in these two cases. The extra contribution from low-mass AGB stars at high metallicity compensates the dimension loss due to the homogenization of the core-collapse supernovae ejecta. Including the extra dimensions from [Fe/H], K, Cu and the light elements, the number of independent dimensions of the [X/Fe]+[Fe/H] chemical space in the solar neighbourhood for HERMES is about eight to nine. Comparing fainter galaxies and the solar neighbourhood, we find that the chemical space for fainter galaxies such as Fornax and the Large Magellanic Cloud has a higher dimensionality. This is consistent with the slower star formation history of fainter galaxies. We find that open clusters have more chemical space dimensions than the nearby metal-rich field stars. This suggests that a survey of stars in a larger Galactic volume than the solar neighbourhood may show about one more dimension in its chemical abundance space...|$|R
40|$|Many online {{communities}} use tags – community selected words or phrases – {{to help people}} find what they desire. The quality of tags varies widely, from tags that capture a key dimension of an entity to those that are profane, useless, or unintelligible. Tagging systems must often select a subset of available tags to display to users due to limited screen space. Because users often spread tags they have seen, selecting good tags not only improves an individual’s view of tags, it also encourages them to create better tags in the future. We explore implicit (behavioral) and explicit (rating) mechanisms for determining tag quality. Based on 102, 056 <b>tag</b> ratings and <b>survey</b> responses collected from 1, 039 users over 100 days, we offer simple suggestions to designers of {{online communities}} {{to improve the quality}} of tags seen by their users...|$|R
40|$|Plastids are the organelles {{of plants}} and algae that house {{photosynthesis}} and many other biochemical pathways. Plastids contain a small genome, but most of their proteins are encoded in the nucleus and posttranslationally targeted to the organelle. When plants and algae lose photosynthesis, they virtually always retain a highly reduced “cryptic ” plastid. Cryptic plastids are known to exist in many organisms, although their metabolic functions are seldom understood. The best-studied example of a cryptic plastid is from the intracellular malaria parasite, Plasmodium, which has retained a plastid for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, isoprenoids, and heme {{by the use of}} plastid-targeted enzymes. To study a completely independent transformation of a photosynthetic plastid to a cryptic plastid in another alga-turned-parasite, we conducted an expressed sequence <b>tag</b> (EST) <b>survey</b> of Helicosporidium. This parasite has recently been recognized as a highly derived green alga. Based on phylogenetic relationships to other plastid homologues and the presence of N-terminal transit peptides, we have identified 20 putatively plastid-targeted enzymes that are involved {{in a wide variety of}} metabolic pathways. Overall, the metabolic diversity of the Helicosporidium cryptic plastid exceeds that of the Plasmodium plastid, as it includes representatives of most of the pathways known to operate in the Plasmodium plastid as well as many others. In particular, several amino acid biosynthetic pathways have been retained, including the leucine biosynthesis pathway, which was only recently recognized in plant plastids...|$|R

Recent CPUE, <b>tagging</b> and aerial <b>survey</b> {{results indicate that}} recruitment continued to be low for the 1993 to 1995 cohorts. Estimates of spawning stock biomass indicate that the current SSB is well below the 1980 level (the target minimum rebuilding level established by the CCSBT). Any indications of a recent increase in the VPA estimates of SSB are predicated on an assumption that the age of maturity is 8. Recent studies and sampling from the spawning grounds are inconsistent with such an assumption. VPA estimates, which suggest {{that there may have}} been some increase in recent years if age 8 maturity is assumed, are not consistent with nominal or standardized CPUE trends.
