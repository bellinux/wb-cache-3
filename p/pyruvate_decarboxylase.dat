In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of Candida utilis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme <b>pyruvate</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> (such as found in beets and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor l-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC).

40|$|The {{industrial}} production of penicillin G by Penicillium chrysogenum requires the supplementation {{of the growth}} medium with the side chain precursor phenylacetate. The growth of P. chrysogenum with phenylalanine as the sole nitrogen source resulted in the extracellular production of phenylacetate and penicillin G. To analyze this natural pathway for penicillin G production, chemostat cultures were switched to [U- 13 C]phenylalanine as the nitrogen source. The quantification and modeling {{of the dynamics of}} labeled metabolites indicated that phenylalanine was (i) incorporated in nascent protein, (ii) transaminated to phenylpyruvate and further converted by oxidation or by decarboxylation, and (iii) hydroxylated to tyrosine and subsequently metabolized via the homogentisate pathway. The involvement of the homogentisate pathway was supported by the comparative transcriptome analysis of P. chrysogenum cultures grown with phenylalanine and with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 as the nitrogen source. This transcriptome analysis also enabled the identification of two putative 2 -oxo acid decarboxylase genes (Pc 13 g 9300 and Pc 18 g 01490). cDNAs of both genes were cloned and expressed in the 2 -oxo-acid-decarboxylase-free Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.

Glucose was catabolized to phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) via the Emden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway. PEP was converted to either pyruvate (via pyruvate kinase) or oxalacetate (via PEP carboxykinase). Pyruvate was reduced to L-lactate via a NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenase or oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and CO 2 by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Acetyl-CoA was apparently converted in a single enzymatic step to acetate and CoA, with concomitant formation of 1 molecule of ATP; since acetyl-phosphate was not an intermediate, the enzyme catalyzing this reaction was identified as acetate thiokinase. Oxalacetate was converted to succinate via the activities of malate dehydrogenase, fumarase and a membrane-bound fumarate reductase. Succinate was then excreted or decarboxylated to propionate via a membrane-bound methylmalonyl-CoA <b>decarboxylase.</b> <b>Pyruvate</b> kinase was inhibited by Pi and activated by fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate.

Several potential sites for energy conservation exist in S. ruminantium HD 4, including pyruvate kinase, acetate thiokinase, PEP carboxykinase, fumarate reductase, and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase.
