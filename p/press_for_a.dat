5|$|Charlton {{received}} treatment midway {{throughout the}} second half after he ran into a photographer chasing an over-hit pass. Leeds had an attack soon after, but after Storrie received the ball from Bremner, his pass went behind the Liverpool goal. Liverpool had more chances, but St. John slipped at the back post when a Callaghan cross was diverted towards him. Then Thompson saw a shot saved by Sprake. Leeds reacted to the increased pressure, by moving Bremner to centre-forward and Giles reverting to midfield. Johanneson switched positions with Storrie, moving from the right to the left. Liverpool continued to <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> winner as the half drew to a close, but Thompson and Strong saw shots saved by Sprake.

Johnson's victory over the reigning world champion, Canadian Tommy Burns, in Sydney, Australia, came after stalking Burns {{around the world for}} two years and taunting him in the <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> match. It is believed that Burns had agreed to fight Johnson only after promotors guaranteed him $30,000. The fight lasted fourteen rounds before being stopped by the police in front of over 20,000 spectators. The title was awarded to Johnson on a referee's decision.|$|E

The polarities which divided Ireland during the Anglo-Irish War and Irish Civil War increasingly sidelined Gwynn's brand of moderate cultural nationalism. Although he supported the newly emergent nation he equally condemned some of the excesses, such as the burning of houses belonging to Free State senators.|$|E

25|$|Hearing that UFO bassist Pete Way was keen {{to leave}} that band, the two met and decided their new band's name would be an {{amalgamation}} of their own two names, resulting in Fastway. They advertised in the music <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drummer and a vocalist. Meanwhile, a rehearsal was organised for which The Clash drummer, Topper Headon, filled in on drums. Headon was doing this as a favour so that Clarke and Way could rehearse. The ads began showing positive results, cassettes from potential band members arrived; one of these was from a young, Dublin-based singer {{by the name of}} Dave King. Clarke was impressed with his voice and financed a trip to London for King and, after an audition together, he became the Fastway vocalist. Ex-Humble Pie member, Jerry Shirley, became the drummer.|$|E
25|$|Discussion of {{this idea}} began {{to take place in}} earnest {{in the pages of the}} pioneer radical {{publication}} The Coming Nation, published by J.A. Wayland, forerunner of the popular Kansas weekly The Appeal to Reason. By the fall of 1895, a concrete proposal had begun to take shape, advanced by Maine resident Norman Wallace Lermond – a disciple of Edward Bellamy and Laurence Gronlund. Lermond called for the formation of a membership organization to carry on such a colonization program in an unnamed Western state, and he issued a call in the pages of the socialist <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> convention to establish a new organization called the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth (BCC). This call was endorsed by an impressive list of 143 of the nation's leading social reformers, including the journalist Henry Demarest Lloyd, union organizer Eugene V. Debs, and religious leader Rev.

25|$|As {{the tension}} {{grew in the}} run-up to World War I, Morel was again {{sympathetic}} to Germany, disinclined to stand by Belgium under German pressure, and opposed to the United Kingdom and France getting involved in war. He campaigned for neutrality but on the outbreak of war accepted that the fight was lost, and with Charles Trevelyan, Norman Angell and Ramsay MacDonald, formed the Union of Democratic Control to <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more responsive foreign policy (he also resigned his candidature at this time). He was Secretary of the UDC until his death. The main demands of the UDC were: (1) that in future to prevent secret diplomacy there should be parliamentary control over foreign policy; (2) there should be negotiations after the war with other democratic European countries in an attempt to form an organisation to help prevent future conflicts; (3) {{that at the end of}} the war the terms of peace should neither humiliate the defeated nation nor artificially rearrange frontiers, as this might provide a cause for future wars.|$|E
25|$|He {{joined the}} staff of Surrey in 1930, and made his {{first-class}} debut the following season. However, he did not play in {{a substantial number of}} matches until 1934, when he made 598 runs with an average of 31.47. In 1935 he was a regular member of the side and passed 1,000 runs for the first time, and scored his first three hundreds. The following year he came right to the fore. He made 2,129 runs at an average of 53.22. He was selected for the Players at Lord's, played in two Test trials and was selected for two Tests against India. He was selected for the following winter's tour of Australia, but missed six weeks through a broken bone in his right hand, and thus missed his chance to <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Test place. During the 1937 season, he switched to opening the batting for Surrey, and occupied that batting position for most of the remainder of his career. He continued to score heavily, and was selected for a Test trial in 1938, in which he made a hundred, but even so could not force his way into the Test team.|$|E
25|$|Now the {{unexpected}} number one {{contender for the}} heavyweight crown held by Jim Braddock, Schmeling looked forward to his chance to regain the title as first Heavyweight ever, scheduled for that September. The fight was postponed, however, when Braddock injured his hand in training. Rumors existed that the fight's organizers were stalling, afraid of the negative publicity that would be generated over a perceived Nazi getting {{a shot at the}} world's title. When it was confirmed that Braddock's managers were in talks with the Louis camp, the New York Commission officially released an order for Braddock to fight Schmeling for the title. Any other fight, with Louis or otherwise, would not be recognized by New York as being for the championship. The Madison Square Garden Corporation, the largest promotional company in the sport at the time, even attempted to get a legal injunction against a Braddock-Louis fight (Louis was not on their roster). Nonetheless, in February 1937, Schmeling received the news that the champion had indeed signed to defend his championship against Louis. A furious Schmeling protested, but to no avail, and he was forced to watch from ringside as Louis knocked Braddock out and gained the championship. Sorely disappointed and convinced that he would never receive his chance at redemption, Schmeling fought just once more in America, an eighth-round knockout of future contender Harry Thomas, before returning to Germany. In his native land, Schmeling was regarded as a hero and promoted by the Nazi propaganda machine as a perfect example of German supremacy over {{the rest of the world}} by virtue of his defeat of the current champion, Louis. The government ordered parades and rallies in his honor. He became a friend to Hitler and other powerful figures in the government and also a popular subject of newspaper articles and films. He continued to <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> chance at a rematch with Louis and in the meantime padded his record against overmatched fighters Ben Foord and Steve Dudas.|$|E

In Melbourne, Australia, he left the ship to continue fund-raising, while Terra Nova proceeded to New Zealand. Waiting for Scott in Melbourne was a telegram from Amundsen, informing Scott that the Norwegian was [...] "proceeding south"; the telegram was the first indication to Scott {{that he was in}} a race. When asked by the <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reaction, Scott replied that his plans would not change and that he would not sacrifice the expedition's scientific goals to win the race to the Pole. In his diary he wrote that Amundsen had a fair chance of success, and perhaps deserved his luck if he got through.|$|E
500|$|The {{losses on}} both sides were horrific, and while Soult had failed in his aim of {{relieving}} the siege of Badajoz, neither side had demonstrated the will to <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> conclusive victory. [...] Allied losses amounted to 5,916: 4,159 British, 389 Portuguese and 1,368 Spaniards. In his despatch of 21 May 1811, Soult estimated British casualties as 5,000 with 800 to 1,000 captured; Spanish as 2,000 with 1,100 captured; Portuguese as 700 to 800. [...] French casualties are harder to ascertain—Soult initially declared 2,800 in his dispatch to Napoleon, but the official figure drawn up on 6 July revised that number upward to 5,936. British historians dispute this, comparing Soult's figure of 241 officer casualties with regimental returns that total 362. Sir Charles Oman extrapolated this figure {{to come up with}} the total number of French casualties, which he puts at approximately 7,900. In comparison, the French historians Belmas and Lapène place Soult's losses at 7,000. Some of the British dead from the battle, including Major General Daniel Hoghton, are buried in the British Cemetery, Elvas.|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson {{had formed}} a close {{relationship}} with Morrison, personally and politically, before and during their wartime ministerial association. She thought that he, rather than the sedate Attlee, should be leading the Labour Party, and had promoted his leadership credentials in 1935 and 1939. In 1945, Morrison [...] informed Attlee that he intended to seek the leadership [...] "in the interests of party unity". In the general election held in July 1945 Labour won a landslide victory, with 393 seats against the Conservatives' 213. This did not prevent Wilkinson and others from continuing to <b>press</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change of leader, but Attlee forestalled further action by quickly accepting the king's invitation to form a government. He showed no resentment towards either Morrison or Wilkinson; the former was appointed Lord President of the Council and deputy prime minister, while Wilkinson was made Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet. Emmanuel Shinwell, who became Minister of Fuel and Power, later commented that [...] "it is not bad tactics to make one's enemies one's servants".|$|E
