50|$|The San Jose scale derives {{its popular}} name from San Jose, California where Comstock {{discovered}} and named it in 1881. It {{has been considered}} the most <b>pernicious</b> <b>scale</b> insect in the United States. It was probably introduced at San Jose about 1870 on trees imported from China by James Lick. By 1890 it had spread over {{the greater part of}} California, but was not recognized east of the Rocky Mountains until August, 1893, when it was found by Howard on a pear received from Charlottesville, Virginia. Soon afterward it was discovered that infested stock had been brought from California in 1887 or 1888 by two New Jersey nurseries and distributed widely. By 1895 the pest had become established in many nurseries and orchards in the majority of the Eastern States. Marlatt made entomological investigations in China, Japan, and Java in 1901-02. He introduced the ladybird to the United States in order to control the San Jose scale.|$|E
