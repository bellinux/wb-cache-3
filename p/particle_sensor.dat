40|$|A {{concept for}} {{buoyancy}} control and magnetic position detection {{has been developed}} {{for the improvement of}} instrumented flow-following <b>sensor</b> <b>particles.</b> The <b>sensor</b> <b>particles</b> are used for investigation of hydrodynamic and biochemical processes in large-scale vessels such as biogas fermenters, bioreactors and aerated sludge basins. Neutral buoyancy of the <b>sensor</b> <b>particles</b> is required for tracing of the fluid flows. Buoyancy control is performed by adjustment of the sensor particles' volume, which is altered by an integrated piston. A miniaturized linear actuator, namely a stepper motor with linear transmission, is operated by a microcontroller to drive the piston. The buoyancy control unit enables accurate automated taring of the <b>sensor</b> <b>particles</b> in the stagnant process fluid to achieve neutral buoyancy. Therefore, the measured vertical position of the <b>sensor</b> <b>particle</b> {{as a function of the}} hydrostatic pressure is used as feedback. It has an incremental density change of 0. 0136  % as compared to water and a residual drift velocity of approximately 3. 6  [*]×[*]  10 − 3  m s − 1. Furthermore, a minimum density of 926  kg m − 3 can be set by full extension of the piston, which allows floating of the <b>sensor</b> <b>particles</b> after a defined event, namely critical charge of battery, full data storage or the end of a fixed time cycle. Thus, recovery of the <b>sensor</b> <b>particles</b> can proceed easily from the fluid level. The <b>sensor</b> <b>particles</b> with a buoyancy control unit are tested for depths up to 15  m. Also, detection of a local magnetic position marker by the <b>sensor</b> <b>particles</b> has been implemented to enhance movement tracking. It was tested in a lab-scale biogas digester and was used for estimation of the liquid circulation time distribution and Peclét number to describe the macro-flow...|$|R

40|$|Scanning probe methods with {{decorated}} tips is a {{new trend}} in surface study. An application of complex probe like a tip with an attached single molecule or single atom allows to get new details about the surface properties. It {{has been shown that}} the scanning tunnelling hydrogen microscopy (STHM) approach can reach atomic scale resolution and reveals intermolecular interactions. Because of the complexity, this new rapidly developing area is not yet fully understood. In this work systematic studies of tips decorated with Xe, H 2, D 2, CO, CH 4 was carried out. The tip with a single atom or a single molecule creates a single <b>particle</b> <b>sensor</b> that simultaneously performs the function of an atomicscale force sensor and a signal transducer, which couples the short-range force acting on the tip to the tunnelling conductance of the junction. In some cases the sensor-transducer function of the decorated STM tips can be quantitatively calibrated. Differences in the performance of the studied sensors suggest that the sensor functionality can be modified by tuning the interaction between the sensor particle and the STM tip. Based on forcefield calculations, theoretical analysis of the single <b>particle</b> <b>sensor</b> shows an interrelation between the relative movement of the particle on the tip and contrast structure of the surface images...|$|E

40|$|The {{disturbances}} of {{very low}} and low frequency signals {{in the lower}} mid-latitude ionosphere caused by magnetic storms, proton bursts and relativistic electron fluxes are investigated {{on the basis of}} VLF–LF measurements obtained in the Far East and European networks.

The anomalies with negative amplitude were registered during the main and recovery phases for several magnetic storms (mainly for three northernmost paths). The correlation between VLF–LF signals and geomagnetic activity is rather weak even for these paths (≈ 12 – 18 %).
