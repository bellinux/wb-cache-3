50|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> (Antrozous pallidus) {{was first}} {{described}} in 1856 and first placed {{in its own}} genus, Antrozous, in 1862. Several suggestions were made early on about its relationships, including that of Wilhelm Peters in 1865, who placed it in the family Vespertilionidae and considered it {{to be related to}} the Australian Nyctophilus. Others suggested a relationship with the vespertilionid genus Plecotus or the Phyllostomidae. In 1897, Gerrit S. Miller described a subfamily Antrozoinae for the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat,</b> but ten years later chose to place Nyctophilus and Antrozous together in a subfamily Nyctophilinae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> {{occurs in}} {{northern}} Mexico, the western United States (east to Kansas and Texas), and marginally southwestern Canada (British Columbia).

In addition, in September, melatonin-treated animals weighed more than untreated animals. Melatonin simulates the effects of short days on testicular spermato-genesis and epididymal sperm storage in this species. We suggest that sensitivity to photoperiod in <b>pallid</b> <b>bats,</b> as in several other mammals, is mediated by the pineal gland...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pallid</b> <b>bats</b> are {{typically}} found in arid or semi-arid habitats, often in mountainous or rocky areas near water. They {{are also found}} over open, sparsely vegetated grasslands. During the day time, <b>pallid</b> <b>bats</b> typically roost in cracks and crevices, which may include tile roofs, exfoliating bark of trees, or rocky outcrops. During the night, this species will often use a night roost that is closer to their foraging grounds than their day roost. A night roost is usually less protected than a day roost; open porches {{may be used as}} night roosts by this species. In the winter time, this species may dip into shallow bouts of torpor, often in buildings, caves, or cracks in rocks.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} in previous studies that Hemprich long-eared bats (Otonycteris hemprichii) are frequently stung during predation attacks on scorpions.

Here, we examine the role of bat vision in predator-prey interactions between a similar <b>bat</b> species, <b>pallid</b> <b>bats</b> (Antrozous pallidus) and northern scorpions (Paruroctonus boreus). We address the question: do bats use visual information provided by moonlight to plan attacks on dangerous prey? We predicted that under moonlit conditions, <b>pallid</b> <b>bats</b> would plan attacks on scorpion prey, therefore, being stung less often.

Although it has in the past been placed in its own subfamily (Antrozoinae) or even family (Antrozoidae), it is now considered part of the subfamily Vespertilioninae and the tribe Antrozoini.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> (Antrozous pallidus) is characterised by slate grey wings, {{cream or}} pale {{yellow-brown}} fur on its body, tan-coloured ears, and eyes {{larger than those}} of most bats. Its range in Canada is restricted to the Okanagan Valley in southern British Columbia, as its preferred habitat is open, arid and semi-arid terrain with sparse vegetation or cultivated fields or dry grasslands, and roost in the crevices of cliffs. It is a threatened species in Canada, where its population is [...] "unknown but it likely is quite small", {{and is on the}} list of wildlife species at risk maintained by Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) via Environment Canada. The primary risk to the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> in Canada is [...] "the harsh climate and naturally low availability of adequate habitat" [...] and continued habitat loss from development, as well as pesticide use in fruit-growing areas within their habitats; they eat insects including beetles, grasshoppers, and moths. It is protected by the Species at Risk Act (SARA) on federally-owned lands, including Vaseux-Bighorn National Wildlife Area and nearby First Nations lands, and is also protected by the British Columbia Wildlife Act.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pallid</b> <b>bats</b> (Antrozous pallidus) are unusual among vespertilionids (the {{most common}} and diverse family of bats in {{temperate}} regions of the world) in that they often emit a loud, partially audible social call several times in rapid succession while in flight. This social call appears {{to function as a}} contact call in that it is frequently given when bats return from foraging and perform circular flights before entering a crevice roost. In this dissertation, I examine the functional and social significance of this calling behavior by free-flying <b>pallid</b> <b>bats</b> in central Oregon using a combination of observations, audio recordings, audio playbacks, acoustic analysis, and genetic marker analysis. In chapter 1, I found that bats respond to the calls of conspecifics and that call structure is unique to individuals and stable through time, which makes these calls well-suited for roostmate recognition. In chapter 2, I found significant genetic structure among colonies based on sequence variation at the mitochondrial DNA control region but very little structure among colonies for nuclear microsatellites. These data are indicative of female philopatry with male-mediated gene flow and highlight the potential that calls may function in the maintenance of multigenerational social groups. Finally, in chapter 3, I utilized genetic markers to investigate relatedness among individuals sharing a roost {{and the extent to which}} call variation encodes information about relatedness to examine whether calling behavior may assist in maintaining social bonds as individuals switch roosts. I found that while average colony relatedness was low, bats roost with a greater proportion of relatives than expected by chance. In addition, I found that contact call structure encodes information about matrilineal relationship and relatedness as well as individual identity. Overall, these results suggest that calling behavior in <b>pallid</b> <b>bats</b> is important in maintaining social structure at maternity roosts. Given the high roost lability and nocturnal environment of <b>pallid</b> <b>bats,</b> this study offers important insight into how animals in fluid societies mediate interactions with groupmates using acoustic signals...|$|R

Accurately predicting the potential occurrence of a species is fundamental to management activities that involve large areas where sampling is difficult due to logistical or financial constraints. During the summers of 2001 - 2003 mist nets were used to capture bats in Whiskeytown National Recreation Area (WNRA), Lassen Volcanic National Park (LVNP), and Lassen National Forest (LNF) in northern California. I used logistic regression and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIQ to model species distributions.

50|$|Van Gelder's bat was {{described}} in 1959 as Antrozous (Bauerus) dubiaquercus; subsequently, the species has been placed in its own genus, Bauerus, while others have retained it in Antrozous with its close relative, the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat,</b> with the current consensus being toward placing them in separate genera. In 1970, Karl F. Koopman and J. Knox Jones recognized a tribe Antrozoini (comprising only Antrozous and Bauerus), which they still placed within Nyctophilinae. In a separate 1970 paper, however, Koopman questioned the affinities between the North American antrozoines and the Australasian Nyctophilus {{on the basis of}} biogeography. The next year, Ronald Pine and colleagues further questioned this relationship on the basis of baculum (penis bone) characters, although they cautioned that more penes of Bauerus needed to be studied.

40|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> (Antrozous pallidus), a {{gleaning}} bat {{found in}} the western United States and Mexico, hunts {{a wide variety of}} ground-dwelling prey, including scorpions. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> is resistant to scorpion venom, but no systematic study has been performed. Here we show with behavioral measures and direct injection of venom that the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> is resistant to venom of the Arizona bark scorpion, Centruroides sculpturatus. Our results show that the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> is stung multiple times during a hunt without any noticeable effect on behavior. In addition, direct injection of venom at mouse LD 50 concentrations (1. 5 mg/kg) has no effect on bat behavior. At the highest concentration tested (10 mg/kg), three out of four bats showed no effects. One of the four bats showed a transient effect suggesting that additional studies are required to identify potential regional variation in venom tolerance. Scorpion venom is a cocktail of toxins, some of which activate voltage-gated sodium ion channels, causing intense pain. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) contain nociceptive neurons and are principal targets of scorpion venom toxins. To understand if mutations in specific ion channels contribute to venom resistance, a <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> DRG transcriptome was generated. As sodium channels are a major target of scorpion venom, we identified amino acid substitutions present in the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> that may lead to venom resistance. Some of these substitutions are similar to corresponding amino acids in sodium channel isoforms responsible for reduced venom binding activity. The substitution found previously in the grasshopper mouse providing venom resistance to the bark scorpion is not present in the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat,</b> indicating a potentially novel mechanism for venom resistance in the bat that remains to be identified. Taken together, these results indicate that the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> is resistant to venom of the bark scorpion and altered sodium ion channel function may partly underlie such resistance...|$|E
40|$|A {{consistent}} organizational {{feature of}} auditory cortex is a clustered representation of binaural properties. Here we address two questions. What is the intrinsic organization of binaural clusters {{and to what}} extent does intracortical processing contribute to binaural representation. We address these issues in the auditory cortex of the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat.</b> The <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> listens to prey-generated noise transients to localize and hunt terrestrial prey. As in other species studied, binaural clusters are present in the auditory cortex of the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat.</b> One cluster contains neurons that require binaural stimulation to be maximally excited, and are commonly termed predominantly binaural (PB) neurons. These neurons do not respond to monaural stimulation of either ear but show a peaked sensitivity to interaural intensity differences (IID) centered near 0 dB IID. We show that the peak IID varies systematically within this cluster. The peak IID is also correlated with the best frequency (BF) of neurons within this cluster. In addition, the IID selectivity of PB neurons is shaped by intracortical GABAergic input. Iontophoresis of GABAA receptor antagonists on PB neurons converts a majority of them to binaurally inhibited (EI) neurons that respond best to sounds favoring the contralateral ear. These data indicate that the cortex does not simply inherit binaural properties from lower levels but instead sharpens them locally through intracortical inhibition. The IID selectivity of the PB cluster indicates that the <b>pallid</b> <b>bat</b> cortex contains an increased representation of the frontal space that may underlie increased localization accuracy in this region...|$|E
