An {{amendment to the constitution}} of the United States must be ratified by three-quarters of either the state legislatures, or of constitutional conventions specially elected in each of the states, before it can come into effect. In referendums to amend the constitutions of Australia and Switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole, but also by separate majorities in each of a majority of the states or cantons. In Australia, this latter requirement is known as a double majority.|$|R

40|$|The South African Constitution {{establishes}} <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> amending any of {{its provisions}} and empowers the Constitutional Court {{to decide on the}} constitutionality of these amendments. Whether or not the Constitution imposes judicially enforceable substantive limits on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution is not clear. This article argues that the Constitution does not impose substantive limits on the power of constitutional amendment. However, the fact that the Constitution establishes different <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> the <b>amendment</b> of different sections creates an implied hierarchy within the Constitution. This implied hierarchy enables the Constitutional Court to scrutinise the substance of constitutional amendments to determine compliance with the proper <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> each <b>amendment.</b> Nevertheless, once the court ascertains that an amendment has been enacted by following the appropriate procedure, the amendment cannot be attacked on substantive grounds. Contrary to the views of some scholars, the Constitution does not recognise the ‘basic structure’ doctrine. It does not recognise extra-constitutional limits on the power of constitutional amendment. The principal purpose of the explicit authorisation of the Constitutional Court to decide on the constitutionality of amendments is to affirm its exclusive jurisdiction in relation to these amendments.

25|$|Chua J. {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the basic features doctrine in Singapore. He reasoned that a constitutional amendment, being part of the Constitution itself, can never be invalid if the <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>amendment</b> is complied with. If the framers of the Constitution had intended limitations on the power of amendment, they would have expressly provided for such limitations. Furthermore, if the courts were allowed to impose limitations on the legislative power to amend, they would be usurping Parliament's legislative function, contrary to Article 58. In any case, Chua J. did not agree that Parliament had violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The subjective test reinserted into the ISA had served the national security interests of Singapore for a long time. The amendments merely reaffirmed the law which the courts had followed since Lee Mau Seng, and ensured that the legislative intent behind the ISA was not disregarded. Moreover, nothing in the amendments was unrelated to national security. A reaffirmation of the original principles could not be said to be objectionable as usurping judicial power or being contrary to the rule of law. The rule of law had not been abolished by legislation, as Parliament had done no more than to enact the rule of law relating to judicial review. The legislation did not order the court to decide a case in a particular way or to dismiss it – the court was left to deal with the case {{on the basis of the}} amendments.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Thorough {{knowledge}} of the regulatory requirements is a challenging prerequisite for conducting multinational clinical studies in Europe given their complexity and heterogeneity in regulation and perception across the EU member states. Methods In order to summarise the current situation {{in relation to the}} wide spectrum of clinical research, the European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) developed a multinational survey in ten European countries. However a lack of common classification framework for major categories of clinical research was identified, and therefore reaching an agreement on a common classification was the initial step {{in the development of the}} survey. Results The ECRIN transnational working group on regulation, composed of experts in the field of clinical research from ten European countries, defined seven major categories of clinical research that seem relevant from both the regulatory and the scientific points of view, and correspond to congruent definitions in all countries: clinical trials on medicinal products; clinical trials on medical devices; other therapeutic trials (including surgery trials, transplantation trials, transfusion trials, trials with cell therapy, etc.); diagnostic studies; clinical research on nutrition; other interventional clinical research (including trials in complementary and alternative medicine, trials with collection of blood or tissue samples, physiology studies, etc.); and epidemiology studies. Our classification was essential to develop a survey focused on protocol submission to ethics committees and competent authorities, <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>amendments,</b> requirements <b>for</b> sponsor and insurance, and adverse event reporting following five main phases: drafting, consensus, data collection, validation, and finalising. Conclusion The list of clinical research categories as used for the survey could serve as a contribution to the, much needed, task of harmonisation and simplification of the regulatory requirements for clinical research in Europe. </p...|$|R

This foresaw that amendments would first be approved by both houses of the Oireachtas, then submitted to a referendum, and finally receive the royal assent from the Governor General.

As noted above it was originally provided that any amendments that violated the Anglo-Irish Treaty would be inadmissible, but this sole restriction was removed in 1933.|$|R

50|$|Canada dates {{its history}} as a country to the British North America Act, 1867, which came into effect on July 1, 1867. However, Canada was not {{established}} as fully independent, since the United Kingdom retained legislative control over Canada and full control over Canadian foreign policy. Canada {{did not have any}} foreign embassies until its first one was established in Washington, D.C., in 1931. Until 1949, changes to the British North America Acts could be made only by the British parliament. The British North America (No. 2) Act, 1949, gave the Parliament of Canada the power to make limited constitutional amendments, but full Canadian control over the constitution was not achieved until the passage of the Canada Act 1982.

A hearing was scheduled for 10 September 2009; if the court ruled against the complaint at that hearing, elections would be held as planned, but politicians agreed that they would rather change the constitution to simplify the procedure of calling early elections, and using the new provisions, the election would be held with a delay of at most one month, regardless of the court's decision, most likely on 6-7 November.However, the Constitutional Court viewed the constitutional <b>amendment</b> calling <b>for</b> one-off early elections as a retroactive decision in violation of the existing constitutional procedures regulating early elections, and struck down the act on the grounds that it violated the <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> constitutional <b>amendments,</b> the right to vote, and the inalienable principle of a law-abiding state.As the Court ruled the election date invalid, the laws (a constitutional amendment and a law shortening election deadlines) were passed on 11 September as planned.
