5000|$|The James project {{manages the}} Apache Mailet API which defines [...] "matchers" [...] and [...] "mailets". These allow users {{to write their}} own mail-handling code, such as to update a database, build a message archive, or filter spam. A matcher is used to {{classify}} messages based on some criteria, and then determines whether the message should be passed to an appropriate mailet for processing. Mailets are so-called due to their conceptual similarity to a servlet, and arose because Sun Microsystems declined a proposal to include mail-handling in the servlet implementation.

The decision fusion schemes considered have simple Bayesian structures (SBS) that particularize the univariat Gaussian density function, Beta density function or Parzen window density estimation.
