50|$|One {{does not}} need to {{establish}} a <b>private</b> <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service</b> for the occasional commercial transport of a letter outside the mails so long as the rate which would have been due to the USPS is affixed in stamps, the stamps are cancelled in ink, and the date of receipt by the carrier or the transport of the letter, are noted thereon. All these privately carried letters can bear a private cancellation if the cancellation is done in ink; private cancellations are different from private overprints on postage stamps.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} {{to set up a}} <b>private</b> <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service</b> known as [...] "lawful private carriage" [...] if the USPS postage is paid in addition to any private postage fee that is collected. Records must be maintained that such postage has been paid, and it must be affixed to the letter cover by U.S. stamps, meter imprints or through another method approved by the USPS; the postage must be canceled by the sender in ink; the date of mailing must be affixed in ink to the cover (either by sender or carrier); and the letter cannot be removed without defacing the cover from the envelope or other container in which the letter is sent. An agreement must be entered into with the Postal Service to conduct volume private carriage through the Chicago Rates and Classification Service Center which has national responsibility for the PES.|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to rural}} <b>mail</b> <b>delivery,</b> many Canadians living outside major {{cities and towns}} had little {{communication}} with the outside world. [...] On 10 October 1908, the first free rural <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service</b> was instituted in Canada. [...] The extension of residential <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>services</b> to all rural Canadian residents was a major achievement for the Post Office Department.|$|R

50|$|Much {{support for}} the {{introduction}} of a nationwide rural <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service</b> came from The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, the nation's oldest agricultural organization. Formerly, residents of rural areas had to either travel to a distant Post office to pick up their mail, or else pay for delivery by a <b>private</b> carrier. Free <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> began in American cities in 1863 with a limited scope. Shortly afterwards, rural citizens began petitioning for equal consideration. Postmaster General John Wanamaker first suggested rural free deliver (RFD) of mail in the United States in his annual report for fiscal year 1891.|$|R

40|$|The {{post office}} is an anomaly for {{business}} historians. The <b>delivery</b> of <b>mail</b> is a potentially lucrative business that could, {{at least in}} theory, be undertaken by private enterprise. Yet historically private postal systems have been not the rule but the exception, and in every major industrial nation today <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> is undertaken by a monopoly that is run either directly by the government or, as in the United States, by a quasi-governmental public corporation. Given this state of affairs, one might assume that the recent efforts of private entrepreneurs {{to break into the}} <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> business are novel departures from time-honored norms. Yet this is only partly true. For while the government has successfully monopolized the <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> business in the twentieth century, in the nineteenth century a very different situation prevailed. In this period, <b>private</b> <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> firms operated profitably in virtually every major market the government served [...] and in many additional markets as well. And between 1839 and 1845 [...] the heyday of the <b>private</b> <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> boom [...] <b>private</b> <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> firms flourished as they never had before and never would again.

50|$|Datagram {{service is}} often {{compared}} to a <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service,</b> the user only provides the destination address, but receives no guarantee of delivery, and no confirmation upon successful <b>delivery.</b> Datagram <b>service</b> is therefore considered unreliable. Datagram service routes datagrams without first creating a predetermined path. Datagram service is therefore considered connectionless. There is also no consideration given to {{the order in which}} it and other datagrams are sent or received. In fact, many datagrams in the same group can travel along different paths before reaching the same destination.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Special Delivery was {{a postal}} service paid for with {{additional}} postage for urgent letters and postal packets which are delivered {{in less time than}} by standard or first class mail service. Its meaning is different and separate from express <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service.</b> Essentially it meant that a postal packet was delivered from a post office to the addressee immediately once it arrived at the post office responsible for delivering it, rather than waiting for the next regular delivery to the addressee.|$|R
