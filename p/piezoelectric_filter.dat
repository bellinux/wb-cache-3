This report deals {{with the problem of}} calculating passing and damped frequency intervals for a filter with given geometrical configurations and materials. Only periodic filters, which are widely used in practice, were considered. These filters consist of periodically arranged cells. For a small amount of cells a numerical procedure to visualise the wave propagation in the filter was developed. For a big number of cells another model of the filter was obtained. In this model it is assumed that the filter occupies an infinite domain. This leads to a differential equation, with periodic coefficients, that describes propagation of the wave with a given frequency in the filter. To analyse this equation the Spectral Theory for Periodic Operators had to be employed. Different ways [...] analytical and numerical [...] to apply the theory were proposed and analysed...|$|R

Ceramic <b>filters</b> were developed using technology similar to that of quartz crystal and electro-mechanical filters.

The primary application of ceramic filters has been for consumer-market use. Accordingly,a major emphasis has involved mass production technology, leading to low-priced devices. A typical ceramic filter includes monolithic resonators and capacitors packaged in unique configurations. I...|$|R

50|$|A crystal {{oscillator}} is an electronic oscillator circuit {{that uses a}} piezoelectric resonator, a crystal, as its frequency-determining element. Crystal is the common term used in electronics for the frequency-determining component, a wafer of quartz crystal or ceramic with electrodes connected to it. A more accurate term for it is piezoelectric resonator. Crystals are also used in other types of electronic circuits, such as crystal <b>filters.</b> <b>Piezoelectric</b> resonators are sold as separate components for use in {{crystal oscillator}} circuits.

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{reports on}} the {{performances}} of a frequency-tunable lead-zirconate-titanate-transduced fully differential mechanically coupled high-overtone width-extensional filter. The demonstrated electric field tuning provides channel agility and bandwidth adjustability for the incorporation of analog spectral processors in modern radio receiver architectures. We designed and experimentally characterized the higher overtone frequency response of a fully differential width-extensional filter. The filter demonstrates a center frequency (fC) tuning range of 7 MHz at 260 MHz and an adjustable bandwidth from 3 to 6. 3 MHz while maintaining a maximum frequency shift due to hysteresis effects below 0. 14 % and a stopband rejection floor of − 60 dB.

40|$|Infrared (IR) sensing {{has been}} a key {{enabling}} tecimology in military systems providing advantages in night vision, surveillance, and ever more accurate targeting. Passive hyperspectral imaging, the ability to gather and process infrared spectral information from each pixel of an infrared image, can ultimately provide two-dimensional composition maps of a scene under study. Finding applications such as atmospheric, and geophysical remote sensing, camouflaged target recognition, and defense against chemical weapons. We are developing a new, compact, high resolution hyperspectral long wave infrared (LWIR) imager concept based on an electronically-tunable, compact, solid state, interferometric Fabry-Pérot étalon filter. By controlling an externally applied electric field, the filter can be rapidly tuned (50 - 100 Hz) over a broad spectral range (> 1. 5 m at 10 tm wavelength). Careful design and fabrication ensures high peak transmission (80 %) and narrow-band width (0. 15 tm). Alternatives such as <b>piezoelectric</b> and opto-acoustic <b>filters</b> can operate at higher frequencies but {{have a much more}} limited tuning range (< 0. 01 pm). We will compare experimental results with theoretical predictions for the transmission bandwidth, peak transmission intensity, spectral tuning range, on-off contrast ratio, off-axis and hysteresis effects of one such tunable filter operating at 9 pm...|$|R
40|$|Numerous devices need filters for {{capturing}} {{signals and}} then conditioning them in communications and wireless systems. For several decades, microwave filters {{have been the}} center of attention for this type of signal conditioning. However, acoustic filters have recently been gaining attention, mainly because of their miniature size and high quality factor. Among the various different types of acoustic filters, SAW filters with only metal layers on top of the piezoelectric substrate are studied in this work. The piezoelectric material used in this thesis is aluminum nitride, which exhibits a higher quality factor in SAW resonators compared to lithium niobate or other piezoelectric materials. An extensive analysis of SAW structures is carried out here, along with an investigation into the relationship between physical dimensions, <b>piezoelectric</b> properties and <b>filter</b> specifications. The proposed design procedure is followed, after which the design is verified by simulation tools such as COMSOL and Coventorware, several prototype units for resonators and filters are fabricated through MEMSCAP. The tests were performed at the Center for Integrated RF Engineering (CIRFE) lab at the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The Q factor of the designed aluminum nitride resonator was proven to be higher than that of lithium niobate resonators. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of realizing aluminum nitride-based SAW resonators using a commercially available fabrication process from MEMSCAP...|$|R
40|$|Temperature-dependent {{dielectric}} permittivity of lead-free (LixNa 1 -x) NbO 3 for nominal x = 0. 04 - 0. 20, {{prepared by}} solid state reaction followed by sintering, was studied to resolve often debated issue pertaining to exactness of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) location along with structural aspects and phase {{stability in the}} system near MPB. Interestingly, a diffuse phase transition has been observed in the dielectric permittivity peak arising from the disorder induced in A-site and structural frustration in the perovskite cell due to Li substitution. A partial phase diagram has been proposed based on temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity studies. The room temperature piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties were investigated and the ceramics with x = 0. 12 showed relatively good electrical properties (d 33 = 28 pC/N, kp = 13. 8 %, Qm = 440, Pr = 12. 5 {micro}C/cm 2, EC = 43. 2 kV/cm, Tm = 340 oC). These parameter values make this material suitable for <b>piezoelectric</b> resonator and <b>filter</b> applications. Moreover, a high dielectric permittivity (= 2703) with broad diffuse peak near transition temperature along with low dielectric loss (< 4 %) in a wide temperature range (50 - 250 oC) found in this material may also have a potential application in high-temperature multilayer capacitors in automotive and aerospace related industries.

40|$|We show both {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{the existence}} of a complete band gap in a phononic crystal (PnC) constituted by periodical air holes drilled in a solid bi-layer slab. The composite slab is formed with an aluminum nitride (AlN) layer deposited on a titanium nitride (TiN) thin metallic film. Indeed, AlN slabs are of great interest in many technological applications, in particular, owing to the capabilities of AlN as a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible material for integration in <b>piezoelectric</b> radio frequency <b>filters</b> (thin-film bulk acoustic resonator technology). The TiN layer was chosen as a buffer to enable small lattice mismatch with AlN, thus resulting in highly c-axis oriented and low stresses at the interface. We calculate the band structure of the crystal by using a finite element method and discuss the frequency and width of the band gap {{as a function of the}} thicknesses of both layers and the shape of the holes, i. e., from cylindrical to conical. The introduction of the TiN slab contributes to slowly widen the band gap. The band gap narrows when the holes become conical and closes when the radius of one face in the cone exceeds by 15 % the radius of the other face. Experimentally, the measurement of the elastic wave transmission through eight rows of the bi-layer PnC shows a band gap around 950 MHz with an attenuation higher than 20 dB. The experimental results are well reproduced by the simulations provided the conical shape of the air inclusions is taken into account...|$|R
