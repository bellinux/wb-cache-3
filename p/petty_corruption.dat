It {{seemed to me that}} the personnel of the bureaucracy could be divided into three classes. There are first the old revolutionists, tested by years of persecution. These men have most of the highest posts. Prison and exile have made them tough and fanatical and rather out of touch with their own country. They are honest men, with a profound belief that Communism will regenerate the world. They think themselves utterly free from sentiment, but, in fact, they are sentimental about Communism and about the régime that they are creating; they cannot face the fact that what they are creating is not complete Communism, and that Communism is anathema to the peasant, who wants his own land and nothing else. They are pitiless in punishing corruption or drunkenness when they find either among officials; but they have built up a system in which the temptations to <b>petty</b> <b>corruption</b> are tremendous, and their own materialistic theory should persuade them that under such a system corruption must be rampant.|$|E

40|$|How {{to fight}} <b>petty</b> day-to-day <b>corruption</b> is a {{question}} often debated by politicians, by the public and in the economic literature. Early studies have noted that a simple and well-known way to fight day-to-day corruption is to create competition among corrupt officials. This paper shows that even a benevolent government might not encourage competition among officials {{in a way that}} eliminates corruption. This is due to a tradeoff between corruption and compliance costs. More differentiated bureaucratic services decrease compliance costs but increase the leeway for extortion. The analysis further reveals that exogenous shocks, for example in the form of foreign aid that aims to improve anti-corruption capacities, may prompt a benevolent government to increase the differentiation of bureaucratic services, thereby leading to an increase in corruption...|$|R

While some scholars consider bribery as a factor driving the rapid delivery of government services or an opportunityfor SMEs representative to clever bypass some bureaucratic barriers, we have to admit corruption is a negative phenomenon, and SMEs have fewer chances to fight against them if they are not supported bystrong measures from the authorities or society.

Disregard for the rule of law regarding property rights began with the confiscation of privately owned assets in 1959 and the early 1960s. Next came four decades of routine expropriation of the personal property of all permanent emigrants.

50|$|Relaxation under glasnost {{resulted}} in the Communist Party losing its absolute grip on the media. Before long, and much to the embarrassment of the authorities, the media began to expose severe social and economic problems the Soviet government had long denied and actively concealed. Problems receiving increased attention included poor housing, alcoholism, drug abuse, pollution, outdated Stalin-era factories, and <b>petty</b> to large-scale <b>corruption,</b> all of which the official media had ignored.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{attempts}} to set some conceptual boundaries and presents corruption {{as a social}} phenomenon, which is produced and re-produced in society. Manifested {{at all levels of}} Romanian society, <b>petty</b> or grand <b>corruption</b> seriously affect the political, legal, local and central administration domains, thus preventing a normal evolution of society. At the institutional level, a specialized agency was set up to investigate corruption. The paper deals with the deep signification and meanings of corruption. A general valid definition for the phenomenon is difficult to offer and the normative approach to define it is not enough. Under the most general terms, corruption is seen as abuse of power. Several definitions have been proposed for corruption seen as a social phenomenon. The main objective is to analyze corruption in a quantitative way and to examine the evolution of the phenomenon in Romania. Also, a comparative analysis has been made, {{based on the results of}} the National Anticorruption Department annual reports...|$|R

40|$|In a {{networked}} utility setting (few, predominantly monopoly providers), it is {{very hard}} to measure the extent of grand corruption using perceptions or surveys. It is even harder to measure the extent of damage done specifically by <b>corruption,</b> <b>petty</b> or grand. As a result, it will be hard to develop "actionable indicators" of, or to develop empirically tested responses to, corruption in utilities. How much does this matter? Corruption is the result of a failure of governance. We can measure the impact of poor governance at the level of the utility, and we have a number of tools to improve their governance. It is not clear that, at the sectoral or company level, there is a significant anticorruption agenda not encompassed by this broader agenda of improved governance. To that extent, the "new" anticorruption agenda provides renewed justification for the "old" focus on institutions at the level of utilities management, but does not require a radically different approach.
