40|$|Competition in {{hospital}} care is often implemented through mixed markets where {{public and private}} hospitals compete for patients. The optimality of this market form has long been debated in the literature. In this paper we investigate the role of soft budget constraint in affecting <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> within a mixed market. <b>Patient</b> <b>selection</b> is the undesired effect of hospital competition when three conditions are met: asymmetry {{in hospital}}s' objectives, presence of hospital’s private information and inability to enforce hard budget constraint. The paper shows that soft budget is a pre-condition {{for the existence of}} <b>patient</b> <b>selection.</b> Our paper adds an important dimension to the existing literature which considers asymmetry of information as the only cause for this market failure.

Although intended to promote evidence-based decision-making, if poorly defined, the inclusion of psychosocial criteria {{has the potential to}} reduce transparency in <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> and equity of access. We reviewed all Australian practice guidelines concerning patient suitability for kidney transplantation and qualitatively analysed their inclusion of, and approach towards, psychosocial criteria. Transplant Directors from all Australian adult transplant units were invited to submit their unit's guidelines for this national research audit. All 16 units (100 %) submitted some form of documentation. We analysed only those documents that were purposely structured tools for directing <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> (eight guidelines used in 10 transplant units). Content analysis was performed on the abstracted psychosocial criteria. Psychosocial criteria [...] particularly non-compliance and smoking [...] were commonly included. In general, the psychosocial criteria were ill-defined and lacking in substantiating evidence and recommendations for assessment or action. Our results reveal that current Australian <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> guidelines for kidney transplantation incorporate poorly defined psychosocial criteria that vary greatly. Furthermore, {{there appears to be a}} weak evidence base underpinning their inclusion. The use of psychosocial criteria in this manner decreases the transparency of <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> and increases the potential for subjective estimates of social worth to influence <b>patient</b> <b>selection.</b> The priority given to such criteria in transplant guidelines requires attention and debate.
