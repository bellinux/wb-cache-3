50|$|The <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> {{contacts}} {{only the}} inside {{surface of the}} tubing thereby negating concern for other valves, O-rings or seals that might be incompatible with fluid being pumped. Therefore, only {{the composition of the}} tubing that the pumped medium travels through is considered for chemical compatibility.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{centrifugal}} pumps, positive-displacement pumps {{have several}} advantages. The <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> is moving axially without turbulence which eliminates foaming {{that would otherwise}} occur in viscous fluids. They are also able to pump fluids of higher viscosity without losing flow rate. Also, changes in the pressure difference have little impact on PD pumps compared to centrifugal pumps.|$|E

50|$|Copper is used {{in field}} power cables, {{grounding}} networks, and motors for tracking and <b>pumping</b> <b>fluids,</b> {{as well as in}} the main generator and high voltage transformers. Typically, there is about 200 tonnes copper for a 50 MW power plant.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> {{will have}} to be {{protected}} from freezing in certain climates, and as such is normally treated with a glycol based anti-freeze. This also reduces the specific heat capacity of the fluid and increases the viscosity, increasing pump power consumption, further reducing the seasonal efficiency of the device. For example, a 20% glycol mixture will provide protection down to -10 C, but will increase system resistance by 15%.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{this system}} is {{generally}} limited to situations where the air streams are separated and no other type of device can be utilised since the heat recovery efficiency is lower than other forms of air-to-air heat recovery. Gross efficiencies are usually {{in the range of}} 40 to 50%, but more significantly seasonal efficiencies of this system can be very low, due to the extra electrical energy used by the <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> circuit.|$|E
50|$|When the pumping {{application}} is not {{suited to a}} centrifugal pump, a progressive cavity pump is used instead. Progressive cavity pumps are single-screw types typically used in shallow wells or at the surface. This pump is mainly used on surface applications where the <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> may contain {{a considerable amount of}} solids such as sand and dirt. The volumetric efficiency and mechanical efficiency of a progressive cavity pump increases as the viscosity of the liquid does.|$|E

5000|$|A {{rotodynamic pump}} is a kinetic machine in which energy is {{continuously}} imparted to the <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> {{by means of}} a rotating impeller, propeller, or rotor, in contrast to a positive displacement pump in which a fluid is moved by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing the trapped volume into the pump's discharge. [...] Examples of rotodynamic pumps include adding kinetic energy to a fluid such as by using a centrifugal pump to increase fluid velocity or pressure.|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{bearings}} can be hydrostatically or hydrodynamically lubricated. Hydrostatically lubricated bearings are lubricated by {{an external}} pump that maintains a static amount of pressure. In a hydrodynamic bearing {{the pressure in}} the oil film is maintained by {{the rotation of the}} journal. Hydrostatic bearings enter a hydrodynamic state when the journal is rotating. Hydrostatic bearings usually use oil, while hydrodynamic bearings can use oil or grease, however bearings can be designed to use whatever fluid is available, and several pump designs use the <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> as a lubricant.|$|E
5000|$|Spring-loaded rollers - As {{the name}} indicates, the rollers in this pump are {{mounted on a}} spring. This design is more {{elaborate}} than the fixed occlusion, but helps overcome the variations in the tube wall thickness over a broader range. Regardless of the variations, the roller imparts {{the same amount of}} stress on the tubing that is proportional to the spring constant, making this a constant stress operation. The spring is selected to overcome not only the hoop strength of the tubing, but also the pressure of the <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E

50|$|Instead {{of a gas}} {{accumulation}} {{and releasing}} cycle, the pressure can be created by burning of hydrocarbons. Such combustion driven pumps directly transmit the impulse form a combustion event through the actuation membrane to the <b>pump</b> <b>fluid.</b> In order to allow this direct transmission, the pump needs to be almost entirely made of an elastomer (e.g. silicone rubber). Hence, the combustion causes the membrane to expand and thereby <b>pumps</b> the <b>fluid</b> out of the adjacent pumping chamber. The first combustion-driven soft pump was developed by ETH Zurich.|$|R
50|$|In {{building}} services {{the water quality}} of various <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> systems, including for heating, cooling, and condensate water, will be regularly checked and topped up with chemicals manually as required to suit the required water quality. Most commonly inhibitors {{will be added to}} protect the pipework and components against corrosion, or a biocide will be added to stop the growth of bacteria in lower temperature systems. The required chemicals will be added to the fluid system by use of a dosing pot; a multi-valved chamber in which the chemical can be added, and then introduced to the fluid system in a controlled manner.|$|E
50|$|Jet {{pumps are}} {{commonly}} used to extract water from water wells. The main pump, often a centrifugal pump, is powered and installed at ground level. Its discharge is split, with {{the greater part of}} the flow leaving the system, while a portion of the flow is returned to the jet pump installed below ground in the well. This recirculated part of the <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> is used to power the jet. At the jet pump, the high-energy, low-mass returned flow drives more fluid from the well, becoming a low-energy, high-mass flow which is then piped to the inlet of the main pump.|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{generating}} electricity {{to turn a}} motor, sunlight can be concentrated on the heat exchanger of a Stirling engine and used to drive a pump mechanically. This dispenses {{with the cost of}} solar panels and electric equipment. In some cases the Stirling engine may be suitable for local fabrication, eliminating the difficulty of importing equipment. One form of Stirling engine is the fluidyne engine which operates directly on the <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> as a piston. Fluidyne solar pumps have been studied since 1987 [...] At least one manufacturer has conducted tests with a Stirling solar powered pump.|$|E
50|$|Pumping {{stations}} are facilities including pumps and equipment for <b>pumping</b> <b>fluids</b> {{from one place}} to another.

50|$|The {{system is}} {{activated}} using a switch in the cockpit. This {{turns on the}} <b>fluid</b> <b>pump,</b> which <b>pumps</b> <b>fluid</b> out of the reservoir, through the ducting and out onto the calibrated orifices on the wing leading edge. As the fluid flows along the airstream (both {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces of the wing), a thin coat of fluid is left that protects the surface from icing. The excess fluid then leaves the wing surface and slides out behind the wing's trailing edge.|$|R
5000|$|Lower {{pressure}} peristaltic pumps {{typically have}} dry casings and use rollers along with non-reinforced, extruded tubing. This class of pump {{is sometimes called}} a [...] "tube pump" [...] or [...] "tubing pump". These pumps employ rollers to squeeze the tube. Except for the 360° eccentric pump design as described below, these pumps have a minimum of 2 rollers 180° apart, and may {{have as many as}} 8, or even 12 rollers. Increasing the number of rollers increase the pressure pulse frequency of the <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> at the outlet, thereby decreasing the amplitude of pulsing. The downside to increasing number of rollers it that it proportionately increases number of squeezes, or occlusions, on the tubing for a given cumulative flow through that tube, thereby reducing the tubing life.|$|E
50|$|In {{a double}} seal Back to Back, the barrier liquid in the cavity {{between the two}} seals is pressurized. Thus if the primary seal fails, the neutral liquid will leak into the pump stream instead of the {{dangerous}} <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid</b> escaping into the atmosphere. This application is usually used in gas, unstable, highly toxic, abrasive, corrosive, and viscous fluids. These are detailed in API Piping Plan standards #53a, 53b, 53c; or 54. Plan 74 may also be considered a double seal piping plan, although it is used exclusively when describing a dry gas barrier seal support system. The barrier fluid used in a Plan 74 system is simply a gas, not a liquid. Typically, nitrogen is used as its inert nature makes it advantageous due to mixing with the process stream being sealed.|$|E
50|$|A {{progressive}} {{cavity pump}} {{is a type of}} positive displacement pump and is also known as a progressing cavity pump, progg cavity pump, eccentric screw pump or cavity pump. It transfers fluid by means of the progress, through the pump, of a sequence of small, fixed shape, discrete cavities, as its rotor is turned. This leads to the volumetric flow rate being proportional to the rotation rate (bidirectionally) and to low levels of shearing being applied to the <b>pumped</b> <b>fluid.</b> Hence these pumps have application in fluid metering and pumping of viscous or shear-sensitive materials. The cavities taper down toward their ends and overlap with their neighbours, so that, in general, no flow pulsing is caused by the arrival of cavities at the outlet, other than that caused by compression of the fluid or pump components.|$|E

Gear pumps are positive displacement (or fixed displacement), meaning they pump a constant amount of fluid for each revolution. Some gear pumps are designed to function as either a motor or a pump.|$|R
