Since DO value in some experiments were read as over saturation (higher than 34  mg/L), the accuracy of this instrument was verified by following procedure: the culture medium used in this experiment was bubbled with pure oxygen for half an hour, and the reading DO value was 32.7  mg/L. Thus, this measure error was 4.0 %, and acceptable.|$|R
