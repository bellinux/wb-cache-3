Furthermore, he was often in the position of trying to force battle on unwilling opponents. At his defeat at Patay in 1429 he was advised not to fight there by Sir John Fastolf, who was subsequently blamed for the debacle, but the French, inspired by Joan of Arc, showed unprecedented fighting spirit - usually they approached an English position with trepidation. The charge of rashness is perhaps more justifiable at Castillon where Talbot, misled by false reports of a French retreat, attacked their entrenched camp frontally - facing wheel to wheel artillery.|$|E

40|$|Jimmy Swaggart's ordeal in 1983 {{provides}} the focus for this research. WBRZ's documentary and Swaggart's interview, hour-long video, and full-page newspaper replies are examined {{from the perspective}} of Lloyd Bitzer's "Rhetorical Situation. " The degree to which Swaggart's responses were "fitting" is determined and insights regarding Bitzer's theory are provided. Reporter John Camp's program, "Give Me That Big Time Religion," was aired in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Thursday, May 19, 1983. Analysis of this documentary reveals that Swaggart stood charged with "Being in Business for the Money;" "Being Corrupt;" "Being a Manipulator;" "Being Too Political;" and "Being Big-Time Rather Than Old-Time Religion. " Examination of Swaggart's replies corroborates that he perceived these charges to be exigencies he must address. Swaggart's discourses demonstrate that the perception of his "Being Anti-Catholic" also needed resolution. Bitzer's criteria for assessment of the appropriateness of Swaggart's replies include: the existence of genuine exigencies; the presence of a capable audience; reliance upon embedded constraints and interests; and the function of the discourse as a means or motivation for actual or probable alteration. This study concludes that Swaggart provided his audience with generalized explanations which would make sense. However, when specific replies to <b>particular</b> <b>charges</b> are assessed, Swaggart did not fare so well. In particular, Swaggart inadequately addressed the issues of his family getting rich, his accountability regarding the Children's Fund, that he often is corrupt, and that he manipulates others for money. Furthermore, this paper argues that Bitzer's "Rhetorical Situation" does not reveal more about the critic than the rhetoric; that meaning can be discovered as well as created; that rhetoric can be an effect not just a cause; and, that ethical responsibility of a rhetor is not removed due to the compulsion of "situation. " Suggestions for future research include: examination of the discussion and debate concerning televangelism using Bitzer's approach; Swaggart's situation in 1983 as an ideal test case for the genre of apologia; and, a comparison of Swaggart's 1983 ordeal with that in 1988...|$|E
40|$|Aristophanes’ appeal {{as a poet}} is universal, and his {{contribution}} to the literary world is important and obvious. The importance of Aristophanes to the historian, however, is much less clearly defined. The {{subject matter of the}} comedies is certainly clear enough, but its meaning has been much and, variously disputed. Aristophanes’ elusiveness is well summed up in one line of the Acharnians: "Did you understand what he said? No, by Apollo, I did not. " 1 The difficulty of determining the exact political views of Aristophanes has moved one writer to say: "A sympathetic reader of Aristophanes can hardly fail to perceive that, while his political and intellectual tendencies are well marked, his opinions, in so far as they color his comedies, are too indefinite to reward, or indeed to tolerate, analysis. " 2 Whether or not Aristophanes’ political opinions will reward analysis depends entirely on the analyst himself, but they will certainly tolerate analysis. While the subject is admittedly thread-bare, much can be learned if we approach it in the correct way. 3 This thesis proposes to show Aristophanes’ stand with respect to the politics of his city, Athens. To avoid the pitfall which is inevitable if we do not understand the true Athenian spirit, it is imperative that we obtain such an understanding, for Aristophanes was an "Athenian", if he was anything at all. For this reason, it will be unnecessary to enumerate Aristophanes’ views one by one. If we can see Aristophanes in his own environment, we need merely let him speak, and we will understand. In order to place Aristophanes into his environment, it has been thought necessary to present as complete a picture as is possible, within the scope of the thesis, of the conditions of the time, and of the historical facts which were important in their development. Some information which may appear irrelevant has been included partly because it provides a fuller picture of Aristophanes’ personality. For example, {{it is important to know}} what historical events preceded each comedy, even if the comedy does not contain any references to those events. Sometimes events or personalities become conspicuous by Aristophanes failure to mention them in his comedies. Similarly, it was felt that the origin and nature of comedy should be described in considerable detail. However, special points on which there are divergent opinions, have not been included because they add little or nothing to an understanding of Aristophanes' politics. The main idea has been to provide the casual reader of Aristophanes’ with a fairly reliable guide to what he must know in order to understand the poet’s political personality. Further, the information on comedy has been included for another reason. It helps to detract from too serious a view of Aristophanes as politician; for the tendency has often been to allow the poet to disappear in the politician. The thesis is presented under three main headings. The first treats of Aristophanes’ career as a whole and includes historical details surrounding the comedies. The next division shows how Aristophanes felt about various personalities and institutions of the democracy. Under the third heading comes a discussion of various aspects of the oligarchy and Aristophanes; views concerning them. In the same chapter, some attention is devoted to Aristophanes' relations with Alcibiades, a much neglected or perhaps underestimated facet of Aristophanes’ political life. The concluding chapter presents some philosophic aspects of Aristophanes’ politics and discusses the validity and influence of Aristophanes’ views generally. The relative justice or injustice of <b>particular</b> <b>charges</b> made by Aristophanes is not given much attention throughout the thesis, since this is not its purpose. Finally, it was felt that it would be difficult to sum up, in the conclusion, all of Aristophanes’ political views. The important thing is his political attitude in general, and the reader will come to a gradual understanding of this attitude during the course of the thesis. A map and a chronological chart have been added as appendices, and it is hoped that these will help the reader to follow more closely the events during the course of which Aristophanes wrote his plays. 1.

This article identifies fundamentally important methods which may enhance the performances of ECR ion sources through the use of: (1) a tailored magnetic field configuration (spatial domain) in combination with single-frequency microwave radiation to create a large uniformly distributed ECR ``volume`` or (2) the use of broadband frequency domain techniques (variable-frequency, broad-band frequency, or multiple-discrete-frequency microwave radiation), derived from standard TWT technology, to transform the resonant plasma ``surfaces`` of traditional ECR ion sources into resonant plasma ``volume``. The creation of a large ECR plasma ``volume`` permits coupling of more power into the plasma, resulting in the heating {{of a much larger}} electron population to higher energies, thereby producing higher charge state ions and much higher intensities within a <b>particular</b> <b>charge</b> state than possible in present forms of` the source.
