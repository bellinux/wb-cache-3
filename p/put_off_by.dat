5|$|The Man from London was {{the first}} of Tarr's films to premiere in {{competition}} at the Cannes Film Festival, but despite being highly anticipated, it won no prize.

5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was <b>put</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It {{was the kind of}} book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E

5|$|While {{developing}} Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately {{departed from}} the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences {{that might otherwise be}} <b>put</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.|$|E

5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 fans {{were said to have}} travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According {{to the head of the}} Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were <b>put</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game.

Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E
5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be <b>put</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E

5|$|With the O.T.O. {{now being}} revived in North America, Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 1, based at his Hollywood home, {{and brought in}} 7 initiates to the Minerval level in September 1935.

The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, {{as well as social}} events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public. In February 1936 they held a Mass in honour of Wayne Walker, a proponent of New Thought who ran a group known as The Voice of Healing; they had hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were <b>put</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the Lodge's sexual openness. Later that year, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years. As a result, the public attendance of the Gnostic Mass plummeted.|$|E

5|$|The counter-arguments {{were much}} stronger. The {{assumption}} that the Germans would be <b>put</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> losses was wrong; {{it would have taken}} severe losses for the OKL to change its mind on target selection. The targets were also vital. The airfields themselves supported the squadrons in the field, while the loss of the vital sector-stations could well have crippled the defence system. Thus the possibility of allowing the bulk of the German bombers to reach their target unscathed was unacceptable. The idea that the Big Wing could inflict heavier losses than had been achieved up until then was based on an overestimate of the numbers of aircraft shot down by the Big Wing. Leigh-Mallory, Sholto Douglas and Bader had based their opinions on claims made by RAF units in battle. However, particularly when a large number of aircraft were engaged, it was possible for the same aircraft to be claimed by more than one pilot. As a result, the RAF claimed 100 or more German aircraft shot down in one day on five occasions, while analysis of Luftwaffe losses has shown that there were only four occasions on which the Luftwaffe lost more than 50 aircraft, and never did they lose 100 or more in a day. Nevertheless, while it is not known whether Mallory and Bader were aware that the claims of the RAF and Big Wings were exaggerated, they certainly tried to use them as a potent tool with which to remove Park and Dowding from command and pursue the Big Wing tactic.|$|E
