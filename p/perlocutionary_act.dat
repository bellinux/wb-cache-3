40|$|J. L. Austin's three-prong {{distinction}} between locutionary, illocutionary and <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>acts</b> {{is discussed in}} terms of D. Davidson's theory of action. <b>Perlocutionary</b> <b>acts</b> refer to the relation between the utterance and its causal effects on the addressee. In contrast, illocutionary and locutionary acts are alternative descriptions of the utterance. The possibility of conceiving of locutionary acts as expressing propositions under a certain mode of presentation is discussed. Different ways to define illocutionary acts without encroaching on the locutionary or perlocutionary territory are considered. © 2008 The Authors Journal Compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

50|$|The term metalocutionary act {{originated}} as metalocution (Gibbon 1976, 1983) in functional {{descriptions of}} intonation in English and German, by analogy with locution (locutionary act), illocution (illocutionary act) and perlocution (<b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act)</b> in speech act theory. The term metalocutionary act {{has developed a}} more general meaning and may include, for example, quotation acts and comments on preceding speech acts.|$|E
5000|$|One way {{to think}} about the {{difference}} between an illocutionary act (e.g., a declaration, command, or a promise), and a <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act</b> (e.g., an insult or a persuasion attempt) is to note how in the former case, by uttering the object—for example, [...] "I hereby declare," [...] or [...] "I command," [...] or [...] "I hereby promise you"—the act has taken place. That is to say, in each case a declaration, command, or promise has necessarily taken place in virtue of the utterance itself, whether the hearer believes in the declaration, command, or promise or not. On the other hand, with a <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act,</b> the object of the utterance has not taken place unless the hearer deems it so—for example, if one utters, [...] "I hereby insult you," [...] or [...] "I hereby persuade you," [...] one would not assume an insult has necessarily occurred, nor persuasion has necessarily taken place, unless the hearer were suitably offended or persuaded by the utterance.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{the phrase}} [...] "Don't {{go into the}} water" [...] (a locutionary act with {{distinct}} phonetic, syntactic and semantic features) counts as warning to the listener not {{to go into the}} water (an illocutionary act). If the listener heeds the warning the speech-act has been successful in persuading the listener not to go into the water (a <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act).</b> This taxonomy of speech acts was inherited by John R. Searle, Austin's pupil at Oxford and subsequently an influential exponent of speech act theory.|$|E

5000|$|J. L. Austin {{introduced}} the performative utterance {{as an additional}} category to ‘constatives’, statements that can be either true or false. [...] Language not only represents, but also can make something happen. Austin distinguishes between two types of performative speech acts. The illocutionary act is concerned with what an actor is doing in saying something (e.g. when someone says ‘hello’, he is greeting another person). [...] The <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act</b> involves the unintended consequences of an utterance and refers to that what an actor is doing by saying something (e.g.when someone says ‘hello’ and the greeted person is scared by it).|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} illocutionary acts was {{introduced}} into linguistics by the philosopher John L. Austin in his {{investigation of the}} various aspects of speech acts. In Austin's framework, locution is what was said, illocution is what was meant, and perlocution is what happened as a result. For example, when somebody says [...] "Is there any salt?" [...] at the dinner table, the illocutionary act (the meaning conveyed) is effectively [...] "please give me some salt" [...] even though the locutionary act (the literal sentence) was {{to ask a question}} about the presence of salt. The <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act</b> (the actual effect), was to cause somebody to offer salt.|$|E
5000|$|In {{linguistics}} and {{the philosophy}} of mind, a locutionary act is the performance of an utterance, and hence of a speech act. The term equally refers to the surface meaning of an utterance because, according to J. L. Austin's posthumous [...] "How To Do Things With Words", a speech act should be analysed as a locutionary act (i.e. the actual utterance and its ostensible meaning, comprising phonetic, phatic and rhetic acts corresponding to the verbal, syntactic and semantic aspects of any meaningful utterance), {{as well as an}} illocutionary act (the semantic 'illocutionary force' of the utterance, thus its real, intended meaning), and in certain cases a further <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act</b> (i.e. its actual effect, whether intended or not).|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the notion}} of illocutionary act, which {{describes}} the linguistic function of an utterance, a perlocutionary effect is in some sense external to the performance. It may be thought of, in a sense, as {{the effect of the}} illocutionary act via the locutionary act. Therefore, when examining <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>acts,</b> the effect on the hearer or reader is emphasized.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{define the}} term [...] "illocutionary act" [...] with {{reference}} to examples, saying for example that any speech act (like stating, asking, commanding, promising, and so on) is an illocutionary act. This approach has generally failed to give any useful hints about what traits and elements make up an illocutionary act; that is, what defines such an act. It is also often emphasised that Austin introduced the illocutionary act {{by means of a}} contrast with other kinds of acts or aspects of acting: the illocutionary act, he says, is an act performed in saying something, as contrasted with a locutionary act, the act of saying something, and also contrasted with a <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act,</b> an act performed by saying something. Austin, however, eventually abandoned the [...] "in saying" [...] / [...] "by saying" [...] test (1975, 123).|$|E

40|$|Introduction Utterances in {{dialogue}} are interpreted {{on the basis}} of their context, which includes the mental states of the interlocutors, e. g. their beliefs and intentions. A speaker can express his beliefs explicitly (using attitude verbs) or implicitly (using attitude adverbs, modal particles, presupposing expressions, syntactic mood). In both cases, this information about the speaker's beliefs and intentions (which reects the content of his current mental state) becomes part of the context for interpreting his utterance. As pointed out in Allen (1995), the purpose of an utterance is to change the mental state of the hearer. How the hearer's mental state is to be changed depends on the intention of the speaker (the <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act</b> he wants his utterance to perform). Whether it is changed depends on the hearer acting in accordance with the speaker's intentions. The <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>act</b> is accomplished only after the hearer signals that his men...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research are (1) to identify the types of speech acts in terms of locutionary acts, illocutionary <b>acts</b> and <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>acts</b> found in the three African American women characters and two white women characters’ utterances in Tate Taylor’s The Help and (2) to describe African American women’s obstacles in 1960 s through the speech acts of the three African American women characters and two white women characters portrayed in the film. This research employed the descriptive qualitative method. The data were {{in the form of}} scenes and each scene has a dialogue and context. The source of the data is The Help directed by Tate Taylor and its script. The data were collected by watching the film, reading and checking the script, selecting the data, and recording them into the data sheet. Some steps in analyzing the data were identifying the speech acts, classifying the speech acts based on Austin’s and Searle’s theories, classifying the obstacles faced by the African American women characters based on the speech acts which potentially portrayed the obstacles, applying the data trustworthiness, analyzing the data, and drawing conclusions. The research reveals two findings. The first is that all the three types of speech acts are found in the characters’ utterances. They are locutionary acts, illocutionary <b>acts,</b> and <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>acts.</b> In terms of locutionary acts, the characters employ the phatic acts which deal with grammar, phonological, and syntactic analysis of utterance, phonetic acts which deal with certain sounds or noises, and rhetic acts which are related to the use of sense and reference. In terms of illocutionary acts, the five types of the acts are all found in the characters’ utterances. They are representative, directive, commissive, expressive, and declaration. In terms of <b>perlocutionary</b> <b>acts,</b> the twelve effects are all found in the characters’ utterances and/or facial expressions. The second findings are the obstacles faced by the African American women characters which {{can be found in the}} use of the characters’ speech acts. The obstacles faced by the African American women characters who live in Mississippi, one of the regions in the United States of America, are economic issue, educational issue, racial discrimination, racial segregation, family disruption, and political issue...|$|R
