25|$|From 1998 to 2006, {{internet}} {{was available in}} Tristan da Cunha but its high cost made it almost unaffordable for the local population, who primarily used it only to send email. The connection was also extremely unreliable, connecting through a 64 kbit/s satellite <b>phone</b> <b>connection</b> provided by Inmarsat. From 2006, a very-small-aperture terminal provided 3072 kbit/s of publicly accessible bandwidth via an internet cafe.|$|E

The song was Thunders's first time singing lead and {{featured}} vocals Weisbard and Marks said were delivered in a quavering but proud New York accent. His lyrics described the narrator's growing frustration over a crossed-wire <b>phone</b> <b>connection</b> with a female subject. On [...] "Human Being", an ode to self-respect and personal liberty, Thunders introduced his guitar playing with a roughly performed variation on Bill Doggett's 1956 song [...] "Honky Tonk". Johansen addressed critics of the band in the song, telling them if they found him objectionable they should instead find themselves [...] "a saint", [...] "a boy who's gonna be what I ain't", and a [...] "plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint who's gonna sit through the madness and always act so quaint".|$|E

3000|$|In Equation (2), p(W) is the {{language}} model constraining inter-word connections, and p(W|P) is the pronunciation dictionary restricting <b>phone</b> <b>connections</b> within each word. In most cases, the relation between P and W is a one-to-one mapping. As will be shown in Section [...] "Experimental results", the word-based phone lattices obey these constraints, resulting in a heavy bias towards the target language and causing significant LRE performance degradation. To remove these constraints and improve LRE accuracy, we propose to use an alternative construction algorithm for phone lattice generation.|$|R
