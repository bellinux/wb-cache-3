5|$|Crawley {{was already}} a modest {{industrial}} centre {{by the end of}} the Second World War. Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large enough to have their own factories. In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and <b>precision</b> <b>engineering</b> and aircraft repair. Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.|$|E

25|$|Colne's former cotton {{industry}} {{has all but}} disappeared. Many of the textile weaving mills that used to punctuate the landscape have been demolished {{to make way for}} new retail outlets and modern housing. Others lie semi-derelict, but the best examples continue to provide jobs for local residents by accommodating new manufacturing and service businesses. Strong growth has been experienced in <b>precision</b> <b>engineering,</b> particularly associated with the aerospace sector, as Rolls-Royce Aerospace operates a large wide chord fan-blade manufacturing facility in nearby Barnoldswick.|$|E
25|$|Integrals {{appear in}} many {{practical}} situations. If {{a swimming pool}} is rectangular with a flat bottom, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), {{and the length of}} its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but <b>precision</b> <b>engineering</b> (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements.|$|E

25|$|Govan is a {{district}} and former burgh in the south-western {{part of the}} city. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite Partick. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding centre of international repute and is {{home to one of}} two BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards on the River Clyde and the <b>precision</b> <b>engineering</b> firm, Thales Optronics. It is also home to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the Glasgow Subway system. The wider Govan area includes the districts of Ibrox, Kinning Park and Cessnock.|$|E
25|$|The {{golden age}} of toy {{development}} was {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. Real wages were rising steadily in the Western world, allowing even working-class families to afford toys for their children, and industrial techniques of <b>precision</b> <b>engineering</b> and mass production was able to provide the supply to meet this rising demand. Intellectual emphasis was also increasingly being placed on the importance of a wholesome and happy childhood for the future development of children. William Harbutt, an English painter, invented plasticine in 1897, and in 1900 commercial production of the material as a children's toy began. Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture and was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles in the twentieth century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys.|$|E
25|$|The city {{is home to}} some internationally {{active and}} well known enterprises. The Buderus company {{was created in the}} year 1731 {{and is one of the}} oldest still {{existing}} (large) enterprises. As BBT Thermotechnik, now part of the Bosch group, Buderus was for many decades one of the largest employers in the central Hessian area with more than 10,000 persons employed in Wetzlar alone (worldwide over 16,000), working in the areas casting (with cement), high-grade steel and heating technologies. Economic changes, repeated shifts of the stock majority as well as close-downs and sales of various divisions have strongly changed the company in the meantime. However, it ranks among the largest enterprises in Hesse. Wetzlar is apart from Jena and Oberkochen a German centre for optics as well as the most important German location for the <b>precision</b> <b>engineering</b> industry. The manufactured products have gained worldwide reputation. One of the most important companies in the area of microscopy is Leica Microsystems (formerly known as Ernst Leitz), which in its peak times employed over 7000 people in the city. Small format (35mm) photography was invented in Wetzlar, and Leica cameras are well known for their excellent quality. In addition there are cameras of the companies Leidolf and Minox, binoculars and telescopes made by the company Hensoldt AG (now Carl Zeiss), part of the Zeiss group (over 2,000 people employed in peak times). Other well-known firms are Philips (with about 1,200 employed at times) or Siemens AG and Siemens VDO, since 2007 Continental AG or the Sancura BKK, a supraregional health insurance company, which is fusioned with the Taunus BKK. The Business park Spilburg, former barracks, became home to a number of innovative enterprises, particularly in the area of optics/precision mechanics, information technology and services. Additionally, areas in the Westend as well as the Hörnsheimer Eck and the Dillfeld are available for new businesses to set up.|$|E

500|$|Under the plan, on 12 July 1938, the Air Ministry {{bought a}} site {{consisting}} of farm fields and a sewage works next to Castle Bromwich Aerodrome in Birmingham. This shadow factory would supplement Supermarine's original factories in Southampton {{in building the}} Spitfire. The Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory (CBAF) ordered the most modern machine tools then available, which were being installed two months after work started on the site. Although Morris Motors under Lord Nuffield (an expert in mass motor-vehicle construction) at first managed and equipped the factory, it was funded by government money. When the project was first discussed {{it was estimated that}} the factory would be built for £2,000,000, however, by the beginning of 1939 this cost had doubled to over £4,000,000. The Spitfire's stressed-skin construction required <b>precision</b> <b>engineering</b> skills and techniques outside the experience of the local labour force, which took some time to train. However, even as the first Spitfires were being built in June 1940, the factory was still incomplete, and there were numerous problems with the factory management, which ignored tooling and drawings provided by Supermarine in favour of tools and drawings of its own designs, and with the workforce which, while not completely stopping production, continually threatened strikes or [...] "slow downs" [...] until their demands for higher than average pay rates were met.|$|E

40|$|We present {{highlights}} from the American Society for <b>Precision</b> <b>Engineering's</b> 2004 winter topical meeting entitled Free-Form Optics: Design, Fabrication, Metrology, Assembly. We emphasize those papers {{that are most}} relevant to astronomical optics. Optical surfaces that transcend the bounds of rotational symmetry have been implemented in novel optical systems with fantastic results since the release of Polaroid's first instant camera. Despite these successes, free-form optics have found only a few niche applications and have yet to enter the mainstream. The purpose of this meeting is to identify {{the state of the}} art of free-form optics design, fabrication, metrology and assembly and to identify the technical and logistical challenges that inhibit their widespread use. Issues that will be addressed include: What are free-form optics? How can optical systems be made better with free-form optics? How can designers use free-form optics? How can free-form optics be fabricated? How can they be measured? How are free-form optical systems assembled? Control of multi-axis systems...|$|R

40|$|Innovative new genome {{engineering}} {{technologies for}} manipulating chromosomes {{have appeared in}} the last decade. One of these technologies, recombination mediated genetic engineering (recombineering) allows for <b>precision</b> DNA <b>engineering</b> of chromosomes and plasmids in Escherichia coli. Single-stranded DNA recombineering (SSDR) allows for the generation of subtle mutations without the need for selection and without leaving behind any foreign DNA. In this review we discuss the application of SSDR technology in lactic acid bacteria, with an emphasis on key factors that were critical to move this technology from E. coli into Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactococcus lactis. We also provide a blueprint for how to proceed if one is attempting to establish SSDR technology in a lactic acid bacterium. The emergence of CRISPR-Cas technology in genome engineering and its potential application to enhancing SSDR in lactic acid bacteria is discussed.
