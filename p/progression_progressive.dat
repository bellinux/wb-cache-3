40|$|Cervical cord {{compression}} from cervical root neurofibromas {{represents an}} important clinical problem {{in patients with}} neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1), but is rarely reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the clinical presentation and follow‐up of children and adults with NF 1 and cervical cord compression. A retrospective review of clinical records and neuroimaging studies from two large tertiary care centres between 1996 and 2006 was performed. 13 patients with NF 1 and cervical cord compression were identified. Age at presentation ranged from 9 to 61  years. The most common presentation was progressive quadriparesis. 11 of 13 patients underwent cervical decompression and subtotal resection of the associated neurofibroma. The majority of patients had recovery of neurological function and no further clinical <b>progression.</b> <b>Progressive</b> neurological deficit (typically quadriparesis), rather than neuroimaging appearances, should dictate the need for surgery...|$|E

The author reflects on ordinary moments where sexuality and relationships become meaningful and situate emotions at the heart of analytical enquiry because it is through emotional interactions that micro–macro networks of relations intersect. Autobiography is combined with original data from empirical research to provide analytical entry points, which aims to advance understanding and also facilitate reflection on how we understand and come to know queer parenthood. Whilst there are now many routes into lesbian motherhood and the stigma of queer kinship is diminishing, this article demonstrates the need to problematize the prevailing narratives of coupledom that are emerging and tease apart the conflation of temporal <b>progression,</b> <b>progressive</b> rights and narratives of progress...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recent {{findings}} suggest that patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD) differ in their disease <b>progression</b> (<b>progressive</b> vs nonprogressive patients). The current study investigates whether the two groups can be discriminated by their clinical features at first presentation. Methods: Archival clinical data of the Early Onset Dementia Clinic, Cambridge, UK, were analysed for 71 patients with bv-FTD: 45 progressive and 26 nonprogressive cases with more than 3 years of follow-up. Results: The subgroups were largely indistinguishable {{on the basis of}} the presenting clinical features but could be distinguished on general cognitive (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-revised) and selected supportive diagnostic features (distractibility, stereotypic speech, impaired activities of daily living (ADLs) and current depression). Conclusions: Progressive and non-progressive patients are difficult to differentiate on the basis of current clinical diagnostic criteria for FTD but a combination of general cognitive, executive dysfunction and impaired ADL measures appear to be the most promising discriminators...|$|E

40|$|Oocyte meiotic {{progression}} and maternal-to-zygote transition {{are accompanied}} by dynamic epigenetic changes. The functional significance of these changes and the key epigenetic regulators involved are largely unknown. Here we show that Setdb 1, a lysine methyltransferase, controls the global level of histone H 3 lysine 9 di-methyl (H 3 K 9 me 2) mark in growing oocytes. Conditional deletion of Setdb 1 in developing oocytes leads to meiotic arrest at the germinal vesicle and meiosis I stages, resulting in substantially fewer mature eggs. Embryos derived from these eggs exhibit severe defects in cell cycle <b>progression,</b> <b>progressive</b> delays in preimplantation development, and degeneration before reaching the blastocyst stage. Rescue experiments by expressing wild-type or inactive Setdb 1 in Setdb 1 -deficient oocytes suggest that the catalytic activity of Setdb 1 is essential for meiotic progression and early embryogenesis. Mechanistically, up-regulation of Cdc 14 b, a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits meiotic progression, greatly contributes to the meiotic arrest phenotype. Setdb 1 deficiency also leads to derepression of transposons and increased DNA damage in oocytes, which likely also contribute to meiotic defects. Thus, Setdb 1 is a maternal-effect gene that controls meiotic progression and is essential for early embryogenesis. Our results uncover an important link between the epigenetic machinery and the major signaling pathway governing meiotic progression...|$|E
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) {{represents a}} neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive muscular paralysis reflecting degeneration of motor neurons {{in the primary}} motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Degeneration of {{the upper and lower}} motor neurons leads to spasticity, impaired reflexes, muscle fatigue, muscle weakness, and eventually atrophy. Affected individuals vary significantly in the locus of disease onset, presentation at diagnosis, and rate of <b>progression.</b> <b>Progressive</b> degenerative disease such as ALS put young patients in a non-self-sufficient condition, leading to an increasing strain in terms of time and money for their families and caregivers. Moreover, patients with severe abnormalities of stomatognathic system worse their conditions and caregivers situation, increasing the work stress.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Friedreich's ataxia {{patients}} are homozygous for expanded alleles of a GAA triplet-repeat sequence in the FXN gene. Patients develop progressive ataxia due to primary neurodegeneration involving the {{dorsal root ganglia}} (DRGs). The selective neurodegeneration {{is due to the}} sensitivity of DRGs to frataxin deficiency; however, the progressive nature of the disease remains unexplained. Our objective was to test whether the expanded GAA triplet-repeat sequence undergoes further expansion in DRGs as a possible mechanism underlying the progressive pathology seen in patients. METHODS: Small-pool polymerase chain reaction analysis, a sensitive technique that allows the measurement of repeat length in individual FXN genes, was used to analyze somatic instability of the expanded GAA triplet-repeat sequence in multiple tissues obtained from six autopsies of Friedreich's ataxia patients. RESULTS: DRGs showed a significantly greater frequency of large expansions (p < 0. 001) and a relative paucity of large contractions compared with all other tissues. There was a significant age-dependent increase in the frequency of large expansions in DRGs, which ranged from 0. 5 % at 17 years to 13. 9 % at 47 years (r = 0. 78; p = 0. 028). INTERPRETATION: Progressive pathology involving the DRGs is likely due to age-dependent accumulation of large expansions of the GAA triplet-repeat sequence. Thus, somatic instability of the expanded GAA triplet-repeat sequence may contribute directly to disease pathogenesis and <b>progression.</b> <b>Progressive</b> repeat expansion in specific tissues is a common theme in the pathogenesis of triplet-repeat diseases...|$|E

40|$|A 44 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of {{pulmonary}} embolism and abdominal echinococcosis complained of sudden thoracic pain and shortness of breath. A D-dimer of 77. 5 mg/l (reference ≤ 0. 5 mg/l) was found. Chest CT scan revealed obstruction of the right lower and middle lobe pulmonary artery (PA). Anticoagulation therapy was initiated for the presumed diagnosis of recurrent pulmonary embolism. However, due to persistent symptoms of dyspnea, follow-up CT angiography of the chest was performed 3 months later. A persistent PA obstruction was found and the presumed diagnosis of embolism was questioned. Subsequently, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging was performed to support an alternative diagnosis. EBUS imaging showed an inhomogeneous, sharply demarcated, intravascular lesion with round hypoechoic areas compatible with cysts. The diagnosis of embolism was rejected and treatment with albendazole was initiated for pulmonary echinococcosis. Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease and cystic spread in the PA is exceptional.

40|$|Background: The {{diagnosis}} of tumour <b>progression</b> or <b>progressive</b> disease (PD) {{is a key}} element for designing and interpreting contemporary phase II trials. In some cases, PD is stated by the physician and is not formally confirmed by imaging. Purpose: In this study, we intend to analyze the value of the PD based on clinical judgment and the risk of overestimating the occurrence of PD by clinical judgment. Methods: We have conducted a single-centre retrospective study to analyse the diagnostic accuracy of this clinical judgment compared to planned imaging including all patients enrolled in our institution in phase II trials investigating systemic treatments for advanced solid tumours between January 2008 and November 2010. Results: The positive predictive value (PPV) and the specificity of clinical judgment of PD was very high (. 90 %). Conclusions: According to this study, the clinical judgment of PD is highly predictive of radiological PD as assessed, for example, by RECIST. Physicians do not overestimate PD occurence.

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{temporal}} evolution of spinal cord (SC) atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS), and {{its association with}} clinical progression in a large MS cohort. Methods A total of 352 patients from two centres with MS (relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) : 256, secondary progressive MS (SPMS) : 73, primary progressive MS (PPMS) : 23) were included. Clinical and MRI parameters were obtained at baseline, after 12 months and 24 months of follow-up. In addition to conventional brain and SC MRI parameters, the annualised percentage brain volume change and the annualised percentage upper cervical cord cross-sectional area change (aUCCA) were quantified. Main outcome measure was disease progression, defined by expanded disability status scale increase after 24 months. Results UCCA was lower in SPMS and PPMS compared with RRMS for all time points. aUCCA over 24 months was highest in patients with SPMS (- 2. 2 % per year) and was significantly higher in patients with disease progress ion (- 2. 3 % per year) than in stable patients (- 1. 2 % per year; p= 0. 003), while annualised percentage brain volume change did not differ between subtypes (RRMS: - 0. 42 % per year; SPMS - 0. 6 % per year; PPMS: - 0. 46 % per year) nor between progressive and stable patients (p= 0. 055).

Based on these findings, we propose a dualistic model for ovarian serous carcinogenesis. One pathway involves a stepwise progression from SBT to noninvasive and then invasive MPSC. The other pathway is characterized by rapid progression from the ovarian surface epithelium or inclusion cysts to a conventional (high-grade) serous carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|Huntington's disease (HD) is {{characterized}} by a triad of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Although many of these symptoms are likely to be related to central nervous system pathology, others may be due to changes in peripheral tissues. The R 6 / 2 mouse, a transgenic model of HD expressing exon 1 of the human HD gene, develops progressive alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reminiscent of a Cushing-like syndrome. We observed muscular atrophy, reduced bone mineral density, abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance in the mice. All these changes could be consequences of increased glucocorticoid levels. Indeed, hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex and a progressive increase in serum and urine corticosterone levels were found in R 6 / 2 mice. In addition, the intermediate pituitary lobe was markedly enlarged and circulating adreno-corticotrophic hormone (ACTH) increased. Under normal conditions dopamine represses the ACTH expression. In the R 6 / 2 mice, however, the expression of pituitary dopamine D 2 receptors was reduced by half, possibly explaining the increase in ACTH. Urinary samples from 82 HD patients and 68 control subjects were analysed for cortisol: in accord with the observations in the R 6 / 2 mice, urinary cortisol increased in parallel with disease <b>progression.</b> This <b>progressive</b> increase in cortisol may contribute to the clinical symptoms, such as muscular wasting, mood changes and some of the cognitive deficits that occur in HD...|$|R

Methods Gait was recorded at self-selected preferred, fast, very fast, slow and very slow speeds. Stride length was normalized to leg length. Linear regression analyses were carried out between cadence and stride length. Other gait variables were compared for each participant’s ‘walk’ which had stride length closest to 1. 4. Results All groups showed a strong linear relationship between stride length and cadence with no difference between groups (p> 0. 05).

40|$|Background and purpose: To {{assess the}} {{predictive}} value of T 2 lesions on {{the rate of}} progression of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: We reanalyzed T 2 lesion number and load on brain MRI scans, performed before 1997, of 186 MS patients, who were clinically followed. There were 90 patients with progressive MS (35 secondary progressive and 55 primary progressive), and 96 with relapsing remitting MS. The rate of progression of disability was measured by time to sustained progression of disability (defined as an increase in >= 1 point when the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was 5. 5 or less {{and an increase in}} EDSS of >= 0. 5 point when the EDSS was 6. 0 or higher), and by the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS). Results: During follow-up (median 15 years, IQR 12 - 17 years), 94 % of the patients with progressive MS and 50 % of the patients with relapsing remitting MS had progression of disability. Higher T 2 lesion number and load were modestly associated with a higher rate of disease progression on the MSSS and a shorter time to progression of disability in relapsing remitting MS, but not in progressive MS.

Curcumin is an antioxidant derived from Curcuma longa (turmeric or curcuma) which has the ability to react directly with reactive species and up-regulation of many cytoprotective and antioxidant proteins. The preventive roles of curcumin in nephropathies were reported, but there was little information on the protective effect of curcumin against lithium-induced nephrotoxicity. In this study, male Wistar rats divided into five groups of six each and were treated as follows: group 1; animals were received lithium chloride as 2 mmol/kg, group 2; animals were received normal saline (0, 5 %), group 3; animals were received curcumin (200 mg/kg), group 4 animals were received curcumin plus lithium and group 5; animals were received solvent intraperitoneally for three weeks.

Preclinical studies demonstrated early drug-induced apoptosis in tumour endothelial cells at 1 - 3 h and secondary tumour cell necrosis between 6 and 72 h. Methods: To capture both possible outcomes of OXi 4503 treatment on cell death, plasma samples for analysis by M 30 and M 65 ELISAs, which measure different circulating forms of cytokeratin 18 as biomarkers of apoptosis and necrosis, respectively, were collected from patients entered into the trial at early (4 / 6 h) and later time points (24 h, day 8 and day 15). Results: OXi 4503 induced a selective dose-dependent elevation in M 30 antigen levels (apoptosis) at 4 / 6 h and a similar elevation in M 65 antigen levels at 24 h (necrosis) consistent with its preclinical cell death profile. For the purposes of investigating potential biomarker relationships to patient characteristics, the trial population was divided into three groups based on radiological and clinical response: (a) early <b>progression,</b> (b) <b>progressive</b> disease and (c) stable disease (SD) /partial response. A significant increase in antigen concentrations was measured by M 65 at 24 h in the SD group compared with the two other groups (P= 0. 015, mean increase 30. 9 %).

Biotin is a vitamin acting as a coenzyme for carboxylases involved in key steps of energy metabolism and fatty acids synthesis. Among others, biotin activates acetylCoA carboxylase, a potentially rate-limiting enzyme in myelin synthesis. The aim of this pilot study is to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of high doses of biotin in patients suffering from progressive MS. Uncontrolled, non-blinded proof of concept study 23 consecutive patients with primary and secondary progressive MS originated from three different French MS reference centers were treated with high doses of biotin (100 - 300 mg/day) from 2 to 36 months (mean= 9. 2 months). Judgement criteria varied according to clinical presentations and included quantitative and qualitative measures. In four patients with prominent visual impairment related to optic nerve injury, visual acuity improved significantly. Visual evoked potentials in two patients exhibited progressive reappearance of P 100 waves, with normalization of latencies in one case. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) in one case showed a progressive normalization of the Choline/Creatine ratio.

40|$|Abstract. This {{learning}} <b>progression</b> describes <b>progressive</b> {{levels of}} understanding for core concepts in modern genetics. The progression extends from 5 th to 10 th grade. We have organized the core ideas in this learning progression around two {{questions in the}} discipline: (a) how do genes influence how we, and other organisms, look and function? And (b) Why do we vary in how we, and other organisms, look and function? We identified eight big ideas that are needed to successfully reason about these questions. The target performances of this progression thus involve generating several types of mechanistic explanations: explanations that link our genotype to our phenotype; explanations of the processes by which our genes are passed on {{from generation to generation}} and how they contribute to genetic variation; and explanations of the sources of variation in phenotype (including environmental interactions with our genes). The learning progression describes three levels of understandings that allow the progressive construction of the explanations described above. Associated with the big ideas are learning performances that range in their complexity and can help determine a student’s level of understanding. 1 The Domain Modern genetics extends the explanatory models of classical genetics into the realm of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underly the patterns of inheritance described by the classical models. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous scientific and technological advances in this domain. The current state of affairs increases the demand for scientific literacy placed on the public because many of the novel technologies and discoveries are entering the public realm. Citizens are expected {{to be able to make}} decisions about genetic screening, stem cell research, genetically manipulated foods, etc. Without a sound understanding of core ideas in genetics such decisions are, at best, uninformed.

There is increasing evidence to suggest that, in many patients, the {{signs and symptoms of}} BPH are <b>progressive.</b> <b>Progression</b> can be measured as continued growth of the prostate gland; worsening of symptoms, bother, or quality of life; deterioration of urinary flow rate; episodes of acute urinary retention (AUR); and need for prostate-related surgery.

The 5 -α-reductase inhibitor finasteride has been shown not only to improve symptoms, bother, and quality of life but also to prevent progression to AUR and surgery, with a relative risk reduction of over 50 %. As the risk for such progression is higher in patients with larger glands or higher serum PSA values at baseline, it is in those patients that finasteride induces an even greater risk reduction, making it a cost-effective treatment choice for patients with LUTS associated with prostatic enlargement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Brainstem gliomas {{are rare}} in adults. They most {{commonly}} {{occur in the}} pons and {{are most likely to}} be high-grade lesions. The diagnosis of a high-grade brainstem glioma is usually reached due to the presentation of rapidly progressing brainstem, cranial nerve and cerebellar symptoms. These symptoms do, however, overlap with a variety of other central nervous system disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging is the radiographic modality of choice, but can still be misleading. Case presentation A 48 -year-old Caucasian woman presented with headache and vomiting followed by cerebellar signs and confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were suggestive of a demyelinating process, but the patient failed to respond to therapy. Her condition rapidly progressed and she died. At autopsy, a high-grade invasive pontine tumor was identified. Histological evaluation revealed glioblastoma multiforme. Conclusion While pontine gliomas are rare in adults, those that do occur tend to be high-grade and rapidly <b>progressive.</b> <b>Progression</b> of symptoms from non-specific findings of headache and vomiting to rapid neurological deterioration, as occurred in our patient, is common in glioblastoma multiforme. While radiographic findings are often suggestive of the underlying pathology, this case represents the possibility of glioblastoma multiforme presenting as a deceptively benign appearing lesion. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{work toward}} an {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of cancer progression, we have followed the changes in expression of several genes in rat mammary carcinomas during the development of invasion. Tumors were induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and serially transplanted to isogeneic rats. Gene expression in individual cells was followed by immunofluorescence microscopy. We show that invading cells do not express the same genes as the primary tumor or normal adult mammary gland but are similar to the primitive mammary duct cells present in late embryos. In the most advanced tumors, the most fundamental epithelial characteristic, polarity, is lost. Relative to the mechanism of invasion, we observe that the basal lamina, often thinner than normal, always coats the strands of invading cells and may be entirely absent from single invasive cells only. These observations suggest that the basal lamina ultimately disappears because of reduced expression of the genes or the failure to assemble the components. In these tumors it is the progressive alteration in gene expression rather than the enzymatic breakdown of the basal lamina that leads to invasion. These results show that {{the most important aspect of}} cancer <b>progression</b> is the <b>progressive</b> alteration of gene expression. They also raise questions about the mechanism that causes tumor cells to retrace the steps in their differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Alberto Gajofatto Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy Abstract: Siponimod (BAF 312) is a {{synthetic}} molecule {{belonging to the}} sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) modulator family, which has putative neuroprotective properties and well-characterized immunomodulating effects mediated by sequestration of B and T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Compared to fingolimod (ie, precursor of the S 1 P modulators commercially available {{for the treatment of}} relapsing–remitting [RR] multiple sclerosis [MS]), siponimod exhibits selective affinity for types 1 and 5 S 1 P receptor, leading to a lower risk of adverse events that are mainly induced by S 1 P 3 receptor activation, such as bradycardia and vasoconstriction. In addition, S 1 P 1 and S 1 P 5 receptors are expressed by neurons and glia and could mediate a possible neuroprotective effect of the drug. A Phase II clinical trial of siponimod for RR MS showed a significant effect of the active drug compared to placebo on reducing gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 3  months of treatment. In a recently completed Phase III trial, treatment with siponimod was associated with a significant reduction in disability <b>progression</b> in secondary <b>progressive</b> (SP) MS patients compared to placebo. In this article, current evidence supporting siponimod efficacy for SP MS is reviewed. Keywords: multiple sclerosis, siponimod, progression, disability, treatmen...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a systemic}} disease characterized by chronic {{inflammation of the}} synovial joints damage and loss of the function. The ultimate goal in managing RA is to prevent joint damage and to maintain functional ability. Consequently, early diagnosis and treatment is important, but predictive markers for RA are still confined to auto- antibodies and also magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sonography {{do not appear to}} sufficiently distinguish between early RA and non RA. Evidence shows that substantial and irreversible joint damage already occurs within the first 2 years after disease onset. This “window of opportunity” hypothesis for therapeutic intervention in RA is based on the existence of a time frame within which there is a potential for a greater response to therapy, resulting in sustained benefits or, perhaps most important, a chance of cure. There is increasing evidence for beneficial effects of early DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) therapy over delayed treatment in patients who present with arthritis of recent onset. However, no universal consensus exists concerning the choice of initial drug or whether single drug or combination should be given as initial treatments. Most studies demonstrated superiority of aggressive over conventional approaches. Because the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α inhibitors have proved to stop joint damage <b>progression</b> in severe <b>progressive</b> RA, the achievement of these agents in early RA are currently of great interest...|$|R
40|$|A {{selective}} cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor decreases proteinuria and retards progressive renal {{injury in}} rats. BackgroundWe have previously shown that cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression {{is low in}} the renal cortex of adult rats, but is increased in macula densa/cortical thick ascending limb and in glomerular podocytes after subtotal renal ablation. MethodsTo evaluate the functional consequences of this increased COX- 2 expression, male rats were subjected to subtotal renal ablation and divided into four groups: (1) treatment with the selective COX- 2 inhibitor SC 58236, (2) treatment with vehicle, (3) treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, and (4) treatment with enalapril + SC 58236. The administration of drugs was begun {{on the third day}} after ablation and continued for 6 to 10 weeks. ResultsWithin one week after ablation, vehicle-treated rats developed hypertension. Although enalapril led to significant reductions in blood pressure, either alone or in combination with the COX- 2 inhibitor, SC 58236 alone did not significantly alter ablation-induced hypertension. However, the SC 58236 -treated animals exhibited levels of proteinuria at six weeks after ablation that were comparable to those seen with enalapril (vehicle, 47 ± 4; enalapril, 27 ± 2; SC 58236, 30 ± 2 mg/day; N = 7, P < 0. 01, each group compared with vehicle), and continued SC 58236 treatment led to persistent reductions in proteinuria at 10 weeks after renal ablation (vehicle, 77 ± 4; SC 58236, 50 ± 4 mg/day; N = 6, P < 0. 01). SC 58236 treatment also significantly reduced the percentage of glomeruli exhibiting segmental or global sclerosis at 10 weeks (32. 6 ± 7. 8 % vs. 10. 9 ± 2. 8 %, N = 6, P < 0. 03). Furthermore, SC 58236 treatment partially inhibited increases in transforming growth factor-β 1 mRNA expression and increases in collagen III and collagen IV mRNA expression. ConclusionsThese studies indicate that chronic treatment with a specific COX- 2 inhibitor may retard the <b>progression</b> of <b>progressive</b> renal injury, and suggest that such compounds can be used in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism by which COX- 2 inhibition is renoprotective...|$|R
40|$|Tumourigenesis is {{the result}} of {{increased}} cell number. Progressive neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by decreased cell number. These illnesses emphasize the life-threatening consequences of disrupting the delicate balance between cell growth, cell differentiation, and cell death. Exposure to chronic inflammation is a recognized risk factor for a variety of human cancers and progressive neurodegenerative diseases. This thesis represents an attempt to determine whether one endogenous proinflammatory agent, platelet activating factor (PAF), may participate in tumourigenesis and/or neurodegeneration. Data are presented to indicate that PAF is capable of inducing sustained alterations in both the rate of cell growth and the rate of cell death in non-inflammatory cells. This ability can be characterized as follows: (1) Brief stimulation (< 1 hr) of rodent and human fibroblasts and epithelial cells cultured in vitro induced PAF receptor activation, PKC activity, phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues, oxyradical production, and de novo gene expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos and the active cell death (ACD) -related gene clusterin. (2) Transient stimulation (1 - 6 hr) elicited long-term growth enhancement (60 - 80 days) characterized by increased focus formation, saturation density, autonomous cell growth, and AI growth in the absence of further ligand exposure. Cell proliferation was, apparently, mediated by increases in intracellular PAF concentrations triggering the synthesis and release of mitogenic factors. Growth enhancement was accompanied by induction of clusterin and urokinase plasminogen activator gene expression. (3) Prolonged exposure (72 hr) to PAF induced ACD when cells were cultured in the absence of excess growth factors. ACD was determined by changes in nuclear and cytoplasmic morphology and by DNA analysis. (4) The kinetics of these responses to PAF could be altered by introduction of an activated ras oncogene into cells. Transient exposure to PAF under suboptimal growth conditions was sufficient to elicit a defined period of cell loss in ras-transformed fibroblasts followed by growth enhancement in surviving cells. (5) Increased PAFR expression was associated with chronic neurodegenerative lesions and cell death in vivo using a kainic acid model of myoclonic epilepsy. In summary, PAF, was shown to be capable of disrupting the delicate balance between cell growth and cell death. In this manner, PAF may contribute to tumour <b>progression</b> and <b>progressive</b> neurodegenerative disorders...|$|R
