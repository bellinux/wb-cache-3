40|$|The PETRA {{storage ring}} at DESY will be {{upgraded}} {{to a third}} generation synchrotron radiation source with 15 beamlines in the PETRA III project [1]. Mobile pumping stations will be needed for the initial <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> <b>of</b> the beamlines and beamline components to a hydrocarbon-free and particle-free ultra-high vacuum [2]. They will be placed at the disposal for users to <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> and bake their experimental chambers and for leak detection. Since the old HASYLAB pumping station design used at DORIS does not fulfil the resulting requirements, a new pumping station was developed (see Fig. 1). Figure 1 : The new mobile dry pumping station for PETRA III beamlines. The outer dimensions of the station are adapted to the tight space in the PETRA tunnel. For mobility reasons {{it has a very}} narrow and rigid framework with rotatable wheels and four crane eyes on top. No part sticks out of the framework except the angle valve, for easy access.

To obtain similar conditions with the CP for hydrogen (H₂) and deuterium (D₂) pumping a lower helium panel temperature (T HP) is required {{in the case of}} H₂. This is achieved by reducing the He boiling pressure (p b) and thus the He boiling temperature (T b) via <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> <b>of</b> the He cryostat. The requirements are predicted by computations and verified experimentally for this case.

The cylindrical shocks occurring in exploding wires are, in general, divided into two types. In the first type the shock is generated by the wire explosion and in the second type the shock is generated by the heat conduction of the wire to the surrounding gas. Application of this mechanism to exploding tubes will enable us to create arc channels in arbitrary gaseous atmospheres with controllable plasma density with the contamination excluded.

The facility is also capable of providing thermal-vacuum simulation services to support testing of large lightweight structures, Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) systems, electric propulsion test programs, and other In-Space propulsion programs. A recently completed integrated system test demonstrated the refurbished thermal vacuum capabilities of the facility. The test used the modernized data acquisition and control system to monitor the facility during <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> <b>of</b> the vacuum chamber, operation of the liquid nitrogen heat sink (or cold wall) and the infrared lamp array.

The heat sink provided a uniform temperature environment of approximately 77 K (140 deg R) along the entire inner surface of the vacuum chamber. The recently rebuilt and modernized infrared lamp array produced a nominal heat flux of 1. 4 kW/sq m at a chamber diameter of 6. 7 m (22 ft) and along 11 m (36 ft) of the chamber s cylindrical vertical interior.

40|$|The broad {{interest}} in exploration of Mars demands instruments {{to be developed}} for the preliminary Mars Smart Lander Mission in 2009 by NASA. This report describes the development at the University of Michigan of a laboratory- scale Mars atmospheric sampling system redesigned after an earlier instrument built by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Texas. This sampling system will demonstrate a method for an instrument that measures the composition of Mars' atmosphere and the isotopic ratios of noble gases in the atmosphere, which {{tell us about the}} atmospheric loss processes. The analysis of these measurements will help determine the past and present climate on Mars and its atmospheric evolution. The technique is based on using two concentration modules with gas adsorbing material that scrubs away the gases of no interest like CO 2, CO, O 2 and water vapor, so that the trace amounts of noble gases can be determined by a mass spectrometer. The adsorbing materials that are used are different kinds of zeolite and one type of non-evaporable getter. Reproducibility of the tests will not only accurately measure the noble gases, it will also determine which zeolite that have the best characteristics and should be used in the future instrument as well as determine the life time of the non-evaporable getter. A short time limit for the project resulted in redesign and an almost complete system that is ready for test. A pressure region in the low 10 ^- 8 mbar was reached several times at <b>pump</b> <b>down</b> <b>of</b> the system before bakeout, which indicate a good vacuum.

One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure.

40|$|The {{study of}} 2 D {{materials}} is {{a rapidly growing}} area of research, where the ability to isolate and probe an individual single-layer specimen is of high importance. The levitation approach serves as a natural solution for this problem {{and can be used}} in ways complementary to the standard techniques. Experiments, including study of properties at high or close to melting temperatures, stretching, folding, vibration and functionalization, can be conducted on levitated 2 D materials. As a first step towards realization of all these ideas, one needs to develop and test a system allowing for control over the thermal state and orientation of mono-layer flakes. In this thesis, I present the results of implementation of the parametric feedback cooling scheme in a quadrupole ion trap for stabilization and cooling of graphene nanopletelets. I have tested and showed that the feedback allows to stabilize levitated graphene nanoplatelets in high vacuum conditions (< 1 microTorr) to have trapped life times longer than a week. Cooling of the center of mass motion to temperatures below 20 K for all translational degrees of freedom was observed. I have also studied the coupling of DC patch potentials, which were found to be present in the high vacuum chamber. Their effect on cooling was studied and the protocol for minimizing the noise coupling created by the DC fields was designed. We have shown that by varying DC voltages on a set of auxiliary DC electrodes, placed near the trap, one can balance out the DC fields and achieve the lowest cooling temperature. The settings corresponding to this temperature were measured to have a slow drift in time. Ability to tune the settings to balance this drift without breaking the vacuum was studied and found to be a viable solution for the drift cancellation. In addition, our effort in characterization of the flakes is presented. It was shown that the flake discharge quantization observed during the initial <b>pumping</b> <b>down</b> <b>of</b> the high vacuum chamber allows to extract absolute values of flake mass and charge. I also mention the issues experienced with estimation of the shape of the flake, as well as its temperature based on an equipartition theorem. Finally, I discuss the preliminary data on the precession and reorientation of the flakes in the presence of circularly polarized light (CPL) and DC stray fields. The dependence of flake orientation on the offset from the nulling settings is observed and is explained in terms of basic model of a solid charged disk in the presence of two torques created by CPL and DC stray fields...|$|R

The efficiency of heat pump system is affected by many factors. The amount <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> charge in the heat pump is a primary parameter that influences the energy efficiency. Undercharge or overcharge <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> degrade its performance and deteriorate system reliability. Therefore, heat pump should be charged with an optimum amount <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> to achieve high performance. However, {{it is difficult to}} calculate the optimum charge accurately because of the various components and operating parameters. Â In this paper, a trans-critical CO 2 Â heat pump system is set up to investigate the influence <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> charge on the performance of a small-sized heat pump water heater. The trans-critical CO 2 Â heat pump system is composed of a rotary compressor, a tube-in-tube evaporator and gas cooler, an electronic expansion valve (EEV), and an internal heat exchanger (IHX). The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the characteristics of the CO 2 heat pump under various refrigerant charging conditions.
