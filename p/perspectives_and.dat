5|$|Computer {{role-playing}} games (CRPGs) {{are once}} again popular. Recent titles, such as BioWare's Mass Effect series and Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls series, have been produced for console systems and have received multi-platform releases, although independently developed games are frequently created as personal computer (PC) exclusives. Developers of role-playing games have continuously experimented with various graphical <b>perspectives</b> <b>and</b> styles of play, such as real-time and turn-based time-keeping systems, axonometric and first-person graphical projections, and single-character or multi-character parties. Subgenres include action role-playing games, roguelikes and tactical role-playing games.|$|E

The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co-benefits for both parties. In example, if a partaking business were to add cool roofs, there will be a reduction in greenhouse gases which is beneficial for the environment as well as the need for excess energy which is beneficial for the business.|$|E

The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E
5|$|While the long-toed {{salamander}} {{is classified as}} least concern by the IUCN, many forms of land development negatively affect the salamander's habitat and have put new <b>perspectives</b> <b>and</b> priorities into its conservation biology. Conservation priorities focus at the population level of diversity, which is declining at rates ten times that of species extinction. Population level diversity is what provides ecosystem services, such as the keystone role that salamanders play in the soil ecosystems, including the nutrient cycling that supports wetland and forested ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|In 1953 the {{collection}} of 17 short stories El trueno entre las hojas (1953; Thunder Among the Leaves) was published and circulated internationally, {{but it was not}} until the 1960 publication of the novel Hijo de hombre (Son of Man) that Roa Bastos won major critical and popular success. The novel draws on the oppressive history of Paraguay from the rule of Dr. Jose Gaspar de Francia in the early 19th century until the Chaco War in the 1930s. Its multiple narrative <b>perspectives</b> <b>and</b> historical and political themes anticipate his most famous work, Yo, el Supremo, written more than a decade later. Roa Bastos adapted Hijo de hombre into an award-winning film in the same year as its publication.|$|E
5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the {{many different}} forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, <b>perspectives</b> <b>and</b> relationships of and among the elements.|$|E

40|$|Present-fatalistic time {{perspective}} {{refers to}} a fatalistic, helpless, and hopeless attitude toward the future and life, and researches have suggested it was negatively associated with life satisfaction. However, age may moderate such an association. In the current study, participants aged 12 to 84 years (N = 1598) finished measures of present -fatalistic time <b>perspective</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction with life. Then moderation analysis was conducted to examine whether age would moderate the association between the present-fatalistic time <b>perspective</b> <b>and</b> life satisfaction. Results indicated that age played a moderating role in the association between the present-fatalistic time <b>perspective</b> <b>and</b> life satisfaction across the lifespan. Specifically, present-fatalistic time <b>perspective</b> <b>and</b> life satisfaction were negatively correlated in participants with younger and middle age, but not correlated in older participants. The {{limitations of this study}} and future directions are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
