40|$|Companies in India {{have responded}} to the {{challenges}} of globalization in various ways. One of the strategies to survive in the market was to reduce the cost by {{reduction in the number of}} employees with the help of Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS). This paper examines different types of VRS offered by the companies in the year 1999 - 2000 in India. It also examines the effect of VRS on the profitability of companies. Findings are based on the VRS of 30 companies from diverse sectors. Findings indicate that there is no fixed pattern of VRS among companies in India. Different companies adopt different forms of VRS. The implementation of VRS also differs significantly between companies. The results indicate that framing an attractive VRS by offering high compensation to employees is not important. The success of VRS depends on how the scheme is implemented and the perception of the <b>persons</b> <b>opting</b> of VRS and the survivors. The key concerns for the successes of VRS are effective communication, building trust among employees about procedural justice and involvement of multiple stakeholders. ...|$|R

A total of 126 couples underwent prenatal diagnosis (PND) on 216 foetuses: 185 (86 %) direct tests and 31 (14 %) exclusion tests. In 9 % of direct tests the risk for the foetus was 25 %. Four at-risk parents (4 %) carried intermediate alleles. Ninety-one foetuses had CAG expansions ≥ 36 % or 50 % risk haplotypes: 75 (82 %) were terminated for HD, 12 (13 %) were carried to term; four pregnancies were miscarried, terminated for other reasons or lost to follow-up. Unaffected pregnancies (122 foetuses) resulted in the birth of 112 children. The estimated uptake of PND was 22 % of CAG expansion carriers (≥ 36 repeats) at reproductive age.

40|$|Introduction: A person 2 ̆ 7 s {{identity}} {{relates to}} individual 2 ̆ 7 s comprehension of himor {{herself as a}} discrete, separate entity, their self-esteem, individuality, self-reflection and the awareness of self. It is in constant pursuit to find {{answers to the questions}} like "Who are we?", "Where do we comefrom?", "What is our meaning and purpose of life?" Several authors define identity as three basic categories: identity as a self-image, identity as a cluster of feature attributes and identity as a reflection of different socialsystems. Several age-related physiological and pathological changes can lead to the identity crises. As many elderly <b>persons</b> <b>opt</b> for residential homesand experience problems of adaptation to living an institutionalised life, the identity crisis often occurs. Nurses should therefore be susceptiblealso to these aspects of aging while satisfying the physiological and psychosocial needs of their clients. Aim: The paper aims to assess the elderly personsć individual and narrow social identity according to their sex,age, education and social environment they lived in prior to entering an institution and define the role of nurses in the prevention of their identity crises. Methods: The research project was conducted in a form of a questionnaire encompassing 36 closed-ended survey questions. 15 questions addressed individual identity, 18 the narrow social identity and 3 the larger social (collective) identity. Within each kind of identity strong and weak identity was further expressed. The Pearson chi-square test was used in determining the difference of identity expression according to sex, age, educational level and the prior social environment of the respondents. Results: Included in the study were 164 elderly home residents, aged 65 through 97. No statistically significant difference was identified in the respondents 2 ̆ 7 individual identity.

The value of the free services provided by these caregivers has been estimated at over 300 billion dollars annually; more {{than the cost of}} nursing home and home health care combined. ^ There has been extensive research examining the burdens associated with caregiving however, there is a dearth of research examining the transition experience. Without understanding the caregiver 2 ̆ 7 s experience of the transition of a loved one to home hospice care, we are unlikely to improve it. Using Colaizzi 2 ̆ 7 s method of analysis, this existential phenomenological study examined the caregiver 2 ̆ 7 s experience as they transitioned from life sustaining care to home hospice care with their dying loved one. Eleven caregivers participated in the study. The resulting six themes are described metaphorically as a social war; (1) dropping the bomb; (2) casualties of war; (3) being drafted; (4) bootcamp; (5) shell shocked; and (6) extended tour of duty. The fundamental structure of the phenomenon of the caregiver 2 ̆ 7 s experience of the transition to home hospice care includes the essences; inadequate and insensitive communication, prolonged suffering, compassionless presence, insufficient support and educational resources at the time of discharge, pervasive emotional turmoil, inadequate discharge options for terminally ill <b>persons</b> <b>opting</b> for hospice care, and the ongoing willingness of caregivers to go to battle with their love ones until the end. This research provides the impetus for developing and delivering the educational resources necessary for caregivers to bring their dying loved one home.

Very often the <b>person</b> that <b>opts</b> for an abortion is merely an adolescent, who is still en route to adulthood. The adolescent's teacher shares the responsibility of the parent to accompany the adolescent to this procedure. The primary objective of the research was to determine from a socio-educational perspective what specific view teachers have of an abortion during adolescence. In order to achieve this, a qualitative method of research was used, with data being collected by means of focus-group interviews, through purposive sampling. The transcriptions were subjected to descriptive analysis. The findings of the research are presented and guidelines offered to teachers on more effectively accompanying the adolescent of our present-day society who plans to have an abortion or has had one.

40|$|The {{definition}} of individual liberty as {{the absence of}} coercion or violence (threatened or actual) includes a circularity problem. A look at prominent representatives of classical liberalism and libertarianism (Hayek, Rothbard, Hoppe, Jasay) reveals that this is typical of classical liberals {{as well as of}} libertarians, though the latter avoid a confusion of power and freedom. However, the respective definitions of individual liberty analysed here rest on the assumption that coercion (or violence) presupposes the absence of the (voluntary) agreement of the coerced party. Thus they use the definiendum in a modified form (voluntariness) as part of the definiens in order to define the definiendum. The resulting circle can be avoided by looking at coercion and freedom (non-coercion) as representatives of the class of two-level decisions (meta-decision and object-decision) with different costs on the meta-level. While coercion means that the coerced party has to face or faces artificial costs in case of a negative meta-decision, non-coercion (freedom) does not. As a conclusion we define freedom as the absence of artificial interference in the private sphere of another person that would produce artificial costs for that <b>person</b> if she/he <b>opted</b> for a negative meta-decision...|$|R
