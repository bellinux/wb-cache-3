40|$|The use of <b>pressure</b> relief <b>shafts</b> {{has often}} been {{proposed}} {{as a means of}} reducing pressure fluctuations and of improving passenger comfort on board high-speed trains in tunnels. The recently opened rail-link between Mattstetten-Rothrist in Switzerland {{is one of the first}} rail projects where such shafts became an integral part of the project right from the design stage. The effectiveness of <b>pressure</b> relief <b>shafts</b> has been proven during the commissioning phase of this 45 km long new rail-link. Several aerodynamic measurements were conducted in different tunnels with and without <b>pressure</b> relief <b>shafts</b> and with different train types. One example is the double-track Emmequerung tunnel with a free cross-sectional area of Atunnel = 76 m 2 with two <b>pressure</b> relief <b>shafts</b> (Ashaft = 12. 25 m 2). The same tunnel without any <b>pressure</b> relief <b>shafts</b> would have required a larger free cross-sectional area of Atunnel = 105 m 2 in order to satisfy the project specific comfort criteria for various train types (∆ptrain < 1. 5 kPa within 4 s). In general, smaller tunnel cross-sections lead to reduced construction costs. Furthermore <b>pressure</b> relief <b>shafts</b> can be combined with additional functions (egress path, smoke extraction, climate improvement, etc.). These advantages must be balanced with possible disadvantages (noise emissions, increased local air flows in the tunnel, etc.) and the limitations (ground overburden). The experience gained from the new Swiss rail-link shows that under certain conditions <b>pressure</b> relief <b>shafts</b> are effective and reasonable. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Piping systems {{commonly}} {{experience the}} transient-state situation {{as the result}} of changes to ow conditions during pump failures, valve closures or turbine load rejection. This paper addresses transients {{as a consequence of the}} load rejection of a Francis hydropower plant (Karun 4, Ahwaz, Iran). To control the turbine system and related equipment during load rejection, the valve closing law of wicket gates is of paramount importance. The pressure rise at the end of the <b>pressure</b> <b>shaft,</b> the pressure drop in the draft tube and the speed rise while the electromagnetic braking torque disappears are solely dependent on the closing curve. Thus, an optimum closing law can eliminate the probable risk of damage to the units. This paper develops a computational model to calculate water-hammer system components, such as pressure rise, speed rise, discharge variations and pressure uctuations. Results obtained from the present model are compared and validated with those obtained by a consultant at the Karun project. The eects of dierent valve-closing laws on the maximum head rise at the end of the <b>pressure</b> <b>shaft</b> and other components are also investigated...|$|E
