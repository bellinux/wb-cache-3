40|$|Abstract. <b>Press</b> {{hardening}} <b>steel</b> {{has become}} a much used material in car body manufacturing due to its excellent safety and lightweight potential. In some recent car models <b>press</b> hardening <b>steel</b> has reached already a weight share of more than 20 % in the body structure while {{it is estimated that}} it could reach even around 40 % in the future. However conventional <b>press</b> hardening <b>steel</b> based on the alloying concept 22 MnB 5 was designed originally not for automotive application. In spite of the high strength level, <b>press</b> hardening <b>steel</b> has generally low toughness due to the relatively high carbon content and its martensitic microstructure. Particularly important is the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature at low temperature, which might lead to unexpected failure in cold climate regions. Furthermore, hydrogen embrittlement is a major concern in <b>press</b> hardening <b>steel</b> as previous results indicated that only a few ppm of hydrogen could induce delayed cracking. Generally it is important that impact energy should be absorbed by the material to avoid unexpected disintegration of the structure.

5|$|The Tiger {{went into}} {{production}} in June 1964, {{little more than}} a year after the completion of the Shelby prototype. Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by <b>Pressed</b> <b>Steel</b> in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods, including using a sledgehammer to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|E
