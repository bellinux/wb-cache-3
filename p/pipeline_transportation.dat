25|$|Upon {{forming a}} {{partnership}} with J. J. Vandergrift of Pittsburgh and George V.

During this period, Pitcairn built the Imperial Refinery at Oil City, Pennsylvania, and was heavily involved with the production, refining, and <b>pipeline</b> <b>transportation</b> of oil. With Vandergrift, he built and controlled the first natural gas pipeline for manufacturing purposes, and had a controlling stake in the Natural Gas Company, Ltd., founded {{in the summer of}} 1875, and later to become the Natural Gas Company of West Virginia. Through these and other successful investments in energy, mining, and banking, Pitcairn substantially expanded his wealth.|$|E

40|$|Leakage in {{pipelines}} {{has always been}} one of the main problems in <b>pipelines</b> <b>transportation</b> fluid. This fluid leakage can happened without any warning. The leaking of fluid in pipeline can give effects to the economic loss and environmental risk. Therefore, the early detection of leak is a main role in the fluid <b>transportation</b> <b>pipelines.</b> This paper presents a technique for early detection of leak in single pipe. The fluid pressure and flow rate velocity are considered as two dependent variables. The governing equations of transient flow were proposed. The mathematical formulation describes the solution process and then solved by the Method of Characteristics and Finite Different Method (FDM). The simulation of pipeline leakage with the three different diameters has been carried out by Matlab programming to see the behavior of pressure and flow in the upstream head and downstream head when leakage occurs. The results show; flow rate trends at the incoming fluid flow pipelines is not equal to outgoing fluid pipelines when leaking occurs and pressure trend at the incoming fluid also not equal to pressure trend outgoing fluid. These situations are obtained to indicate the early presence of leakage. This method provided a theoretical basis for early recognizing leakag...|$|R

40|$|Part 1 : Control Systems SecurityInternational audienceIndustrial {{control systems}} monitor and control {{critical}} infrastructure assets {{such as the}} electric power grid, oil and gas <b>pipelines,</b> <b>transportation</b> systems and water treatment and supply facilities. Attacks that impact the operations of these critical assets could have devastating consequences to society. The complexity and interconnectivity of industrial control systems have introduced vulnerabilities and attack surfaces that previously did not exist. The numerous communications paths and ingress and egress points, technological diversity and strict operating requirements provide myriad opportunities for a motivated adversary. This paper investigates the detection of integrity errors in industrial control systems by correlating state values from field devices. Specifically, it considers a formulation of the classic Byzantine Generals Problem {{in the context of}} industrial control systems. The results demonstrate that leveraging physical system properties allows the inference of system states to identify integrity compromises...|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : CONTROL SYSTEMS SECURITYInternational audienceIndustrial {{control systems}} are cyber-physical systems that {{supervise}} and control physical processes in critical infrastructures such as electric grids, {{water and wastewater}} treatment plants, {{oil and natural gas}} <b>pipelines,</b> <b>transportation</b> systems and chemical plants and refineries. Leveraging the stable and persistent control flow communications patterns in industrial control systems, this chapter proposes an innovative control system fingerprinting methodology that analyzes industrial control protocols to capture normal behavior characteristics. The methodology can be used to identify specific physical processes and control system components in industrial facilities and detect abnormal behavior. An experimental testbed that incorporates real systems for the cyber domain and simulated systems for the physical domain is used to validate the methodology. The experimental results demonstrate that the fingerprinting methodology holds promise for detecting anomalies in industrial control systems and cyber-physical systems used in the critical infrastructure...|$|R

Market capitalization is relevant in the Railroad and Motor Freight Transportation clusters, and the Transportation by Air cluster is the only one where CoC is influenced by money supply and gross capital formation. The explanatory power (R 2) of all models is very high in all clusters and is higher than R 2 of the analyses of CoC and macroeconomic values.|$|R
