2500|$|For any surface {{embedded}} in Euclidean space of dimension 3 or higher, {{it is possible}} to measure the length of a curve on the surface, the angle between two curves and the area of a region on the surface. This structure is encoded infinitesimally in a Riemannian metric on the surface through line elements and area elements. Classically in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}} only surfaces {{embedded in}} [...] were considered and the metric was given as a 2×2 <b>positive</b> <b>definite</b> <b>matrix</b> varying smoothly from point to point in a local parametrization of the surface. The idea of local parametrization and change of coordinate was later formalized through the current abstract notion of a manifold, a topological space where the smooth structure is given by local charts on the manifold, exactly as the planet Earth is mapped by atlases today. Changes of coordinates between different charts of the same region are required to be smooth. Just as contour lines on real-life maps encode changes in elevation, taking into account local distortions of the Earth's surface to calculate true distances, so the Riemannian metric describes distances and areas [...] "in the small" [...] in each local chart. In each local chart a Riemannian metric is given by smoothly assigning a 2×2 <b>positive</b> <b>definite</b> <b>matrix</b> to each point; when a different chart is taken, the matrix is transformed according to the Jacobian matrix of the coordinate change. The manifold then has the structure of a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold.|$|E
