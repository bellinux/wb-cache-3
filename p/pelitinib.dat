The {{studies are}} about SKBR 3 and T 47 D, two human breast cancer cells which {{proved to be}} sensitive and resistant against the particular Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) /ErbB- 2 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor <b>pelitinib</b> (EKB- 569, Wyeth).

40|$|International audienceResistance against {{first and}} second {{generation}} (irreversible) ErbB inhibitors is an unsolved problem in clinical oncology. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of the irreversible ErbB inhibitors <b>pelitinib</b> and canertinib on growth of breast and ovarian cancer cells. Although in vitro growth-inhibitory effects of both drugs exceeded by far the effects of all reversible ErbB blockers tested (lapatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib), complete growth inhibition was usually not reached. To define the mechanism of resistance, we examined downstream signaling pathways in drug-exposed cells by Western blot analysis. Although ErbB phosphorylation was reduced by <b>pelitinib</b> and canertinib, activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway remained essentially unaltered in drug-resistant cells. Correspondingly, transfection of tumor cells with constitutively activated AKT was found to promote resistance against all ErbB inhibitors tested, whereas dominant negative AKT reinstalled sensitivity in drug-resistant cells. In a next step, we applied PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR blockers including the dual PI 3 K/mTOR kinase inhibitor NVP-BEZ 235. These agents were found to cooperate with <b>pelitinib</b> and canertinib in producing in vitro growth inhibition in cancer cells resistant against ErbB-targeting drugs. In conclusion, our data show that ErbB drug-refractory activation of the PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a crucial role in resistance against classical and second-generation irreversible ErbB inhibitors, and NVP-BEZ 235 can override this form of resistance against <b>pelitinib</b> and canertinib...|$|E
40|$|Background: Oncogenic {{activation}} of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway occurs in a variety tumour types, albeit in human melanoma the contribution of EGFR is still unclear. Methods: The potential role of EGFR was analyzed in four BRAF-mutant, one NRAS-mutant and one wild-type NRAS-BRAF-carrying human melanoma cell lines. We have tested clinically available reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) gefitinib and erlotinib, irreversible EGFR-TKI <b>pelitinib</b> and a reversible experimental compound (PD 153035) on in vitro proliferation, apoptosis, migration {{as well as in}} vivo metastatic colonization in a spleen-liver model. Results: The presence of the intracellular domain of EGFR protein and its constitutive activity were demonstrated in all cell lines. We detected significant differences between the efficacies of EGFR-TKIs, irreversible inhibition had the strongest anti-tumour potential. Compared to BRAF-mutant cells, wild-type BRAF associated with relative resistance against gefitinib. In combination with gefitinib, selective mutant BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib showed additive effect in BRAF-mutant cell lines. Treatment of BRAF-mutant cells with gefinib- or <b>pelitinib</b> attenuated in vitro cell migration and in vivo colonization. Conclusions: Our preclinical data suggest that EGFR is a potential target in the therapy of BRAF-mutant malignant melanoma; however, more benefits could be expected from irreversible EGFR-TKIs and combined treatment settings...|$|E
40|$|EKB- 569 (<b>Pelitinib),</b> an {{irreversible}} EGFR {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor has shown potential therapeutic efficiency in solid tumors. However, cell-killing potential {{in combination with}} radiotherapy and its underlying molecular orchestration remain to be explored. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of EKB- 569 on ionizing radiation (IR) -associated NFkB-dependent cell death. SCC- 4 and SCC- 9 cells exposed to IR (2 Gy) with and without EKB- 569 treatment were analyzed for transactivation of 88 NFkB pathway molecules, NFkB DNA-binding activity, translation of the NFkB downstream mediators, Birc 1, 2 and 5, cell viability, metabolic activity and apoptosis. Selective targeting of IR-induced NFkB by EKB- 569 and its influence on cell-fate were assessed by overexpressing (p 50 /p 65) and silencing (DIkBa) NFkB. QPCR profiling after IR exposure revealed a significant induction of 74 NFkB signal transduction molecules. Of those, 72 were suppressed with EKB- 569. EMSA revealed a dose dependent inhibition of NFkB by EKB- 569. More importantly, EKB- 569 inhibited IR-induced NFkB in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibition was sustained up to at least 72 h. Immunoblotting revealed a significant suppression of IR-induced Birc 1, 2 and 5 by EKB- 569. We observed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability, metabolic activity and apoptosis with EKB- 569. EKB- 569 significantly enhanced IR...|$|E
40|$|Deregulation of ErbB/HER {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases {{has been}} linked to several types of cancer. The mechanism of activation of these receptors includes establishment of receptor dimers. Here, we have analyzed the action of different small molecule HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on HER receptor dimerization. Breast cancer cell lines were treated with distinct TKIs and the formation of HER 2 -HER 3 dimers was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation and western blot or by Förster resonance energy transfer assays. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was analyzed by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase and cell viability. Lapatinib and neratinib interfered with ligand-induced dimerization of HER receptors; while <b>pelitinib,</b> gefitinib, canertinib or erlotinib did not. Moreover, lapatinib and neratinib were able to disrupt previously formed receptor dimers. Structural analyses allowed the elucidation of the mechanism by which some TKIs prevent the formation of HER receptor dimers, while others do not. Experiments aimed at defining the functional importance of dimerization indicated that TKIs that impeded dimerization prevented down-regulation of HER 2 receptors, and favored the action of trastuzumab. We postulate that TKIs that prevent dimerization and down-regulation of HER 2 may augment the antitumoral action of trastuzumab, and this mechanism of action should be considered in the treatment of HER 2 positive tumors which combine TKIs with antireceptor antibodies.

40|$|Lung {{cancer causes}} {{a large number}} of deaths per year. Until now, a cure for this disease has not been found or developed. Finding an {{effective}} drug through traditional experimental methods invariably costs millions of dollars and takes several years. It is imperative that computational methods be developed to integrate several types of existing information to identify candidate drugs for further study, which could reduce the cost and time of development. In this study, we tried to advance this effort by proposing a computational method to identify candidate drugs for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a major type of lung cancer. The method used three steps: (1) preliminary screening, (2) screening compounds by an association test and a permutation test, (3) screening compounds using an EM clustering algorithm. In the first step, based on the chemical-chemical interaction information reported in STITCH, a well-known database that reports interactions between chemicals and proteins, and approved NSCLC drugs, compounds that can interact with at least one approved NSCLC drug were picked. In the second step, the association test selected compounds that can interact with at least one NSCLC-related chemical and at least one NSCLC-related gene, and subsequently, the permutation test was used to discard nonspecific compounds from the remaining compounds. In the final step, core compounds were selected using a powerful clustering algorithm, the EM algorithm. Six putative compounds, protoporphyrin IX, hematoporphyrin, canertinib, lapatinib, <b>pelitinib,</b> and dacomitinib, were identified by this method. Previously published data show that all of the selected compounds have been reported to possess anti-NSCLC activity, indicating high probabilities of these compounds being novel candidate drugs for NSCLC...|$|E
