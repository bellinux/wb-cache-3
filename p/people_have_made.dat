Wentz explained [...] "The whole campaign is part of the record and people can call it whatever they want, but the mixtape was part of that campaign, and we'll see what happens from here...In creating this autocratic organization, we created a democratic campaign, because <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it go the direction they wanted it to go." ...|$|E

[...] His nomination was opposed by liberal Republicans, who thought Goldwater's demand for rollback, defeat of the Soviet Union, would foment a nuclear war. He delivered a captivating acceptance speech. [...] "Instead, he devoted more care to his acceptance speech than to any other speech in his political career. And with good reason: he would deliver it to the largest and most attentive audience of his life. No other statement of the 1950s and 1960s, including The Conscience of a Conservative, presents more truly Barry Goldwater's basic beliefs and his positions on current issues." ...|$|E

Aren Maeir, a professor of archeology at Bar-Ilan University said [...] "a lot of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> many crazy claims about Atlantis – it’s one of those classic places where you have a lunatic fringe looking for all types of things.

2500|$|After the September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001, {{performances}} by the Boston Symphony Orchestra of excerpts from Klinghoffer were canceled. BSO Managing Director Mark Volpe remarked of the decision: [...] "We originally programmed the choruses from John Adams’ The Death of Klinghoffer {{because we believe}} in it {{as a work of}} art, and we still hold that conviction. ... explained that it was a purely human reason, and that it wasn’t in the least bit a criticism of the work." [...] Adams and Klinghoffer librettist Alice Goodman criticized the decision, and Adams rejected a request to substitute a performance of Harmonium, saying: [...] "The reason that I asked them not to do 'Harmonium' was that I felt that 'Klinghoffer' is a serious and humane work, and it's also a work about which many <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> prejudicial judgments without even hearing it. I felt that if I said, 'OK, [...] "Klinghoffer" [...] is too hot to handle, do [...] "Harmonium,"' that in a sense I would be agreeing with the judgment about 'Klinghoffer.'" [...] In response to an article by San Francisco Chronicle David Wiegand denouncing the BSO decision, musicologist and critic Richard Taruskin accused the work of catering to [...] "anti-American, anti-Semitic and anti-bourgeois" [...] prejudices.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock's second {{piece was}} [...] "The Woman's Part" [...] (1919), which {{involves}} the conflicted emotions that a husband feels {{as he watches}} his actress wife perform onstage. [...] "Sordid" [...] (1920) surrounds an attempt to buy a sword from an antiques dealer, with another twist ending. The short story [...] "And There Was No Rainbow" [...] (1920) is Hitchcock's first brush with possibly censurable material. A young man goes out looking for a brothel, only to stumble into the house of his best friend's girl. [...] "What's Who?" [...] (1920) at first glance {{seems to be a}} precursor to Abbott and Costello's [...] "Who's on First?" [...] routine, as it is a short dialogue piece resembling antic dialogue from a music hall skit. It captures the confusion that occurs when a group of actors decide to put together a sketch in which they will impersonate themselves. In the story’s forty sentences, confusion regarding the questions “Who’s me?” and [...] "Who’s you?” rise to comic emotional heights. [...] "The History of Pea Eating" [...] (1920) is a satirical disquisition on the various attempts that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> over the centuries to eat peas successfully. His final piece, [...] "Fedora" [...] (1921), is his shortest and most enigmatic contribution. It also gives a strikingly accurate description of his future wife Alma Reville, whom he had not yet met.|$|E
