The product of the adjacent gene faeR is involved in the positive control of faeD in response to ferulic acid. Moreover, ferulic acid acts in synergy with polygalacturonate to induce <b>pectate</b> <b>lyases,</b> the main virulence determinant of soft rot disease. Feruloyl esterases dissociate internal cross-links in the polysaccharide network of the plant cell wall, suppress the polysaccharide esterifications, and liberate ferulic acid, which contributes to the induction of <b>pectate</b> <b>lyases.</b> Together, these effects of feruloyl esterases could facilitate soft rot disease caused by pectinolytic bacteria...|$|R

40|$|The {{plant cell}} wall {{constitutes}} an essential protection barrier against pathogen attack. In addition, cell-wall disruption leads to accumulation of jasmonates (JAs), which are key signaling molecules for activation of plant inducible defense responses. However, whether JAs in return modulate the cell-wall composition to reinforce this defensive barrier remains unknown. The enzyme 13 -allene oxide synthase (13 -AOS) catalyzes the first committed step towards biosynthesis of JAs. In potato (Solanum tuberosum), {{there are two}} putative St 13 -AOS genes, which we show here to be differentially induced upon wounding. We also determine that both genes complement an Arabidopsis aos null mutant, indicating that they encode functional 13 -AOS enzymes. Indeed, transgenic potato plants lacking both St 13 -AOS genes (CoAOS 1 / 2 lines) exhibited a significant reduction of JAs, a concomitant decrease in wound-responsive gene activation, and an increased severity of soft rot disease symptoms caused by Dickeya dadantii. Intriguingly, a hypovirulent D. dadantii pel strain lacking the five major <b>pectate</b> <b>lyases,</b> which causes limited tissue maceration on wild-type plants, regained infectivity in CoAOS 1 / 2 plants.

A type II secretion system (T 2 SS) -deficient mutant of D. dadantii 3937, A 1919 (ΔoutC), lost the capability to promote the multiplication of EDL 933, whereas Ech 159 (ΔrpoS), a stress-responsive σ factor RpoS-deficient mutant, increased EDL 933 proliferation on lettuce leaves. A spectrophotometric enzyme activity assay revealed that A 1919 (ΔoutC) was completely deficient in the secretion of <b>pectate</b> <b>lyases</b> (Pels), which {{play a major role in}} plant tissue maceration.

Analysis of theD. dadantii 3937 genome revealed a gene encoding a new protein of the PL 9 family, which already includes the secreted endopectate lyase PelL and the periplasmic exopectate lyase PelX. We demonstrated that PelN is an additional extracellular protein secreted by the Out system. However, PelN has some unusual char-acteristics. Althoughmost <b>pectate</b> <b>lyases</b> require a very alkaline pH and Ca 2 for their activity, the PelN activity is optimal at pH 7. 4 and in the presence of Fe 2 as a cofactor. PelN is only weakly affected by the degree of pectin methyl esterification. The PelN structural model, constructed on the basis of the PelL structure, suggests that the PelL global topology and its catalytic amino acids are conserved in PelN. Notable differences concern the presence of additional loops at the PelN surface, and the replace-ment of PelL charged residues, involved in substrate binding, by aromatic residues in PelN. The pelN expression is affected by different environmental conditions, such as pH, osmolarity, and temperature. It is controlled by the repressors KdgR and PecS and by the activator GacA, three regulators ofD. dadantii pectinase genes.

30|$|Pectic {{substances}} {{are major}} constituents {{of the middle}} lamellae of plant cells that {{are present in the}} form of calcium and magnesium pectate, and they are high molecular weight, negatively charged and acidic polysaccharides (Jayani et al. 2005; Murad and Azzaz 2011).

The enzymes that hydrolyze pectic substances are broadly classified as pectinases or pectinolytic enzymes. These include two main groups: methyl esterases, which catalyze the removal of the methoxyl group from pectin to form pectate, and depolymerases (hydrolases and lyases), which split the backbone of both pectin and pectate by hydrolytic cleavage (polymethyl galacturonases and polygalacturonases) or trans-eliminative cleavage (pectin <b>lyases</b> and <b>pectate</b> <b>lyases)</b> (Yuan et al. 2011).|$|R
