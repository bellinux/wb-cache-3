50|$|The Collector's Edition of Dead Space 2 {{features}} {{a copy of}} the game, replica <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter,</b> CD soundtrack, DLC voucher (for access to the Unitology Suit and Force Gun) and artwork. In North America, all three system versions comes with the <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter.</b> In Europe, however, only the Xbox 360 and PC versions come with the <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter.</b> The PlayStation 3 version forgoes the replica gun and comes with Dead Space: Extraction, and a DLC voucher for access to the Rivet Gun. It is the HD version of Extraction which supports PlayStation Move, features co-op gameplay options, and has been updated to include full trophy support.|$|E
50|$|Analog <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters,</b> {{typically}} requiring {{more than}} 2 kilowatts, use a heavy mains-frequency transformer. Inverter <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters</b> rectify the mains supply to DC, which is fed into a high-frequency transistor inverter between 10 kHz to about 200 kHz. Higher switching frequencies allow smaller transformer resulting in overall {{size and weight}} reduction.|$|R

50|$|A {{plasma torch}} (also {{known as a}} plasma arc, plasma gun, or <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter)</b> is a device for {{generating}} a directed flow of plasma. The plasma jet {{can be used for}} applications including plasma cutting, plasma arc welding, plasma spraying, and plasma gasification for waste disposal.|$|E
50|$|CNC <b>Plasma</b> <b>Cutters</b> {{are also}} used in many {{workshops}} to create decorative metalwork. For instance, commercial and residential signage, wall art, address signs, and outdoor garden art.|$|R
50|$|The {{pattern for}} a fuel tank is {{generally}} cut using automated programmable machinery such as laser <b>cutters,</b> high definition <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters</b> or water jet cutters. These tools provide accuracy and process repeatability.|$|R
25|$|Closely {{related in}} design to {{three-phase}} AC synchronous motors, stepper motors and SRMs {{are classified as}} variable reluctance motor type. Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and computer numerical control (CNC) machines such as routers, <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters</b> and CNC lathes.|$|R
50|$|Anthony Howe (born 1954, Salt Lake City, Utah) is an American kinetic {{sculptor}} who creates wind-driven sculptures resembling pulsing, alien {{creatures and}} vortices. He {{makes use of}} computer-aided design, shaping the metal components with a <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter,</b> and completing his work by use of traditional metalworking techniques.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the Texas A&M College of Architecture {{completed}} an 8000 sq ft Built Environment Teaching and Research Facility {{also known as}} Architecture Ranch. The building contains a woodshop, a metal shop, and two digital fabrication machines: a CNC Mill and a CNC <b>Plasma</b> <b>Cutter.</b> Architecture Ranch is located on 12 acre of the Texas A&M RELLIS Campus.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{plasma cutting}} process {{involves}} creating an electrical channel of superheated, electrically ionized gas i.e. plasma from the <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> itself, {{through the work}} piece to be cut, thus forming a completed electric circuit back to the <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> via a grounding clamp. This is accomplished by a compressed gas (oxygen, air, inert and others depending on material being cut) which is blown through a focused nozzle at high speed toward the work piece. An electrical arc is then formed within the gas, between an electrode near or integrated into the gas nozzle and the work piece itself. The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through the work piece. At the same time, much of the high velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby separating i.e. cutting through the work piece.|$|E
50|$|Many {{workshops}} {{have the}} tools to manufacture steel targets out of hardened steel, {{but it is important}} that it is done correctly. For instance <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters</b> can be used, but angle grinders or normal welding damages the hardening. Hard drill bits are also needed to cut holes.|$|R
50|$|A {{specialized}} use of CNC <b>Plasma</b> <b>Cutters</b> {{has been}} in the HVAC industry. Software processes information on ductwork and creates flat patterns to be cut on the cutting table by the plasma torch. This technology has enormously increased productivity within the industry since its introduction in the early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>cutters</b> use {{a number}} of methods to start the arc. In some units, the arc is created by putting the torch {{in contact with the}} work piece. Some cutters use a high voltage, high {{frequency}} circuit to start the arc. This method has {{a number of}} disadvantages, including risk of electrocution, difficulty of repair, spark gap maintenance, and the large amount of radio frequency emissions. <b>Plasma</b> <b>cutters</b> working near sensitive electronics, such as CNC hardware or computers, start the pilot arc by other means. The nozzle and electrode are in contact. The nozzle is the cathode, and the electrode is the anode. When the plasma gas begins to flow, the nozzle is blown forward. A third, less common method is capacitive discharge into the primary circuit via a silicon controlled rectifier.|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} Isaac's {{profession}} as an engineer, the weapons in Dead Space are mostly improvised from mining tools, {{such as a}} <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> (for horizontal and vertical slicing), rotary saw, a hydrazine torch (repurposed as a flamethrower), a high-energy demolition beam, and a cannon that emits powerful shock waves. A military-grade automatic rifle is available, and Isaac can also attack enemies by clubbing them with his weapon or stomping on them. All weapons feature a secondary-fire mode; for example, the <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> can be rotated 90 degrees for more effective dismemberment of vertical limbs (such as legs on a normal bipedal humanoid). The player must scavenge for ammunition and items, which are found throughout the ship or dropped by Necromorphs when killed. Automated stores throughout the ship can be accessed {{to buy and sell}} items or store them for later use. The player can use workbenches to upgrade Isaac's suit and weapons.|$|E
50|$|Players {{can pick}} up and move objects, as well as {{manipulate}} switches and control panels. In addition they are given a data scanner that can interface with machinery, and a <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> than can cut through certain surfaces. As a service android, the player must repair damaged or inoperable systems, as well as aid and protect the station's sole human crew member, with whom they interact using dialog trees.|$|E
5000|$|Inspiration {{was created}} using {{three-dimensional}} modeling software. Kerber {{worked closely with}} architects and engineers to use digital design to create an efficient and creative work. The final image was programmed into a <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> which precisely cut the image. According to Kerber, the title [...] "Inspiration" [...] refers to [...] "the source of creativity {{as well as the}} functional role in relation to the building's system of breathing." ...|$|E
50|$|LinuxCNC is a {{software}} system for numerical control of machines such as milling machines, lathes, <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters,</b> routers, cutting machines, robots and hexapods. It can control up to 9 axes or joints of a CNC machine using G-code (RS-274NGC) as input. It has several GUIs suited to specific kinds of usage (touch screen, interactive development).|$|R
5000|$|With a 'Business-like, Business-led' ethos, {{the academy}} {{is built around}} core values of knowledge, skills and employability. The {{curriculum}} is taught through interactive learning in the school's Â£13.5 million resources, including a state-of-the-art Engineering Hall containing tools and machines like CNC routers, <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters,</b> lathes and milling machines {{as well as a}} welding centre.|$|R
5000|$|Plasma cutting is an {{effective}} of cutting thin and thick materials alike. Hand-held torches can usually cut up to 38 mm thick steel plate, and stronger computer-controlled torches can cut steel up to 150 mm thick. Since <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters</b> produce a very hot and very localized [...] "cone" [...] to cut with, they are extremely useful for cutting sheet metal in curved or angled shapes.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> {{manufacturers}} build CNC cutting tables, {{and some}} have the cutter built into the table. CNC tables allow a computer to control the torch head producing clean sharp cuts. Modern CNC plasma equipment is capable of multi-axis cutting of thick material, allowing opportunities for complex welding seams that are not possible otherwise. For thinner material, plasma cutting is being progressively replaced by laser cutting, due mainly to the laser cutter's superior hole-cutting abilities.|$|E
50|$|North Forge Fabrication Lab is a rapid {{prototyping}} workshop and business development facility located in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Founded in September 2011, it is a fabrication laboratory, intended to assist entrepreneurs in developing their ideas into physical prototypes. Facilities {{at the site}} include 3D printers in several sizes, CNC laser cutters from 50 to 120 watts, CNC milling machines, a <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter,</b> wood and metal lathes, and facilities for manufacturer and test of printed circuit boards. Software resources include various systems for computer aided design.|$|E
50|$|The machine uses {{linear guides}} in the X, Y, and Z axis {{including}} the gantry and custom flat connecting plates {{that can be}} fabricated {{with a number of}} tools including water jet cutter, <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter,</b> laser cutter, CNC mill or manually with a hacksaw and drill press. The FarmBot Genesis uses a belt and pulley system including NEMA 17 stepper motors with rotary encoders, GT2 belts and OpenBuilds v slot extrusions and wheels. Stainless steel screws, t-nuts, washers, bearings, driveshaft and leadscrew make the machine weather and corrosion-resistant allowing long term operation in outdoor environments.|$|E
50|$|The {{switch mode}} {{topology}} {{is referred to}} as a dual transistor off-line forward converter. Although lighter and more powerful, some inverter <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters,</b> especially those without power factor correction, cannot be run from a generator (that means manufacturer of the inverter unit forbids doing so; it is only valid for small, light portable generators). However newer models have internal circuitry that allow units without power factor correction to run on light power generators.|$|R
5000|$|Plasma cutting {{grew out}} of plasma welding in the 1960s, and emerged as a very {{productive}} way to cut sheet metal and plate in the 1980s. It had the advantages over traditional [...] "metal against metal" [...] cutting of producing no metal chips, giving accurate cuts, and producing a cleaner edge than oxy-fuel cutting. Early <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters</b> were large, somewhat slow and expensive and, therefore, tended to be dedicated to repeating cutting patterns in a [...] "mass production" [...] mode.|$|R
50|$|Weyrs {{are also}} the {{physical}} spaces in which dragons, their riders and support staff reside. Weyrs are usually built into the cliff faces of ancient volcanic calderas. Many of the living spaces are in natural cave systems within the cliff walls, but in early Passes when the colonists still had technology, <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters</b> were used to create extended systems and additional caves {{to meet the needs}} of the growing numbers of dragons. There are six ancient Weyrs as of beginning of the 9th Pass.|$|R
50|$|Advanced Shop: An {{almost entirely}} shop-oriented course and {{typically}} the student's last stop before graduation, Advanced Shop sets the student on live trucks and extremely advanced tasks, such as removing, overhauling, and reinstalling the engine successfully into a truck. Live projects {{are also used}} for training. Transmission, suspension, hydraulic, etc. projects are available. Students are also given some degree of freedom in learning how to cut and weld. Stick welding, gas welding, wire feed welding, {{as well as the}} proper use of a gas torch and <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> are covered. Students fabricate various stands, (for engines and other devices).|$|E
5000|$|The {{guard and}} his team then arrive at the dig site, telling Natalia {{that they are all}} {{relieved}} of duty and placed under arrest due to Carthusia's suspicion that the vid-log was made by one of them. Natalia rebuffs all these accusations then suddenly draws a <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> and kills the guard. When Jerry tries to calm Natalia down, she says she [...] "won't let them hurt it" [...] and even if they kill her [...] "He'd see her again." [...] This ends up distracting Natalia long enough for one of the other guards to knock her unconscious.|$|E
5000|$|The Bench weapon upgrade {{system from}} Dead Space and Dead Space 2 has been {{redesigned}} {{as a new}} upgrading system called the [...] "Weapon Bench". Here, players are able to construct new weapons from parts gathered throughout the game. The bench provides two main frames to start withâa light one-hand frame and a heavy two-hand frameâand players can build new weapons and put two weapons together (for example, a <b>plasma</b> <b>cutter</b> and a flamethrower). Examples of weapon functions include an electric rivet gun and an incendiary buzzsaw launcher. If a player {{does not want to}} build a weapon from scratch, they can choose from ready-made blueprints, including classic Dead Space and Dead Space 2 weapons. Built weapons can also be shared in co-op mode.|$|E
5000|$|Gunplay is {{influenced}} by the franchise's antagonists. Because Necromorphs are re-animated and re-purposed corpses, often lacking nervous, respiratory and circulatory systems, the conventions of stopping power are largely irrelevant to them. Thus, instead of targeting foes' heads or center of mass, players are encouraged to engage in [...] "strategic dismemberment" [...] by shooting off their arms and legs. Some Necromorphs can be easily defeated in this manner, but others may change attack patterns or even spawn entirely new enemies when slain. Relatedly, the game's weapons are characterized as being repurposed power tools or mining implements, such as <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters,</b> rotary saws and gravitic repulsion tools, though an increasing amount of dedicated military ordnance becomes available as the franchise progresses.|$|R
50|$|A Fab Lab {{consists}} of off-the-shelf, industrial-grade fabrication and electronics tools, wrapped in {{open source software}} and programs written by researchers at MITâs Center for Bits & Atoms. The Fab Lab suite of equipment supports design and fabrication activities. 2D and 3D software as well as micro scribes and scanners support the design portion of the project. To support the fabrication portion of the project vinyl cutters, laser engravers, 3D printers, mini-mills, CNC routers and <b>plasma</b> <b>cutters.</b> A video teleconferencing unit supports distance collaboration between labs. Students use all of these new, exciting, and different tools in learning to create new things and bring to life new ideas. TLHS Fab Lab Faculty include Mr. Mike Gorney, Mr. Brad Volkmann, and Mr. Al Votis.|$|R
5000|$|Other brand tie-ins are a <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutter</b> {{and other}} welding torches made by ESAB, {{designed}} by and named after Jesse James. [...] Airstream trailers {{had a deal}} as well, which included a WCC motorcycle with a sidecar made with a polished aluminum body to simulate {{the appearance of the}} iconic camper trailers. [...] Besides Yoo-hoo, another beverage company, Coors Brewing Company, added West Coast Choppers logos and pictures of bikes to their product in a mutually beneficial brand tie-in.|$|R
