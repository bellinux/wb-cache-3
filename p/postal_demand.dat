50|$|Since {{definitive}} {{series are}} issued {{over a period}} of time and are reprinted to meet <b>postal</b> <b>demand,</b> they often contain more variation than is typically found in stamps that have a single print run. Switching printing methods and experimenting with phosphors is a common source of variation in modern stamps, while differences in watermarks and perforation are also prevalent, especially in older stamps. Many philatelists study these differences as part of their hobby and try to collect all the varieties of each stamp. Some varieties are particularly rare and can be more valuable than others of the same stamp that may look the same to the casual observer. One notable example of this variation is the Machin stamps of the UK, where philatelists have identified over 1000 varieties of the same basic design.|$|E
40|$|This paper quantifies {{the shift}} in the household-level demand for postal {{delivery}} services over time and determines {{the extent to which}} it can be attributed to the appearance of alternative modes of communication and the concomitant rise in the relative price of postal delivery services. The specific questions addressed are: What are the own-price, cross-price and expenditure elasticities of household-level demand for postal delivery services and how have these magnitudes changed over time? What is the impact of the increasing penetration of home-computing technology on <b>postal</b> <b>demand?</b> What household characteristics predict differences in household-level <b>postal</b> <b>demand?</b> How has the aggregate demand for postal delivery services by U. S. households changed over this time period? The two major results to emerge from this analysis are: (1) postal price increases of the magnitude recently enacted on January 1, 1995 should lead to significant reductions in aggregate household-level expenditures [...] ...|$|E

50|$|To enable as {{many voters}} as {{possible}} to participate, postal voting can assist people {{who may not be}} able to attend a polling station in person, for example because of a physical disability, absence from the locality or some other reason. Postal voting is generally available to voters upon application, sometimes with restrictions. If no reason for a request is required, it may be called <b>postal</b> vote on <b>demand.</b> <b>Postal</b> voting may be an option for voters in some jurisdictions, while in some elections there may be all-postal voting.|$|R

50|$|In 1875, the 20 or so {{permanent}} {{residents of the}} area decided to call the area Long Beach City, even though the area was still considered part of Stafford Township. In 1894, Surf City was incorporated, changing its name to Surf City in 1899 after the United States <b>Postal</b> Service <b>demanded</b> a name change before the town could incorporate, preventing it from being confused with Long Branch in Monmouth County.|$|R
50|$|The {{strike was}} Britain's first {{national}} postal strike and began after <b>postal</b> workers <b>demanded</b> a pay rise of 15-20% then walked out after Post Office managers made a lower offer. The strike began on 20 January and lasted for seven weeks, finally ending with {{an agreement on}} Thursday 4 March. After voting over the weekend, the strikers returned to work on Monday 8 March 1971. The strike overlapped {{with the introduction of}} decimal currency in the U.K.|$|R

5000|$|The Cuban {{government}} of the República de Cuba issued stamps from its inception in 1902 until Fidel Castro assumed control on January 1, 1959. The first issue was on September 30, 1902. There were no stamps yet printed by Cuba, but they had many of the little used 3¢ allegory stamps of 1899. They choose to overprint these stamps to meet the 1¢ <b>postal</b> rate <b>demand</b> by overprinting a large numeral [...] "1" [...] on each stamp with the legend [...] "UN CENTAVO" [...] "HABILITADO" [...] and [...] "OCTUBRE 1902". Cubans continued to use the allegory stamps of 1899. In 1905, {{four of the five}} regular rate allegory stamps were reprinted for Cuba in the United States, but this time the printer made minute changes in each of the stamps before the reprint so as to make them distinguishable.|$|R
50|$|In April 2006, {{the postal}} order system {{underwent}} a revamp, enabling individual post offices to print <b>postal</b> orders on <b>demand</b> in any value from 50p through to 250 pounds, {{instead of the}} previous 50p to 20 pounds fixed range. As a result, single postal orders can now be purchased for odd denominations such as 66p or 99p, {{rather than having to}} make up odd amounts through a combination of pre-printed denominations and affixed stamps. This has made British postal orders similar to the money orders issued by post offices in the United States and many other countries.|$|R
50|$|Until 2012, {{entry to}} the race was via a <b>postal</b> lottery, with <b>demand</b> for places far outstripping the 1,500 spots available, {{restricted}} due to safety reasons. Applicants sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to the Marathon Runners Club before a specified deadline, at which date the Club sends all the applications to the prospective participants in the same delivery. The first 1,500 applications they then receive back are the 1,500 runners who gain entry. As a result, most participants were from the South of Florida and the Keys. Since 2012, registration has taken place online, typically with places filling up {{within an hour of}} opening.|$|R
30|$|Over the {{following}} years laws against communist activities on West German territory were further tightened. BMG and BMI frequently played a leading role. The amendments {{to the national security}} laws are a case in point. Since August 1951, it had been possible to proceed against the import and distribution of so-called ‘anti-constitutional’ (literally verfassungsverräterisch, ‘treasonable to the constitution’) publications. The measure was brought in at a time when SED and KPD were swamping the young Federal Republic with communist propaganda material. Representatives of the All-German Department had reacted immediately, while the law was still being debated, with a radical and unorthodox measure: they <b>demanded</b> <b>postal</b> censorship and a strict ban on the printing of communist propaganda within the Federal Republic.|$|R
50|$|Since 2001, any elector {{has been}} {{entitled}} {{to request a}} postal vote (known as <b>postal</b> voting on <b>demand)</b> without giving a reason, apart from in Northern Ireland, where postal voting is available only {{if it would be}} unreasonable to expect a voter to go to a polling station on polling day as a result of employment, disability or education restrictions. Prior to 2001, postal votes had been available since 1948 only to those unable to attend a polling station for reasons of ill health, employment or planned holiday away from home and to some electors living on small islands where they would need to cross water to reach their polling station. Before 1985, holidays were not a sufficient reason, and the employment criterion allowed only some professions.|$|R

He lent his son the remaining $800,000 at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in a filling station of Lauria, {{in the province of}} Potenza, shortly after the ransom was paid. After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but Getty refused to come to the phone. Nine people associated with 'Ndrangheta were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted. Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed {{for the rest of his}} life. He died 30 years later on February 5, 2011 at the age of 54.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} when Nixon took office in January 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7%, its highest rate since the Korean War, and rising. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. There was little unemployment (3.3%,), but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. That however could not be accomplished overnight. The administration adopted a policy of restricting {{the growth of the}} money supply to address the inflation problem. In February 1970, {{as a part of the}} effort to keep federal spending down, Nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months. When the nation's postal workers went on strike, he used the Army to keep the postal system going. In the end, the government met the <b>postal</b> workers' wage <b>demands,</b> undoing some of the desired budget-balancing. According to political economist Nigel Bowles's 2011 study of Nixon's economic policies, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency. The president and congressional Republicans entered the 1970 campaign season faced with unemployment, inflation, and Democratic demands for an incomes policy, all of which contributed to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Republicans gained two seats in the Senate but lost nine in the House; Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency).|$|R
40|$|European {{postal market}} has been {{challenged}} by changes in services that have questioned traditional postal service monopolies. The postal monopolies had evident lack of competitiveness, were not customer oriented, services were poor and unreliable. Postal services were traditionally state monopolies which had no tradition of flexibility and independence toward changing demand and growing competition in the postal market. Couple with this, technology advances, shifts in customer preferences and diminution in physical delivery demand, active competition from logistic companies and increasing internationalization brought the European Commission to modernize through a full liberalization of the postal services in each member state of the Union. Liberalization pursues to give free entrance to companies and bring competition, improvement in services, profitability and success. Some Member states are still unwilling to open their markets to competition due to anti-market ideologies, corporatist interests and protectionist reflex. On the contrary to the more conservative countries, Sweden was a pioneer in this regard. Swedish has preceded the EU postal liberalization starting in 1993, before any other member State. Sweden abolished the postal monopoly before first EU directive was released and even before it {{became part of the}} European Union (1995). This dissertation examines the liberalization process of the Swedish postal sector and its consequent transformation. The particularity of Posten AB is to be totally owned by the State but having transformed its organization to answer public policies and business objectives. A study of Posten AB’s internal restructuring, business models, key resources and service networking restructuring created an independent public corporation. It also explains a remarkable step toward being an innovative actor in the business of distribution by integrating into its business models electronic messages with physical mail distribution giving more value to the service. The dissertation proceeds to an analysis of competition and competitors faced by each Posten AB’s business division in a fully liberalized postal market. The information obtained is based on secondary research based on reports, articles, European Commission reports, Acts, books, Postal companies’ annual reports and newspapers rated with real customer’s information available in electronic sources. I reviewed and compare the process of partial and full liberalization of the postal sector in different EU member states in different time. This dissertation focused on Swedish liberalization process of the sector precisely because it was achieved before Sweden became part of the European Union. Posten is allowed, beside its public services duties to develop public services duties to develop independent business strategy based on an analysis of market demands. Posten has converted the traditional postal operator into an organization oriented to create and fasten business opportunities and increase competition. Posten brought investments, innovations, state-of-the-art technology and services and products improvements which resulted in sales increases and higher profitability. Posten’s successful experience demonstrates to other European postal services (and around the world) that overcoming actual challenges in <b>postal</b> market, <b>demand</b> to embrace actively the liberalization of services, by organizing its place in the competition and by restructuring toward technology and the accordingly renewed customers <b>demands.</b> The Swedish <b>postal</b> operators demonstrate that the issue is beyond being a survivor of market forces but materialize in the proactive self-organization of its own profitability and success...|$|R
