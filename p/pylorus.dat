5|$|During a Whipple's procedure, {{commonly}} used to treat pancreatic cancer by removing the pancreas, duodenum, {{and part of the}} jejunum, the ligament of Treitz is separated from the duodenum and preserved. When the remaining jejunum is anastamosed with the <b>pylorus</b> of the stomach, it may be passed through the ligament.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pylorus</b> is one {{component}} of the gastrointestinal system. Food from the stomach, as chyme, passes through the <b>pylorus</b> to the duodenum. The <b>pylorus,</b> through the pyloric sphincter, regulates entry of food from the stomach into the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|Type III: In the pyloric channel within 3cm of <b>pylorus.</b> Associated with acid oversecretion.|$|E
25|$|The outer {{longitudinal}} {{layer is}} responsible for moving the bolus towards the <b>pylorus</b> of the stomach through muscular shortening.|$|E
25|$|Pyloric {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} a <b>pylorus</b> that is narrow. This is due to congenital hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter. The lumen of the <b>pylorus</b> is narrower, and less food is able to pass through. This problem is often detected in the early weeks of life. When it is present, a newborn baby may projectile vomit after eating, but despite vomiting remain hungry. Pyloric stenosis may be managed by the insertion of a stent, or through surgical cutting of the pyloric sphincter, a pyloromyotomy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pylorus</b> is {{the furthest}} {{part of the}} stomach that connects to the duodenum. It {{is divided into two}} parts, the antrum, which connects to the body of the stomach, and the pyloric canal, which connects to the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|The end {{stage of}} type I and type II hernias {{occurs when the}} whole stomach migrates up into the chest by {{rotating}} 180° around its longitudinal axis, with the cardia and <b>pylorus</b> as fixed points. In this situation the abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stomach.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} pyloric {{stenosis}} are diagnosed/confirmed with ultrasound, if available, showing the thickened <b>pylorus</b> and non-passage of gastric contents into the proximal duodenum. Muscle wall thickness 3 millimeters (mm) or greater and pyloric channel length of 15mm or greater are considered abnormal in infants younger than 30 days.|$|E
25|$|The middle {{circular}} layer: At this layer, the <b>pylorus</b> {{is surrounded}} by a thick circular muscular wall which is normally tonically constricted forming a functional (if not anatomically discrete) pyloric sphincter, which controls the movement of chyme into the duodenum. This layer is concentric to the longitudinal axis of the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Pyloric {{stenosis}} is a {{narrowing of}} the opening from the stomach to {{the first part of}} the small intestine (the <b>pylorus).</b> Symptoms include projectile vomiting without the presence of bile. This most often occurs after the baby is fed. The typical age that symptoms become obvious is two to twelve weeks old.|$|E
25|$|Retroperitoneal {{parts are}} covered with adventitia. They blend into the {{surrounding}} tissue and are fixed in position. For example, the retroperitoneal section of the duodenum usually passes through the transpyloric plane. These include the esophagus, <b>pylorus</b> of the stomach, distal duodenum, ascending colon, descending colon and anal canal. In addition, the oral cavity has adventitia.|$|E
25|$|Scleroderma {{may also}} be {{associated}} with gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), also known as watermelon stomach. This is a condition where atypical blood vessels proliferate usually in a radially symmetric pattern around the <b>pylorus</b> of the stomach. GAVE can be a cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or iron deficiency anemia in patients with scleroderma.|$|E
25|$|The gastric outlet {{obstruction}} {{due to the}} hypertrophic <b>pylorus</b> impairs emptying of gastric contents {{into the}} duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity {{may be involved in}} the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of gastric dilatation-volvulus {{is made by}} several factors. The breed and history will often give a significant suspicion of gastric dilatation-volvulus, and the physical exam will often reveal the telltale sign of a distended abdomen with abdominal tympany. Shock is diagnosed {{by the presence of}} pale mucous membranes with poor capillary refill, increased heart rate, and poor pulse quality. Radiographs (x-rays), usually taken after decompression of the stomach if the dog is unstable, will show a stomach distended with gas. The <b>pylorus,</b> which normally is ventral and {{to the right of the}} body of the stomach, will be cranial to the body of the stomach and left of the midline, often separated on the x-ray by soft tissue and giving the appearance of a separate gas filled pocket (double bubble sign).|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus in dogs {{is likely}} {{caused by a}} multitude of factors, but in all cases the immediate prerequisite is a dysfunction of the sphincter between the esophagus and stomach and an obstruction of outflow through the <b>pylorus.</b> Some of the more widely acknowledged factors for developing GDV include increased age, breed, having a deep and narrow chest, eating foods such as kibble that expand in the stomach, overfeeding, too much water consumption in a small period of time before or after exercise and other causes of gastrointestinal disease and distress. Studies have indicated {{that the risk of}} bloat in dogs perceived as happy by their owners is decreased, and increased in dogs perceived as fearful. This {{may be due to the}} physiological effects of the dog's personality on the function and motility of the gastrointestinal system. Alternatively, the dogs may become unhappy/uncomfortable as a consequence of the conditions that lead up to exhibiting bloat. Dogs with inflammatory bowel disease may be at an increased risk for bloat.|$|E
25|$|The patient lies on his/her {{left side}} with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the {{endoscope}}. The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the <b>pylorus</b> to examine {{the first and second}} parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the endoscope. Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.|$|E
2500|$|The word <b>pylorus</b> {{comes from}} Greek πυλωρός, via Latin. The word <b>pylorus</b> in Greek means [...] "gatekeeper", related to [...] "gate" [...] (...) {{and is thus}} linguistically related to the word [...] "pylon".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>pylorus</b> ( [...] or [...] ), or pyloric part, {{connects the}} stomach to the duodenum. The <b>pylorus</b> is {{considered}} as having two parts, the pyloric antrum (opening {{to the body}} of the stomach) and the pyloric canal (opening to the duodenum). The pyloric canal ends as the pyloric orifice, which marks the junction between the stomach and the duodenum. The orifice is surrounded by a sphincter, a band of muscle, called the pyloric sphincter.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>pylorus</b> (from Greek, [...] "gatekeeper") is {{the lower}} {{section of the}} organ that {{facilitates}} emptying the contents into the small intestine.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>pylorus</b> also {{contains}} scattered parietal cells and neuroendocrine cells. These endocrine cells including D cells, which release somatostatin. (Somatostatin {{is responsible for}} shutting off acid secretion. There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment of}} pyloric stenosis is with surgical pyloromyotomy known as Ramstedt's procedure (dividing the muscle of the <b>pylorus</b> {{to open up}} the gastric outlet). [...] This surgery can be done through a single incision (usually 3–4cm long) or laparoscopically (through several tiny incisions), depending on the surgeon's experience and preference.|$|E
2500|$|After the B12-haptocorrin {{complexes}} {{pass from}} the stomach via the <b>pylorus</b> to the duodenum, pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the B12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor (IF). [...] These B12-IF complexes {{travel to the}} ileum portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of B12-IF complexes in the blood.|$|E
2500|$|The pyloric antrum is {{the initial}} {{portion of the}} <b>pylorus.</b> It is {{near the bottom of}} the stomach, {{proximal}} to the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the duodenum. [...] It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the pyloric canal by a slight groove.|$|E
2500|$|Anatomically, the {{pancreas}} {{is divided into}} the head of pancreas, the neck of pancreas, the body of pancreas, and the tail of pancreas. The head is surrounded by the duodenum in its concavity. The head surrounds two blood vessels, the superior mesenteric artery and vein. From {{the back of the}} head emerges a small uncinate process which extends to the back of the superior mesenteric vein and ends at the superior mesenteric artery. The neck is about [...] long and lies between the head and the body and in front of the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Its front upper surface supports the <b>pylorus</b> (the base) of the stomach. The neck arises from the left upper part of the front of the head. It is directed first upward and forward, and then upward and to the left to join the body; it is somewhat flattened from above downward and backward. On the right it is grooved by the gastroduodenal artery. The body is the largest part of {{the pancreas}} and lies behind the <b>pylorus,</b> at the same level as the transpyloric plane. The tail ends by abutting the spleen.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis is via {{a careful}} history and {{physical}} examination, often supplemented by radiographic imaging studies. Pyloric stenosis should be suspected in any young infant with severe vomiting. On physical exam, palpation of the abdomen may reveal a {{mass in the}} epigastrium. This mass, which consists of the enlarged <b>pylorus,</b> {{is referred to as}} the 'olive', and is sometimes evident after the infant is given formula to drink. Rarely, there are peristaltic waves that may be felt or seen (...) due to the stomach trying to force its contents past the narrowed pyloric outlet.|$|E
2500|$|Under microscopy, the <b>pylorus</b> {{contains}} numerous glands, including gastric pits, which constitute {{about half}} {{the depth of the}} pyloric mucosa. [...] They consist of two or three short closed tubes opening into a common duct or mouth. These tubes are wavy, and are about one-half the length of the duct. The duct is lined by columnar cells, continuous with the epithelium lining the surface of the mucous membrane of the stomach, the tubes by shorter and more cubical cell which are finely granular. The glands contain mucus cells and G cells that secrete gastrin.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a shift in the {{management}} paradigm from TPN (total parenteral nutrition) to early, post-pyloric enteral feeding (in which a feeding tube is endoscopically or radiographically introduced to the third portion of the duodenum). The advantage of enteral feeding is that it is more physiological, prevents gut mucosal atrophy, and is free from the side effects of TPN (such as fungemia). [...] The additional advantages of post-pyloric feeding are the inverse relationship of pancreatic exocrine secretions and distance of nutrient delivery from the <b>pylorus,</b> as well as reduced risk of aspiration.|$|E
6000|$|March 2.--I have {{a letter}} from Colin Mackenzie, {{approving}} Malachi,--"Cold men may say it is too strong; but from the true men of Scotland you are sure of the warmest gratitude." [...] I never have yet found, nor do I expect it on this occasion, that ill-will dies in debt, or what is called gratitude distresses herself by frequent payments. The one is like a ward-holding and pays its reddendo in hard blows. The other a blanch-tenure, and is discharged for payment of a red rose or a peppercorn. He that takes the forlorn hope in an attack, is often deserted by those that should support him, and who generally throw the blame of their own cowardice upon his rashness. We shall see this will end in the same way. But I foresaw it from the beginning. The bankers will be persuaded {{that it is a}} squib which may burn their own fingers, and will curse the poor pyrotechnist that compounded it; if they do, they be d--d. Slept indifferently, and dreamed of Napoleon's last moments, of which I was reading a medical account last night, by Dr. Arnott. Horrible death--a cancer on the <b>pylorus.</b> I would have given something to have lain still this morning and made up for lost time. But desidiae valedixi. If you once turn on your side after the hour at which you ought to rise, it is all over. Bolt up at once. Bad night last--the next is sure to be better.|$|E
60|$|The stories {{connected}} with this wreck {{made it an}} object of great awe to my boyish fancy; but in truth the whole neighborhood was full of fable and romance for me, abounding with traditions about pirates, hobgoblins, and buried money. As I grew to more mature years I made many researches after the truth of these strange traditions; for I {{have always been a}} curious investigator of the valuable, but obscure branches of the history of my native province. I found infinite difficulty, however, in arriving at any precise information. In seeking to dig up one fact it is incredible the number of fables which I unearthed; for the whole course of the Sound seemed in my younger days to be like the straits of <b>Pylorus</b> of yore, the very region of fiction. I will say nothing of the Devil's Stepping Stones, by which that arch fiend made his retreat from Connecticut to Long Island, seeing that the subject is likely to be learnedly treated by a worthy friend and contemporary historian[2] whom I have furnished with particulars thereof. Neither will I say anything of the black man in a three-cornered hat, seated in the stern of a jolly boat who used to be seen about Hell Gate in stormy weather; and who went by the name of the Pirate's Spuke, or Pirate's Ghost, because I never could meet with any person of stanch credibility who professed to have seen this spectrum; unless it were the widow of Manus Conklin, the blacksmith of Frog's Neck, but then, poor woman, she was a little purblind, and might have been mistaken; though they said she saw farther than other folks in the dark. All this, however, was but little satisfactory in regard to the tales of buried money about which I was most curious; and the following was all that I could for a long time collect that had anything like an air of authenticity.|$|E
60|$|Now Heartbreak House, with Butler and Bergson and Scott Haldane {{alongside}} Blake and {{the other}} major poets on its shelves (to say nothing of Wagner and the tone poets), was not so completely blinded by the doltish materialism of the laboratories as the uncultured world outside. But being an idle house it was a hypochondriacal house, always running after cures. It would stop eating meat, not on valid Shelleyan grounds, {{but in order to}} get rid of a bogey called Uric Acid; and it would actually let you pull all its teeth out to exorcise another demon named Pyorrhea. It was superstitious, and addicted to table-rapping, materialization seances, clairvoyance, palmistry, crystal-gazing and the like to such an extent that it may be doubted whether ever before in the history of the world did soothsayers, astrologers, and unregistered therapeutic specialists of all sorts flourish as they did during this half century of the drift to the abyss. The registered doctors and surgeons were hard put to it to compete with the unregistered. They were not clever enough to appeal to the imagination and sociability of the Heartbreakers by the arts of the actor, the orator, the poet, the winning conversationalist. They had to fall back coarsely on the terror of infection and death. They prescribed inoculations and operations. Whatever part of a human being could be cut out without necessarily killing him they cut out; and he often died (unnecessarily of course) in consequence. From such trifles as uvulas and tonsils they went on to ovaries and appendices until at last no one's inside was safe. They explained that the human intestine was too long, and that nothing could make a child of Adam healthy except short circuiting the <b>pylorus</b> by cutting a length out of the lower intestine and fastening it directly to the stomach. As their mechanist theory taught them that medicine was the business of the chemist's laboratory, and surgery of the carpenter's shop, and also that Science (by which they meant their practices) was so important that no consideration for the interests of any individual creature, whether frog or philosopher, much less the vulgar commonplaces of sentimental ethics, could weigh for a moment against the remotest off-chance of an addition to the body of scientific knowledge, they operated and vivisected and inoculated and lied on a stupendous scale, clamoring for and actually acquiring such legal powers over the bodies of their fellow-citizens as neither king, pope, nor parliament dare ever have claimed. The Inquisition itself was a Liberal institution compared to the General Medical Council.|$|E
