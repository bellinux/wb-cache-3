25|$|The main {{structures}} of the bird eye {{are similar to those}} of other vertebrates. The outer layer of the eye consists of the transparent cornea at the front, and two layers of sclera — a tough white collagen fibre layer which surrounds the rest of the eye and supports and protects the eye as a whole. The eye is divided internally by the lens into two main segments: the anterior segment and the posterior segment. The anterior chamber is filled with a watery fluid called the aqueous humour, and the <b>posterior</b> <b>chamber</b> contains the vitreous humour, a clear jelly-like substance.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} ostariophysan fishes, the swim bladder has two chambers. The {{anterior}} chamber {{is connected to}} the inner ear by a series of small bones derived from neck vertebrae called the Weberian apparatus, which greatly enhances its hearing capability. The <b>posterior</b> <b>chamber</b> extends along the whole length of the body and maintains the fish's buoyancy. E. electricus has a well-developed sense of hearing. This fish has a vascularized respiratory system with gas exchange occurring through epithelial tissue in its buccal cavity. As obligate air-breathers, electric eels must rise to the surface every ten minutes or so to inhale before returning to the bottom. Nearly eighty percent of the oxygen used by the fish is obtained in this way.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s, the microkeratome and keratomileusis {{technique}} {{were developed}} in Bogotá, Colombia, by the Spanish ophthalmologist Jose Barraquer. In his clinic, he would cut thin (one hundredth of a mm thick) flaps in the cornea to alter its shape. Barraquer also investigated {{how much of the}} cornea had to be left unaltered in order to provide stable long-term results. This work was followed by that of the Russian scientist, Svyatoslav Fyodorov, who developed radial keratotomy (RK) in the 1970s and [...] designed the first <b>posterior</b> <b>chamber</b> implantable contact lenses (phakic intraocular lens) in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{underlying}} cause of open-angle glaucoma remains unclear. Several theories exist on its exact etiology. However, the {{major risk factor}} for most glaucomas and the focus of treatment is increased intraocular pressure. Intraocular pressure {{is a function of}} production of liquid aqueous humor by the ciliary processes of the eye, and its drainage through the trabecular meshwork. Aqueous humor flows from the ciliary processes into the <b>posterior</b> <b>chamber,</b> bounded posteriorly by the lens and the zonules of Zinn, and anteriorly by the iris. It then flows through the pupil of the iris into the anterior chamber, bounded [...] posteriorly by the iris and anteriorly by the cornea.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961, a Danish {{ophthalmologist}} named Mette Warburg reported about a Danish {{family that}} showed seven cases of a hereditary degenerative disease throughout seven generations. The first {{member of the}} family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child's examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except that his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating. The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass. [...] Five months later, his left eye was removed due to suspicion of retinoblastoma, a cancerous tumor on the retina. A histologic examination showed a hemorrhagic necrotic mass in the <b>posterior</b> <b>chamber,</b> surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) glial tissue. The diagnosis included a pseudotumor of the retina, hyperplasia of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment epithelium, hypoplasia and necrosis of the inner layer of the retina, cataract, and phthisis bulbi. This means his eye was removed because the physician suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that led to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells already began to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed deafness later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined to be low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were caused by this disease as well. She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, Gordon Norrie (1855–1941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years.|$|E

The developed system is portable and easily movable, containing the compact portable OCT system that includes the handheld probe and computer. Eye <b>posterior</b> <b>chambers</b> were diagnosed using the handheld probe, and the probe could be fixed to the bench-top cradle depending on the volunteers' physical condition.

Large-scale signal-processing procedures such as k-domain linearization, fast Fourier transform (FFT), and log-scaling signal processing can be rapidly applied using graphics-processing-unit (GPU) accelerated processing rather than central-processing-unit (CPU) processing.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{reveal the}} {{influence}} of retrobulbar capsaicin treatment on rats' eyes and to test the protective effects of PEDF, a known neurotrophic and antiangiogenic substance, against neurotrophic keratouveitis. METHODS. A single retrobulbar injection of capsaicin (50 mg/kg) was performed in young rats, {{and the effect of}} subsequent retrobulbar injections of PEDF 3. 2 or 6. 4 mu g was recorded. Tear fluid alterations were evaluated with the Schirmer test and corneal alterations with slit lamp biomicroscopy. Histopathologic alterations were studied with light and electron microscopy. The number of leukocytes (myeloid cells) in the anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>chambers,</b> peripheral retina, and vitreous were quantitatively evaluated. RESULTS. Reduced tear secretion was found in capsaicin-treated rats compared with the control, but this effect was significantly attenuated by PEDF. Corneal ulceration developed and was followed by scar formation and neovascularization in the capsaicin-treated, and it was also significantly attenuated by PEDF treatment. Leukocyte infiltration of the anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>chambers,</b> as well as the peripheral retina and vitreous, was also observed in capsaicin-treated eyes and was significantly reduced by PEDF treatment. The protective effects of PEDF were dose dependent for each parameter, even if the treatment was initiated at day 14 after the challenge. CONCLUSIONS. PEDF accelerated the recovery of tear secretion and also prevented capsaicin-induced neurotrophic keratouveitis and peripheral vitreoretinal inflammation. These effects of PEDF, described herein for the first time, may have a clinical application in inflammatory and neovascular diseases of the eye.

50|$|Within the {{vertebrate}} eye, {{there are}} considered to be three chambers: anterior, posterior, and vitreous. It {{is important to note that}} the eye can also be classified as having two cavities: anterior and posterior. Both the anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>chambers</b> are located within the anterior cavity, while the vitreous chamber is located in the posterior cavity. The best way to distinguish between the two cavities is to use the lens as a dividing point. The vitreous chamber is the largest of the three chambers and is located behind the lens and in front of the optic nerve. This chamber is filled with a thick, clear gel-like substance called the vitreous humor (also vitreous body). The humor plays a crucial role in supporting the posterior side of the lens.|$|R
