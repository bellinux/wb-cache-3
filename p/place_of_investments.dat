Globalization here is now not merely a new reality, but also a powerful rhetorical device whose invoking {{is proving to be}} a potent political tool for capital in its drive to transform cities. At this rhetoric's core, a supposed new hyper-competitive reality makes Rust Belt cities easily discardable as <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> These once-enclosed containers of "the economic", in the rhetoric, have recently become leaky landscapes rife with a potential for economic hemorrhaging. Against this supposed reality, cities are portrayed as beset by a kind of accumulation disorder that now haunts them. Through this, the new governmentality's dominant contours – a proposed shock treatment of re-regulation – is rationalized.

[…] niewiele jest w polskim piśmiennictwie ekonomicznym prac na temat bankowości inwestycyjnej i rekomendacji dla Polski wynikających z analizy doświadczeń innych krajów w tym zakresie”. Dynamic {{transformations in}} global economy have {{produced}} {{an urgent need}} to develop knowledge and to intensify scientific reflection over problems generated, also in Poland, by these transformations in modern financial systems. The monograph investigates trends and direction {{in the evolution of}} global and Polish financial systems. Against this backdrop, surveys have demonstrated a close linkage between financial and economic development. Financial system cannot operate without the real sector while the real sector may not operate efficiently and grow without a financial system. We have also been able to show that there is a feedback between financial and economic development. This has provided an impulse for future, more in-depth examination of the relationship between one of the mot dynamically developing segments of the financial market: investment banking and economic growth. At the source of our investigation there was a conviction that processes which have been taking place in investment banking sector in Poland, with its economy still at the stage of transformation, can be described and explained. Recent decades witnessed very rapid and unexpected developments across the world economy. High pace of changes in contemporary economies has not been indifferent to global financial systems. In economics, many theoretical approaches have evolved or been replaced with new concepts. That is the effect of, inter alia, the outbreak of the latest Global Financial Crisis, the emergence of new needs and urgent problems of the contemporary world, including the world of finance. Financial capital {{is one of the major}} catalysts of growth. Linkages between financial (financial system) and economic development have been studied since the beginning of the 1990 s. The monograph focuses attention mainly on comparative analysis of institutional and functional aspects and on the relevance and impact <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> banking (more broadly accumulated financial capital) upon the development of modern market economies. The publication discusses main development stages <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> banking in the world and current tendencies observed in this area. These considerations are presented against the convergence of Anglo-American and continental financial systems. Due to the fact that investment banking forms part of financial services sector, its impact on growth is reflected in functions performed by the financial system in market economy. In Poland, interest in the role of capital as promoter of economic growth, including investment banking, emerged relatively early following the beginning of systemic transformations in 1989. In the early stages, investment banking was perceived as another range of services that could be offered by commercial banks, disregarding deeper relationships between investment banking and economic policy. We missed a wider perspective on investment banking in the context of the development of the financial system as such. On top of that, it was demonstrated that the increasing role <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> banking in Polish economy should have effects on further economic growth, which, in turn, should imply further development <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> banking. The publication consists of four chapters. The first one provides an overview of general characteristics of financial systems in modern market economy. The second chapter explains what investment banking is about and how relevant it is to modern financial systems. Investment banking is presented in functional term, i. e., in the context of services it offers. The third chapter includes a theoretical and analytical sections. It describes the specific role played by investment banking in economic growth of countries through financial development. The chapter demonstrates the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> banking in contemporary market economy and its relevance for economic growth. The fourth chapter is devoted entirely to Polish economy and studies <b>of</b> interdependences <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> banking, financial development and economic growth. Our attempts to analyse available international statistical data have shown that economic growth stimulates financial development. Underdeveloped and underperforming financial systems are a vital reason why many developing countries still exhibit low growth rate. Based on our studies, we were also able to prove that the developments in the Polish economy and the development <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> banking services influence each other, which coincides with the outcomes of international empirical studies. We also tried to empirically validate the relationships between economic growth and the development <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> banking through financial development. An econometric cause-effect model was built based on observations of statistical data from the years 1994 – 2004 with special attention paid to investment banking services. Studies demonstrated that there is interdependence between capital – measured in terms of development <b>of</b> the <b>investment</b> banking sector – and economic growth in Poland. We also provided evidence that economic growth remains closely connected with financial development and its intensity depends on financial advancement of a given country. In conclusion, as a result of structural transformations in international financial markets and in the face of the recent Global Financial Crisis, investment banking should play a major and supporting role vis-à-vis emerging economic phenomena.

40|$|Although {{capital is}} now {{generally}} {{free to move}} across national borders, there is strong evidence that savings tend to remain and to be invested {{in the country where}} the saving takes place. The current paper examines the apparent conflict between the potential mobility of capital and the observed de facto segmentation of the global capital market. The key to reconciling this 'Feldstein-Horioka paradox' is that, although capital is free to move, its owners, and especially the agents who are responsible for institutional investments, prefer to keep funds close to home because of a combination of risk aversion, ignorance and a desire to show prudence in their investing behavior. The paper presents evidence on the capital mobility and on capital market segmentation. The role of hedging and the difference between gross and net capital movements for individual investors and borrowers are discussed. The special <b>place</b> <b>of</b> foreign direct <b>investment</b> is also considered. The segmentation of the global capital market affects the impact of capital income taxes and subsidies. This is discussed in the final section of the paper...|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} characteristics and trends <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed {{capital of the}} Northern regions. It singles out phases of rapid pre-crisis growth, crisis, post-crisis growth and stagnation. Stagnation and decline in recent years are caused by completed major investment projects, reduced own funds of enterprises, limited availability <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> resources and increased capital outflow. The article reveals that the growth <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital of the North in the post-crisis period {{is provided by the}} regions, carrying out major investment in oil and gas pipeline transport, oil extraction, production and distribution of electricity, gas and water. The changes in the sectoral structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital of the Northern regions are barely visible; the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in the traded sector is still high, especially in mining, due to the Northern regions’ specialization in the extractive industries. The share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in the public sector and social services remains low. The specific structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital has changed: the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in buildings (excluding housing) and structures has increased greatly; the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in machinery, equipment, vehicles has decreased due to insufficient investment in mining enterprises and financial shortages in manufacturing. In most regions the structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital by directions is characterized by the increase in the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in machinery, equipment, vehicles in new construction, investment in buildings and structures and the decline in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in machinery, equipment, vehicles modernization and reconstruction and acquisition of new fixed assets. The dynamics and the inefficient structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed assets and directions testify the shortage <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in innovation in the Northern regions...|$|R
