5|$|The metal's {{distinctive}} natural green <b>patina</b> {{has long}} been coveted by architects and designers. The final <b>patina</b> is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering. It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished' to embark a particular look, feel, and/or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.|$|E

5|$|I {{believe that}} my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without <b>patina).</b> In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E
5|$|A meter {{in length}} canes, dated between 1850 and 1920, {{are used to}} make an entry into a village or in dance ceremonies. The canes were fired to give black <b>patina</b> over the {{engraved}} parts; the engraving designs consist of geometrical real images from the pilou dance, agricultural motifs and village scenes of fishing or building a Grand Hut or case. These were also stuffed with magic herbs to ward off evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is a {{precious}} metal commodity; its bullion has the ISO currency code of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewellery, usually as a 90–95% alloy, {{due to its}} inertness. It is {{used for this purpose}} for its prestige and inherent bullion value. Jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term <b>patina)</b> as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the improvement of restoration and conservation sciences of metallic artefacts belonging to Cultural Heritage, a wide research has been started on the study of artificial (artistic) and natural (corrosion or alteration) <b>patinas</b> of copper-based alloys. Micro-Raman spectroscopy (mRS) coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) were applied for the characterization of a number of <b>patinas</b> made on metallic substrate reproducing the typical copper-based alloys used for statuary. A non alloyed copper sheet has been also used to simulate the architectural cover typically used after a specific cold spray coating. To reach these goals, a number of <b>patinas</b> were experimentally produced in our laboratory using the torch technique and reactive solutions based on water as a solvent containing, respectively, copper nitrate, iron nitrate and potassium sulfide (‘liver of sulfur’). The only exception is a sample reproducing the architectural cover of a recent building nearly completely covered with copper sheets coated with copper salts. All the produced <b>patinas</b> were aged in a salt spray chamber and then studied with mRS, SEM and EDXS in order to understand their evolution between the two known terms and therefore the reactions involved in all <b>patinas.</b> mRS allowedus todetect asmain constituents of the ‘artistic’ <b>patinas,</b> before and after ageing: copper oxides (Cuprite and Tenorite), copper nitrates (Rouaite and Gerhardtite), copper chlorides (Botallackite, Atacamite and Paratacamite), a copper sulfate (Posnjakite), iron oxides (Magnetite and Hematite) and an iron hydroxide (Limonite) ...|$|R

5|$|Arsenic is a grey, {{metallic}} looking solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.727 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more than aluminium; less than iron). It is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze <b>patina</b> in moist air, which blackens on further exposure. Arsenic is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It reacts with fused caustic soda {{to give the}} arsenate Na3AsO3 and hydrogen gas. Arsenic sublimes at 615°C. The vapour is lemon-yellow and smells like garlic. Arsenic only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm, at 817°C. It is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.5eV. Liquid arsenic is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.15eV.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} of the name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or <b>patina).</b> Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscription}} {{created a}} sensation as it mentions four distant countries {{that were the}} targets of adventurous Scandinavian expeditions during the Viking Age, but it also stirred some doubts as to its authenticity. However, thorough geological and runological analyses dispelled any doubts as to its genuine nature. The stone had the same <b>patina</b> as other Viking Age stones on all its surfaces and carvings, and in addition it has the normal r-rune with an open side stroke, something which is usually overlooked by forgerers. Moreover, v Friesen commented {{that there could be}} no expert on Old Swedish that made a forgery while he correctly wrote krikiaʀ as all reference books of the time incorrectly told that the form was grikir.|$|E

5|$|Body {{adornment}} {{has only}} recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, {{the deterioration of the}} flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the <b>patina</b> of history. His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.|$|E
5|$|Captain Edward Smith – Unveiled in July 1914 at {{the western}} end of the Museum Gardens, the statue was sculpted by Kathleen Scott, wife of Antarctic {{explorer}} Robert Scott. The pedestal is made from Cornish granite and the figure is bronze. This is a memorial to the captain of the RMS Titanic, which sank on 15 April 1912. Captain Smith was from Hanley and Lichfield was chosen as the location for the monument because Smith was a Staffordshire man and Lichfield was the centre of the diocese. The statue originally cost £740 raised through local and national contributions. In 2010, as part of the 'Parks for People' programme, the statue was restored and the green <b>patina</b> removed from its surface at a cost of £16,000. In 2011 an unsuccessful campaign was started to get the statue moved back to Captain Smith's home town of Hanley.|$|E
25|$|Copper’s {{most famous}} trait is its display from a bright {{metallic}} colour to iridescent brown to near black {{and finally to}} a greenish verdigris <b>patina.</b> Architects describe the array of browns as russet, chocolate, plum, mahogany, and ebony. The metal’s distinctive green <b>patina</b> has long been coveted by architects and designers.|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of dark <b>patinas</b> has been mainly related with deposition of gases and particles, and sulphation mechanisms particularly in calcareous rocks. However, in granitic monuments located in Galicia (northwest of Spain), especially in rural areas, this origin is unlikely since granite {{is a very}} poor calcium-containing rock and the atmospheric pollution {{in this area is}} negligible. A biological origin seems to be most probable. In order to know the importance of biological and atmospheric factors in the {{formation of}} dark <b>patinas</b> on granitic monuments, a number of analyses using several techniques are needed. The characterization of fatty acids in <b>patinas</b> by gas chromatography has established clear differences among samples. Thus, all of the samples having a biological origin displayed a similar fatty acid pattern, with unsaturated fatty acids predominating, especially oleic and linoleic acids; these were followed in abundance by the branched fatty acid 18 : 00 anteiso, and palmitic acid. Different patterns of fatty acid allowed establishment of an anthropogenic origin of the some of the <b>patinas</b> analysed. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
