40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} tests {{to assess the}} use of anaerobic adhesive for providing a <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature in threaded fasteners. Test procedures are developed and tests are performed on three fastener materials, four anaerobic adhesives, and both unseated assembly conditions. Five to ten samples are tested for each combination. Tests for initial use, reuse without additional adhesive, and reuse with additional adhesive are performed for all samples. A 48 -hour cure time was used for all initial use and reuse tests. Test data are presented as removal torque versus removal angle with the specification required <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> range added for performance assessment. Percent specification pass rates for the all combinations of fastener material, adhesive, and assembly condition are tabulated and reveal use of anaerobic adhesive as a <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature is viable. Although not every possible fastener material and anaerobic adhesive combination provides <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> values within specification, any combination can be assessed using the test procedures presented. Reuse without additional anaerobic adhesive generally provides some <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque,</b> {{and in some cases}} within specification.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine if anaerobic adhesive {{can be used as a}} <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature. Maintaining preload in critical joints is the usual standard that anaerobic adhesives are held to in aerospace and other industry. To test if anaerobic adhesive can be used as a <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature a test procedure was developed and implemented to measure the removal torque of threaded fasteners after an allotted cure time. In total, 191 threaded fasteners of different material and coatings were tested in the unseated and seated states with various strengths and varieties of anaerobic adhesive. A series of three tests were conducted: initial use, reuse with no added anaerobic adhesive, and a third test with added product to the bolt and nut to see how removal torque would behave in these conditions. It was found that using anaerobic adhesive as a <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature is viable in many cases.

40|$|Practically every {{engineering}} {{product with}} {{any degree of}} complexity uses threaded fasteners. Although threaded fasteners are generally considered a mature technology, significant problems exist with their use. This study has investigated a number of issues with the tightening and self-loosening of threaded fasteners. - It was found that upon repeated tightening of electro-zinc plated fastners significant wear of the contact surfaces of the bolt/nut thread and nut face occured. This wear was accompanied by an increase in the friction coefficient causing a reduction in the clamp force provided for an assembly when tightened to a specific torque value. - The self-loosening characteristics of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> nuts were also investigated. It was found that there was a significant loss of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> when a fastner self-loosened when compared to the <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> when being deliberately disassembled. The current standard test for <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> nuts on re-use does not reflect this surprising result and leads to a significant over-estimate of the capability of this class of nut to resist self-loosening. This is a contribution to knowledge on this topic. - A further major original finding of this study has been that if an axial load is also acting on a joint which is experiencing transverse slip, <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> nuts can continue to self-loosen leading to their possible detachment from bolts. A number of accidents have been caused by such detachments, but the cause was not understood partly because this detachment could not be reproduced on the standard loosening test. Work reported in this thesis has been found that if an external axial load is acting whilst the joint is experiencing transverse slip, under the approprioate conditions, the loosening process will continue until nut detachment occurs. - A series of tests has been completed in which the forces needed to tighten and loosen threaded fastners were measured whilst the joint was being subjected to transverse slip/vibration. Measurements were made of the frictional resistance forces in the circumfrential direction and the loosening torque acting on a fastner under transverse slip conditions. It was found that the loosening torque range varied between two positive limits rather than between zero and an upper limit as anticipated by the theory. It was also found that the friction coefficient in the circumfrential direction in the threads is greated than that on the nut face bearing surface during conditions of transverse slip...|$|R

40|$|In {{aerospace}} design, where minimizing {{weight is}} always a priority, achieving the full capacity from fasteners is essential. To do so, the initial bolt preload must be maximized. The benefits of high preload are well documented and include improved fatigue resistance, a stiffer joint, and resistance to loosening. But many factors like elastic interactions and embedment tend to lower the initial preload placed on the bolt. These factors provide additional motivation to maximize the initial preload. But, to maximize bolt preload, you must determine what torque to apply. Determining this torque is greatly complicated by the large preload scatter generally seen with torque control. This paper presents a detailed methodology for generating limit torques for threaded fasteners. This methodology accounts for the large scatter in preload found with torque control, and therefore, addresses the statistical nature of the problem. It also addresses <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque,</b> a feature common in aerospace fasteners. Although <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> provides a desired locking feature, it can also increase preload scatter. In addition, it can {{limit the amount of}} preload that can be generated due to the torsion it creates in the bolt. This paper discusses the complications of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> and how best to handle it. A wide range of torque-tension bolt testing was conducted in support of this research. The results from this research will benefit the design engineer as well as analyst involved in the design of bolted joints, leading to better, more optimized structural designs...|$|R

40|$|A slight pitch {{difference}} is considered between the {{bolt and nut}} in this study. Here, the pitch ofnut is α μm larger than the pitch of bolt. In the first place, the distance δ, of nut screwed onto bolt withoutany <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque,</b> is experimentally and analytically obtained for each level of α. Then, the relationshipbetween axial force and <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> during tightening process is tested. According to the obtainedtorque-axial force relationship, for four different levels of α, the loosening experiment based on NAS 3350 (National Aerospace Standard) is performed, and the loosening and dropping status of the nuts areinvestigated. Considering both the anti-loosening ability and the clamping ability of the nut, the desirablerange of α is discussed. After that, according to the loosening experiment results, three levels of α areselected to make a further study {{about the effect of}} the pitch difference on the fatigue life of bolt.

50|$|<b>Prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> differentiates a locknut from a free {{spinning}} nut {{based on}} a value of how much torque is required during installation before clamp loading. For example, on a nylon-insert nut, it is the torque needed to overcome {{the resistance of the}} nylon dragging across the mating thread. This torque value is usually not very high relative to final installation torque. Tolerance ranges for torque are specified in some standards such as (ISO, DIN, IFI, ASME, SAE, AN-, MS-, NAS- NASM-).|$|R

[...] However, an Air Force Technical Order requires replacement of self-locking nuts in critical areas.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods to}} statistically quantify data from fastener vibration life tests. Data from fastener vibration life tests with secondary locking features of threaded inserts is used. Threaded inserts {{in three different}} configurations are examined: no locking feature, <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature, and adhesive locking feature. Useful composite plots were developed by extracting minimum preloads versus cycles from test data. Minimum preloads were extracted due to the overlapping of varying test data and because the minimum preload is of most interest in such tests. In addition to composite plots, descriptive statistics of the samples were determined including mean, median, quartiles, and extents. These descriptive statistics were plotted to illustrate variability within a sample as well as variability between samples. These plots also reveal that characteristics of loosening for a sample, such as preload loss and rates of preload loss, are preserved when summarizing such tests. Usually fastener vibration life tests are presented and compared with one test sample, which is why statistically quantifying them is needed and important. Methods to predict the sample population have been created as well. To predict populations, tests to determine {{the distribution of the}} sample, such as probability plots and probability plot correlation coefficient, have been conducted. Once samples were determined to be normal, confidence intervals were created for test samples, which provides a range of where the population mean should lie. It has been shown that characteristics of loosening are preserved in the confidence intervals. Populations of fastener vibration life tests have never before been presented or created. The evaluation of loosening has been conducted for fastener vibration life tests in the past with plots of one test sample; however, in this work statistically quantified results of multiple tests were used. This is important because evaluating loosening with more than one test sample can determine variation between tests. It has been found that secondary locking features do help reduce the loss of preload. The <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> secondary locking feature is found to be more effective as preload is lost. The best secondary locking feature {{has been found to be}} the adhesive...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate Vespel for potential application on the Solid Rocket Booster to replace all-metal deformed self-locking nuts and anchor nuts and be used as self-locking elements for bolts and screws. The Vespel self-locking elements were tested for <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> retention at room temperature, after heating to 450 F and exposure for 3 hr, breakaway torque at 450 F and for vibration at a level consistent with the maximum expected on the SRB at lift-off and reentry. The investigation revealed Vespel has properties that can provide a self-locking capability for threaded fasteners up to 450 F and it can be used in nuts and anchor nuts for installation on the SRB. Vespel elements in bolts did not meet all our SRB requirements for reuse, however, we have defined a design for Vespel elements in nuts/anchor nuts that fully meets all requirements. It is recommended that No. 1, 1 / 4 in. and 5 / 16 in. nuts/anchor nuts be procured for use on the SRB. This system will eliminate the galling problems now encountered and achieve a much higher reuse life than the present deformed nut design...|$|R
40|$|Phase I: The use of {{adhesive}} locking features or liquid locking compounds (LLCs) (e. g., Loctite) as a {{means of}} providing a secondary locking feature has been used on NASA programs since the Apollo program. In many cases Loctite was used as a last resort when (a) self-locking fasteners were no longer functioning per their respective drawing specification, (b) access was limited for removal & replacement, or (c) replacement could not be accomplished without severe impact to schedule. Long-term use of Loctite became inevitable in cases where removal and replacement of worn hardware was not cost effective and Loctite was assumed to be fully cured and working. The NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) and United Space Alliance (USA) recognized the need for more extensive testing of Loctite grades to better understand their capabilities and limitations as a secondary locking feature. These tests, identified as Phase I, were designed to identify processing sensitivities, to determine proper cure time, the correct primer to use on aerospace nutplate, insert and bolt materials such as A 286 and MP 35 N, and the minimum amount of Loctite that is required to achieve optimum breakaway torque values. The. 1900 - 32 was the fastener size tested, due to wide usage in the aerospace industry. Three different grades of Loctite were tested. Results indicate that, with proper controls, adhesive locking features can be successfully used in the repair of locking features and should be considered for design. Phase II: Threaded fastening systems used in aerospace programs typically have a requirement for a redundant locking feature. The primary locking method is the fastener preload and the traditional redundant locking feature is a self-locking mechanical device that may include deformed threads, non-metallic inserts, split beam features, or other methods that impede movement between threaded members. The self-locking resistance of traditional locking features can be directly verified during assembly by measuring the dynamic <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque.</b> Adhesive locking features or LLCs are another method of providing redundant locking, but a direct verification method has not been used in aerospace applications to verify proper installation when using LLCs because of concern for damage to the adhesive bond. The reliability of LLCs has also been questioned due to failures observed during testing with coupons for process verification, although the coupon failures have often been attributed to a lack of proper procedures. It is highly desirable to have a direct method of verifying the LLC cure or bond integrity. The purpose of the Phase II test program was to determine if the torque applied during direct verification of an adhesive locking feature degrades that locking feature. This report documents the test program used to investigate the viability of such a direct verification method. Results of the Phase II testing were positive, and additional investigation of direct verification of adhesive locking features is merited...|$|R
