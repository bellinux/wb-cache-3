5|$|Prince Paul {{was found}} guilty of war crimes in September 1945 {{for his role in the}} Yugoslav {{accession}} to the Tripartite Pact. In 2011, a High Court in Serbia found the sentence to be <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> ideologically motivated and Prince Paul was officially rehabilitated. A similar decision had been made in 2009 to rehabilitate Cvetković for war crimes charges relating to the signing of the pact.|$|E
5|$|The Great Sejm, {{also known}} as the Four-Year Sejm (Polish: respectively, Sejm Wielki or Sejm Czteroletni; Lithuanian: Didysis seimas or Ketverių metų seimas) was a Sejm (parliament) of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that was held in Warsaw between 1788 and 1792. Its {{principal}} aim became to restore sovereignty to, and reform, the Commonwealth <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> economically.|$|E

5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|Between 1929 and 1935, {{under the}} strain of World Depression, {{political}} thinking worldwide received a jolt from the spread of international communism. Indian political parties, movements and considerable sections of leadership were also affected by inter-continental ideologies. The Self-Respect Movement also came {{under the influence of}} the leftist philosophies and institutions. E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the Self-Respect Movement as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> socially. To accomplish this, he studied the history and politics of different countries, and personally observed these systems at work.|$|E
5|$|Both Ravel's {{parents were}} Roman Catholics; Marie was also {{something}} of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> socially progressive in outlook in adult life. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.|$|E

5|$|Gabon gained its {{independence}} from France on 17 August 1960. The country had a relatively high standard of living and {{was considered one of}} the more stable countries in West Africa, both <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> economically. At the time of the coup, the country had an estimated US$200 average annual income {{and was one of the}} few countries in Africa with a positive trade balance, with exports exceeding imports by 30 percent. As of 1964, the country was among the largest producers of uranium and manganese in French Africa, which Time suggested was one of the reasons for France's response to the coup. It also had petroleum, iron, and logging interests stationed in Gabon.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{expanded}} his nonviolent non-co-operation platform {{to include the}} swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi {{in support of the}} independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> administratively.|$|E
5|$|In Algeria, the Muslims {{were not}} {{considered}} French and did not share the same political or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E

5|$|In due course, {{soon after}} he was {{relieved}} of his command, and as a semi-dictatorial Sanacja regime was established, Sikorski joined the anti-Piłsudski opposition. Sikorski largely withdrew from politics, spending {{much of his time}} in Paris, France, and working with the French Ecole Superieure de Guerre (war college). Even after the death of Piłsudski in 1935, he was still marginalized, <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> militarily, by Piłsudski's successors. In February next year, together with several prominent Polish politicians (Wincenty Witos, Ignacy Paderewski, and General Józef Haller) he joined the Front Morges, an anti-Sanacja political grouping.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1948 Pei was {{recruited}} by New York real estate magnate William Zeckendorf to join a staff of architects for his firm of Webb and Knapp to design buildings around the country.

Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected <b>politically,</b> <b>and</b> Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{revolutions}} split {{also the}} Russian army officers <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> {{their attitude toward}} the Finnish civil war varied; Mikhail Svechnikov led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and Konstantin Yeremejev the Russian forces in the Karelian Isthmus, while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary underlings and co-operated with the former colleague General Mannerheim, assisting the Whites in the disarmament of the Russian garrisons in Finland. On 30 January 1918 Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers in Finland that the White army did not fight against Russia: {{the goal of the}} White campaign was to beat the Finnish Red rebels and the Russian troops supporting them.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol and the {{effectiveness}} of the operation to free them prompted the British government to increase its support of UNAMSIL, both <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> through the provision of staff officers to assist UNAMSIL's operational headquarters (though not with a significant contribution of peacekeepers, despite considerable lobbying). The British also applied political pressure through the United Nations Security Council on the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)—the second main party to the civil war after the government—and on Sierra Leone's neighbour Liberia, which had provided support to the RUF. The new approach, combined with a larger and more powerful UNAMSIL, hastened the demobilisation of the RUF and thus the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{may have}} weakened Mallory <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> certainly diverted him from other duties, {{but it was}} not enough to drive him from office. Perhaps because {{there was no one to}} replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} {{family of}} the world that has the most speakers is the Indo-European languages, spoken by 46% of the world's population. This family includes major world languages like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian Migration Period (c. 400–800 AD), and subsequently through the European colonial expansion, which brought the Indo-European languages to a <b>politically</b> <b>and</b> often numerically dominant position in the Americas and much of Africa. The Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by 20% of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds of smaller languages.|$|E
