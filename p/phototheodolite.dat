50|$|He {{applied the}} {{technique}} of plane table photogrammetry {{in addition to a}} conventional geodetic survey, assisted by the novel lightweight, accurate <b>phototheodolite</b> that he had developed for high-mountain applications. The device was based on the prototype <b>phototheodolite</b> developed by Albrecht Meydenbauer (1834-1921) for architectural applications. From 1890 Finsterwalder also employed aerial photography, reconstituting the topography of the area of Gars am Inn in 1899 from a pair of balloon photographs using mathematical calculations of many points in the images.|$|E

Returning to Joshimath he took up a <b>phototheodolite</b> and went south to survey the Rinti glacier and the saddle between Trisul and Nanda Ghunti.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plane table}} became a popular {{instrument}} for surveying. [...] Its use was widely taught. Interestingly, {{there were those}} who considered it a substandard instrument compared to such devices as the theodolite, since it was relatively easy to use. [...] By allowing the use of graphical methods rather than mathematical calculations, it could be used by those with less education than other instruments. The addition of a camera to the plane table, as was done from 1890 by Sebastian Finsterwalder in conjunction with a <b>phototheodolite,</b> established photogrammetry in spatial and temporal surveying.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{architectural}} survey, {{the most}} important factor is to create a very believable drawing of the existing building, structure or monument (sculpture). In order to carry out such surveys, there can be used reflectorless tacheometers, <b>phototheodolites,</b> digital cameras and surface laser scanners. Nowadays, it is the most expeditious method of obtaining the detailed and reliable information concerning the particular object. With the help of laser scanning, it is possible to create the most accurate and detailed digital models of the whole environment in the shortest possible time. The information concerning the object {{in the form of a}} point cloud can be got in minutes. Thus, we have a unique opportunity for real-time monitoring of the processes, both natural and manmade character...|$|R

5000|$|Knowing of Shipton's 1934 explorations, Gordon Osmaston, {{director}} of the Survey of India's triangulation of Great Himalaya, planned to improve the survey of the Sanctuary using a <b>phototheodolite.</b> As he set off from Darjeeling he met Shipton returning from the Everest expedition. Shipton immediately agreed to join the Osmaston's party, hoping to join up with Tilman's Nanda Devi climbers. Ang Tharkay and Tenzing Norgay also joined as Sherpas. They met Lloyd who was descending the Rishi Ganga gorge ahead of the main party and so heard that the mountain had just been climbed. Writing to a friend Shipton said [...] "What a glorious effort of Bill and Odell to have climbed Nanda Devi. I am overjoyed that it was Bill who did the touchdown - he so thoroughly deserves every inch of his success ... I confess I wished I had been with them instead of wasting time on that ridiculous Everest business". He also said [...] "By Jove, it will shake the old fools at home", referring to the RGS Mount Everest Committee {{and the fact that}} the expedition had been conceived in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{understanding}} of wind flow near the ground surface {{in all three}} dimensions onsite is extremely important for wind research. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a system to quantitatively measure wind flow near the ground surface in both the horizontal and vertical directions (in other words, wind flow in three dimensions) using inertial photographic surveying or <b>phototheodolite.</b> In this method, a balloon (a no-lift balloon) with the same relative weight as air and soap bubbles were released as tracers. Their movements were captured using stereo-photography and single photographs, and then the path of particles was analyzed in three dimensions. For this document, wind flow near tall buildings, conical vortices flow on the rooftops of buildings and wind flow crossing over an embankment were measured. The results of the testing proved that the measurement methods were effective...|$|E

For each pose, a panoramic image is generated from the set of corresponding but poorly overlapping images. In this paper, we evaluate {{the performance of a}} three-step method {{developed in}} Craciun [1] that computes the relative pose between the different frame camera images composing the panoramic frame. A <b>phototheodolite,</b> i. e. a theodolite coupled with a digital camera, is used to construct a reference data set with a ground truth which is sufficiently accurate (to some extent) to evaluate by comparison the results of our pose estimation process. We present the different steps to compute, then we present the algorithm which is used as well as mathematic concept and finally results are commented the results of our pose estimation process will also be compared with an off-the-shelf high quality software using SIFT-based corresponding points and bundle adjustment, i. e.

Demonstration flights to include curved approaches and automatic landings were tracked by a <b>phototheodolite</b> system. For 50 approaches during the demonstration flights, the following results were obtained: the navigation system, using TRSB guidance, delivered the aircraft onto the 3 nautical mile final approach leg with an average overshoot of 25 feet past centerline, subjet to a 2 -sigma dispersion of 90 feet. Lateral tracking data showed a mean error of 4. 6 feet left of centerline at the category 1 decision height (200 feet) and 2. 7 feet left of centerline at the category 2 decision height (100 feet). These values were subject to a sigma dispersion of about 10 feet.

40|$|Acquisition of pose {{parameters}} of moving objects {{is an important}} problem in many fields. This paper proposed a method to obtain pose {{parameters of}} moving object (mainly aircraft) from image sequence under assumptions of monocular and perspective view as well as known 3 D shape and initial pose parameters of objects. Firstly image sequence is captured by optical-electric <b>phototheodolite.</b> Based these images, a method for aircraft pose measurement from image sequence has been deeply studied from the view of photogrammetry and projective geometry. A novel idea, Parapoint Feedback Iteration, has been presented and used in aircraft pose measurement. Firstly, we derive nonlinear equations to estimate pose parameter with the correspondence between image feature and model feature. To solve the nonlinear equations, at first several frames several control points must be selected manually and a DLT (Direct Linear Transform) algorithm {{has been used to}} provide approximate value, in the following frames Kalman filter can be used to predict motion parameter of next frame as approximate value. To get the accurate parameters, Parapoint Feedback Iteration algorithm has been used. Several sets of data have been used to test the method and results show its reliability and robustness. * Corresponding author...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{results of}} remote {{monitoring}} of the greatest inEuropemountain glaciation of Elbrus are covered for 120 years by instrumental survey (1887 – 2007) and lichenometric survey in 1986. The materials of stereoscopic digital photo survey of the whole glaciation with terrain resolution of 2. 5 metersproduced by space imaging system Cartosat- 1 (IRS-P 5) in 2007 were {{compared with the same}} year materials of <b>phototheodolite</b> survey of south glaciation slope (6 glaciers in total). Results of comparison showed that the data received from Cartosat- 1 can be used for monitoring of glaciers with long enough interval of time between repeated surveys (from 10 years and more), and also is suitable for updating 1 : 25 000 topographic maps of mountain areas. The leading role of Dzhikiugankez plateau in changes was revealed. Over the last 50 years (1957 – 2007) the Dzhikiugankez share in change of the glaciation area as a whole has reached 45 %. The method of glacier dynamics research, based on digital technologies of image processing and assuming first of all visual deciphering of changes and in the second – measurement of parameters of changes is offered. The quantitative data of Elbrus glaciation reduction since the middle of the XIX century do not confirm the hypothesis of the global climate warming beginning just {{in the second half of}} XX century as a result of anthropogenic greenhouse gases effect. Contrarily in 1970 s, many Elbrus glaciers advanced. Elbrus glaciation area reduction is occurring practically evenly through time and is alternated with short-term periods of stationary state and advance. These facts suggest that global climate warming, which alternated with short-term cooling periods, began after the end of the Little Ice Age and was most likely due to natural rather than anthropogenic causes. </p...|$|E
