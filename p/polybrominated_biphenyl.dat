40|$|This {{volume of}} the IARC Monographs {{provides}} evaluations of the carcinogenicity of polychlorinated <b>biphenyls</b> and <b>polybrominated</b> <b>biphenyls.</b> Polychlorinated biphenyls are a class of aromatic compounds comprising 209 congeners, each containing 1 to 10 chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl nucleus. Technical products, which were manufactured to obtain {{a certain degree of}} chlorination, are mixtures of numerous congeners. These products were widely used as dielectric fluid in capacitors and transformers, {{and to a lesser extent}} in building materials. Although their production and use has been banned in most countries, these compounds are ubiquitous environmental pollutants, including in polar regions and the deep ocean, because they are persistent and bioaccumulate. Worldwide monitoring programmes have shown that polychlorinated biphenyls are present in most samples of human milk. An IARC Monographs Working Group reviewed epidemiological evidence, animal bioassays, and mechanistic and other relevant data to reach conclusions as to the carcinogenic hazard to humans of polychlorinated biphenyls, of the subclass of dioxinlike polychlorinated <b>biphenyls,</b> and of <b>polybrominated</b> <b>biphenyls...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} <b>polybrominated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> mixture {{was separated}} chromatographically into two fractions on neutral alumina (AA and AB) and into three fractions on Florisil (FA, FB, and FC) by sequential elution with solvents of increasing polarity. Using established methods, {{the activity of}} each fraction as hepatic microsomal cytochrome P- 450 - and/or cytochrome P- 448 -dependent monooxygenase enzyme inducers was examined in the male Wister rat. Like the coadministration of phenobarbitone and 3 -methylcholanthrene, commercial PBBs, either unfractionated or reconstituted from its various fractions, induced both cytochromes P- 450 and P- 448. Both cytochromes were also induced by the less-polar fractions AA and FA. In contrast, little or no inductive effects were exhibited by the more polar Florisil fractions, FB and FC, indicating that the ability of commercial PBBs to induce cytochrome P- 448 is not due to contaminating brominated dibenzofurans or dibenzodioxins. Unlike the polar Florisil fraction, the more polar alumina fraction, AB, was a potent microsomal enzyme inducer. This fraction was enriched in 2, 3, 3 ', 4, 4 ', 5 -hexa- and 2, 2 ', 3, 3 ', 4, 4 ', 5 -heptabromobiphenyl and also contained unassigned monochloro derivatives of a penta- and hexabromobiphenyl, namely C 12 H 4 Br 5 Cl and C 12 H 3 Br 6 Cl, respectively. The data strongly suggest that the biologic effects of the commercial <b>polybrominated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> mixture are due to the various halogenated biphenyls present.

40|$|Cancer {{etiology}} {{involves the}} Interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Striking geographic differences {{and changes in}} cancer incidence over time have led epidemiologists to infer that probably the major etiologic component is environmental. Recent experiences with vinyl chloride, kepone, and <b>polybrominated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> illustrate the problems involved in epidemiologic studies of proven or suspected environmental carcinogens. While epidemiologic studies {{will continue to be}} an essential means for monitoring potential human risks, the long latent periods involved in human carcinogenesis severely limit the usefulness of such approaches for disease prevention. While in vitro and animal test systems can never fully supplant human studies, they represent our only means for detecting potential carcinogenkity before human exposure has become widespread or long established. By promising to detect environmental hazards before human exposure occurs, mutagen testing should be far more effective than epidemiologic studies as a technique for preventive medicine. This, of course, is because epidemiologic studies can take place only after exposure occurs, and usually only after disease develops. The disease prevention shortcomings of epidemiology are particularly noticeable in the field of cancer. Usually 10 - 20 years can be expected to pass before cancer develops following initial exposure to a carcinogenic agent, and the interval will inevitably be longer before clinical and epidemiologic observations suggest cause-effect relationships. In the meantime, human exposures continue, and economic adjustments take place which make preventive measures difficult once carcinogenicity is fmally recognized. The relation of cigarette smoking to lung cancer continues to be a major case in point.
