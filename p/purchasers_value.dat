This means that the precise composition of the wine changes from year to year; it is the expertise of the winemakers which <b>purchasers</b> <b>value,</b> rather than the qualities of the specific places where the grapes are grown, or the particular vines. The quantity of Penfolds Grange produced varies from year to year, with 1,800 bottles of the original 1951 vintage produced. Gago states that 7000 to 9000 cases are made each vintage as of 2013.

40|$|Large {{employers}} {{formed the}} National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) to ensure value to healthcare <b>purchasers.</b> <b>Value</b> in healthcare {{is a function}} of quality divided by costs. Through NCQA's role as an accrediting agency for healthcare organizations and the development of performance measures, Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS), gains toward defining the value of health services have materialized. An analysis of the impact of HEDIS data collection on physician practices and the influence of HEDIS data on employer, employee, and governmental health plan selections is examined. This study consisted of a general review, from 1993 to 2001, of HealthStar databases, PubMed databases, and the NCQA website. NCQA accreditation is accepted as an important industry milestone for health plans, credentials verification organizations, and physician organizations. The data for HEDIS is collected from health plan administrative data repositories, whereas health plan members' clinical data may be collected by chart abstraction in physician offices. Data collection in physician offices consumes administrative resources from physician practices and health plans. As commercial and governmental insurers move toward greater adoption of HEDIS measures, complex implications are created for physician practices and vulnerable populations. There are lingering questions regarding the improvements in quality of care for medically underserved populations and physician practice costs attributable to HEDIS...|$|E

40|$|We compute quality-adjusted price indexes for {{personal}} digital assistants (PDAs) {{for the period}} 1999 to 2004. Hedonic regressions indicate that prices are related to processor generation and clock speed, memory capacity, screen size and quality {{and the presence of}} a digital camera or wireless capability. A particularly salient feature of PDAs is portability, where we find: (i) <b>purchasers</b> <b>value</b> the energy density of the battery technology (e. g. lithium ion) rather than the battery life in hours; and (ii) the physical characteristics of the PDA (e. g. weight, volume) are nonlinearly related to price, suggesting that valuation of the physical form of PDAs does not bear a simple linear relationship to characteristics, either in absolute terms ('smaller is better') or vs. an ergonomic 'sweet spot'. Rather, portability characteristics are correlated with other desirable attributes, making the relationship between price and portability difficult to disentangle. However, hedonic price indexes are robust across different measures of the portability of PDAs. Hedonic indexes using the dummy variable, characteristics prices, and imputation approaches decline on average between 19 and 26 % per year. A matched model price index computed from a subset of observations declines at 19 % per year, while a fixed-effects hedonic index declines at 14 % per year. ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{reasoning}} behind {{value engineering}} is as follows: if marketers expect a product to become practically or stylistically obsolete {{within a specific}} length of time, they can design it to only last for that specific lifetime. The products could be built with higher-grade components, but with value engineering they are not because this would impose an unnecessary cost on the manufacturer, and to a limited extent also an increased cost on the <b>purchaser.</b> <b>Value</b> engineering will reduce these costs. A company will typically use the least expensive components that satisfy the product's lifetime projections.|$|R

40|$|Good faith <b>purchasers</b> for <b>value</b> — {{individuals}} who unknowingly {{and in good}} faith purchase property from a seller whose own actions in obtaining the property are of questionable legality — have long obtained special protection under the common law. Despite the seller’s own actions being tainted, such purchasers obtain valid title themselves and are allowed to freely alienate the property without any restriction. Modern copyright law, however, does just the opposite. Individuals who unknowingly and in good faith purchase property embodying an unauthorized copy of a protected work are altogether precluded from subsequently alienating such property, or risk running afoul of copyright’s distribution right. This Article examines copyright law’s anomalous treatment of good faith purchasers and shows how the concerns motivating the good faith purchaser doctrine in the common law, relating to the free alienability of property and the informational burdens that consumers might have to unduly bear, carry over to the principal settings where modern copyright law operates. It then develops an analogous doctrine for copyright law that would balance the concerns of copyright owners and innocent consumers. Under this doctrine good faith <b>purchasers</b> for <b>value</b> of objects embodying infringing content would obtain good title to such objects {{as long as they}} acquire the object from its manufacturer prior to a judicial determination of infringement against the manufacturer, i. e., so long as the manufacturer’s title is merely voidable and not void. The Article illustrates how such a doctrine would work in practice, and shows how its core elements remain compatible with copyright law’s existing analytical structure and normative ideals...|$|R

However, as Jeffrey Hackney has pointed out, the title is somewhat misleading; in cases where legal title is passed to a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for <b>value</b> without notice, {{it is not so much}} that equity has any great affection for the purchaser - it is simply that equity refuses to intervene to preserve any rights held by the former beneficial owner of the property.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{compares the}} experiential {{consumption}} values that motivate consumer choice to purchase online for {{both male and}} female purchasers and non-purchasers. Design/methodology/approach – Using the theory of consumption value the study examines gendered perceptions of the functional, social and conditional value of using a virtual consumption setting for purchasing. Data was collected through an online survey and analysed using multiple discriminant analysis to determine meaningful differences between male and female purchasers and non-purchasers. Findings – The findings show that male online purchasers are discriminated from female <b>purchasers</b> by social <b>value</b> and from male non-purchasers by conditional <b>value.</b> Female <b>purchasers</b> are discriminated from male <b>purchasers</b> by functional <b>value</b> and from female non-purchasers by social value. Female non-purchasers are discriminated from female <b>purchasers</b> by conditional <b>value.</b> Male non-purchasers are discriminated from male purchasers by functional and social value. Research limitations/implications – Limitations include using an Internet survey and an Australian sample which may impact the generalisability of the findings to a wider population of Internet users. Future research should involve replication of the study in a country more or less developed in terms of gender composition of internet users to extend the generalisability of the findings. Additionally, researchers should examine whether other dimensions of consumption value, such as social influence through on- and off-line communication networks, may influence consumer choice to purchase online. Practical implications – The study provides practical implications for marketers to leverage consumption values that influence male and female consumers 2 ̆ 7 choice to purchase online and then drive their behaviour online through integrated marketing campaigns that involve both on- and offline strategies. Originality/value – The research makes an original contribution to the consumer behaviour literature as to date, no research has been found that undertakes such a comprehensive gender-based comparison of the perceived value of using a virtual consumption setting for purchasing...|$|R
30|$|Medical {{doctors can}} provide people with {{face-to-face}} two-way communication mainly at medical institutions, {{and just like}} pharmacists, they tended {{to be used by}} OTC purchasers who considered individuality a valuable information characteristic; however, information provided by them didn’t have significant impact on consumers’ purchase of OTCs. Although OTC <b>purchasers</b> who <b>valued</b> various information characteristics as well as individuality were more likely to use medical doctors, information provided by them, even individualized information, might not have had enough influence to lead people to purchase OTCs. A Patient Attitude Questionnaire in the West Midlands (Bradley et al. 1998) demonstrated that patients generally expressed positive attitudes regarding their doctors’ suggestions to try OTCs. It is probable that medical doctors might have an impact on consumers’ decisions to substitute prescription drugs with OTCs.|$|R
5000|$|An {{equitable}} easement when the servient tenement is unregistered is enforceable against a <b>purchaser</b> for <b>value</b> only when properly registered {{under the terms}} of the Land Charges Act 1972. Equitable easements arising by virtue of a contract to grant an easement are registerable as either estate contracts or {{equitable easement}}s. Where the servient tenement is registered, the registration of an equitable easement at the Land Registry can take place through mere notice or caution and will then bind purchasers. Alternatively, it will still bind purchasers if it constitutes an [...] "overriding interest". As confirmed in the case of Thatcher v Douglas, section 70(1)(c) of the Land Registration Act and rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925 will operate to ensure that almost all equitable easements constitute overriding interests.|$|R
5000|$|It may however {{be that a}} {{contractual}} document {{has failed}} to adequately reflect {{the intentions of the}} parties, in which case they can ask the court to [...] "rectify" [...] the agreement (i.e. pretend the words written down were different and give an order accordingly). Asking a court to rectify a document does not mean asking for the contract to be changed. It just asks for the recording of the document to be changed. Rectification is an equitable discretionary remedy, and therefore unavailable to claimants who delay excessively and it has no effect against a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for <b>value</b> without notice. There is a fine line between interpretation and rectification, since evidence assisting in interpretation is also evidence which can give rise to rectification. Claimants can ask for both.|$|R
50|$|Under a race/notice statute, a {{subsequent}} <b>purchaser</b> for <b>value</b> wins if (1) {{at the time}} of conveyance, that subsequent purchaser had no actual or constructive notice of the prior conveyance, and (2) the subsequent purchaser records before the prior purchaser. In short, {{a subsequent}} purchaser in good faith wins only if he records before the prior purchaser does. In this type of system, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then Bob will own the land only if he was not aware of the prior sale to Al, and if Bob actually records his interest before Al does. In the hybrid race/notice statute, all grantees have a strong incentive to record early, thereby making the land records complete.|$|R
