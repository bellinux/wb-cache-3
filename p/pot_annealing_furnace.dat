The furnace buildings varied in size and architectural style, growing in size towards {{the latter part of}} the 19th century as technological developments enabled multiple pots to be [...] "fired" [...] at once, using gas as a heating fuel. Each workshop had a series of standard features, such as rows of melting holes, teaming pits, roof vents, rows of shelving for the crucible <b>pots</b> and <b>annealing</b> <b>furnaces</b> to prepare each pot before firing. Ancillary rooms for weighing each charge and for the manufacture of the clay crucibles were either attached to the workshop, or located within the cellar complex. The steel, originally intended for making clock springs, was later used in other applications such as scissors, axes and swords.|$|R

Therefore, steel manufacturing companies are strongly affected by bull whip effects and other unpredictable influences along their production chains. In the course of these integrated operations, making the right decision at a certain stage can {{be the difference between}} earning or losing a great benefit. Improving their operational efficiency is required to keep a competitive position on the market. Therefore, flexible planning and scheduling systems are needed to support these processes, which are based on considerable amounts of data, hardly processable manually anymore.

In this research, we analyzed electricity consumption from the perspective of load profiling, which charts variations in electrical load during a specified period in order to track energy consumption of an <b>annealing</b> <b>furnace</b> in a co-operating steel forging plant. We made a preliminary proposal to use a symbolic time-series data mining framework for electricity consumption analysis.
