40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 25 - 26) This {{paper has}} been written as {{a survey of the}} heat storage and heat transfer fluids in a solar system. This paper is divided into two sections. The first deals with most common heat storage methods as follows. 1. Sensible heat storage: In storage units employing the sensible heat of solids or liquids, heat being absorbed as their specific heat. 2. Storage by change of state: Much more energy is involved in changes of phase, where there is a change from an ordered structure to a disordered one. 3. Solar ponds: Large shallow ponds of water with black bottoms can be used for storing heat from solar radiation for long periods of time. And their problems are also reviewed and summarized. <b>Pebble</b> <b>bed</b> <b>storage</b> used with air circulation is the cheapest method, while the method using chemicals is the most expensive and the most efficient in space utilization. The second section of this paper treats the water and air as heat transfer fluids in a solar system. Water has the advantages of good heat transfer characteristics and suitability for heat transfer fluid but freezing and corrosion are problems. Therefore, a mixture of inhibited water and ethylene glycol is recommended. Air is an acceptable heat transfer fluid for pebble beds and concentrators, but the use of air is severely handicapped when electrical power is not available for operating a blower...|$|E

40|$|In the European Union {{the power}} {{generation}} from wind and photovoltaic, a very unpredictable and fluctuating energy source, has increased significantly {{over the last}} years. With a lack of storage capacity for power in the national grids, energy balance demand rises from year to year. As a matter of research Fraunhofer UMSICHT is exploring a concept of implementing high temperature storages (HTES), for example <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> <b>storages</b> (so-called Pebble-Heater), in biomass power plants for high temperature heat storage. In times of low energy demand {{a fraction of the}} flue gas is diverted and used in a HTES to buffer thermal energy on a high temperature level. In times of high energy use, the power plant operates in condensation mode and with the stored energy the heat supply of the connected consumer can be maintained, e. g. for supply of process heat or district heating systems. The decoupling of heat and power generation leads to more flexibility in the operation of the power plants...|$|R

40|$|The {{situation}} on the energy market in the EU countries, especially in Germany, is in a changing process. An increasing amount of wind and solar power plants is feeding renewable, but fluctuating energy into the grid especially in Germany. Thus balancing power is needed. Combined heat and power plants (CHPs) are mostly operating heat driven at the moment. Fraunhofer UMSICHT is researching a new concept of external superheating for CHP with biomass and waste fuels for increasing electrical efficiency and additional storage option for decoupling heat and power generation in order to supply the electrical grid with power on demand. Therefore the main component for this superheating concept, the so-called Pebble-Heater, has been developed. It is a <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> regenerator and <b>storage</b> system for high temperatures, {{which can be used}} in combined heat and power plants (CHPs). Theoretical examination of the Pebble-Heater performance has been accomplished at the test facilities of F raunhofer UMSICHT during the last years. Especially the temperature profile inside the <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> has been simulated. The results of the Pebble-Heater test rig with a storage capacity of approximately 80 kW. h at temperatures up to 1200 °C are presented in this paper. The temperature profile inside the <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> combined with a low pressure drop have shown the potential to implement the Pebble-Heater for high temperature usage...|$|R
40|$|For {{efficient}} {{application of}} solar energy, a <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> energy <b>storage</b> heating {{system in a}} solar attic is optimally designed and operated. To study {{the characteristics of the}} heating system, a numerical model for the system is presented and is validated with the experiment data in the literature. Based on the model, the influence of the envelopes of the solar house and the meteorological condition on the system performance is investigated. The results show that the envelopes, except those on the north face, with more glazed exterior surfaces can be beneficial to raise the temperature of the solar house. It is also found that outdoor temperature may have less impact on the energy storage in the system compared with solar radiation. Furthermore, through optimizing the system design and operation, solar energy can account for 56 % of the energy requirement in the heating season in Xi’an (about 34 ° N, 108 ° E), which has an average altitude of 397. 5 m and moderate solar irradiation. Also, the suitability of the system in northwest China is investigated, and the outcome demonstrates that the external comprehensive temperature should be more than 269 K if a 50 % energy saving rate is expected...|$|R

40|$|Several blanket designs {{based on}} lithium ceramic and Be <b>pebble</b> <b>beds</b> are being {{currently}} considered for fusion reactors (e. g. refs. [1, 2]). The thermomechanical {{behavior of the}} <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> regions represents a key issue for these blankets. This is mostly due to temperature-driven processes imposing operating limits on the <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> temperatures and requiring acceptable accuracy in the prediction of the <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> spatial and temporal temperature profiles over the lifetime of the blanket. For example, the tritium inventory in ceramic breeder and Be increases with decreasing temperature and would set a lower limit on the operating temperature of Be and Li ceramics. For blankets {{with the possibility of}} water ingress under safety analysis scenarios the possible Be/steam reaction imposes an upper limit on the Be operating temperature. Differential thermal expansion and swelling creates stress/strain conditions which affect the <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> thermal conductivity and possibly the lifetime of the component, and need to be understood.

Within the framework of the modelling activities promoted for the lithiated ceramics and beryllium <b>pebble</b> <b>beds</b> foreseen in the Helium-Cooled Pebble Bed breeding blanket concept of DEMO, at the Department of Nuclear Engineering of the University of Palermo (DIN) a thermo-mechanical constitutive model has been set-up assuming that <b>pebble</b> <b>beds</b> can be considered as continuous, homogeneous and isotropic media.

40|$|MSc (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The heat {{transfer}} phenomena in the near-wall region of a randomly packed <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> {{are important in}} the design of a Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR), especially when considering the safety case during accident conditions. At higher temperatures the contribution of the radiation {{heat transfer}} component to the overall heat transfer in a PBR increases significantly. The wall effect present in the near-wall region of a packed <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> affects the heat transfer in this region. Various correlations exist to predict the effective thermal conductivity through a packed <b>pebble</b> <b>bed,</b> but not all of the correlations consider the contribution of radiation and some are only applicable to the bulk region. Experimental research has been done on the heat transfer through a packed <b>pebble</b> <b>bed.</b> However, most of the results are case specific and cannot necessarily be used to validate models or simulations to predict the effective thermal conductivity of a <b>pebble</b> <b>bed.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a methodology that uses experimental work together with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to predict the effective thermal conductivity in the near-wall region of a randomly packed <b>pebble</b> <b>bed,</b> and to separate the conduction and radiation components of the effective thermal conductivity. The proposed methodology inter alia includes experimental tests and the calibration of a CFD model to obtain numerical results that correlate well with the experimental results. To illustrate the proposed methodology the newly constructed Near-wall Effect Thermal Conductivity Test Facility (NWETCTF) was used to gather experimental results for the temperature and heat transfer distribution through a randomly packed <b>pebble</b> <b>bed.</b> Two identical but separate experimental tests were performed and the results of the two tests were in good agreement. From the experimental results the effective thermal conductivity was derived. The effect of the near-wall region on the heat transfer and the significance of radiation at higher temperatures are evident from the results. Recommendations were made for future experimental work with the NWETCTF from the findings of the investigation.

40|$|The AVR <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> reactor (46 MWth) was {{operated}} 1967 - 88 at coolant outlet temperatures up to 990 °C. A principle {{difference of}} <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> HTRs as AVR to conventional reactors is the continuous movement of fuel element pebbles through the core which complicates thermohydraulic, nuclear and safety estimations. Also {{because of a}} lack of other experience AVR operation is still a relevant basis for future <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> HTRs and thus requires careful examination. This paper deals mainly with some insufficiently published unresolved safety problems of AVR operation and of <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> HTRs but skips the widely known advantageous features of <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> HTRs. The AVR primary circuit is heavily contaminated with metallic fission products (Sr- 90, Cs- 137) which create problems in current dismantling. The amount of this contamination is not exactly known, but the evaluation of fission product deposition experiments indicates that the end of life contamination reached several percent of a single core inventory, which is some orders of magnitude more than precalculated and far more than in large LWRs. A major fraction of this contamination is bound on graphitic dust and thus partly mobile in depressurization accidents, which has to be considered in safety analyses of future reactors. A re-evaluation of the AVR contamination is performed here in order to quantify consequences for future HTRs (400 MW$_{th]$). It leads to the conclusion that the AVR contamination was mainly caused by inadmissible high core temperatures, increasing fission product release rates, and not - as presumed in the past - by inadequate fuel quality only. The high AVR core temperatures were detected not earlier than one year before final AVR shut-down, because a <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> core cannot yet be equipped with instruments. The maximum core temperatures are still unknown but were more than 200 K higher than calculated. Further, azimuthal temperature differences at the active core margin of up to 200 K were observed, probably due to a power asymmetry. Unpredictable hot gas currents with temperatures > 1100 °C, which may have harmed the steam generator, were measured in the top reflector range. After detection of the inadmissible core temperatures, the AVR hot gas temperatures were strongly reduced for safety reasons. Thus a safe and reliable AVR operation at high coolant temperatures, which is taken as a foundation of the <b>pebble</b> <b>bed</b> VHTR development in Generation IV, was not conform with reality. Despite of remarkable effort spent in this problem the high core temperatures, the power asymmetry and the hot gas currents are not yet understood.

Packed beds of lengths similar to 200 mm and 300 mm were characterized for packing diameter based Reynolds numbers, Re-d ranging from 0. 6 x 10 (4) to 8. 5 x 10 (4). The solid packing used in the bed consisted of circle divide 9. 5 mm and circle divide 5 mm steel spheres with suitable arrangements to eliminate flow entrance and exit effects. The ratios of packed bed diameter to packing diameter for 9. 5 mm and 5 mm sphere packing were similar to 9. 5 and 18 respectively, with the average packed bed porosities around 0. 4. Gas temperatures were measured at the entry, exit and at three axial locations along centre-line in the packed beds.
