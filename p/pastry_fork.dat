2500|$|A <b>pastry</b> <b>fork,</b> {{also known}} as a [...] "pie fork", is a fork {{designed}} for eating pastries and other desserts while holding a plate. The fork has 3 or 4 tines. The 3 tine fork has a larger, flattened and beveled tine on the side while the 4 tine fork has the 1st and 2nd tine connected or bridged together and beveled. On July 7, 1891, Anna M. Mangin of Queens, a borough of New York City, filed the first patent for the <b>pastry</b> <b>fork.</b> U.S. patent #470,005 was later issued on March 1, 1892.|$|E
50|$|Pastry forks {{range in}} size from 4 inches (10 cm) (in English <b>pastry</b> <b>fork</b> sets) to 7 inches (19 cm) as serving pieces in {{silverware}} (sterling and silver plate) place settings. In many fine place settings, the <b>pastry</b> <b>fork</b> and pie fork may be two separate forks as well.|$|E
5000|$|The cakes {{are usually}} served with tea or coffee, and in formal {{settings}} are eaten with <b>pastry</b> <b>forks.</b> But the brittleness of the pastry makes this difficult, inspiring the humorous article [...] "Hoe eet je een tompoes?" [...] 'How {{do you eat}} a tompoes?'.|$|R
50|$|It is {{typically}} {{designed so that}} it can be used with the right hand, while the left hand holds the plate. It therefore has the left side widened to be used like a knife to cut the food when pressed down on the plate. Left-handed <b>pastry</b> <b>forks</b> have the right side widened instead.|$|R
25|$|Serving {{pieces were}} often elaborately {{decorated}} and pierced and embellished with ivory, and could include {{any or all}} of the following: carving knife and fork, salad knife and fork, cold meat fork, punch ladle, soup ladle, gravy ladle, casserole-serving spoon, berry spoon, lasagna server, macaroni server, asparagus server, cucumber server, tomato server, olive spoon, cheese scoop, fish knife and <b>fork,</b> <b>pastry</b> server, petit four server, cake knife, bon bon spoon, salt spoon, sugar sifter or caster and crumb remover with brush.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>pastry</b> <b>fork,</b> {{also known}} as a [...] "pie fork", is a fork {{designed}} for eating pastries and other desserts from a plate. The fork has three or four tines. The three-tine fork has a larger, flattened and beveled tine on the side while the four-tine fork has the first and second tine connected or bridged together and beveled.|$|E
50|$|When more {{courses are}} being served, place {{settings}} {{may become more}} elaborate and cutlery more specialised. Examples include fruit spoon or fruit knife, cheese knife, and <b>pastry</b> <b>fork.</b> Other types of cutlery, such as boning forks, were used when formal meals included dishes that have since become less common. Carving knives and forks are used to carve roasts at the table.|$|E
5000|$|Dessert fork (alternatively, pudding fork/cake fork in Great Britain): Any {{of several}} {{different}} special types of forks designed to eat desserts, {{such as a}} <b>pastry</b> <b>fork.</b> They usually have only three tines and are smaller than standard dinner forks. The leftmost tine may be widened so as to provide an edge with which to cut (though it is never sharpened).|$|E
50|$|Mainly in {{the winter}} season, {{temporary}} stands selling poffertjes are quite popular, and sell portions containing one or two dozen of them. Usually the cook prepares them freshly for the customer. They are sold on a small cardboard (sometimes plastic) plate and come with a small disposable fork {{the size of a}} <b>pastry</b> <b>fork.</b> Poffertjes are not difficult to prepare, but a special cast iron pan or copper pan (also available in aluminium with Teflon coating) with several shallow indentations in the bottom is required.|$|E
