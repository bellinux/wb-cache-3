She was considered one of the best miniature painters in America and something of an innovator in the medium, especially in her use of broad paint handling, bright colors, and line work in place of traditional stippling.|$|E

Many then went on to become his customers, and some his lovers. His easy manners, charisma and exotic appeal meant that he was able to build up a large female clientele that was close to a fan club. In order to distance himself from the actual transaction, the goods and money were exchanged over a high wall so that the parties were invisible to each other.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} met with {{negative}} reviews by critics and mixed enthusiasm by theater proprietors. The Morning Telegraph found it unbelievable and only {{for the sake of}} the plot that family would be reunited by happenstance. The Moving Picture World was negative finding that it was not a strong offering because of the plot and the camerawork having resulted in a cloudy image quality in parts of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror found the concept of the plot to be interesting, but the execution to have been poorly executed. [...] The review found that the production was crude, cheap and unconvincing because the set was bare and lacked the presence of onlookers on the city scenes. Advertisers like the Majestic theater of Wellington, Kansas, would prompt it as a [...] "well told story". The Empire in Frederick, Maryland, would be equally promotional and appeal to the audience as having <b>pretty</b> <b>girls</b> in the cast. The Edisonia in Durham, North Carolina, advertised the film as a strong Thanhouser drama that was [...] "thrilling, pathetic, interesting". The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Bioscope from November 10, 1910. It states: [...] "Will and John are prosperous young businessmen and close friends. Will has {{an apartment in the}} city, while John lives in the suburbs. When Will goes to the country on his vacation he leaves the latchkey of his apartment with his chum, telling him to make himself at home. The landlady in the house in which Will lives is seized with a bright idea that she can sublet his apartment during his absence. May and Belle, two <b>pretty</b> <b>girls</b> who are in business, decide to try their hand at housekeeping. They rent Will's apartment and settle down in their new quarters. John decides to take advantage of his friend's invitation and make use of his rooms. He lets himself in with the latchkey, and is amazed to find the two girls sound asleep. Believing him to be a burglar the girls threaten him with annihilation. John thinks the joke too good to spoil, so does not try to square himself, but pleads for mercy. May secures his promise that he will never 'burgle' again, and allows him to escape. Unknown to John, May has been engaged by his partner as a typist, and when she enters the office the following morning and finds John opening the safe, she decides that once again her burglar has been caught red-handed. She calls for help, and is greatly chagrined when her supposed burglar is introduced as her employer. Amid explanations, the 'burglar' and the lady shake hands and become good friends." ...|$|E
