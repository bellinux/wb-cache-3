In 1996, the U.S. had proven helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about 147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM). At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM {{per year in the}} U.S.; see <b>pie</b> <b>chart</b> below) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers.|$|E

Warp Records released Selected Ambient Works Volume II in 1994, with a less beat- and melody-driven sound than the previous album. The track names were described with <b>pie</b> <b>chart</b> symbols, each of which {{was meant to be}} paired with a corresponding image in the album jacket (except [...] "Blue Calx"). To decipher the titles, listeners had to compare the length of each track with the size of the pie-chart symbols; for example, the first title (often called [...] "Cliffs"), is realised by pairing the first symbol with the first image (a rocky cliffside). James said in The Wire magazine and elsewhere that the tracks were inspired by lucid dreams and synaesthesia. Other releases were a fourth Analogue Bubblebath; GAK (derived from early demos sent to Warp Records), and Classics, a compilation album with [...] "Digeridoo" [...] EP and the Xylem Tube EP.|$|E

50|$|An {{obvious flaw}} {{exhibited}} by <b>pie</b> <b>charts</b> {{is that they}} cannot show {{more than a few}} values without separating the visual encoding (the “slices”) from the data they represent (typically percentages). When slices become too small, <b>pie</b> <b>charts</b> have to rely on colors, textures or arrows so the reader can understand them. This makes them unsuitable for use with larger amounts of data. <b>Pie</b> <b>charts</b> also take up a larger amount of space on the page compared to the more flexible bar charts, which do not need to have separate legends, and can display other values such as averages or targets at the same time.|$|R

Age and gender groups that are especially susceptible to being involved in accidents then stand out as slices that extend beyond the original <b>pie</b> <b>chart.</b>|$|E
