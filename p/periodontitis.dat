5|$|Apical <b>periodontitis</b> is acute {{or chronic}} {{inflammation}} around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical <b>periodontitis,</b> and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical <b>periodontitis.</b> Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Periodontitis,</b> a {{bacterial}} disease affecting the jaws, is particularly virulent in marsh rice rats; the animal {{has been proposed}} {{as a model for}} research on the disease in humans. The identity of the bacterial agent remains unknown. Vitamin E, fluoride, and iodide protect against bone loss associated with this disease in the rice rat and a high-sucrose diet increases the severity of <b>periodontitis.</b> A case of kyphosis has been observed in a North Carolina marsh rice rat.|$|E
5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical <b>periodontitis</b> (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral <b>periodontitis</b> (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical <b>periodontitis.</b> Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic <b>periodontitis</b> (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical <b>periodontitis</b> is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E
5|$|One of the specimens, AMZ 6698, is {{an adult}} female {{that lived in}} Zürich Zoo. It is {{represented}} by a virtually complete skeleton, but the skin was not preserved. According to Schwartz, the skeleton shows signs of osteoporosis and <b>periodontitis</b> (common in zoo animals), but not of other pathologies or abnormalities. The right teeth were removed before Schwartz studied the specimen. Schwartz selected this specimen as the holotype. The other specimen, AMZ-AS 1730, is a subadult male collected in the wild, of which only the skull, including the mandible (lower jaw), was preserved. The dentition includes both permanent and deciduous teeth. Specimens of Pseudopotto are at least superficially similar to pottos, but according to Schwartz, they differ {{in a number of}} traits. Among lorisids, Schwartz saw similarities between the false potto and true pottos as well as angwantibos and slow lorises (Nycticebus). The false potto is comparable in size to the smallest pottos, but falls within their range of metrical variation; small size is also seen in western pottos.|$|E
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, <b>periodontitis,</b> and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. <b>Periodontitis</b> and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
25|$|While {{some cases}} of {{gingivitis}} never progress to <b>periodontitis,</b> data indicates that <b>periodontitis</b> is always preceded by gingivitis.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{researchers}} <b>periodontitis</b> {{may be associated}} with higher stress. <b>Periodontitis</b> occurs more often in people from {{the lower end of the}} socioeconomic scale than people from the upper end of the socioeconomic scale.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{increased risk}} of <b>periodontitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>periodontitis</b> affects about 750nbsp&million {{people or}} about 10.8% of the {{population}} as of 2010.|$|E
25|$|Microaerophile {{bacteria}} Actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens {{also may}} play a role in chronic <b>periodontitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that <b>periodontitis</b> results in worldwide productivity losses {{in the size of}} about US$54 billion yearly.|$|E
25|$|Ehlers–Danlos {{syndrome}} is a <b>periodontitis</b> risk factor {{and so is}} the Papillon–Lefèvre syndrome also known as palmoplantar keratoderma.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages, chronic <b>periodontitis</b> has few {{symptoms}} {{and in many}} individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic {{species of}} {{bacteria}} Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium sp. {{have all been}} implicated in chronic <b>periodontitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smoking {{is another}} factor that {{increases}} the occurrence of <b>periodontitis,</b> directly or indirectly, and may interfere with or adversely affect its treatment.|$|E
25|$|Using an {{antiseptic}} mouthwash: Chlorhexidine gluconate-based mouthwash {{in combination}} with careful oral hygiene may cure gingivitis, although they cannot reverse any attachment loss due to <b>periodontitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like other {{conditions}} intimately related to access to hygiene and basic medical monitoring and care, <b>periodontitis</b> {{tends to be}} more common in economically disadvantaged populations or regions. Its occurrence decreases with a higher standard of living. In Israeli population, individuals of Yemenite, North-African, South Asian, or Mediterranean origin have higher prevalence of periodontal disease than individuals from European descent. <b>Periodontitis</b> is frequently reported to be socially patterned, i.e. people from {{the lower end of the}} socioeconomic scale suffer more often from it than people from the upper end of the socioeconomic scale.|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>periodontitis</b> is {{a common}} disease of the oral cavity {{consisting}} of chronic inflammation of the periodontal tissues that is caused by accumulation of profuse amounts of dental plaque.|$|E
25|$|Long term {{randomized}} {{clinical trials}} {{need to be}} conducted to determine if regular routine scaling and polishing is clinically effective for {{reducing the risk of}} chronic <b>periodontitis</b> in healthy adults.|$|E
25|$|Saliva {{contributes}} to the digestion of food and {{to the maintenance of}} oral hygiene. Without normal salivary function the frequency of dental caries, gum disease (gingivitis and <b>periodontitis),</b> and other oral problems increases significantly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Periodontitis</b> {{has been}} linked to {{increased}} inflammation in the body, such as indicated by raised levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. It is linked through this to increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis. It also linked in those over 60 years of age to impairments in delayed memory and calculation abilities. Individuals with impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus have higher degrees of periodontal inflammation, and often have difficulties with balancing their blood glucose level owing to the constant systemic inflammatory state, caused by the periodontal inflammation. Although no causal association was proven, a recent study showed correlation between chronic <b>periodontitis</b> and erectile dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Meta-analysis {{found an}} {{association}} between periodontal disease and RA, but the mechanism of this association remains unclear. Two bacterial species associated with <b>periodontitis</b> are implicated as mediators of protein citrullination in the gums of people with RA.|$|E
25|$|Regular dental check-ups and {{professional}} teeth cleaning as required: Dental check-ups serve {{to monitor the}} person's oral hygiene methods and levels of attachment around teeth, identify any early signs of <b>periodontitis,</b> and monitor response to treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Periodontitis</b> is very common, and {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the second most common dental disease worldwide, after dental decay, and in the United States has a prevalence of 30–50% of the population, but only about 10% have severe forms.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} makes <b>periodontitis</b> a {{difficult}} disease to {{study is that}} human host response can also affect the alveolar bone resorption. Host response to the bacterial-mycotic insult is mainly determined by genetics; however, immune development may play some role in susceptibility.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane {{review of}} 30 studies {{concluded}} that triclosan/copolymer-containing toothpastes produced a 22% reduction in both dental plaque and gingival inflammation {{when compared with}} fluoride toothpastes without triclosan/copolymer. There was weak evidence of a reduction in tooth cavities, and no evidence of reduction in <b>periodontitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A dental {{hygienist}} or dentist will {{check for the}} symptoms of gingivitis, and may also examine the amount of plaque in the oral cavity. A {{dental hygienist}} or dentist will also look for signs of <b>periodontitis</b> using X-rays or periodontal probing {{as well as other}} methods.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} shows that activity levels of the following enzymes in saliva samples are associated with periodontal destruction: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and acid phosphatase (ACP). Therefore, these enzyme biomarkers {{may be used to}} aid in the diagnosis and treatment of gingivitis and <b>periodontitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>periodontitis</b> is {{initiated}} by Gram-negative tooth-associated microbial biofilms that elicit a host response, {{which results in}} bone and soft tissue destruction. In response to endotoxin derived from periodontal pathogens, several osteoclast-related mediators target the destruction of alveolar bone and supporting connective tissue such as the periodontal ligament. Major drivers of this aggressive tissue destruction are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, and other osteoclast-derived enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Dental {{disease is}} very common in dogs. Calculus is the most obvious sign of dental disease, but {{gingivitis}} progressing to <b>periodontitis</b> is what results in tooth loss. Treatment involves scaling and polishing of the teeth under general anesthesia and treatment of any periodontal disease. Prevention is very important and can be accomplished {{through the use of}} special diets or treats, brushing, and plaque prevention gels.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a slow}} to {{moderate}} rate of disease progression but the patient may have periods of rapid progression ("bursts of destruction"). Chronic <b>periodontitis</b> {{can be associated with}} local predisposing factors(e.g. tooth-related or iatrogenic factors). The disease may be modified by and be associated with systemic diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus, HIV infection) It can also be modified by factors other than systemic disease such as smoking and emotional stress.|$|E
25|$|As {{dental plaque}} or biofilm accumulates on the teeth near {{and below the}} gums, there is {{a shift in the}} {{composition}} of the biofilm from essentially streptococcus to an actinomyces dominant plaque. Motile bacteria is also seen more frequently. As this happens, inflammation sets in the gingiva. Initially, this takes the form of gingivitis, which represents inflammation confined to the soft tissues above the bone level. Inflammation in the gingiva can remain at the gingivitis level for a long period and will not progress to <b>periodontitis,</b> unless in the presence of local conditions or generalized host susceptibility. When this shift occurs, the immune system's response to plaque accumulation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic mediated response to lymphocytic and plasma cell-mediated response. Clinically, the gingiva presents swelling, redness and a tendency to bleed. This modifies the environment, leading to changes in the composition of the biofilm itself. As this happens, a predominantly gram-negative environment is established, with periodontal pathogens emerging. These include A. actinomycetemcomitans, the red complex bacteria (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola) {{and to a lesser extent}} the orange complex bacteria (F. nucleatum, P. micros, P. intermedia, P. nigrecens, E. nodatum and S. constellates). Strongest bacterial association to chronic <b>periodontitis</b> is with P. gingivalis. Numerous virulence factors have been identified for this pathogen. This allows P. gingivalis to elude defense mechanism and perpetuate inflammation inside the periodontium. Prolonged inflammation in the periodontium leads to an apical shift in the attachment of the gingiva to the tooth with deepening pockets and bone loss around the teeth. Untreated <b>periodontitis</b> progresses unevenly over time but results in loss of function, tissue destruction, and tooth loss.|$|E
25|$|In some people, {{gingivitis}} progresses to <b>periodontitis</b> – {{with the}} destruction of the gingival fibers, the gum tissues separate from the tooth and deepened sulcus, called a periodontal pocket. Subgingival microorganisms (those that exist under the gum line) colonize the periodontal pockets and cause further inflammation in the gum tissues and progressive bone loss. Examples of secondary causes are those things that, by definition, cause microbic plaque accumulation, such as restoration overhangs and root proximity.|$|E
