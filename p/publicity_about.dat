Ayres' style in art was highly detailed with exaggerated angularity. His works and written accounts were distributed nationally, and an art exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City. Hutchings' publicity efforts between 1855 and 1860 led to an increase in tourism to Yosemite.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl tried {{many times}} to make more films during the 1950s and 1960s, but was met with resistance, public protests and sharp criticism. Many of her filmmaking peers in Hollywood had fled Nazi Germany and were unsympathetic to her. Although both film {{professionals}} and investors were willing to support her work, most of the projects she attempted were stopped owing to ever-renewed and highly negative <b>publicity</b> <b>about</b> her past work for the Third Reich.|$|E

5|$|Monroe next filmed a {{scene for}} Something's Got to Give {{in which she}} swam naked in a {{swimming}} pool. To generate advance publicity, the press was invited to take photographs of the scene, which were later published in Life; {{this was the first}} time that a major star had posed nude while at the height of their career. When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling to cover the rising costs of Cleopatra (1963). On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages. She was replaced by Lee Remick, but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production.
