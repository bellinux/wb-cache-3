5|$|Nick calls Norah, {{apologizing for}} leaving, and she agrees {{to meet him}} again. Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to <b>play</b> <b>something</b> {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the {{recording}} room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E
25|$|Rather than give way, Charles {{prepared}} in 1640 to invade Scotland. Montrose was of necessity driven to <b>play</b> <b>something</b> {{of a double}} game. In August 1640 he signed the Bond of Cumbernauld as a protest against the particular and direct practising of a few, in other words, against the ambition of Argyll. But he took his place amongst the defenders of his country, {{and in the same}} month displayed his gallantry in action at the forcing of the River Tyne at Newburn. On 27 May 1641 he was summoned before the Committee of Estates and charged with intrigues against Argyll, and on 11 June he was imprisoned by them in Edinburgh Castle. Charles visited Scotland to give his formal assent to the abolition of Episcopacy, and upon the King's return to England Montrose shared in the amnesty tacitly accorded to all Charles's partisans.|$|E

500|$|According to musicologist Leonid Sabaneyev, Tchaikovsky was not {{comfortable}} with being recorded for posterity and tried {{to shy away from}} it. On an apparently separate visit from the one related above, Block asked the composer to <b>play</b> <b>something</b> on a piano or at least say something. Tchaikovsky refused. He told Block, [...] "I am a bad pianist and my voice is raspy. Why should one eternalize it?" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Inglis, [...] "Love You To" [...] is [...] "defined" [...] by {{the interplay}} between sitar and tabla. Bhagwat later {{recalled}} of his involvement: [...] "George told me what he wanted and I tuned the tabla with him. He suggested I <b>play</b> <b>something</b> in the Ravi Shankar style, 16-beats, though he agreed that I should improvise. Indian music is all improvisation." [...] After rehearsing the song together many times, Harrison and Bhagwat recorded the sitar and tabla parts onto the vocal and guitar performance taped earlier that day.|$|E

500|$|Taborn has {{commented on}} the {{similarities}} and differences in his playing on piano and electronic instruments. Comparing his accompaniments on piano and Fender Rhodes, he said that: I play some of the same chords on the piano, but there are definitely things I would do on the piano because it's a more transparent instrument that I wouldn't do on the Rhodes. [...] The Rhodes is so strong that when you <b>play</b> <b>something</b> on it, it really can dictate, because it's louder and the timbre is much more opaque. So you leave more holes. On the piano, I would maybe play more sustain chords.|$|E
500|$|... "It adapts {{with the}} show, I {{think in the}} context of a live show it's {{important}} to have something that lives and breathes with the show.

So it needs to be malleable ... It's as much a piece of art as the music is, so we want it to be compelling and fit with the overall kind of aesthetic of what the band is up to right at this moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The video also faced a ban from MTV Arabia {{citing the}} same reason as Australia. Since it was very rare to ban videos on MTV, head of MTV Arabia Samer al Marzouki commented, [...] "We {{represent}} the young generation's mentality and culture so we can't <b>play</b> <b>something</b> that conflicts with that.

[...] He attributed his ability to keep playing during some of the longest shows in E Street Band history to his keeping in top physical condition, including exercise by swimming, and to his love of playing with Springsteen.|$|E
500|$|After that Beyoncé {{mentions}} Jay-Z, {{the bass}} glides {{up for a}} vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone [...] "to <b>play</b> <b>something</b> more singing", {{in the words of}} Jon Jon Webb, the bass player on the track. The melody returns to the main groove during the repeated hook. This pattern repeats and leads to the second rap verse. The third pre-chorus [...] "comes from Jerkins' idea to have the part changes on top, with Webb's main groove on the bottom". It is followed by the main pre-chorus, then the hook is repeated four times. The singing stops and the instruments fill in the space. The hi-hat and Roland TR-808 also stop; the song ends with the plucked bass and blasts of horns.|$|E
500|$|In June 2004, Bloc Party convened at Deltalab Studios in Copenhagen to make Silent Alarm with Paul Epworth. The {{band had}} already written demo songs to record, but Okereke {{has noted that}} [...] "it is a {{creative}} process {{and you have to}} let yourself be inspired while you're in the studio as well". The Deltalab set-up posed problems, because it included bare mains cables and dated, malfunctioning equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. Bloc Party took three sessions to get acquainted with Epworth's methodology. The producer has called the recording time a [...] "growing process" [...] because Okereke was not wholly comfortable singing in front of people, especially after tonsil problems. Although the band members had preliminary ideas about a track's rhythm, they did not know how songs were going to start or end. Okereke often asked Tong to <b>play</b> <b>something</b> on the drums, which inspired him to mould a track by adding guitar chords to the beat.|$|E

500|$|... "Get On Top", a song which {{contains}} significant {{use of a}} wah pedal, was formed after a jam session conducted shortly after Frusciante had listened to Public Enemy: [...] "I came up with [...] {{on the way to}} rehearsal—just tapping it out with my foot." [...] The understated guitar solo played {{in the middle of the}} song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought process after listening to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' [...] "Siberian Khatru": [...] "the band sounded really big—and they're playing really fast—and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on its own sort of shelf. For 'Get On Top' I wanted to <b>play</b> <b>something</b> that contrasted between the solo and the background." [...] "Savior", a song found towards the end of the album, features heavy effects, most notably an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second delay. Frusciante notes that the sound is [...] "directly inspired by Eric Clapton's playing in Cream. If you listen to the actual notes, they're like a Clapton solo—they just don't sound like it because of the effects." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Sam & Max comics {{had a more}} adult tone, Steve Purcell {{expected}} LucasArts to {{cut back}} [...] "the edgier material" [...] from the game. However, he expressed that he was pleased with how LucasArts allowed him {{to stay close to}} his original vision for the game. The game's various minigames were included to allow players to take a break from solving the main game's puzzles and <b>play</b> <b>something</b> [...] "short and silly". Sam & Max Hit the Road also signified a major change in development for games on the SCUMM engine. The user interface was entirely rehauled from that introduced in Maniac Mansion and built upon in subsequent games. Instead of selecting a verb function from a list {{at the bottom of the}} screen and clicking on an in-game entity, Sam & Max Hit the Road compressed all verb functions into the mouse cursor, which players could cycle through using the right-mouse button. The inventory was also moved off the main screen to a sub-screen accessible by a small icon on the screen. According to Steve Purcell, this cleared space on the screen to [...] "expand on the excellent backgrounds and also made interaction much quicker and less laborious than LucasArts' previous adventure games" [...] The conversation trees were also affected by this; Michael Stemmle proposed removing the text-based selection menu used in previous LucasArts' adventure games in favor of icons representing topics of discussion as [...] "nothing would kill a joke worse than reading it before you hear it". Several of these innovations were retained for future LucasArts adventure games.|$|E
500|$|Allgame {{said the}} {{enjoyment}} [...] "isn't bad", but limited: [...] "You can only blow {{up so much}} stuff with a helicopter." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm happy {{to say that the}} much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, {{it would be nice to}} <b>play</b> <b>something</b> that requires a little bit more than just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When all is said and done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E
5000|$|Block was {{notable for}} his {{considerable}} influence on a records popularity. Block's program on station WNEW was highly successful, and Block {{was described as}} [...] "the make-all, break-all of records. If he <b>played</b> <b>something,</b> it was a hit". Block later negotiated a multimillion-dollar contract with ABC for a syndicated nationwide radio show.|$|R
60|$|My {{attention}} was now diverted by a fresh stir and bustle.

500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{integrated}} the band's typical punk and funk style, but {{moved away}} from this with more melodically driven songs. Tracks like [...] "The Righteous and the Wicked", [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Funky Monks" [...] still incorporated use of heavy metal guitar riffs, but differed from Mother's Milk in that they contained less distortion. Flea, who had centered his bass playing around the slapping technique, downplayed on this {{in favor of more}} traditional and melodic bass lines. He also adopted a minimalist, [...] "less is more" [...] philosophy: [...] "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do <b>play</b> <b>something</b> busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good." [...] Kiedis felt that the album would expand the Chili Peppers' musical horizons, and that it was a departure from their previous material. One of Blood Sugar Sex Magiks more melodic tracks, [...] "Breaking the Girl", was written about Kiedis' constantly shifting relationships. He feared that he was following in his father's footsteps and simply becoming a womanizer, rather than establishing stable and long-term relationships: [...] "...As exciting and temporarily fulfilling as this constant influx of interesting and beautiful girls can be, {{at the end of the}} day, that shit is lonely and you're left with nothing." [...] The track also featured a bridge in the middle, consisting of percussion instruments salvaged from a garbage dump.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, McAdams {{starred in}} Woody Allen's fantasy romantic comedy Midnight in Paris with her Wedding Crashers co-star Owen Wilson and Michael Sheen. The film opened the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. McAdams played Inez, the shrewish fiancée of Wilson's {{character}} Gil. Allen wrote McAdams' part for her, after hearing [...] "glowing reports" [...] from {{his friend and}} her former co-star Diane Keaton. He {{said that he was}} [...] "crazy about Rachel" [...] and wanted to give her the opportunity to <b>play</b> <b>something</b> other than [...] "beautiful girls". The film was shot on location in Paris and McAdams has said that the experience [...] "will always have a great place in my heart". Hadley Freeman The Guardian criticized that she [...] "has morphed from the sweet thing in Wedding Crashers to the dream-crushing bitch that, according to American comedies, women become once they ensnare their man". Richard Corliss of Time [...] "felt sorry for McAdams, whose usually winning presence is ground into hostile cliché". However, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt she [...] "deftly handles a part that is less amiable than usual for her" [...] and A. O. Scott of The New York Times found her [...] "superbly speeded-up". It became Allen's highest-grossing film ever in North America and was the most commercially successful independent film of 2011. With a production budget of $17million, the film has grossed over $151 million worldwide. McAdams, along with six other members of the cast, received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture nomination. Allen won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the film itself was nominated for three other Academy Awards, including Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|New {{cast members}} include Ian McShane, {{who plays the}} notorious pirate and primary {{antagonist}} of the film, Blackbeard, and Penélope Cruz, who plays Angelica, Jack Sparrow's love interest. According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because [...] "he can <b>play</b> <b>something</b> evil but there's always humor behind it as well" [...] and the actor accepted the job due to both the [...] "very funny and charming" [...] script {{and the opportunity to}} work with Marshall. The beard took one {{hour and a half to}} get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to [...] "a real biker pirate—it's all black leather.” Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit the description as [...] "an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him, but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way. She needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful", and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of Nine. The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role. During filming, Cruz discovered she was pregnant, leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic, and the producers to hire her sister Mónica Cruz to double for Penélope in risky scenes. Depp recommended Stephen Graham, who worked with him in Public Enemies, to play Scrum, a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick to Jack Sparrow, and Richard Griffiths for the role of King George II, as Depp was a fan of Griffiths' work on Withnail and I. Sam Claflin, a recent drama school graduate with television experience, was chosen to play the missionary Philip, and British actor Paul Bazely also joined the cast. Spanish news website El Pais reported that the film had four Spanish actors: Cruz, Bergès-Frisbey, Óscar Jaenada, and Juan Carlos Vellido. Jaenada was picked for both his work in The Losers and a recommendation by Cruz.|$|E
