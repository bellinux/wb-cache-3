5|$|McKinley {{was born}} in 1843 in Niles, Ohio. After service as an Army officer in the Civil War, he became a lawyer and settled in Canton, Ohio. In 1876 {{he was elected to}} Congress, and he {{remained}} there most of the time until 1890, when he was defeated for re-election in a gerrymandered district. By this time he was considered a likely presidential candidate, especially after being elected governor in 1891 and 1893. McKinley had incautiously co-signed the loans of a friend, and demands for repayment were made on him when his friend went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893. <b>Personal</b> <b>insolvency</b> would have removed McKinley as a factor in the 1896 campaign, but he was rescued from this by businessmen who supported him, led by his friend and political manager, Mark Hanna. With that obstacle removed, Hanna built McKinley's campaign organization through 1895 and 1896. McKinley refused to deal with the eastern bosses such as Thomas Platt and Matthew Quay, and they tried to block his nomination by encouraging state favorite son candidates to run and prevent McKinley from getting a majority of delegate votes at the Republican National Convention, which might force him to make deals on political patronage. Their efforts were in vain, as the large, efficient McKinley organization swept him to a first ballot victory at the convention, with New Jersey's Garret Hobart as his running mate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} of <b>personal</b> <b>insolvencies</b> in Germany and the UK, focusing on the recent recession. These countries are particularly interesting as they are both member countries of the European Union, yet have completely different approaches to deal with overindebted individuals. In Germany unfortunate households who file on their debt are required to undergo a relatively long restructuring period until they eventually receive debt relief, whereas British debtors can choose proceeding out of many alternatives to manage their debt. Even under the official bankruptcy option, debt gets discharged relatively fast. In line with their different insolvency procedures, the two countries also represent two different financial systems: the German system is rather bank-based and the UK system rather market-based. The underlying financial systems already point to different patterns of lending across countries and hence, also to different structures of debt. Specifically, {{we are interested in}} {{the dynamics of}} petitions and actual insolvencies during the crisis as well as their reaction to exogeneous macroeconomic and financial conditions. The findings suggest that insolvencies are more persistent in the UK than in Germany, i. e. after an external shock it takes longer for insolvencies to return to their previous level in the UK. In both countries, the recent recession has no effect on petitions to default, but it has an effect on actual insolvencies in the UK suggesting that debtors rather opted for official procedures during the recession...|$|R

40|$|The Commission has {{released}} a Draft Report on Business Set-Up, Transfer and Closure for public consultation and input. It is pleasing {{to note that}} three chapters of the Draft Report address aspects of <b>personal</b> and corporate <b>insolvency.</b> Nevertheless, we continue to make the submission to national policy inquiries and discussions that a comprehensive review should be undertaken of the regulation of insolvency and restructuring in Australia. The last comprehensive review of the insolvency system was by the Australian Law Reform Commission (the Harmer Report) and was handed down in 1988. Whilst there have been aspects of our insolvency laws that have been reviewed since that time, none {{has been able to}} provide the clear and comprehensive analysis that is able to come from a more considered review. Such a review ought to be conducted by the Australian Law Reform Commission or similar independent panel set up for the task. We also suggest that {{there is a lack of}} data available to assist with addressing questions raised by the Draft Report. There is a need to invest in finding out, in a rigorous and informed way, how the current law operates. Until there is a willingness to make a public investment in such research with less reliance upon the anecdotal (often from well-meaning but ultimately inadequately informed participants and others) the government cannot be sure that the insolvency regime we have provides the most effective regime to underpin Australia’s commercial and financial dealings, nor that any change is justified.

Until recently however this did not extend to a consideration of the role of personal indebtedness in explaining the observed pattern of crime. This paper uses the Becker (1968) and Stigler (1970) framework, and extends to a fuller consideration of the relationship between economic hardship and theft crimes in an urban setting. The increase in personal debt in the past decade has been significant, which combined with the recent global recession, has led to a spike in <b>personal</b> <b>insolvencies.</b> In the context of the recent recession {{it is important to understand}} how increases in personal indebtedness may spillover into increases in social problems like crime. This paper uses data available at the neighbourhood level for London, UK on county court judgments (CCJ's) granted against residents in that neighbourhood, this is our measure of personal indebtedness, and examines the relationship between a range of community characteristics (economic, socio-economic, etc), including the number of CCJ's granted against residents, and the observed pattern of theft crimes for three successive years using spatial econometric methods. Our results confirm that theft crimes in London follow a spatial process, that personal indebtedness is positively associated with theft crimes in London, and that the covariates we have chosen are important in explaining the spatial variation in theft crimes. We identify a number of interesting results, for instance that there is variation in the impact of covariates across crime types, and that the covariates which are important in explaining the pattern of each crime type are largely stable across the three periods considered in this analysis...|$|R
40|$|This Productivity Commission report - Annual Review of Regulatory Burdens on Business: Business and Consumer Services Sector - {{identifies}} ways {{to reduce}} the regulatory burdens on businesses in the finance and insurance, accommodation and food services, professional, scientific and technical services, and arts and recreational services sectors. Notwithstanding some progress, there is still duplication and inconsistency in regulations between different jurisdictions of Australia's federation that are hard to justify. These include those regulations applying to migration lawyers, architects, and property laws. Removing or reducing such inconsistencies will reduce business costs and increase the scope for better, cheaper services for the community. Consultation processes remain a weak point when developing regulations. In many areas consultation lacks transparency, continuity and time frames are too short. The Commission identified several key areas where regulations can be made less burdensome for business while maintaining or improving services. These include harmonising <b>personal</b> and corporate <b>insolvency</b> laws, changes to regulations related to superannuation, changes to the treatment of foreign investors in commercial real estate and changes in the regulation of what should be included on restaurant menus. red tape; business and consumer regulations; service sector regulations; <b>personal</b> and corporate <b>insolvency</b> laws; superannuation; commercial real estate; restaurant menus; regulatory burdens; Regulation Impact Statement...|$|R

The approach they outlined has been utilised to consider the response of crime rates {{to a range of}} economic, criminal and socioeconomic factors. Until recently however this did not extend to a consideration of the role of personal indebtedness in explaining the observed pattern of crime. This paper builds on a recent publication in the literature (McIntyre & Lacombe 2012), and using the Becker (1968) and Stigler (1970) framework, extends to a fuller consideration of the relationship between personal indebtedness and theft crimes. We also extend the existing empirical literature by building on recent extensions of the Becker (1968) model to the case of non-expected utility. This extension provides an interesting and useful way of motivating the observed level of crime, which better reflects the reality of criminality. We adopt the cumulative prospect theory approach in motivating the personal indebtedness and theft crime relationship. There has been a large increase in personal debt in the past decade, which combined with the recent global recession, has led to a large increase in <b>personal</b> <b>insolvencies.</b> This paper uses data available at the neighbourhood level for London, UK on county court judgments (CCJ?s) granted against residents in that neighbourhood for the years 2003 to 2005. We use this as our measure of personal indebtedness, and examine the relationship between a range of community characteristics (economic, socioeconomic, etc), including the number of CCJ?s granted against residents, and the observed pattern of theft crimes using spatial econometric methods. Specifically, we estimate three common spatial econometric models, the spatial error model, the spatial autoregressive model and the spatial Durbin model using Bayesian methods, before calculating posterior model probabilities to select the best model. Our results demonstrate the importance of personal indebtedness in explaining the observed pattern of theft crimes, as well as reinforcing a number of key conclusions in the existing literature. Our results are broadly consistent across time, but vary by crime type as is expected. Our results highlight a number of interesting areas for future research which we will pursue...|$|R

The authorities have designed a strategy that strengthens incentives for marked-based debt resolution by improving the legal framework for credit enforcement, introducing tax incentives for debt write-downs, and strengthening financial sector supervision. These measures have started to yield results, but further steps are needed to speed up bankruptcy procedures and reduce credit enforcement costs.

40|$|A {{personal}} bankruptcy {{law that allows}} for a "fresh start" after bankruptcy reduces the individual risk involved in entrepreneurial activity. On the other hand, as risk shifts to creditors who recover less of their credit after a debtor's bankruptcy, lenders may charge higher interest rates or ration credit supply, which can hamper entrepreneurship. Both aspects of a more forgiving {{personal bankruptcy}} law are less relevant for wealthy potential entrepreneurs who still risk losing their wealth, but tend not to face higher interest rates because they provide collateral. This paper illustrates these effects in a model and tests the hypotheses derived by exploiting {{the introduction of a}} "fresh start" policy in Germany in 1999 as a natural experiment, based on representative household panel data. The results indicate that the insurance effect of a more forgiving personal bankruptcy law exceeds the interest effect and on balance encourages less wealthy individuals to enter into entrepreneurship. <b>personal</b> bankruptcy law, <b>insolvency,</b> entrepreneurship, fresh start...|$|R
