40|$|For some {{research}} projects, recruiting in <b>public</b> <b>places</b> is an invaluable addition to sampling strategies. It complements {{the more traditional}} recruitment strategies by providing researchers with 2 ̆ 7 opportunities to include people in the research who would otherwise be excluded.

Participants from these social groups often share similar experiences and ways of thinking about those experiences. The aim of recruiting in <b>public</b> <b>places</b> is to move beyond this 2 ̆ 7 in group 2 ̆ 7 to ensure a wider perspective.
