50|$|The {{parking pawl}} locks the {{transmission}}'s output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} parking pawl mechanism are the <b>parking</b> <b>gear,</b> parking pawl, actuator rod, cam collar, cam plate, pivot pin and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the <b>parking</b> <b>gear</b> teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are {{put in place to}} avoid this condition and engage the pawl only when the vehicle has come to a stand still.|$|E

This {{can also be}} considered as part of a shift by wire system whose objective is to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive modes without the traditional mechanical system which involves linkages between the gear shifter and the transmission. The main components of a park by wire system include the driver interface which could be a lever, switch or knob as designed by the OEM (input), an electronic control unit to host the control system and actuators (one or two motors) which are capable of driving the parking pawl {{into and out of the}} locking position with the <b>parking</b> <b>gear</b> of the transmission.|$|E

After further investigation it was determined that another Sansom Park firefighter had showed up on scene in their private vehicle and was using the gear of another firefighter who had become ill in the initial stages of the fire.

Establishing a leading research park and a new university in Huddinge, with special reference to Flemingsberg, is part of a broader vision of achieving a regional balance: stimulating economic growth and enabling southern Stockholm to catch up with the wealthier northern parts of the county. Since the establishment of the research park and university was initiated, several other government and private organizations have followed suit, establishing a presence in the area. In 1997, Stockholm Syd-Flemingsberg, southern Stockholm's major national- and regional-train hub was established in the area, giving excellent communications with central Stockholm.|$|R

50|$|A remote starter is a radio {{controlled}} device, {{which is}} {{installed in a}} vehicle by the factory or an aftermarket installer to preheat or cool the vehicle before the owner gets into it.

5000|$|Flight tests {{proceeded}} fairly smoothly until 4 May 1978, when HB1001 {{was making}} its 36th flight. The aircraft pitched {{up just as}} it made contact with the ground which forced the pilot, Bill Park, to abort the landing and make a second attempt. The impact had however been so hard that the landing gear had become jammed in a semi-retracted position. Efforts to lower the gear were unsuccessful and Bill Park was forced to climb again, and eject when his fuel ran out. The aircraft was destroyed on impact {{in the vicinity of}} the Groom Lake facility. Park survived, but suffered a concussion, forcing him to retire from further test flights. Dyson, who was in the chase plane, recounted: [...] "Just before touchdown the airplane pitched up... It seemed it slammed down on the ground real hard...

60|$|Aylmer Park and {{the great}} house of the Aylmers {{together}} formed an important, and, as regarded in some minds, an imposing country residence. The park was large, including some three or four hundred acres, and was peopled, rather thinly, by aristocratic deer. It was surrounded by an aristocratic paling, and was entered, at three different points, by aristocratic lodges. The sheep were more numerous than the deer, because Sir Anthony, though he had a large income, was not in very easy circumstances. The ground was quite flat; and though there were thin belts of trees, and some ornamental timber here and there, it was not well wooded. It had no special beauty of its own, and depended for its imposing qualities chiefly on its size, on its three sets of double lodges, and on its old-established character as an important family place in the county. The house was of stone, with a portico of Ionic columns which {{looked as though it}} hardly belonged of right to the edifice, and stretched itself out grandly, with two pretentious wings, which certainly gave it a just claim to be called a mansion. It required a great many servants to keep it in order, and the numerous servants required an experienced duenna, almost as grand in appearance as Lady Aylmer herself, to keep them in order. There was an open carriage and a close carriage, and a butler, and two footmen, and three gamekeepers, and four gardeners, and there was a coachman, and there were grooms, and sundry inferior men and boys about the place to do the work which the gardeners and gamekeepers and grooms did not choose to do themselves. And they all became fat, and lazy, and stupid, and respectable together; so that, as the reader will at once perceive, Aylmer Park was kept up in the proper English style. Sir Anthony very often discussed with his steward the propriety of lessening the expenditure of his residence, and Lady Aylmer always attended and probably directed these discussions; but it was found that nothing could be done. Any attempt to remove a gamekeeper or a gardener would evidently throw the whole machinery of Aylmer <b>Park</b> out of <b>gear.</b> If retrenchment was necessary Aylmer Park must be abandoned, and the glory of the Aylmers must be allowed to pale. But things were not so bad as that with Sir Anthony. The gardeners, grooms, and gamekeepers were maintained; ten domestic servants sat down to four heavy meals in the servants' hall every day, and Lady Aylmer contented herself with receiving little or no company, and with stingy breakfasts and bad dinners for herself and her husband and daughter. By all this it must be seen that she did her duty as the wife of an English country gentleman, and properly maintained his rank as a baronet.|$|R
