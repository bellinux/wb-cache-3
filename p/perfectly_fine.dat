Cubillos and Pablo Tedeschi, and recorded at Aga Studios in Bogotá, when Shakira was 13. A Sony Music Columbia representative said that the recording process was simple and went <b>perfectly</b> <b>fine.</b> But for Shakira, the process was problematic, as she had no ability to decide which tracks would be included and no input into the rhythmic structure or artistic production of the songs.|$|E

40|$|A {{concurrent}} {{object is}} {{an object that}} can be concurrently accessed by several processes. Two well known consistency criteria for such objects are atomic consistency (also called linearizability) and sequential consistency. Both criteria require that all the operations on the concurrent objects can be totally ordered {{in such a way}} that each read operation obtains the last value written into the corresponding object. They differ in the meaning of the word "last" that refers to physical time for atomic consistency, and to logical time for sequential consistency. This paper investigates the merging of these consistency criteria in a multiprocess program. The proposed combination offers two read operations to the processes, namely, an atomic read operation and a sequentially consistent read operation. While the first provides a process with the last "physical" value of an object, the second provides it with a value that is approximate with respect to real-time but whose semantics is <b>perfectly</b> well de- <b>fined.</b> A protocol that implements the combination on top of an asynchronous distributed system is described. The protocol provides a better understanding of the similarities and differences between these consistency criteria. Moreover, the protocol is generic in the sense that it can be tailored to provide only one of these consistency criteria...|$|R
6000|$|Assuredly Zenobia {{could not}} have {{intended}} it,--the fault must have been entirely in my imagination. But these last words, together with something in her manner, irresistibly brought up a picture of that <b>fine,</b> <b>perfectly</b> developed figure, in Eve's earliest garment. Her free, careless, generous modes of expression often had this effect of creating images which, though pure, are hardly felt to be quite decorous when born of a thought that passes between man and woman. I imputed it, at that time, to Zenobia's noble courage, conscious of no harm, and scorning the petty restraints which take the life and color out of other women's conversation. There was another peculiarity about her. We seldom meet with women nowadays, and in this country, who impress us as being women at all,--their sex fades away and goes for nothing, in ordinary intercourse. Not so with Zenobia. One felt an influence breathing out of her such as we might suppose to come from Eve, {{when she was just}} made, and her Creator brought her to Adam, saying, [...] "Behold! here is a woman!" [...] Not that I would convey the idea of especial gentleness, grace, modesty, and shyness, but of a certain warm and rich characteristic, which seems, for the most part, to have been refined away out of the feminine system.|$|R
500|$|The {{romantic comedy}} America's Sweethearts was Zeta-Jones' sole film project of 2001.

The critic Roger Ebert compared the film unfavourably to the musical Singin' in the Rain (1952), but thought that Zeta-Jones was aptly [...] "chilly and manipulative" [...] in her part. The following year, Zeta-Jones starred alongside Renée Zellweger as the murderous nightclub singer Velma Kelly in Chicago (2002), a film {{adaptation of the}} Broadway musical {{of the same name}} from the director Rob Marshall. She based her character's look and mannerisms on the actress Louise Brooks, and as the script did not provide a backstory to Kelly, she worked to convey her character's [...] "flamboyance" [...] and [...] "desperation" [...] through [...] "little looks and nuances". The film and her performance received critical acclaim. William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer felt that the actress made [...] "a wonderfully statuesque and bitchy saloon goddess", and David Edelstein of Slate magazine wrote that she has [...] "a smoldering confidence that takes your mind off her not-always-fluid dancingalthough she's a <b>perfectly</b> <b>fine</b> hoofer, with majestic limbs and a commanding cleavage" [...] and particularly praised her rendition of the song [...] "All That Jazz".

60|$|BY H.

The want of variety in the scenery from Hospenthal made the KAHKAHPONEEKA wearisome; but let none be discouraged; no one can fail to be {{completely}} R'ECOMPENS'EE for his fatigue, when he sees, for the first time, the monarch of the Oberland, the tremendous Finsteraarhorn. A moment before all was dullness, but a PAS further has placed us on {{the summit of the}} Furka; and exactly in front of us, at a HOPOW of only fifteen miles, this magnificent mountain lifts its snow-wreathed precipices into the deep blue sky. The inferior mountains {{on each side of the}} pass form a sort of frame for the picture of their dread lord, and close in the view so completely that no other prominent feature in the Oberland is visible from this BONG-A-BONG; nothing withdraws the attention from the solitary grandeur of the Finsteraarhorn and the dependent spurs which form the abutments of the central peak.|$|E
60|$|Lord Ashleigh, who {{had stepped}} through some French {{windows at the}} farther end of the terrace, paused {{for a few minutes}} to look around him. There was {{certainly}} some excuse for his momentary absorption. The morning, although it was late September, was <b>perfectly</b> <b>fine</b> and warm. The cattle in the park which surrounded the house were already gathered under the trees. In the far distance, the stubble fields stretched like patches of gold to ridges of pine-topped hills, and beyond to the distant sea. The breakfast table at which his wife and daughter were seated was arranged on the broad grey stone terrace, and, as he slowly approached, it seemed like an oasis of flowers and fruit and silver. A footman stood discreetly in the background. Half a dozen dogs of various breeds came trotting forward to meet him. His wife, still beautiful notwithstanding her forty-five years, had turned her pleasant face towards him, and Ella, whom a great many Society papers had singled out as being {{one of the most beautiful}} débutantes of the season, was welcoming him with her usual lazy but wholly good-humoured smile.|$|E
60|$|These {{phenomena}} {{are only}} the sequel {{of a series of}} still more strange and sad conditions of the air, which have continued among the Savoy Alps for the last eight days, (themselves the sequel of others yet more general, prolonged, and harmful). But the weather was <b>perfectly</b> <b>fine</b> at Dijon, and I doubt not at Chamouni, on the 1st of this month. On the 2d, in the evening, I saw, from the Jura, heavy thunderclouds in the west; on the 3d, the weather broke at Morez, in hot thunder-showers, with intervals of scorching sun; on the 4th, 5th, and 6th there was nearly continuous rain at St. Cergues, the Alps being totally invisible all the time. The sky cleared {{on the night of the}} 6th, and on the 7th I saw from the top of the Dole all the western plateaux of Jura quite clearly; but the entire range of the Alps, from the Moleson to the Salève, and all beyond,--snow, crag and hill-side,--were wrapped and buried in one unbroken gray-brown winding-sheet, of such cloud as I had never seen till that day touch an Alpine summit.|$|E
60|$|Dearest Sis,--You {{received}} a letter written last thing on Wednesday, 18th. We started next day with <b>perfectly</b> <b>fine</b> mild weather and every sort of comfort, and got to our first night's stage, Poggio Bagnoli, with great ease; with the same advantages next day, we passed Arezzo and reached Camuscia, and on Saturday slept at Perugia, having found the journey delightful. Sunday was rainy, but just as mild, so Ba did not suffer at all; we slept at Spoleto. Rain again on Monday. We reached Terni {{early in the day}} in order to go to the Falls, but the thing was impossible for Ba. Eckley, his mother-in-law, and I went, however, getting drenched, but they were fine, the rain and melted snow having increased the waters extraordinarily. On Tuesday we had fine weather again to Cività Castellana; there we found that on the previous day, while we were staying at Terni, a carriage was stopped and robbed in the road we otherwise should have pursued. They said such a thing had not happened for years. On Wednesday afternoon, four o'clock, we reached Rome, with beautiful weather; so it had been for some four out of our seven days. Ba bore the journey irregularly well; of course she has thus had a week of open air, beside the change, which always benefits her. We always had the windows of the carriage open. We passed Wednesday night at an hotel in order to profit by any information friends might be able to furnish, but we ended by returning to the rooms here we occupied before, of which we knew the virtues--a blaze of sun on the front rooms--and absolute healthiness. Rents are enormous; we pay only ten dollars a month more than before, in consideration of the desire the old landlady had to get us again. To anybody else the price would have been 20 more--60 in all--for which we are to pay 40. The Eckleys took good rooms and pay 1,000 (£210 or 15) for six months! One can't do that. The best is that they have thoroughly cleaned and painted the place, and everything is very satisfactorily arranged. We take the apartment for four months, meaning to be at liberty to go to Naples if we like. We have no fire this morning while I write, but it is before breakfast and Ba may like the sight of one, tho' I rather think she will not. Rome looks very well, and I hope we shall have a happier time of it than before. Many friends are here and everybody is very kind. The Eckleys were extravagantly good to us, something beyond conception almost. We have seen Miss Cushman, Hatty,[60] Leighton, Cartwright, the Storys, Page and his new (third) wife, Gibson, beside the Brackens and Mrs. Mackenzie; and there are others I shall see to-day. Ferdinando was sent on by sea with the luggage, and met us at the gate. It has been an expensive business altogether, but I think we shall not regret it. I daresay you have mild weather at Paris also. These premature beginnings of cold break down and leave {{the rest of the year}} the warmer, if not the better for them. Dearest Sis, write and tell me all the news of your two selves. Do you hear anything about Reuben's leaving London? Anything of Lady Elgin? How is Madame Milsand? I will send you the last 'Ath.' I have received, but break off here rather abruptly, in order to let Ba write. Good-bye. God bless you both. Kindest love to Milsand.|$|E
