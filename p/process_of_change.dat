The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to test the application of the Transtheoretical Model <b>of</b> <b>Change</b> (TTM) in relation to exercise behaviour of 298 Hong Kong Chinese undergraduates. Design and methods. A cross-sectional design was used. Respondents completed measures <b>of</b> stages <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> self-efficacy, <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> decisional balance, exercise and demographic data. Results. Significant effects for stage <b>of</b> <b>change</b> were found for self-efficacy, pros, exercise and nine <b>of</b> the 10 <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> In general, scores on these variables were found to increase across the stages although post hoc tests revealed slightly different patterns of significant differences.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the role of disengagement beliefs in smoking cessation. The association of disengagement beliefs with forward transition through the transtheoretical stages <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and self-reported quitting were examined, with and without adjusting for <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> Methods: A longitudinal survey was conducted among Dutch smokers, resulting in 367  respondents who completed two questionnaires, one at baseline and one at 8  months follow-up. Disengagement beliefs, intention to quit, actual quitting, and the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> were assessed. Results: The findings showed that disengagement beliefs were negatively associated with forward stage transition and actual quitting. <b>Processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> only partly mediated these associations. Conclusions: Adhering to disengagement beliefs seems to be an inhibitor of progression towards smoking cessation and actual quitting, also after adjustment for <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change...</b>|$|R

In the search for mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> it is important to clarify how growth in self-efficacy and use <b>of</b> the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> are related to each other, and how shifts in these client variables relate to changes in their drinking during treatment. This study used latent growth modeling (LGM) to examine self-efficacy as a potential mechanism for changing drinking behavior using Client Session Report data collected on clients in the Outpatient arm receiving either Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Twelve Step Facilitation Therapy (TSF) during Project MATCH. Results indicated that changes in drinking, self-efficacy, and use of behavior, experiential, and helping relationships <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> were nonlinear and that generally there was significant variability in growth trajectories during treatment. Modeling pairs <b>of</b> growth <b>processes</b> revealed that initial levels of Percent Days Drinking (PDD) and self-efficacy at the beginning of treatment predicted growth trajectories in the other; initial levels of PDD predicted trajectories of use <b>of</b> behavioral <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> change; initial levels of self-efficacy predicted trajectories of use <b>of</b> behavioral <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> while initial levels of use <b>of</b> behavioral <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> predicted trajectories <b>of</b> self-efficacy; and initial levels of self-efficacy at the beginning of treatment was predictive of trajectories of use <b>of</b> helping relationships <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> during treatment.

25|$|During the 15th century, Sutton Coldfield {{underwent}} a <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> {{due in part}} to the turbulent ongoings with the Earls of Warwick and their possession of the manor house. In 1397, Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, was punished by King Richard II for being a member of the Lords Appellant. All his possessions were confiscated, including the land at Sutton which was transferred to Thomas Holland, 3rd Earl of Kent. Upon King Richard II's death in 1400, Thomas de Beauchamp was returned his possessions although he died the following year. In 1446, Henry de Beauchamp, 14th Earl of Warwick died and the earldom was passed to his two-year-old daughter Anne, however King Henry VI collected the profits of the land whilst Anne was in her infancy. Anne died in 1448, and the estate and earldom passed to her aunt Anne Neville, although this was contested by her three older half-sisters. In his Itinerary, John Leland mentions that Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick and his wife Anne Neville, are believed to have built a new manor of timber-frame construction, with a lease given by King Henry VI in 1460 to Edward Mountfort suggesting that the manor was then occupied by the Mountfort family.|$|E
25|$|Frequently, {{acquisition}} {{planning is}} {{integrated into a}} larger language planning {{process in which the}} statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities. This <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a bilingual language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language’s script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language’s status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote language revitalization, which can change a language’s status or reverse a language shift, or to promote linguistic purism. In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain effective language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Identity {{development}} is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are, adolescents are liklely to cycle {{through a number of}} identities to find one that suits them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood. Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also {{plays an important role in}} their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.|$|E
