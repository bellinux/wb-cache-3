2500|$|Ward and Brownlee ask [...] "whether oxygenation, {{and hence}} the rise of animals, would ever have {{occurred}} on a world {{where there were no}} continents to erode". Extraterrestrial free oxygen has recently been detected around other solid objects, including Mercury, Venus, Mars Jupiter's four Galilean moons, Saturn's moons Enceladus, Dione and Rhea and even the atmosphere of a comet. This has led scientists to speculate whether processes other than photosynthesis could be capable of generating an environment rich in free oxygen. Wordsworth (2014) concludes that oxygen generated other than through photodissociation may be likely on Earth-like exoplanets, and could actually lead to false positive detections of life. Narita (2015) suggests <b>photocatalysis</b> by titanium dioxide as a geochemical mechanism for producing oxygen atmospheres.|$|E

Some well-known examples of cooperative catalysis involving two metal ions in biological systems include: the diiron sites in methane monooxygenase, dicopper in cytochrome c oxidase, and tricopper oxidases which have analogy with polynuclear clusters {{found in the}} 0D coordination polymers, such as binuclear Cu2 paddlewheel units found in MOP-1(CO2)4 Paddle-Wheel Building Blocks |year=2001 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=123 |page=4368 |doi=10.1021/ja0104352 |last1=Eddaoudi |first1=M. |last2=Kim |first2=Jaheon |last3=Wachter |first3=J.

In enzymatic systems, protein units show [...] "molecular recognition", high affinity for specific substrates. It seems that molecular recognition effects are limited in zeolites by the rigid zeolite structure. In contrast, dynamic features and guest-shape response make MOFs more similar to enzymes. Indeed, many hybrid frameworks contain organic parts that can rotate {{as a result of}} stimuli, such as light and heat. The porous channels in MOF structures can be used as <b>photocatalysis</b> sites. In <b>photocatalysis,</b> the use of mononuclear complexes is usually limited either because they only undergo single- electron process or from the need for high-energy irradiation. In this case, binuclear systems have a number of attractive features for the development of photocatalysts. For 0D MOF structures, polycationic nodes can act as semiconductor quantum dots which can be activated upon photostimuli with the linkers serving as photon antennae. Theoretical calculations show that MOFs are semiconductors or insulators with band gaps between 1.0 and 5.5 eV which can be altered by changing the degree of conjugation in the ligands. Experimental results show that the band gap of IRMOF-type samples can be tuned by varying the functionality of the linker.|$|E

Rep. 6, 24770; [...] (2016) states that [...] "a novel transparent, immobilised and superhydrophilic coating of titanium dioxide, co-doped with fluorine and copper has been prepared on float glass substrates. Antibacterial activity has demonstrated (by using Staphylococcus aureus), {{resulting from a}} combination of visible light activated (VLA) <b>photocatalysis</b> and copper ion toxicity. Co-doping with copper and fluorine has been shown to improve the performance of the coating, relative to a purely fluorine-doped VLA photocatalyst. Reductions in bacterial population of log10 = 4.2 under visible light irradiation and log10 = 1.8 in darkness have been achieved, compared with log10 = 1.8 under visible light irradiation and no activity, for a purely fluorine-doped titania. Generation of reactive oxygen species from the photocatalytic coatings is the major factor that significantly reduces the bacterial growth on the glass surfaces."

50|$|Pilkington has {{developed}} a self-cleaning coated float glass product, called Pilkington Activ. This self-cleaning glass has a coating which uses a method of <b>photocatalysis</b> to break down organic dirt with sunlight.

50|$|In 2001, Pilkington Glass {{announced}} {{the development of}} the first self-cleaning windows, Pilkington Activ™, and in the following months several other major glass companies released similar products. As a result, glazing is perhaps the largest commercial application of self-cleaning coatings to date. All of these windows are coated with a thin transparent layer of titanium dioxide. This coating acts to clean the window in two stages, using two distinct properties: <b>photocatalysis</b> and hydrophilicity. In sunlight, <b>photocatalysis</b> causes the coating to chemically break down organic dirt adsorbed onto the window. When the glass is wet by rain or other water, hydrophilicity reduces contact angles to very low values, causing the water to form a thin layer rather than droplets, and this layer washes dirt away.|$|E
50|$|The {{process by}} which a photon initiates a {{chemical}} reaction directly is known as photolysis; if this process is aided by a catalyst, it is called <b>photocatalysis.</b> If a photon has more energy than a material's characteristic band gap, it can free an electron upon absorption by the material. The remaining, positively charged hole and the free electron may recombine, generating heat, or they can take part in photoreactions with nearby species. If the photoreactions with these species result in regeneration of the electron-donating material—i.e., if the material acts {{as a catalyst for}} the reactions—then the reactions are deemed photocatalytic. PECO represents a type of <b>photocatalysis</b> whereby semiconductor-based electrochemistry catalyzes an oxidation reaction—for example, the oxidative degradation of an airborne contaminant in air purification systems.|$|E

5000|$|Quantum dots also {{function}} as photocatalysts {{for the light}} driven chemical conversion of water into hydrogen as a pathway to solar fuel. In <b>photocatalysis,</b> electron hole pairs formed in the dot under band gap excitation drive redox reactions in the surrounding liquid. Generally, the photocatalytic activity of the dots {{is related to the}} particle size and its degree of quantum confinement. [...] This is because the band gap determines the chemical energy that is stored in the dot in the excited state. An obstacle for the use of quantum dots in <b>photocatalysis</b> is the presence of surfactants {{on the surface of the}} dots. These surfactants (or ligands) interfere with the chemical reactivity of the dots by slowing down mass transfer and electron transfer processes. Also, quantum dots made of metal chalcogenides are chemically unstable under oxidizing conditions and undergo photo corrosion reactions.|$|E
50|$|In <b>photocatalysis</b> the {{electron-hole pair}} is {{immediately}} {{used to drive}} a redox reaction {{but the problem is}} that the electron-hole pair suffer from fast recombinations.
