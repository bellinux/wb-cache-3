40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a holographic approach for the fabrication of large-area photonic crystal (PhC) microstructures by applying a single top-cut hexagonal prism (TCHP). The interference {{patterns of the}} beams from the TCHP are calculated. Various two-dimensional PhC structures are fabricated in <b>photo-resist</b> <b>films.</b> They include symmetrical hexagonal structures, the honey-comb structure and the hexagonal structure with skewed elliptical rods. The first structures come from six-beam and symmetrical three-beam interfering. The second structure appears when the beam is incident on the TCHP obliquely. The third structure is obtained when adjacent three beams or four beams are interfered. The period can be decreased to 285 nm. SPM observations of the PhCs {{provide the basis for}} measurement of their structural parameters. A good agreement is obtained for the measured structural parameters and calculated results for the PhCs. The photonic band gaps of the hexagonal symmetrical and honeycomb structures are derived by using the plane wave method. These results reveal that, by varying the number of split beams and the incident angle, using the single TCHP PhCs, different band gaps can be achieved. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been an onset of fluidic filters {{fabricated}} using micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology. These filters, compared to conventional ones, are more accurate and precise due to the highly sophisticated techniques that are used to define and implement the separation mechanism. In order to contribute to this new field of research, a project on micro- and nanoparticle filtration was started in the MEMS group of Delft Institute of Microsystems and Nanoelectronics. This project had grown to produce two MEMS filter designs prior to the beginning of this graduation thesis. This thesis study seeks to identify and analyze reoccurring issues in the two MEMS filter designs and from those results, realize a new design that is superior in the aspects of performance, robustness and durability. The first MEMS filter design proves {{that it is possible to}} create vertical membrane filtration devices using MEMS technology and seal these with dry <b>film</b> <b>photo-resist.</b> However, the first design suffers from a high flow resistance that cannot be dealt with effectively, without relying on a more area efficient design. The second MEMS filter design is meant to outperform the first design in the aspect of flow resistance. The second design is a promising concept, but does not reach its full potential. Critical issues from a number of sources degrade and limit its performance to such a degree that it is close to dysfunctional. A redesign is necessary to fully exploit the advantageous aspects of the second design. A third MEMS filter design was developed based on the knowledge and experience gained from the preceding designs. This third design aims to incorporate the advantages of both the first and second designs while avoiding their disadvantages. Although the third design does address and solve the problems encountered in preceding designs, the development of this design resulted in new issues that are yet to be addressed. However, despite the addition of new issues, fully functional devices for fluidic experiments could still be fabricated. A series of fluidic experiments were performed to verify the functionality and performance of the fabricated designs. The basic filter function was hereby confirmed for all devices. Moreover, pressure and flow rate experiments were carried out to quantify the performance parameters of the filter devices. From these results, devices from the third design were found to have the best pressure and flow rate performance. A qualitative comparison was made between the three different filter designs. This comparison considers both the structural aspects of the designs and the data gained from the fluidic experiments. Based on the comparison, the conclusion is made that the problem initially defined for this thesis has been properly addresses by the third design. Although further optimization is still possible, the third design has proven to be the best amongst the three MEMS filter designs.

40|$|Photopolymerization, {{which uses}} light rather than heat to {{initiate}} polymerization, is a facile technique used to fabricate adhesives, protective coatings, thin <b>films,</b> <b>photo-resists,</b> dental restoratives, and other materials. Epoxide monomers, which are polymerized via cationic photoinitiation, have received less attention in fundamental research {{in comparison to}} free radical polymerized acrylate monomers. The characterization of propagation mechanisms, network structures, and physical properties is yet lacking. This project focused on the reactivity and physical properties of 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexylmethyl- 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexane carboxylate (EEC), and the kinetic and physical effects of chain transfer agents (CTAs) in EEC based formulations were characterized. This characterization was carried out using real-time Raman spectroscopy, real-time infrared spectroscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, simple gel fraction measurements, and atomic force microscopy. The effects of water, organic alcohols, processing conditions (e. g., UV light intensity, humidity, post-illumination curing temperature), and photoinitiation systems were investigated. In general, increasing the concentration of CTAs in a crosslinking epoxide resin increases the rate of polymerization and the overall epoxide conversion level. High CTA levels also correspond to lower glass transition temperatures (Tg) and lower crosslink densities. A post-illumination annealing was critical in obtaining stable physical properties for high Tg epoxide materials. In addition, humidity (water being the most universal contaminant type of CTA) was found to impact the surface properties of an epoxide polymer negatively by reducing the surface hardness. Hybrid acrylate-epoxide systems are much more complex and unpredictable in curing behavior. The use of hydroxy acrylates in hybrid systems allows for grafting between the epoxide and the acrylate domains, via the AM mechanism. Another intricacy of hybrid systems is the initiation system. In order to maximize the conversion of both the epoxide and the acrylate moieties, the free-radical photoinitiator must not hinder the polymerization of the epoxide monomer. Some very efficient free-radical photoinitiators limit the epoxide polymerization by absorbing {{the majority of the}} deep-UV incident photons. Finally, a renewable acrylate oligomer was synthesized to provide a green alternative to petroleum-based oligomers currently used. The oligomer was freely miscible and readily photopolymerized {{with a wide range of}} commercial monomers. The Tg relationship between the commercial monomers and the parent resin followed the Fox equation. The results of this research provide strategies for controlling epoxide kinetics and physical properties in neat and hybrid systems. This information is useful for tailoring resin formulations to specific end-use applications, especially in films, coatings, and adhesives. Hybrid epoxide-acrylate photopolymerization affords the unique opportunity to structure polymer networks in time and to engineer advanced material properties. These hybrid systems are based on formulations that contain both an epoxide moiety, which undergoes cationic ring-opening photopolymerization, and an acrylate moiety, which undergoes free-radical photopolymerization. Through the combination of these two independent reactive systems, hybrid polymers exhibit lower sensitivity to oxygen and moisture and offer advantages such as increased cure speed and improved film-forming properties. The ability to design the polymer network architecture and to tune mechanical properties can be realized through control of the cationic active center propagation reaction relative to the cationic chain transfer reaction. Specifically, grafted polymer networks can be developed through the covalent bonding of the epoxide chains to the acrylate chains via hydroxyl substituents. This work demonstrates the formation of these grafted polymer networks and overviews the physical properties obtained through control of hydroxyl content and hybrid formulation composition...|$|R
