25|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to local anesthetics (especially the esters) are not uncommon, but true allergy is very rare. Allergic {{reactions to}} the esters is usually due to a sensitivity to their metabolite, <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and does not result in cross-allergy to amides. Therefore, amides {{can be used as}} alternatives in those patients. Nonallergic reactions may resemble allergy in their manifestations. In some cases, skin tests and provocative challenge may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of allergy. Also cases of allergy to paraben derivatives occur, which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions.|$|E

5000|$|Dihydropteroate synthase (...) (DHPS) catalyses the {{condensation}} of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine pyrophosphate to <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> to form 7,8-dihydropteroate. This is {{the second}} step in the three-step pathway leading from 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin to 7,8-dihydrofolate. DHPS is the target of sulfonamides, which are substrate analogues that compete with <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Bacterial DHPS (gene sul or folP) is a protein of about 275 to 315 amino acid residues that is either chromosomally encoded or found on various antibiotic resistance plasmids. In the lower eukaryote Pneumocystis carinii, DHPS is the C-terminal domain of a multifunctional folate synthesis enzyme (gene fas).|$|E
5000|$|Sulfonamides (e.g. sulfadiazine) inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase, {{an enzyme}} that participates in folic acid {{synthesis}} from <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Hence, sulfonamides work synergistically with pyrimethamine by blocking a different enzyme needed for folic acid synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|Aminodeoxychorsimate synthase (PabB), a 51 kDa {{protein in}} E. coli, is encoded by the gene pabB. [...] 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate, {{the product of}} PabB, can be {{converted}} to <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> by the enzyme 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase (PabC).|$|E
50|$|Ingested {{medications}} {{may cause}} systemic photosensitivity and topically applied medications, cosmetics and essential oils {{may lead to}} local (or perhaps systemic) photosensitivity. Curiously and ironically, <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA) found in some sunscreens can also cause photosensitivity.|$|E
5000|$|Alteration of {{metabolic}} pathway: e.g., some sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do {{not require}} <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of folic acid and nucleic acids in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides. Instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to utilizing preformed folic acid.|$|E
50|$|Amino esters, in {{reference}} to anesthetic agents, are rapidly metabolized in the plasma by butyrlcholinesterase to <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives, then excreted in the urine. This suggests their very short half lives. Allergy {{is more likely to}} occur with ester-type agents, as opposed to amide-type.|$|E
50|$|To prevent AC from developing, {{protective}} measures could be undertaken such as avoiding mid-day sun, {{or use of}} a broad-brimmed hat, lip balm with anti UVA and UVB ingredients (e.g. <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid),</b> or sun blocking agents (e.g. zinc oxide, titanium oxide) prior to sun exposure.|$|E
5000|$|Vitamin B10: <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (pABA or PABA), a {{chemical}} {{component of the}} folate molecule produced by plants and bacteria, and found in many foods. It {{is best known as}} a UV-blocking sunscreen applied to the skin, and is sometimes taken orally for certain medical conditions.|$|E
50|$|It {{is part of}} {{a pathway}} for the {{biosynthesis}} of <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA); a precursor for the production of folates. Folates are family of cofactors that are essential for living organisms. Folate cofactors are used in several one-carbon transfer reactions required during the synthesis of essential metabolites, including methionine and thymidylate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA) is a {{metabolite}} of the ester {{class of}} local anesthetics, which includes benzonatate, {{as well as}} procaine and tetracaine. Severe allergic reactions {{have been reported in}} patients who are allergic to PABA. Severe sensitivity reactions to benzonatate have resulted in respiratory side effects such as bronchospasm, laryngospasm and cardiac arrest.|$|E
50|$|Aminohippuric acid or para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), a {{derivative}} of hippuric acid, is a diagnostic agent useful in medical tests involving the kidney {{used in the}} measurement of renal plasma flow. It is an amide derivative of the amino acid glycine and <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> that is not naturally found in humans; {{it needs to be}} IV infused before use diagnostically.|$|E
50|$|As a sulfonamide antibiotic, {{sulfanilamide}} functions by competitively inhibiting (i.e., {{by acting}} as a substrate analogue) enzymatic reactions involving <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA). PABA is needed in enzymatic reactions that produce folic acid, which acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. Mammals do not synthesize their own folic acid so are unaffected by PABA inhibitors, which selectively kill bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Aminobenzoic acid (also {{known as}} <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> or PABA {{because the number}} 4 carbon in the benzene ring {{is also known as}} the para position) is an organic {{compound}} with the formula H2NC6H4CO2H. PABA is a white solid, although commercial samples can appear gray. It is slightly soluble in water. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with amino and a carboxyl groups. The compound occurs naturally.|$|E
50|$|Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Sulfonamides are {{synthetic}} bacteriostatic antibiotics, {{that are}} active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It blocks {{the synthesis of}} dihydrofolic acid by inhibiting the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. It is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA). PABA is required for bacterial synthesis of folic acid {{and it is an}} essential component for bacterial growth. The multiplication of bacteria is therefore inhibited by the action of sulfacetamide.|$|E
5000|$|Phthalylsulfathiazole {{belongs to}} the group of drugs called sulfonamides. The drug is a broad {{spectrum}} antimicrobial that can treat different types of infections including intestinal. The mechanism of action depends if based on competitive antagonism with <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and inhibition of dihydropteroate synthetase activity, that in turn leads to impaired synthesis of dihydrofolic acid and as a result its active metabolite that is necessary for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine.|$|E
50|$|Chloramine-T is as an algicide, bactericide, virucide, {{fungicide}} (including spores), germicide. It is also {{effective against}} mycobacteria such as tuberculosis, foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza. The molecular structure of toluenesulfonylamide {{is similar to}} <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> an intermediate in bacterial metabolism, which is disrupted by this sulfonamide (in {{the same way as}} by a sulfa drug). Therefore, chloramine-T is capable of inhibiting with bacterial growth with two mechanisms, with the phenylsulfonamide moiety and the hypochlorite, which destroys the DNA structure via oxidation and thereby prevents microbes from reproducing and reforming.|$|E

50|$|Research {{shows that}} {{accumulation}} of acecainide during procainamide therapy can alter both procainamide elimination {{as well as}} its electrophysiologic actions. A few healthy people demonstrated that concomitantly administered trimethoprim decreased the renal clearance of procainamide and formed NAPA, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of both drugs and increases in QTc after procainamide. Trimethoprim, procainamide and acecainide are all excreted by active tubular secretion. Also amiodarone, cimetidine and trimethoprim increase the NAPA serum level. Cimetidine an ranitidine possible increases plasma procainamide and NAPA concentrations and subsequent toxicity. Furthermore, alcohol enhances acetylation of procainamide to NAPA and alcohol consumption may reduce half-life. It also has been shown that coadministration of <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> decreases the biotransformation of procainamide to acecainide in a patient with rapid acetylation kinetics.|$|E
50|$|Antimetabolites {{may also}} be antibiotics, such as {{sulfanilamide}} drugs, which inhibit dihydrofolate synthesis in bacteria by competing with <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA). PABA is needed in enzymatic reactions that produce folic acid, which acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, the building-blocks of DNA. Mammals do not synthesize their own folic acid so they are unaffected by PABA inhibitors, which selectively kill bacteria. Sulfanilamide drugs are not like the antibiotics used to treat infections. Instead, they work by changing the DNA inside cancer cells {{to keep them from}} growing and multiplying. Antitumor antibiotics are a class of antimetabolite drugs that are cell cycle nonspecific. They act by binding with DNA molecules and preventing RNA (ribonucleic acid) synthesis, a key step in the creation of proteins, which are necessary for cancer cell survival.|$|E
50|$|Sulfamethoxazole, a sulfanilamide, is a {{structural}} analog of <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA). They compete with PABA to bind to dihydropteroate synthetase and inhibit conversion of PABA and dihydropteroate diphosphate to dihydrofolic acid, or dihydrofolate. Inhibiting {{the production of}} dihydrofolate intermediate interferes with the normal bacterial synthesis of folic acid (folate). Folate is an essential metabolite for bacterial growth and replication because it is used in DNA synthesis, primarily at thymidylate and purine biosynthesis, and amino acids synthesis, including serine, glycine and methionine. Hence, blockage of folate production inhibits the folate-dependent metabolic processes for bacterial growth. Since it inhibits bacterial growth, sulfamethoxazole is considered a bacteriostatic antibiotic.Sulfonamides are selective against bacteria because they interfere with the synthesis of folate, a process which does not occur in humans. Human do not synthesize folate, and must acquire it through diet.|$|E
5000|$|Moisturizers and emollients such as mineral oil, {{petroleum}} jelly, calcipotriol, and decubal (an oil-in-water emollient) {{were found}} to increase the clearance of psoriatic plaques. Emollients {{have been shown to}} be even more effective at clearing psoriatic plaques when combined with phototherapy. However, certain emollients have no impact on psoriasis plaque clearance or may even decrease the clearance achieved with phototherapy. The emollient salicylic acid is structurally similar to <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA), commonly found in sunscreen, and is known to interfere with phototherapy in psoriasis. Coconut oil, when used as an emollient in psoriasis, has been found to decrease plaque clearance with phototherapy. [...] Medicated creams and ointments applied directly to psoriatic plaques can help reduce inflammation, remove built-up scale, reduce skin turnover, and clear affected skin of plaques. Ointment and creams containing coal tar, dithranol, corticosteroids (i.e. desoximetasone), fluocinonide, vitamin D3 analogs (for example, calcipotriol), and retinoids are routinely used. The use of the finger tip unit may be helpful in guiding how much topical treatment to use.|$|E
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibits {{the action of}} sulfonamides on bacteria in vitro and in vivo. (Rubbo and Gillespie, 1940; Selbie, 1940; Woods, 1940). Wiedling (1941) found that <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> pro-duced an inhibition {{of the effect of}} sulfanilamide, sulfapyridine and sulfathiazole on the fresh water diatom Nitzschia palea var. debilis.

40|$|By {{injection}} into typhus-infected yolk sacs, {{a number}} of agents were tested for possible inhibition or acceleration of rickettsial growth. The previously reported rickettsiostatic activity of penicillin was further confirmed. <b>Para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> in single injections of 6. 6 mg. and 3. 3 mg. giving initial concentrations of approximately 1 : 6000 and 1 : 12, 000 {{was found to have}} rickettsiostatic activity approximately equal to that of penicillin. No conclusion could be drawn regarding the possibility of a synergistic action of <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and penicillin. <b>Para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> neutralized with sodium hydroxide was found to be as effective as the acid itself, when given in single injections of 6. 6 mg. Sodium benzoate, as Well as the ortho and meta forms of aminobenzoic acid were found to be ineffective when given in similar amounts. <b>Para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> when added to the food in a concentration of 3 per cent, was shown to have a remarkably effective chemotherapeutic action on murine typhus infection in mice. Sodium fluoride was found at times to accelerate the growth of rickettsiae in the yolk sac, and to cause heavy infection under conditions such that the controls showed practically no multiplication of the organism. When rickettsiostatic substances (penicillin and <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid)</b> were combined with sodium fluoride, their rickettsiostatic activity was not demonstrably changed.
