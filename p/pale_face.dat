500|$|By 1722, Sheppard {{was showing}} great promise as a carpenter. [...] Aged 20, {{he was a}} small man, only 5'4" [...] (1.63m) and lightly built, but deceptively strong. [...] He had a <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> with large, dark eyes, a wide mouth and a quick smile. [...] Despite a slight stutter, his wit made him popular in the taverns of Drury Lane. [...] He served five {{unblemished}} years of his apprenticeship but then began to be led into crime.|$|E
500|$|Herman Bang's {{novel was}} {{inspired}} by an incident in 1883 when he was passing through Skørping Station {{in the north of}} Jutland. He noticed a young woman at the window who, her <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> couched in her hands, stared after his departing train. In the introduction to Stille Eksistenser he explains: [...] "For the rest of the journey, I could see the woman's face between the flowers. Her look was not quite one of longing — longing would have perhaps fluttered to death by breaking its wings in such tight confines — just a quite resignation, a waning sorrow. And when the train had slid by, she would be peering out with the same look over Egnens Lyng — over the dreary plain." ...|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{had already}} {{established}} himself as a respected songwriter—other Melbourne musicians would go to see him on their nights off. Richard Guilliatt, writing for The Monthly, later described Kelly from a 1979 performance at Richmond's Kingston Hotel, the singer was [...] "a skinny guy with a head of black curls framing a <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> and a bent nose... singing with his eyes closed, one arm outstretched and the other resting on the body of the Fender Telecaster". Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots' gigs and they later married – the relationship is described in [...] "When I First Met Your Ma" [...] (1992). Brown's father supplied Kelly with a gravy recipe – used on [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] (1996). Their son, Declan, was born in 1980.|$|E
500|$|Virginia was {{described}} as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called [...] "pure white", causing a [...] "bad complexion that spoiled her looks". One visitor to the Poe family noted that [...] "the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright", possibly a symptom of her illness. Another visitor in Fordham wrote, [...] "Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. Her <b>pale</b> <b>face,</b> her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look." [...] That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human. William Gowans, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of [...] "matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any houri, and her face defy the genius of a Canova to imitate". She {{might have been a}} little plump. Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even {{in the last years of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|The {{barn owl}} is a medium-sized, pale-coloured owl with long wings and a short, squarish tail. There is {{considerable}} size variation across the subspecies with a typical specimen measuring about [...] in overall length, {{with a full}} range of [...] across the species. Barn owls have a typical wingspan of some , with {{a full range of}} [...] Adult body mass is also variable with male owls from the Galapagos (T. a. punctatissima) weighing approximately [...] on average while male eastern barn owls (T. javanica) average [...] The full known weight range for the barn owl species can range from [...] In general, owls living on small islands are smaller and lighter, perhaps because they have a higher dependence on insect prey and need to be more manoeuvrable. However, the largest bodied race of barn owl, T. a. furcata from Cuba and Jamaica, is also an island race, albeit being found on more sizeable islands with larger prey and few larger owls competing for dietary resources. The shape of the tail is a means of distinguishing the barn owl from typical owls when seen in the air. Other distinguishing features are the undulating flight pattern and the dangling, feathered legs. The <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> with its heart shape and black eyes give the flying bird a distinctive appearance, like a flat mask with oversized, oblique black eye-slits, the ridge of feathers above the beak somewhat resembling a nose.|$|E

2500|$|The goth {{subculture}} has associated tastes in music, aesthetics, and fashion. The {{music of}} the goth subculture encompasses {{a number of different}} styles, including gothic rock, industrial, deathrock, post-punk, darkwave, ethereal wave and neoclassical. Styles of dress within the subculture range from deathrock, punk and Victorian styles, or combinations of the above, most often with dark attire (often black), <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> makeup and black hair. The scene continues to draw interest from a large audience decades after its emergence. [...] In Western Europe, there are large annual festivals, mainly in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Humboldt Times {{newspaper}} editorialized, [...] "For {{the past}} four years we have advocated two—and only two—alternatives for ridding our country of Indians: either remove them to some reservation or kill them. The loss of life and destruction of property by the Indians for ten years past has not failed to convince every sensitive man that the two races cannot live together, and the recent desperate and bloody demonstrations on Indian Island and elsewhere is proof that the time has arrived that either the <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> or the savage must yield the ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{sketches}} of John on sheets held in Paris and Chicago {{are the only}} drawings by Pisanello that can be securely dated and provide firm evidence of his presence in Ferrara. The figure on the horse in the recto of the Paris leaf (Louvre MI 1062) is undoubtedly the emperor because of the Italian inscription above the figure, part of which reads: [...] "The hat of the Emperor should be white on top and red underneath, the profile black all around. The doublet of green damask, and the mantle of top crimson. A black beard on a <b>pale</b> <b>face,</b> hair and eye-brows alike." [...] Pisanello's references to colours on this sheet suggests that the artist intended to do a painting of the emperor.|$|E

2500|$|Settlers in Wise County, Virginia {{believed}} that the mine was located on or around Stone Mountain, and that local Indians knew {{the location of the}} mine. According to the settlers, an Indian chief named Benge once said that [...] "if the <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> knew what he knew they could shoe their horses cheaper with silver than with iron." [...] They maintain that a captured settler named Hans G. Frenchman was taken to the mine by the Indians. He marked its location, and later escaped his captors and revealed the location of the mine to Swift. In this version of the story, Swift and Frenchman took only enough silver to buy two horses, and on a return trip, were unable to locate the mine.|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien gives a {{brief but}} {{detailed}} description of Strider in The Fellowship of the Ring: lean, dark and tall, with shaggy dark hair [...] "flecked with grey", grey eyes, and a stern <b>pale</b> <b>face.</b> It is also stated {{that he was the}} tallest of the Company. Some time after the publication of the books, Tolkien wrote that he was at least 6ft 6 in (198cm) tall. Although he was 87 {{years old at the time}} of the War of the Ring, this was the prime of life for a Dunadan of royal blood, and Tolkien wrote that to those unaware of his lineage [...] "in character Aragorn was a hardened man of say 45". In [...] "The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen", found in the Appendices, he was described as often grim and sad, with unexpected moments of levity.|$|E

After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at her <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: Un dì, felice, eterea – [...] "One day, happy and ethereal"). At first, she rejects him because his love means nothing to her, but there is something about Alfredo that touches her heart. He is about to leave when she gives him a flower, telling him to return it when it has wilted, which will be the very next day.|$|E

2500|$|One such {{threat was}} {{delivered}} by fur trader James McDougall, who {{is quoted as}} saying to a gathering of local chiefs, [...] "You know the smallpox. Listen: I am the smallpox chief. In this bottle I have it confined. All I {{have to do is to}} pull the cork, send it forth among you, and you are dead men. But this is for my enemies and not my friends." [...] Likewise, another fur trader threatened Pawnee Indians that if they didn't agree to certain conditions, [...] "he would let the smallpox out of a bottle and destroy them." [...] The Reverend Isaac McCoy was quoted in his History of Baptist Indian Missions as saying that the white men had deliberately spread smallpox among the Indians of the southwest, including the Pawnee tribe, and the havoc it made was reported to General Clark and the Secretary of War. [...] Artist and writer George Catlin observed that Native Americans were also suspicious of vaccination, [...] "They see white men urging the operation so earnestly they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of the <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> by which they hope to gain some new advantage over them." [...] So great was the distrust of the settlers that the Mandan chief Four Bears denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as brothers, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people.|$|E
2500|$|Worse men {{had been}} less detested, but Danby had none of the amiable virtues which often {{counteract}} the odium incurred by serious faults. John Evelyn, who knew him intimately, described him as [...] "a man of excellent natural parts but nothing of generosity or gratefulness". The Earl of Shaftesbury, doubtless no friendly witness, spoke of him as an inveterate liar, [...] "proud, ambitious, revengeful, false, prodigal and covetous to the highest degree", and Burnet supported his unfavourable judgment. His corruption, his submission to a tyrannical wife, his greed, his <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> and lean person, which had replaced the handsome features and comeliness of earlier days, were the subject of ridicule, from the witty sneers of Halifax to the coarse jests of the anonymous writers of innumerable lampoons. By his championship of the national policy he raised up formidable foes abroad without securing a single friend or supporter at home, and his fidelity to the national interests was now, through an act of personal spite, to be the occasion of his downfall. Kenyon describes the Danby administration by the autumn of 1678 as [...] "weak, discredited, unpopular and unsuccessful"; it required only the Popish Plot to bring it down. Danby was accused of using the insane [...] "revelations" [...] of Israel Tonge for his own advantage; but as Kenyon notes, the King gave Danby an explicit order to investigate Tonge's claims, and whatever Danby's personal views, {{he had no choice}} but to comply.|$|E
