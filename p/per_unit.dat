5|$|Surface tension has the {{dimension}} of force <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> length, or of energy <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> area.

5|$|The {{classical}} formulae for {{the energy}} and momentum of electromagnetic radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events.

The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the plantar support in 72 normal-weight young voluntaries (46 women, 26 men), by a baropodometric platform. We considered subjects with claw foot (CFS) and subjects with normal foot (NFS). We {{found a significant}} reduction of total plantar support surface in the CFS (P < 0. 0001 for women, P < 0. 001 for men), due to {{the reduction of the}} forefoot and rear foot areas of both plantar imprints. Indeed, CFS of both sexes exhibited higher values of both plantar pressure and peak pressure, compared to the NFS. Moreover, the load <b>per</b> <b>units</b> of plantar surface increased in CFS compared to the NFS. In conclusion, the reduction of plantar support surfaces in CFS of both sexes was associated to a major load <b>per</b> <b>units</b> of plantar surface in the forefoot and rear foot areas, and this may be a risk factor to lower extremity overuse injuries...|$|R
