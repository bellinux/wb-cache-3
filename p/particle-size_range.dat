The relative importance of different inorganic ammonium compounds (chloride, nitrate and sulfate) in marine air chemistry was studied by single-particle characterization with the laser microprobe mass analyser. Standard aerosols were generated as a reference for compound identification, based on the fingerprint spectra obtained, and calculation of the relative sensitivity achieved for different ions in a marine aerosol matrix. The relative sensitivity for ammonium was low. Aerosol samples were collected in the Southern Bight of the North Sea under different meteorological conditions and examined for their ammonium compounds.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} for disposition using an electrometallurgical technique results in two high-level waste forms: a ceramic waste form (CWF) and a metal waste form (MWF). The CWF is a composite of sodalite and glass, which stabilizes the active fission products (alkali, alkaline earths, and rare earths) and transuranic (TRU) elements. Reactive metal fuel constituents, including all the TRU metals {{and the majority of}} the fission products remain in the salt as chlorides and are processed into the CWF. The solidified salt is containerized and transferred to the CWF process where it is ground in an argon atmosphere. Zeolite 4 A is dried in a mechanically-fluidized dryer to about 0. 1 wt% moisture and ground to a <b>particle-size</b> <b>range</b> of 45 µ to 250 µ. The salt and zeolite are mixed in a V-mixer and heated to 500 °C for about 18 hours. During this process, the salt occludes into the structure of the zeolite. The salt-loaded zeolite (SLZ) is cooled and then mixed with borosilicate glass frit with a comparable <b>particle-size</b> <b>range.</b> The SLZ/glass mixture is transferred to a crucible, which is placed in a furnace and heated to 925 °C.

A 2 % free electrolyte clay sus-pension showed pseudoplastic flow behavior and had a high apparent viscosity, attributed at low shear rates to the high volume fraction of the suspended clay platelets, the flexibility of the platelets, and the presence of edge-to-edge association. The breaking of edge-to-edge associations and the progressive orientation of the individual platelets in the direction of flow contribute to the reduction in viscosity with increasing shear rate. The compression of the diffuse double layer at a NaCI concentration of 10 mEq L-t contributes to the free movement of the individual platelets, even at low shear ates. The flow behavior changed from pseudoplastic to plastic at an NaCI concentration of 100 mEq L-L At this electrolyte concentration, face-to-face associations of specific junction points at certain areas of the planar surface are probably occurring. The apparent viscosity of the clay suspension for the two <b>particle-size</b> <b>ranges</b> (< 2 and < 0. 02 p~m) at all shear rates converged to a minimum value of 4. 5 mPa s at NaC 1 concentrations of 10 - 20 mEq L-L On both sides of the minimum, the lower the shear rate, the greater the slope.

To understand colloid formation during interactions between highly reactive fluids and sediments {{and its impact on}} contaminant transport, we simulated tank waste solution (TWS) leakage processes in laboratory columns at ambient and elevated (70 C) temperatures. We found that maximum formation of mobile colloids occurred at the plume fronts (hundreds to thousands times higher than within the plume bodies or during later leaching).

During infiltration of the leaked high Na{sup +} waste solution, rapid and completed Na{sup +} replacement of exchangeable Ca{sup 2 +} and Mg{sup 2 +} from the sediment caused accumulation of these divalent cations at the moving plume front. Precipitation of supersaturated Ca{sup 2 +}/Mg{sup 2 +}-bearing minerals caused dramatic pH reduction at the plume front. In turn, the reduced pH caused precipitation of other minerals.

The soils {{are referred to as}} bimodal soil, with an associated bimodal zone in the soil textural triangle. It was shown that processes of pedogenesis in tropical and subtropical regions favor the generation of bimodal soils. Data from the Maheshwaram watershed in South India (subtropical), the Oueme watershed in Benin (subhumid), and soil databases established for (sub) tropical regions confirmed that bimodal soils are common in (sub) tropical climates. These results were backed up by the fact that sample populations of bimodal soils are underrepresented in databases such as UNSODA, GRIZZLY, or the Soil Information System of the Netherlands, all three of which contain soils mainly from temperate regions. The consequences of bimodal soil behavior are important. The hydrodynamic flow behavior of these soils should be different from that of monomodal soils. The concept of shape similarity between the cumulative particle-size distribution curve and the water retention curve, validated for monomodal soils, implies that bimodal soils should theoretically exhibit bimodal hydraulic properties. These consequences are far reaching since most of the soil hydraulic models in the literature are monomodal and hence inadequate to describe the hydraulic behavior of bimodal soils from (sub) tropical regions...|$|R

40|$|Many {{environmental}} {{studies on the}} protection of European soil and water resources make use of soil water simulation models. A major obstacle to the wider application of these models {{is the lack of}} easily accessible and representative soil hydraulic properties. In order to overcome this apparent lack of data, a project was initiated to bring together the available hydraulic data which resided within different institutions in Europe into one central database. This information was then used to derive a set of pedotransfer functions applicable to studies at a European scale. These pedotransfer functions predict the hydraulic properties from parameters collected during soil surveys and can be a good alternative for costly and time-consuming direct measurement of these properties. A total of 20 institutions from 12 European countries collaborated in establishing the database of HYdraulic PRoperties of European Soils (HYPRES). This database has a flexible relational structure capable of holding a wide diversity of both soil pedological and hydraulic data. As these data were contributed by 20 different institutions it was necessary to standardise both the particle-size and the hydraulic data. A novel similarity interpolation procedure was successfully used to achieve standardization of particle-sizes according to the FAO clay, silt and sand <b>particle-size</b> <b>ranges.</b> Standardization of hydraulic data was achieved by fitting the Mualem-van Genuchten model parameters to the individual (h) and K(h) hydraulic properties stored in HYPRES. The HYPRES database contains information on a total of 5521 soil horizons (including replicates).

Information on both water retention and hydraulic conductivity was available for 1136 horizons whereas 2894 horizons had only information on water retention.

Eruptive activity during 4 - 8 May 2010 was characterized based on short-duration physical parameters in order to capture transient eruptive behavior of a long-lasting eruption (i. e., total grainsize distribution, erupted mass and mass eruption rate averaged over 30 -minute activity). Resulting 30 -minute total grainsize distribution based on both ground and MSG-SEVIRI satellite measurements is characterized by Mdphi of about 2 phi and a fine-ash content of about 30 wt%. Accumulation rate varied by two orders of magnitude with an exponential decay away from the vent, whereas Mdphi shows a linear increase until about 18 km from vent reaching a plateau of about 4. 5 phi between 20 - 56 km. Associated mass eruption rate is in between 0. 6 - 1. 2 x 10 ^ 5 kg s^- 1. In-situ sampling showed how fine ash mainly fell as aggregates of various typologies.

The species prefers substrate habitat in the particle size range of 125 - 2000 μ and it appears to recognize "home" substrate. At Salmon Cove 95 % of the substrate is within the size range 125 - 1000 μ; at areas of greatest abundance of the animal in Newfoundland the same particle size predominates. A concentration of the species at Salmon Cove beach 25 meters from LWS {{during the summer months}} may shift seaward during the winter because of low water temperatures. A possible alternative explanation for the small numbers taken in winter samples might be that the animals burrow deeply enough into the sand to escape capture by the collection method used. Population numbers reach a peak at Salmon Cove in October when unsexable young constitute over 90 % of the total; least numbers are present in January. Oogonia of the females enlarge in October and November; embryos are deposited in brood pouches in March and young are released in August. For a second brood embryos are deposited in June and released in the fall. The smaller male copulates at right angles to the body of the female and the latter assumes various reproductive hues during this season. Strong water currents created by pleopod beat aid the animal in swimming and burrowing. An efficient means of aeration of embryos in the brood pouches is provided by these water currents.

Concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs), size-fractionated particulate matter (PM), and carbon monoxide (CO) were measured in the central area of Milan over three-week-long periods, one each during summer, autumn, and winter, with three monitoring sessions per day. Experimental data were collected continuously during each monitoring period along an established urban pathway. To assess the relevance of time and spatial factors affecting atmospheric concentrations of UFPs, PM, and CO data were collected while walking or moving by different private and public means of transport. Measurements were divided on the basis of different microenvironments (MEs), seasons, days of the week, and periods of the day.

It is also a limiting factor for many processes involve mass or energy transfer between air and water phases in vadose zone. In this research, the gas-phase partitioning tracer method was used to measure air-water interfacial area for eight porous media. The experimental results were used to investigate the influencing factors of the magnitude of air-water interfacial area and the relationship between the air-water interfacial area and water saturation, and capillary pressure. The porous media comprised a series of sands with narrow <b>particle-size</b> <b>ranges,</b> a sand with a wider particle-size distribution, a sandy soil, and a loamy sandy soil. The measurement range was extended to very low water contents in an attempt to determine upper limits for air-water interfacial areas. The measured values were compared to the normalized surface areas of the porous media. The results of the experiments showed that the magnitude of the air-water interfacial areas increased with decreasing water saturation, and approached that of the normalized surface areas. Generally, air-water interfacial areas were larger for media with larger specific surface areas. The change in air-water interfacial area with changing water saturation was less near saturated water contents and greater at smaller values. In addition, the change was greater for the poorly-sorted media than the well-sorted media. An empirical model was developed to describe the observed relationship between air-water interfacial area and water saturation. The coefficients of the model were found to correlate to the porous-medium uniformity coefficient. With this model and associated correlations, only bulk density, specific surface area, and uniformity coefficient are needed to estimate air-water interfacial area for a given water saturation. The model was shown to provide a reasonable description of a literature data set. Potential relationships between air-water interfacial area and capillary pressure under higher water-content conditions are investigated for unsaturated sandy porous media. A conceptual relationship between air-water interfacial area and capillary pressure is hypothesized, and is tested using air-water interfacial area data obtained from gas-phase tracer tests and saturation-pressure data obtained from water-drainage experiments. The results show that the magnitude of the air-water interfacial area increases with increasing capillary pressure, which corresponds to decreasing water content. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

Are referred to as bimodal soils soils with a particle-size distribution function F having two 02 inflection points the first in the range of clays and the second in the range of sands. Such soils are already part of multiporous soils that have multimodal behavior. Haverkamp and Reggiani 2002 have established for soils whose particle-size have a monomodal behavior a shape similarity between the cumulative particle-size distribution curve and the water retention curve h amp 952. A soil whose particle-size distribution has two modes bimodal distribution of soil particle-size usually poses enormous difficulties to soil physicists. Indeed this character when already achieves two in soil bimodal soils results in nine 09 unknown for the same water retention curve model with mathematical-physical basic making it very difficult if not impossible to determine hydrodynamic parameters. So monomadal soils facilitate the study of water transfers in the soil. The hydrodynamic models are available for these types of soils and involve more than 4 unknowns. And with the initial and boundary conditions they allow the indeterminations up without difficulty. Now the work of Tomasella and Hodnett 1998 2000 2002 appears to link the modal character of the soil to climate zones to which they belong. They have come to say that the monomodal soils are specific to temperate regions and bimodal soils are specific to tropical or subtropical regions. The objective of the study is to test the hypothesis of bimodality for the case of soils of the unsaturated zone of Allada plateau located in the intertropical zone and to confirm the applicability of Brooks and Corey 1964 and van Genuchten 1980 models considered in this study and which are only valid on monomodal soils. The analysis according to USDA classification of the main soils of the study area namely haplic Acrisols umbric Fluvisols and ferric Acrisols and their representation according to the soil textural triangle with an associated bimodal zone revealed 66 of monomodal soils and 34 of bimodal soils in the study area.

Necessary chemical information on the fume was obtained using various analytical techniques. It is demonstrated that NaF and KF are preferentially enriched on the particle surfaces and that Na, K, F and CrtVI) are appreciably leachable by water. The toxicological significance of the results is discussed.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{development of}} medial moraines on Austerdalsbreen, Norway and Berendon Glacier, British Columbia {{is dependent upon}} englacial debris supply. A literature review suggests {{that this is a}} general case. An 'ablation-dominant' model of moraine formation is proposed which relates englacial debris supply to the site and manner of englacial incorporation of debris relative to the firn line. On Austerdalsbreen a prominent medial moraine is formed by the confluence of two ice-cap outlet glaciers below the firn line (below firn line subtype of the model). Moraine debris is derived from extraglacial bedrock outcrops between the two ice streams and is englacially entrained via crevasses to which lower depth limits apply. Revelation of crevasse-bound debris generates a distinct ice-cored morphology which is destroyed as crevasse-bottoms are revealed downglacier. In this below firn line subtype, moraines formed by confluence of ice-cap outlet glaciers below the firn line are characterized by a discrete debris supply distinct from subglacial removal of bedrock. [...] On Berendon Glacier ice streams coalesce above the firn line (above firn line subtype); debris entrained between ice streams is derived both from extraglacial rock outcrops and from subnival and subglacial bedrock zones. Extraglacially derived debris undergoes seasonal sedimentation with snowfall; debris extends throughout ice depth. As a result a distinct moraine morphology is present in the terminal area in response to continuing englacial debris supply. The bulk of moraine debris is found to be transported at depth near the glacier base following subglacial and subnival derivation in the firn basin. Upper englacial debris (related to extraglacial rockslope activity in the firn basin) is of small quantity. [...] In addition, moraines are generated in many cases by confluence below the firn line of large ice-streams carrying a large lateral moraine load. Peculiar ice structures and patterns of ice flow commonly observed from confluence zones have been considered to determine moraine morphology rather than englacial debris supply. However this 'ice-stream interaction' model which was tested on Berendon Glacier where two large ice-streams converge explains moraine morphology in the confluence zone only. Down-glacier, moraine morphology accords with those moraines formed above the firn-line i. e. is dependent upon the nature of englacial debris supply. [...] Examination of debris texture, scanning electron microscopy (s. e. m.) of quartz grains and clay mineral investigations form the basis of sedimentological analyses. Medial moraine debris cannot be rigorously distinguished from other elements of the debris system; primary comminution processes produce debris exhibiting a wide <b>particle-size</b> <b>range</b> independent of parent bedrock. A wide spectrum of particle sizes is produced. Limited comminution following initial derivation (i. e. passive glacial transport) is reflected in quartz grain surface textures and a coarser mean size of medial moraine debris compared to subglacial lodgement tills...|$|E
