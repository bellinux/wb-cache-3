40|$|Characterizing the {{phenotype}} of wild versus domesticated forms is {{a fundamental}} step {{to understand how the}} domestication process has affected morphospace occupation. In the case of dogs the extent of divergence in different organs is a rich subject when considering the diversity of breeds. We present a comprehensive morphometric study of the osseous inner ear, considered a highly conserved structure in mammals. It houses the sense of balance in the vestibular organ, including the semicircular canals, and the cochlea, associated with the perception of sound waves. Three dimensional virtual endocasts obtained from high-resolution computed tomography scans were used to characterize the inner ear of 35 dogs of three ‘ancient’ (‘basal’) and 13 ‘modern’ breeds, 13 wolves, and six dingoes, which are feral dogs, using semilandmarks. In comparison to wolves, ‘modern’ dog breeds exhibit larger variationin the morphology of the inner ear. The structures of the inner ear of ‘ancient’ dog breeds also occupy a morphospace outside the range of the wolves. The number of turns of the cochlea is uniform in wolves whereas the range is extended in dogs. The domestication process and the selection of breeds have produced shapesoutside the normal range of variation of the species, illustrating the plasticity of development of conserved structures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The differences in diagnostic quality between thin-section coronal sequential CT scans of 24 petrosal bones in 12 patients and matched MPR images were assessed by five observers. The matched MPR images were calculated with both trilinear and tricubic interpolation. Image resolution was determined by measuring the three-dimensional point spread function. RESULTS: All observers preferred tricubically interpolated MPR images over trilinearly interpolated images. Subjective differences in image quality between direct coronal scans and matched tricubically interpolated MPR images were small. Only the direct coronal scans with the highest image quality (0. 5 -mm collimation, 465 mAs) were judged to be slightly better than the matched MPR images. With regard to direct coronal scans obtained at 245 mAs and/or 1. 0 -mm collimation, either there was no preference or the MPR images were preferred.

40|$|Hydrocephalus is {{uncommon}} in horses. However, in recent years, {{it has become}} clear that the prevalence of hydrocephalus is greater in Friesian horses than in other breeds probably due to their limited gene pool. Before identification of candidate genes that predispose to the development of hydrocephalus in Friesian horses can be pursued, an in-depth, phenotypic, pathological description of the condition in Friesians would be of great benefit. Our study aimed to characterize the morphology of hydrocephalus in Friesian horses, to support further investigation of the genetic background of this condition. Four stillborn Friesian foals with hydrocephalus were examined macroscopically and microscopically and compared with 2 normal stillborn Friesian foals without hydrocephalus. In all clinical cases, tetraventricular and venous dilatations were observed, together with malformation of the <b>petrosal</b> <b>bone</b> and, as a result, narrowing of the jugular foramen. These observations suggest a communicative hydrocephalus with a diminished absorption of cerebrospinal fluid into the systemic circulation at the venous sinuses due to a distorted, nonfunctional jugular foramen.

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal case study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A father and son with the BOR syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Both patients underwent imaging studies to detect and evaluate inner ear anomalies. Longitudinal audiometric analysis of the hearing threshold data over the previous 23 years was performed. Caloric tests were performed at various ages. RESULTS: The son had a short, wide internal acoustic canal, a hypoplastic cochlea, a plump vestibule, and a wide vestibular aqueduct on both sides; the semicircular canals and endolymphatic sac were of normal size. He showed progressive fluctuant sensorineural hearing loss. Caloric tests disclosed hyporeflexia on the left side. The father had a plump internal acoustic canal and hypoplastic cochlea on both sides. The left vestibule was hypoplastic, and the left vestibular aqueduct was marginally enlarged. He showed severe hearing impairment, without substantial progression or fluctuation, and caloric areflexia on the left side. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a correlation between progressive fluctuant sensorineural hearing loss with caloric hypofunction {{and the presence of}} an enlarged vestibular aqueduct in the BOR syndrome.

Among mammals, bats possess unique traits that place unusual demands on their vestibular systems.

Second, many bats have enlarged cochleae associated with echolocation, and both cochleae and semicircular canals share a space within the <b>petrosal</b> <b>bone.</b> To determine how bat vestibular systems have evolved {{in the face of}} these pressures, we used micro-CT scans to compare canal morphology across species with contrasting flight and echolocation capabilities.

No such trend was seen in members of the Yinpterochiroptera that use laryngeal echolocation, although canal radius was associated with wing-tip roundedness in this group. We also found that the vestibular system scaled with cochlea size, although the relationship differed in species that use constant frequency echolocation. Across all bats, the shape of the anterior and lateral canals was associated with large cochlea size and small body size respectively, suggesting differential spatial constraints on each canal depending on its orientation within the skull.

Although Rhynchippus equinus Ameghino {{is one of the}} most frequent notohippids in the fossil record, there are scarce data about cranial osteology other than the classical descriptions which date back to the early last century. In this context, we describe the exceptionally preserved specimen MPEF PV 695 (based on CT scanning technique and 3 D reconstruction) with the aim of improving our knowledge of the species, especially regarding auditory region (petrosal, tympanic and surrounding elements), sphenoidal and occipital complexes. Besides a modular description of the whole skull, osteological correlates identified on the basicranium are used to infer some soft-tissue elements, especially those associated with vessels that supply the head, mainly intracranially. One of the most informative elements was the <b>petrosal</b> <b>bone,</b> whose general morphology matches that expected for a toxodont. The endocranial surface, together with the surrounding parietal, basisphenoid, occipital, and squamosal, enabled us to propose the location and communication of main venous sinuses of the lateral head wall (temporal, inferior and sigmoid sinuses), whereas the tympanic aspect and the identification of a posterior carotid artery canal provided strong evidence in support of an intratympanic course of the internal carotid artery, a controversial issue among notoungulates. Regarding the arrangement of tympanic and paratympanic spaces, the preservation of the specimen allowed us to appreciate the three connected spaces that constitute a heavily pneumatized middle ear; the epitympanic sinus, the tympanic cavity itself, and the ventral expansion of the tympanic cavity through the notably inflated bullae.

Hearing loss affects 35 - 60 % of the patients and will progress to deafness in 2 - 11 % of OI patients for whom cochlear implantation may become the only remaining treatment option. Three patients with OI were retrieved from the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Centre's database. Most of the specific observations in ear surgery on patients with OI, such as brittle scutum, sclerotic thickening of the cochlea, hyperplastic mucosa in the middle ear and persistent bleeding, were encountered in these 3 patients. In case 3, with severe deformities on the CT scan, misplacement of the electrode array into the horizontal semicircular canal occurred. In all 3 cases, programming was hindered by nonauditory stimulation. Even after reimplantation, nonauditory sensations lead to case 3 becoming a nonuser. Averaged electrode voltages in case 3 were deviant in accordance with an abnormally conductive otic capsule. Spatial spread of neural excitation responses in cases 1 and 2 suggested intracochlear channel interaction for several electrodes, often in combination with facial nerve stimulation (FNS). In case 1, the estimated pitch of the electrodes that caused FNS varied consistently. Despite the electrophysiological changes, after 1 -year follow-up, open set phoneme scores of 81 % and 78 % were reached in cases 1 and 2, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Anatomical {{comparisons}} of the ear region of baleen whales (Mysticeti) are provided through detailed osteological descriptions and high-resolution photographs of the petrotympanic complex (tympanic bulla and <b>petrosal</b> <b>bone)</b> of all extant species of mysticete cetaceans. Salient morphological features are illustrated and identified, including overall shape of the bulla, size of the conical process of the bulla, morphology of the promontorium, and {{the size and shape}} of the anterior process of the petrosal. We place our comparative osteological observations into a phylogenetic context in order to initiate an exploration into petrotympanic evolution within Mysticeti. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The morphology of the petrotympanic complex is diagnostic for individual species of baleen whale (e. g., sigmoid and conical processes positioned at midline of bulla in Balaenoptera musculus; confluence of fenestra cochleae and perilymphatic foramen in Eschrichtius robustus), and several mysticete clades are united by derived characteristics. Balaenids and neobalaenids share derived features of the bulla, such as a rhomboid shape and a reduced anterior lobe (swelling) in ventral aspect, and eschrichtiids share derived morphologies of the petrosal with balaenopterids, including loss of a medial promontory groove and dorsomedial elongation of the promontorium. Monophyly of Balaenoidea (Balaenidae and Neobalaenidae) and Balaenopteroidea (Balaenopteridae and Eschrichtiidae) was recovered in phylogenetic analyses utilizing data exclusively from the petrotympanic complex. SIGNIFICANCE: This study fills a major gap in our knowledge of the complex structures of the mysticete petrotympanic complex, which is an important anatomical region for the interpretation of the evolutionary history of mammals. In addition, we introduce a novel body of phylogenetically informative characters from the ear region of mysticetes. Our detailed anatomical descriptions, illustrations, and comparisons provide valuable data for current and future studies on the phylogenetic relationships, evolution, and auditory physiology of mysticetes and other cetaceans throughout Earth's history...|$|E

No such trend was seen in members of the Yinpterochiroptera that use laryngeal echolocation, although canal radius was associated with wing-tip roundedness in this group. We also found that the vestibular system scaled with cochlea size, although the relationship differed in species that use constant frequency echolocation. Across all bats, the shape of the anterior and lateral canals was associated with large cochlea size and small body size respectively, suggesting differential spatial constraints on each canal depending on its orientation within the skull. Thus in many echolocating bats, it seems that the combination of small body size and enlarged cochlea together act as a principal force on the vestibular system. The two main groups of echolocating bats displayed different canal morphologies, in terms of size and shape in relation to body mass and cochlear size, thus suggesting independent evolutionary pathways and offering tentative support for multiple acquisitions of echolocation...|$|E
40|$|The {{available}} {{data in the}} literature (177 cases), two current clinical patients, and cases which occurred in The Netherlands (13) were reviewed concerning the clinical presentation, pathological features, radiological data, and treatment options of chondrosarcoma of the cranial base.  The mean age of patients was 37 years, the male/female ratio 1 : 1. 1. The most frequent complaints were diplopia with oculomotor disorders (51 %), headache (31 %), and decreased hearing, dizziness, and tinnitus with statoacusticus dysfunction (21 %). The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 27 months.  The chondrosarcomas were located in the <b>petrosal</b> <b>bone</b> in 37 % (47 cases), in the occipital bone and clivus in 23 % (30 cases), in the sphenoïd bone in 20 % (25 cases) {{and to a lesser}} extent in frontal, ethmoïdal, and parietal bones (14 %). In 6 % (eight cases) the primary location was in dural tissue. Radiological examinations showed bone destruction and variable calcification (CT), involvement of neuronal and vascular structures (MRI), and mostly hypovascularity on angiography. On histological examination 51 % of tumours were classified as grade I, 11 % grade II, 30 % mesenchymal, and 8 % myxoïd. The mesenchymal type was the most malignant as illustrated by a strong tendency to intradural and cerebral growth and possibly occurrence in younger age groups. The treatment of choice until recently was surgery because of the critical location and local aggressive nature. Regrowth of tumour after surgery occurred in 53 % of the patients (average after 32 months). Charged particle irradiation gave a five year survival of 83 - 94 % and a local control rate of 78 %- 91 %. Both in surgery and radiotherapy there is treatment related morbidity and mortality that should be considered when offering these therapies.  Recent promising results imply that charged particle radiotherapy, in combination with surgery, may be the therapeutical choice of the future. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop an {{experimental}} model that would generate extensive motor neuronal degeneration in adult rats, and furthermore to study mechanisms causing nerve cell death and effects of putative neuroprotective compounds. The facial nerve was chosen because it is well characterized and allows evaluation of functional recovery by analyzing vibrissae movements. Using a microsurgical technique, the facial nerve was exposed in the <b>petrosal</b> <b>bone</b> and along its intracranial course in the subarachnoid space where it was cut or compressed near the brainstem. This proximal injury may reflect the situation for some patients suffering from long-lasting facial palsies due to skull-base fractures or tumor growth in the pontine angle. We found that the intracranial portion {{of the facial nerve}} was more sensitive than the distal part of the nerve, in terms of neuronal degeneration. A massive motor neuronal death was found after intracranial facial nerve transection (73 % cell death after one month). Intracranial facial nerve crush also generated nerve cell death (13 % after one month). These data suggest that the intracranial portion of the facial nerve is vulnerable in a unique fashion, in comparison to other peripheral nerves. Furthermore, adult facial motor neurons demonstrated apoptotic death after intracranial transection, in contrast to a distal injury, which is yet another unique response to transection of adult peripheral motor neurons. Moreover, following intracranial transection, reactive microglia transformed into ED I -expressing macrophages, in the ipsilateral facial nucleus, which was not the case after the distal injury. This reaction pattern, which distinguishes intracranial facial nerve transection from the distal lesion as well as from other peripheral nerve injuries, may partly explain the poor outcome that occur in some patients, when the intracranial portion of the facial nerve is lesioned in patients. Several mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to neuronal death following axotomy, such as loss of trophic support from the periphery, accumulation of neurotoxic compounds in the vicinity of neuronal somata, like reactive oxygen species and excitotoxic amino acids. Some of these neurotoxic compounds are released from reactive microglial cells. Here we have studied yet another potential cell death promoting mechanism, the activation of the complement cascade. Using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, we provide evidence for activation of the complement cascade locally in the ipsilateral facial nucleus, in the immediate vicinity to the axotomized neurons. Facial motor neurons also responded with an upregulation of the complement regulators clusterin and CD 59. Reactive oxygen species {{as well as the other}} neurotoxic components mentioned above, including the complement cascade, may cause an intracellular overload of calcium, however, by different mechanisms. We have therefore within the frame of the present thesis also evaluated potential neuroprotective effects of two antioxidants, betamethasone and the pyrrolopyrimidine PNU- 101033 -E, as well as the calcium flow antagonist nimodipine. No neuroprotective effects of high-dose betamethasone could be found, however, a dramatic neuroprotective effect of pyrrolopyrimidines as well as nimodipine could be demonstrated. In addition, nimodipine promoted axonal regeneration. We found increased numbers of myelinated axons as well as increased axon and myelin dimensions ipsilateral to intracranial facial nerve crush, and furthermore, an improved facial nerve function, studied by analysis of vibrissae movements. In conclusion, proximal, intracranial lesion of the adult facial nerve cause severe consequences in the facial nucleus in terms of neuronal degeneration, some of which might be due to substances released by reactive microglia, like complement. This intense degeneration can be reversed by administration of pyrrolopyrimidines or nimodipine, both of which may become new strategies for treatment of patients suffering from cranial or other peripheral nerve injuries. We suggest that these drugs should be further evaluated for clinical use...|$|E
