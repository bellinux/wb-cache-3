5|$|Marge finally {{loses her}} temper and sends Homer {{and the class}} out of the house. When Homer tries to get back in, Marge stops him, saying she can no longer trust him, and refuses to let him back in. Homeless, Homer stays in Bart's treehouse. Marge tries to reassure Bart and Lisa that she and Homer love the children, despite their current situation, but Lisa and Bart are worried their <b>parents</b> <b>will</b> get divorced. Marge tries to get advice from Reverend Lovejoy, who tells her to get a divorce.|$|E
5|$|Overstreet, {{who played}} New Directions member and {{football}} team player Sam Evans {{in the second}} season, returns {{for the first time}} this season, and will have a multi-episode recurring role. Sam's <b>parents</b> <b>will</b> appear for the first time in this episode; his father is played by John Schneider, and his mother by Tanya Clarke. Series co-creator Ryan Murphy also stated that Pearce returns as Harmony in this episode, and Gustin will appear for the second time as Sebastian Smythe, a member of the Dalton Academy Warblers.|$|E
5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their <b>parents</b> <b>will</b> be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E

5|$|At a music festival, Sunny is embarrassed when Ringo and Declan Napier (James Sorensen) {{interrupt}} a kiss {{between her}} and Zeke. She runs off into the bush, falls down a cliff and injures her ankle. Zeke also falls down the cliff, they are eventually rescued by Declan and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they know nothing about the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents demand that she {{is placed on the}} next flight home. However, Zeke moves out, so Sunny's <b>parents</b> <b>will</b> not worry about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him. Sunny lies to her father {{about the nature of the}} conversation and tells him that her father said everything is fine.|$|E
5|$|Mother is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a melodrama that focuses with Will Allen who runs away from home after being violently abused by his stepfather and his mother keeps a candle lit for him to return home. Twenty years later, Will returns home after having become a successful lawyer, but cannot find his <b>parents.</b> <b>Will</b> later takes the case to defend a lady being prosecuted by a client company. After being successful he recognizes the lady as his mother and they are reunited. The film's cast included Anna Rosemond, Frank H. Crane and Carey L. Hastings, but other credits are uncertain. The film was released on September 6, 1910, and was met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the <b>parents</b> <b>will</b> usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
30|$|For the routing from a node in {{the tree}} of a sink to that sink, the packets will be routed like {{described}} in the RFC describing RPL. The upward routing principle {{is based on the}} selection of preferred parent for each node in the network. This selected <b>parent</b> <b>will</b> act as the next hop for the multi-hop path towards the sink. The preferred <b>parent</b> <b>will</b> be selected based on the objective function used to construct the DODAG.|$|R

5|$|The social {{organisation}} of the blue-faced honeyeater {{has been little}} studied to date. Encountered in pairs, family groups or small flocks, blue-faced honeyeaters sometimes associate with groups of yellow-throated miners (Manorina flavigula). They mob potential threats such as goshawks (Accipiter spp.), rufous owls (Ninox rufa), and Pacific koels (Eudynamys orientalis). There is some evidence of cooperative breeding, with some breeding pairs recorded {{with one or more}} helper birds. <b>Parents</b> <b>will</b> dive at and harass intruders to drive them away from nest sites, including dogs, owls, goannas, and even a nankeen night heron (Nycticorax caledonicus). A study published in 2004 of remnant patches of forest in central Queensland, an area largely cleared for agriculture, showed a reduced avian species diversity in areas frequented by blue-faced honeyeaters or noisy miners. This effect was more marked in smaller patches. The study concluded that conserved patches of woodland containing the two aggressive species should be larger than 20ha (44acres) to preserve diversity.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season takes place over five months from August to January {{with up to}} three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is a neat, deep cup made of soft dry grass and bark. Spider webs, feathers and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork or even a mistletoe bush. It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged {{to blend in with}} its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish and splotched with dark grey-brown are laid on consecutive days, measuring 16mm × 13mm (0.6 × 0.5in). Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood while the female is foraging, and <b>parents</b> <b>will</b> feed young and dart off quickly if there are predators in the vicinity. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and {{there is some evidence that}} extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.|$|E

50|$|Mendelian {{traits in}} humans {{concerns}} how, in Mendelian inheritance, a child receiving a dominant allele from either <b>parent</b> <b>will</b> have the dominant {{form of the}} phenotypic trait or characteristic. Only those that received the recessive allele from both parents, known as zygosity, will have the recessive phenotype. Those that receive a dominant allele from one parent and a recessive allele from the other <b>parent</b> <b>will</b> have the dominant form of the trait. Purely Mendelian traits are a tiny minority of all traits, since most phenotypic traits exhibit incomplete dominance, codominance, and contributions from many genes.|$|R

25|$|The female {{will lay}} an egg every {{one or two}} days until she has {{completed}} a clutch, which can consist of 4 to 12 eggs (usually 9). She will then incubate the eggs for three to four weeks while the male brings her food. After the eggs hatch, both <b>parents</b> <b>will</b> feed the chicks. Four weeks after hatching, the chicks can make short flights and begin leaving the nest burrow. The <b>parents</b> <b>will</b> still help feed the chicks for one to three months. While most of the eggs will hatch, only four to five chicks usually survive to leave the nest.|$|E

25|$|Before 2010, {{the usage}} of PGD was in a legal grey area. In 2010, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled that PGD {{can be used in}} {{exceptional}} cases. On 7 July 2011, the Bundestag passed a law that allows PGD in certain cases. The procedure may only be used when there is a strong likelihood that <b>parents</b> <b>will</b> pass on a genetic disease, or when there is a high genetic chance of a stillbirth or miscarriage. On 1 February 2013, the Bundesrat approved a rule regulating how PGD can be used in practice.|$|E
