Though 80–90 percent of cancer pain can be eliminated or well controlled, nearly half of all people with cancer pain in the developed world and more than 80 percent of people with cancer worldwide receive less than optimal care.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{the title}} Cakravarti {{seem to have}} been {{commonly}} used in the Pandyan kingdom as a caste or job title. Compound titles exist, such as Maravacakravarti that belonged to a Maravar chief as well as Malavacakravarti that belonged to a Malava chief. Ariyar in Tamil could denote a noble or a learned <b>person,</b> <b>a</b> Brahmin or alternatively a person from Aryavarta. Thus the title Arayacakravarti seems to fit the structure of similarly used titles across the Pandyan kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary <b>person.</b> <b>A</b> higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|Some {{palladium}} is emitted {{with the}} exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food {{is estimated to}} be less than 2µg per <b>person</b> <b>a</b> day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, from which the uptake of palladium {{is estimated to be}} less than 15µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E
5|$|The author {{starts with}} Basavanna's birth and weaves episodes of other famous sharanas (devotees of Hindu god Shiva)—such as Allama Prabhu—into his life history. Basavanna is {{depicted}} as a saintly <b>person,</b> <b>a</b> great devotee of Shiva, an incarnation of Nandi, a man of miracles and one with a mission, sent to re-establish the Veerashaiva faith on earth. The work is arranged into eight aswasas (divisions) containing sixty-one sandhis (chapters) and 3,621 verses. The narration includes stories of devotees of Shiva who overcame their egos. Apart from a few variations, the writings of Bhima Kavi and his predecessors are complementary. Two lost works of Bhima Kavi are the Bhimakaviswara Ragale and the Bhringidandaka.|$|E

5|$|The shark tourist {{industry}} has some financial leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to £20,000. That is {{a fraction of}} the tourism value of a live shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in Gansbaai, South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between £50 and £150 per <b>person,</b> <b>a</b> single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between £9,000 and £27,000 of revenue daily.|$|E

Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency. One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization. All the detainees were subsequently released.|$|E
5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a <b>person</b> <b>a</b> member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, IUPAC {{published}} a recommendation on naming the disputed elements following the previous reports. For element 105, they proposed the name joliotium (Jl), after the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie, a significant {{contributor to the}} development of nuclear physics and chemistry; this name was originally proposed by the Soviet team for element 102, which by then had long been called nobelium. (The name nielsbohrium for element 107 was transformed to bohrium to conform with the practice set by all then-named elements.) This recommendation paper was generally met with criticism from the American scientists: their recommendations were scrambled (the names rutherfordium and hahnium, originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were used for elements 106 and 108, respectively); both elements 104 and 105 were given names suggested by the Russian team despite earlier recognition of the Berkeley team as of an equal co-discoverer; and especially because the name seaborgium for element 106 was rejected for honoring a living <b>person,</b> <b>a</b> rule that had only just been approved. These names were to be accepted on a Council meeting in 1995.|$|E
25|$|During sleep, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> is in <b>an</b> altered {{state of}} mind. Aristotle compares <b>a</b> {{sleeping}} <b>person</b> to <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who has <b>a</b> strong infatuation with someone {{may begin to}} think they see that person everywhere {{because they are so}} overtaken by their feelings. When <b>a</b> <b>person</b> is asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who is influenced by strong feelings. Since <b>a</b> <b>person</b> sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Sam Newton that Ecgric {{may in fact be}} identical to Eni's son Æthelric, whose descendants became kings of East Anglia. Æthelric's son Ealdwulf ruled from about 664 to 713. After Ecgric's death, three other sons of Eni ruled in succession before Ealdwulf, an indication that Raedwald's line was extinct. Æthelric's marriage to Hereswith suggests that it was expected that he would rule East Anglia and he may have been promoted by Edwin before 632. Æthelric was apparently dead by 647, at which time Anna was already ruling and Hereswith had gone to Gaul to lead a religious life. It has therefore been argued that Æthelric and Ecgric were in fact the same <b>person,</b> <b>a</b> suggestion that is disputed by the historian Barbara Yorke, who notes that the two names are too distinct to be compatible.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} storm {{of the season}} was Cyclonic Storm Hibaru, which formed southeast of Sri Lanka in January. After nearly five months of inactivity, two depressions formed {{toward the end of}} June on opposite sides of India. The depression in the Arabian Sea was one of only two in that body of water during the year, the other of which formed in September and killed 13people. The other was a depression that formed over land and killed 26people in Madhya Pradesh, followed by another depression in July that killed one <b>person.</b> <b>A</b> series of deadly storms affected southeastern India beginning in September; a depression killed six people in Madhya Pradesh, Cyclonic Storm Pyarr killed 80people, an unclassified tropical storm killed 16people in nearby Bangladesh, and a deep depression in October killed 100people in Andhra Pradesh. December was active, with cyclonic storms Baaz and Fanoos hitting southern India, resulting in 11fatalities, and a deep depression remaining over waters {{in the middle of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|Unhappy {{with this}} change of {{policy of the}} Portuguese government, Napoleon sent an army to invade Portugal. On 17 October 1807, 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish {{cooperation}} and headed towards Portugal to enforce Napoleon's Continental System. This {{was the first step}} in what would become the six-year-long Peninsular War, a struggle that sapped much of the French Empire's strength. Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the Spanish royal family. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialised when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the Spanish royal family. Marshal Murat led 120,000 troops into Spain and the French arrived in Madrid on 24 March, where wild riots against the occupation erupted a few weeks later. The resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout the country. The shocking French defeat at the Battle of Bailén in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in <b>person.</b> <b>A</b> new French army commanded by Napoleon crossed the Ebro in autumn and dealt blow after blow to the opposing Spanish forces. Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops. He then unleashed his troops against Moore's British forces. The British were swiftly driven to the coast, and, after a last stand at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809, withdrew from Spain entirely.|$|E
