500|$|With the {{emergence}} of feminist criticism in academia in the 1960s and 1970s, Wollstonecraft's works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the second wave of the North American feminist movement itself; for example, in the early 1970s, six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her [...] "passionate life in [...] to [...] radical and rationalist agenda". The feminist artwork The Dinner Party, first exhibited in 1979, features a <b>place</b> <b>setting</b> for Wollstonecraft. In the 1980s and 1990s, yet another image of Wollstonecraft emerged, one which described her as much more a creature of her time; scholars such as Claudia Johnson, Gary Kelly, and Virginia Sapiro demonstrated the continuity between Wollstonecraft's thought and other important eighteenth-century ideas regarding topics such as sensibility, economics, and political theory.|$|E
500|$|With Heidfeld injured, Webber's former Jaguar {{teammate}} Antônio Pizzonia {{stepped into}} the second Williams seat adding pressure on Webber to perform well given the public argument the pair had {{towards the end of}} 2004. The [...] saw Pizzonia driving to seventh whilst Webber was caught up in a first-corner incident which led to him finishing 14th. The roles were reversed for the following race in Belgium as Webber finished in fourth place and Pizzonia retired after a collision with Juan Pablo Montoya in the closing laps. With rumours spreading that Heidfeld had in fact signed with BMW Sauber for the 2006 season, Pizzonia continued in the race seat, and in the , was clipped by David Coulthard in turn one. The contact caused Pizzonia to spin into the path of Webber forcing extensive repairs to the Australian's car. Webber took 17th <b>place,</b> <b>setting</b> the 8th fastest lap of the race, but was not classified as a finisher.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} much {{speculation}} in print about {{the identity of the}} girl in the song. Clinton Heylin states that the most frequently mooted candidates are Echo Helstrom, an early girlfriend of Dylan from his hometown of Hibbing, and Suze Rotolo, for whom Dylan was pining as he finished the song in Italy. Howard Sounes suggests the girl Dylan probably had in mind was Bonnie Beecher, a girlfriend of Dylan's when he was at the University of Minnesota. Musicologist Todd Harvey notes that Dylan not only took the tune of [...] "Scarborough Fair", which he learned from Martin Carthy in London but also adapted the theme of that song. [...] "Scarborough Fair" [...] derives from [...] "The Elfin Knight" [...] (Child Ballad Number 2), which was first transcribed in 1670. In the song, a supernatural character poses a series of questions to an innocent, requesting her to perform impossible tasks. Harvey points out that Dylan [...] "retains the idea of the listener being sent upon a task, a northern <b>place</b> <b>setting,</b> and an antique lyric quality". Dylan returned to this song on Nashville Skyline (1969), recording it as a duet with Johnny Cash and he returned to it again in the studio with an unreleased organ and sax version in 1978.|$|E

500|$|His {{best chance}} at winning a race {{occurred}} at the [...] where, in the wet conditions, Webber ran in 2nd <b>place,</b> <b>setting</b> the 3rd fastest lap of the race after the two McLarens. Towards {{the end of the}} race, Webber was running 2nd behind Lewis Hamilton, with no further pit stops to make, when Sebastian Vettel, driver for sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso, ran into the back of him when Hamilton suddenly reduced his speed in poor visibility and heavy rain under a safety car, taking both cars out of the race. He had been lapping faster than Hamilton due to damage on the McLaren's sidepod from contact with Robert Kubica. Out of the current Formula One drivers, until his win at the 2009 German Grand Prix, Webber has had the second highest number of starts without a win, and {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "unluckiest man in modern Formula One", a title that was reinforced in Japan as Webber started the race suffering from food poisoning and vomited inside his helmet during the first safety car period. When questioned by ITV's Louise Goodman about the race ending collision Webber commented: [...] "Well it's kids, isn't it. Kids with not enough experience, doing a good job then they fuck it all up," [...] Webber was particularly critical of Hamilton's driving that led to the accident, describing his antics as [...] "shit". Webber also stated the British press attacked him for criticising their [...] "golden boy" [...] Hamilton.|$|E

40|$|A {{well known}} {{sampling}} theorem states that a bandlimited function can be completely determined by its values at a uniformly <b>placed</b> <b>set</b> of points whose density {{is at least}} twice the highest frequency component of the function (Nyquist rate). A less familiar but important sampling theorem states that a bandlimited narrowband function can be completely determined by its values at a properly chosen, nonuniformly <b>placed</b> <b>set</b> of points whose density is at least twice the passband width. This allows for efficient digital demodulation of narrowband signals, which are common in sonar, radar and radio interferometry, without the side effect of signal group delay from an analog demodulator. This theorem was extended by developing a technique which allows a finite sum of bandlimited narrowband functions {{to be determined by}} its values at a properly chosen, nonuniformly <b>placed</b> <b>set</b> of points whose density can be made arbitrarily close to the sum of the passband widths...|$|R

2500|$|In 2013 South African artist Jonty Hurwitz {{created a}} chrome and resin {{anamorphic}} sculpture of Kaspar, the hotel's cat mascot, titled [...] "The 14th Guest", {{found at the}} entrance to the hotel's newest restaurant, Kaspar's Seafood Bar & Grill. Kaspar's story begins with the legend of an 1898 dinner at the Savoy given for 14 guests by Woolf Joel, a South African diamond tycoon. One of the diners was unable to attend, leaving the number of guests an unlucky 13, and another diner predicted that whoever first left the table would soon die. The first to leave was Joel, who was shot dead a few weeks later in Johannesburg. After this, the hotel offered to seat a member of its staff at tables of 13 to ward off bad luck. Finally, in 1926, the designer Basil Ionides sculpted a 3-foot high art-deco black cat called Kaspar, which is used as the 14th guest. Kaspar is given a full <b>place</b> <b>setting,</b> a napkin is tied around his neck, and he is served each course. Winston Churchill liked Ionides's Kaspar so much that he insisted that the sculpture join his parties of any size when dining at the Savoy.|$|E

For an hour he lay resting in the cool shade at the foot of the cliff. All about him reigned utter silence--the silence of the tomb. No fluttering birds, no humming insects, no scurrying reptiles relieved the deathlike stillness. This indeed was the valley of death. He felt the depressing influence of the horrible <b>place</b> <b>setting</b> down upon him; but he staggered to his feet, shaking himself like a great lion, for was he not still Tarzan, mighty Tarzan of the Apes? Yes, and Tarzan the mighty he would be until the last throb of that savage heart! ...|$|E
