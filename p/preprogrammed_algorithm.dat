40|$|The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) has {{as one of}} {{its primary}} goals the {{demonstration}} of the attractiveness of the spherical torus concept as a fusion power plant. Central to this goal is the achievement of high plasma {beta} (= 2 {micro}{sub 0 } /B{sup 2 } a measure of the efficiency of a magnetic plasma confinement system). It has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the maximum achievable {beta} is a strong function of both local and global plasma parameters. It is therefore important to optimize control of the plasma. To this end a phased development plan for digital plasma control on NSTX is presented. The relative level of sophistication of the control system software and hardware will be increased according {{to the demands of the}} experimental program in a three phase plan. During Day 0 (first plasma), a simple coil current control algorithm will initiate plasma operations. During the second phase (Day 1) of plasma operations the control system will continue to use the <b>preprogrammed</b> <b>algorithm</b> to initiate plasma breakdown but will then change over to a rudimentary plasma control scheme based on linear combinations of measured plasma fields and fluxes. The third phase of NSTX plasma control system development will utilize the rtEFIT code, first used on DIII-D, to determine, in real-time, the full plasma equilibrium by inverting the Grad-Shafranov equation. The details of the development plan, including a description of the proposed hardware will be presented...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{test facility}} for solar {{heating and cooling}} has been constructed to evaluate the operation and performance of an LBLdeveloped solar controller that has promising commercial potential. The LBL controller {{was designed to be}} intermediate in performance between a simple differential thermostat and an on-line microprocessor. The PROM~based controller operates the solar system according to a <b>preprogrammed</b> <b>algorithm</b> that translates operating state conditions (fluid temperatures, switch positions, comparator outputs) into a set of operating instructions (open or close valves, turn pumps on or off). The operating algorithm can be changed by reprogramming or exchanging the plug-in integrated circuit component, or by changing the sensors selected for comparison. The experimental solar heating system can be operated using different control algorithms, input meteorological conditions, and output load demands. In FY 1979 the test facility became operational and initial testing began. Emphasis has been on refinement of system instrumentation and the development of necessary computer software to run the facility and perform data analysis. Preliminary energy balance experiments with the load and collector loops under microcomputer control were successfully completed in November 1979. Experiment modifications have been completed to permit variable-flow and proportional-flow control of the collector loop. A series of experimental comparisons of proportional and on/off collector loop strategies are planned using typical meteorological year data. The evaluation of configurations for combined domestic hot water and heating systems has begun to determine necessary experiment modifications to test one and two tank domestic hot water systems in combination with hydronic space heating systems. Other work has included the application of theoretical models to describe dynamic collector operation and building temperature response. Theoretical analysis of the energy collection performance of on/off and proportional flow control collector loop strategies has been completed. Papers have been presented at the Second System Simulation and Economics Conference held in January 1980 in San Diego. Technical program support activities, in cooperation with SERI and SAN, are continuing...|$|E

30|$|The game {{presented}} here could be realized by transmitting all data sensed by the smart {{objects to the}} mobile phone and processing it centrally. However, this would produce an unnecessary high load on the wireless network, leading to scalability problems and drawing more power than needed from the smart objects' batteries. <b>Preprogramming</b> the recognition <b>algorithms</b> onto the sensor nodes may be another solution, but it needlessly restricts the breadth of applications for which the smart objects can be used. With the Titan framework, a scalable and composable deployment of the applications in pervasive environments is enabled. Below, we describe {{the implementation of the}} game and characterize it.|$|R

The primary purpose is to provide flexibility in application through digital control of the important functions of the receiver. This permits the acquisition and demodulation of medium to very low data rates in widely varying communications environments and over a broad range of modulation schemes.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems {{in the field of}} robotics is path determination and motion planning. The project described in this paper focuses on path determination in a known environment. The goal is to enable a mobile robot to successfully navigate an environment according to a specified temporal logic formula. On a high level, temporal logic formulas can effectively provide the robot with directions on where and when to go. As part of this project, a program will be developed to formulate a continuous path plan that will fulfill the temporal logic formula supplied for the robot to follow. In this project, the ActivMedia Pioneer 3 -DX robot will be used. This robot model was chosen because it is preconfigured for basic navigation. <b>Preprogrammed</b> with <b>algorithms</b> for shortest path determination, obstacle avoidance, and localization, the Pioneer 3 -DX is also capable of new navigation techniques that can be programmed in C and C++. Maps of known environments can be generated by the Pioneer 3 -DX. A graphical user interface program will utilize these maps in conjunction with user supplied directions as expressed by a temporal logic formula to construct a path plan. The path determined by the progra...|$|R
40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this paper is how to enable a computer system to acquire facts about new domains from tutors who are experts in their respective fields, but who {{have little or no}} training in computer science. The information to be acquired is that needed to support question-answering activities. The basic acquisition approach is "learning by being told. " We have been especially interested in exploring the notion of simultaneously learning not only new concepts, but also the linguistic constructions used to express those concepts. As a research vehicle we have developed a system that is <b>preprogrammed</b> with deductive <b>algorithms</b> and a fixed set of syntactic/semantic rules covering a small subset of English. It has been endowed with sufficient seed concepts and seed vocabulary to support effective tutorial interaction. Furthermore, the system is capable of learning new concepts and vocabulary, and can apply its acquired knowledge in a prescribed range of problem-solving situations. ...|$|R
40|$|Physical Sciences Ins. (PSI) has {{developed}} compact, lightweight, low power instrumentation for in-situ {{monitoring of the}} orbital environment of spacecraft/payload systems {{and the effects of}} this environment on long-term degradation of specific materials and solar photovoltaic arrays. This instrumentation, which will be flown on STEP- 3 mission in October 1994, is especially suited for applications on small satellites. It is being developed under a BMDO-sponsored program called space-Active Modular Materials ExperimentS (SAMMES). SAMMES consists of four sensor modules, called Test Modules (TMs), and a controller, called the System Control Module (SCM). The TMs are 15 x 16 x 14 cm high, weigh 2. 6 - 3. 2 kg, and their electronics consume 4 - 8 watts power in operational mods. The SCM is 15 x 20 x 20 cm high, weighs 5. 2 kg, and consumes 9 watts in operational mods. The SCM and TMs are equipped with power-conserving quiescent modes; 1. 3 - 5. 3 watts for TMs and 2. 7 watts for the SCM. The four Test Modules are called Low Earth Orbit (LEO TM), CALorimeter (CAL TM), Temperature-controlled Quartz Crystal Microbalance/Actinometer (TQCM/ACT TM) and Solar PhotoVoltaic (SPV TM). The LEO module contains sensors for measuring space environment parameters such as atomic oxygen flux, and contaminant accretion, cumulative dose of ionizing radiation, solar irradiance, and local solar angle. The calorimeter module contains sensors (calorimeters) coated with materials whose long duration degradation in the space environment is to be evaluated on the STEP- 3 mission, e. g. thermal control paints and films, charge control coatings and optical coatings. The TQCM/ACT TM contains actinometers and TQCMs coated with test materials to accurately measure their erosion due to the atomic oxygen and charge particle environment. The SPV TM continuously monitors the current vs. voltage characteristics of solar cell samples to evaluate their degradation due to the radiation and contamination environment. The TMs are equipped with heaters for each test material sample to maintain its temperature at a fixed value or to vary it linearly. These heaters consume typically about 0. 5 watt each. The SCM communicates with the TMs via a MIL-SID- 1553 bus and with the spacecraft on 1553, RS 232 / 422 interfaces. The SCM controls the experiments by selecting TMs, sensors, setting test material temperatures, etc. It periodically polls the TMs for sensor data, puts them in the quiescent mode, and then goes into the quiescent mode itself. SAMMES is fully autonomous and can be run with minimal ground intervention. The SCM has several megabytes of RAM and EEPROM for data storage. It has the capability of performing onboard data reduction using <b>preprogrammed</b> or uploaded <b>algorithms...</b>|$|R
