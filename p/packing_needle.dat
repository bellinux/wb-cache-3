Sykes), refused his sanction, alleging as a no-reason," [...] et seq. [FN#2] The vagrant, the merchant, and the philosopher, amongst Orientals, are frequently united in the same person. [FN#3] In a communication made to the Royal Geographical Society, and published in the 24th vol. of the Journal, I have given my reasons for naturalising this word. It {{will be used in}} the following pages to express a [...] "hill water-course, which rolls a torrent after rain, and is either partially or wholly dry during the droughts."

[...] This truth has been disputed, but now it is generally acknowledged. [FN#5] A French traveller, the Viscount Escayrac de Lanture, was living at Cairo as a native of the East, and preparing for a pilgrimage when I was similarly engaged. Unfortunately he went to Damascus, where some disturbance compelled him to resume his nationality. The only European I have met with who visited Meccah without apostatising, is M. Bertolucci, Swedish Consul at Cairo. This gentleman persuaded the Badawin camel men who were accompanying him to Taif to introduce him in disguise: he naïvely owns that his terror of discovery prevented his making any observations. Dr. George A. Wallin, of Finland, performed the Hajj in 1845; but his [...] "somewhat perilous position, and the filthy company of Persians," [...] were effectual obstacles to his taking notes. [FN#6] No one felt the want of this [...] "silent friend," [...] more than myself; for though Eastern Arabia would not have been strange to me, the Western regions were a terra incognita. Through Dr. Norton Shaw, Secretary to the Royal Geographical Society, I addressed a paper full of questions to Dr. Wallin, professor of Arabic at the University of Helsingfors. But that adventurous traveller and industrious Orienta1ist was then, as we afterwards heard with sorrow, no more; so the queries remained unanswered. In these pages I have been careful to solve all the little financial and domestic difficulties, so perplexing to the [...] "freshman," [...] whom circumstances compel to conceal his freshness from the prying eyes of friends. [FN#7] [...] "Then came Trafalgar: would that Nelson had known the meaning of that name! it would have fixed a smile upon his dying lips!" [...] so says the Rider through the Nubian Desert, giving us in a foot note the curious information that [...] "Trafalgar" [...] is an Arabic word, which means the [...] "Cape of Laurels." [...] Trafalgar is nothing but a corruption of Tarf al-Gharb-the side or skirt of the West; it being the most occidental point then reached by Arab conquest. [FN#8] In Arabic [...] "Ras al-Tin," [...] the promontory upon which immortal Pharos once stood. It is so called from the argile there found and which supported an old pottery. [FN#9] [...] "Praise be to Allah, Lord of the (three) worlds!" [...] a pious ejaculation, which leaves the lips of the True Believer on all occasions of concluding actions. [FN#10] [...] "Bakhshish," [...] says a modern writer, [...] "is a fee or present which the Arabs (he here means the Egyptians, who got the word from the Persians through the Turks,) claim on all occasions for services you render them, as well as for services they have rendered you. A doctor visits a patient gratis-the patient or his servant will ask for a bakhshish (largesse); you employ, pay, clothe, and feed a child-the father will demand his bakhshish; you may save the life of an Arab, at the risk of your own, and he will certainly claim a bakhshish. This bakhshish, in fact, is a sort of alms or tribute, which the poor Arab believes himself entitled to claim from every respectable-looking person." [...] [FN#11] Mafish, [...] "there is none," [...] equivalent to, [...] "I have left my purse at home." [...] Nothing takes the Oriental mind so much as a retort alliterative or jingling. An officer in the Bombay army (Colonel Hamerton) once saved himself from assault and battery by informing a furious band of natives, that under British rule [...] "harakat na hui, barakat hui," [...] "blessing hath there been to you; bane there hath been none." [...] [FN#12] In a coarser sense [...] "kayf" [...] is app1ied to all manner of intoxication. Sonnini is not wrong when he says, [...] "the Arabs give the name of Kayf to the voluptuous relaxation, the delicious stupor, produced by the smoking of hemp." [...] [FN#13] Cleopatra's Needle is called by the native Ciceroni [...] "Masallat Firaun," [...] Pharaoh's <b>packing</b> <b>needle.</b> What Solomon, and the Jinnis and Sikandar zu'l karnain (Alexander of Macedon), are to other Moslem lands, such is Pharaoh to Egypt, the [...] "Caesar aut Diabolus" [...] of the Nile. The ichneumon becomes [...] "Pharaoh's cat,"-even the French were bitten and named it, le rat de Pharaon; the prickly pear, [...] "Pharaoh's fig;" [...] the guinea-worm, [...] "Pharaoh's worm;" [...] certain unapproachable sulphur springs, [...] "Pharaoh's bath;" [...] a mausoleum at Petra, [...] "Pharaoh's palace;" [...] the mongrel race now inhabiting the valley of the Nile is contemptuously named by Turks and Arabs [...] "Jins Firaun," [...] or [...] "Pharaoh's Breed;" [...] and a foul kind of vulture (vultur percnopterus, ak baba of the Turks, and ukab of Sind), [...] "Pharaoh's hen." [...] This abhorrence of Pharaoh is, however, confined to the vulgar and the religious. The philosophers and mystics of Al-Islam, in their admiration of his impious daring, make him equal, and even superior, to Moses. Sahil, a celebrated Sufi, declares that the secret of the soul (i.e., its emanation) was first revealed when Pharaoh declared himself a god. And Al-Ghazali sees in such temerity nothing but the most noble aspiration to the divine, innate in the human, spirit. (Dabistan, vol. iii.) [FN#14] [Greek text] [...] "Quid novi fert Africa?" [...] said the Romans. [...] "In the same season Fayoles, tetrarch of Numidia, sent from the land of Africa to Grangousier, the most hideously great mare that was ever seen; for you know well enough how it is said, that ‘Africa always is productive of some new thing.'" [...] [FN#15] Alexandria, moreover, is an interesting place to Moslems, on account of the prophecy that it will succeed to the honours of Meccah, when the holy city falls {{into the hands of the}} infidel. In its turn Alexandria will be followed by Kairawan (in the Regency of Tunis); and this by Rashid or Rosetta, which last shall endure to the end of time. [FN#16] A Persian as opposed to an Arab. [FN#17] A priest, elder, chieftain, language-master, private-tutor, &c., &c. [FN#18] The Persians place the Prophet's tomb at Susan or Sus, described by Ibn Haukal (p. 76). The readers of Ibn Batutah may think it strange that the learned and pious traveller in his account of Alexandria (chap. 2.) makes no allusion to the present holy deceased that distinguish the city. All the saints are now clear forgotten. For it is the fate of saints, like distinguished sinners, to die twice. [FN#19] The Mandal is that form of Oriental divination which owes its present celebrity in Europe to Mr. Lane. Both it and the magic mirror are hackneyed subjects, but I have been tempted to a few words concerning them in another part of these volumes. Meanwhile I request the reader not to set me down as a mere charlatan; medicine in the East is so essentially united with superstitious practices, that he who would pass for an expert practitioner, must necessarily represent himself an [...] "adept." [...] [FN#20] Hence the origin, I believe, of the Chronothermal System, a discovery which physic owes to my old friend, the late Dr. Samuel Dickson. [FN#21] The Persian [...] "Mister." [...] In future chapters the reader will see the uncomfortable consequences of my having appeared in Egypt as a Persian. Although I found out the mistake, and worked hard to correct it, the bad name stuck to me; bazar reports fly quicker and hit harder than newspaper paragraphs. [FN#22] Arab Christians sometimes take the name of [...] "Abdullah," [...] servant of Allah-"which," [...] as a modern traveller observes, [...] "all sects and religions might be equally proud to adopt." [...] The Moslem Prophet said, [...] "the names most approved of God are Abdullah, Abd-al-rahman (Slave of the Compassionate), and such like." [...] [FN#23] [...] "King in-the-name-of-Allah," [...] a kind of Oriental [...] "Praise-God-Barebones."

40|$|Montane {{red spruce}} (Picea rubens Sarg.) {{in the northeastern}} United States has {{undergone}} a decline {{during the past two}} decades. One symptom associated with the decline syndrome is the episodic browning of first-year foliage in early spring. To examine the potential role of winter desiccation in this browning, the water relations of red spruce foliage in a subalpine forest on Mt. Moosilauke, New Hampshire, USA, were monitored from January to May, 1989. All sampled trees lost water during the winter and the first-year foliage on some trees turned brown in early spring. The relative water content of first-year shoots during the winter {{was a significant predictor of}} spring browning; red spruce trees that showed browning had desiccated faster and reached lower relative water contents. Damaged trees also had more closely <b>packed</b> <b>needles</b> and lower cuticular resistances to water loss. The first-year shoots had a significantly lower average relative water content than older shoots before and after browning. Cuticular resistance to water loss decreased with elevation. Sun-exposed shoots lost more water than shaded shoots because of solar heating of needles. Winter desiccation can occur before the decline-related spring browning of red spruce foliage...|$|R

40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} commonly {{interact with}} eukaryotic host cells using type III secretion systems (TTSSs or secretons), which comprise cytoplasmic, transmembrane and extracellular domains. The extracellular domain is a hollow needle-like structure protruding 60 nm beyond the bacterial surface. The TTSS is activated to transfer bacterial proteins {{directly into a}} host cell only upon physical contact with the target cell. We showed previously that the monomer of the Shigella flexneri needle, MxiH, assembles into a helical structure with parameters similar to those defining {{the architecture of the}} extracellular components of bacterial flagella. By analogy with flagella, which are known to exist in different helical states, we proposed that changes in the helical <b>packing</b> of the <b>needle</b> might be used to sense host cell contact. Here, we show that, on the contrary, mutations within MxiH that lock the TTSS into altered secretion states do not detectably alter the helical <b>packing</b> of <b>needles.</b> This implies that either: (1) host cell contact is signalled through the TTSS via helical changes in the needle that are significantly smaller than those linked to structural changes in the flagellar filament and therefore too small to be detected by our analysis methods or (2) that signal transduction in this system occurs via a novel molecular mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Various needle trap devices (NTDs) with {{different}} designs for different applications {{have been developed}} during the past decade. A theoretical model on the fundamentals of the NTD was recently proposed, which employed the theory of frontal (gas-solid) chromatography to describe the sampling process, where a gaseous sample was continuously introduced into the sorbent bed. In this investigation, different types of sorbent particles {{with different}} dimensions were <b>packed</b> into the <b>needle</b> as adsorbents. The effect of particle dimension, which would affect the packing density and consequently the capacity, the extraction efficiency, and desorption efficiency of the NTD were experimentally investigated and the proposed theory was validated. The results demonstrated that NTDs packed with small particles possess higher extraction capacity and efficiency but much higher resistance to flow as well. The higher resistance did not necessarily result in poor desorption efficiency, because desorption efficiency was affected by both the sorbent bed structure and the desorption gas flow. The relationships observed among those physical parameters provide valuable guidance on how to design an NTD with high performance potential for future applications. For particulate sampling, {{it was found that}} NTDs packed with different particles presented high collection efficiency of the particulates being investigated, and the collection efficiency was dominated by the pore size and distribution of the sorbent bed <b>packed</b> inside the <b>needle.</b> Collection efficiency also increased with increase in solidity of the sorbent bed; the increase in humidity of the aerosol sample; and the decrease of sampling rate. The results also provide valuable guidance on the optimisation of needle trap for particulate collection...|$|R
40|$|Clay, quartz and {{feldspar}} {{are widely}} available in Uganda. The location and properties of various clay deposits are reported in the literature, but little is reported on feldspar and quartz deposits. In this work an extended literature on ceramics and porcelains in particular, is documented. Samples from two deposits of feldspar and two deposits of quartz are characterised and found to possess requisite properties for making porcelain insulators. Sample porcelain bodies are made from materials collected from selected deposits using different mixing proportions of clay, feldspar and quartz. Their properties in relation to workability, firing temperature, dielectric and bending strengths are studied. It is found that a mixture consisting of 30 % Mutaka kaolin, 15 % Mukono ball clay, 30 % Mutaka feldspar and 25 % Lido beach flint yields a body with highest mechanical strength (72 MPa) and dielectric strength (19 kV/mm) when fired at 1250 °C. The strength (both mechanical and dielectric) is found to decrease with increasing firing temperature. At high firing temperatures, the undissolved quartz in the body decreased, the glass content increases and pores are formed.

40|$|Mast. saplings {{growing in}} sun and shade in a snowy subalpine parkland in central Japan were {{assessed}} to infer how saplings acclimate to suppression by larger individuals in a conifer clump and to extremely snowy conditions. Sun and shade sap-lings produced structurally different current-year shoots, and allocated biomass to needles and stem differently. Compared with sun saplings, shoots of shade saplings had lower needle mass per unit shoot size, which indicates less dense <b>needle</b> <b>packing</b> {{and more effective}} use of the limited available light by avoiding mutual shading among needles. Biomass allocation within lateral branches also differed between sun and shade saplings. Compared with sun saplings, needle mass was a smaller proportion of total branch mass in shade saplings al-though shade saplings retained needles for longer, thereby compensating, in part, for their lower annual production of needles. Thus shade saplings incur a high mechanical cost to support their low-light acclimated, conspicuously flattened crowns in this snowy habitat. Suppressed saplings are an im-portant component of the persistent conifer clumps in snowy subalpine parklands.

40|$|Combining {{headspace}} (HS) sampling with a needle-trap device (NTD) {{to determine}} priority {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) in water samples results in improved sensitivity and efficiency when compared to conventional static HS sampling. A 22 gauge stainless steel, 51 -mm <b>needle</b> <b>packed</b> with Tenax TA and Carboxen 1000 particles is used as the NTD. Three different HS-NTD sampling methodologies are evaluated and all give limits of detection for the target VOCs in the ng L− 1 range. Active (purge-and-trap) HS-NTD sampling is found to give the best sensitivity but requires exhaustive control of the sampling conditions. The use of the NTD to collect the headspace gas sample results in a combined adsorption/desorption mechanism. The testing of different temperatures for the HS thermostating reveals a greater desorption effect when the sample is allowed to diffuse, whether passively or actively, through the sorbent particles. The limits of detection obtained in the simplest sampling methodology, static HS-NTD (5 mL aqueous sample in 20 mL HS vials, thermostating at 50 °C for 30 min with agitation), are sufficiently low as to permit its application {{to the analysis of}} 18 priority VOCs in natural and waste waters.

40|$|Larch (Larex decidua Mill.) is {{an early}} {{successional}} tree species of glacial sediments and valley side-slopes at treeline in the Swiss Alps. In such areas, the needles from this deciduous conifer are a dominant source of particulate organic matter to springs and streams of glacial floodplains. We examined the breakdown of larch needles in 5 stream types of a glacial floodplain in the Swiss Alps in relation to macroinvertebrates, aquatic fungi, and litter nutrient concentrations. The 5 streams ranged from a physically harsh pro-glacial (kryal) stream that lacked significant input of terrestrially derived particulate organic matter to a stable side-slope springbrook that flowed through a mixed larch/pine forest with alder also present in the riparian zone. We hypothesized that needle breakdown (as a surrogate of ecosystem function) would be significantly faster in the springbrook than in the other streams, reflecting differences in macroinvertebrate and fungal assemblages present among streams. Although needle breakdown was generally slow, especially relative to alder leaves, parameters of litter breakdown were indeed higher in the springbrook than in the other streams. Concentrations of nutrients (N and P) found in decomposing needles were 2 to 4 x higher in the springbrook than in the other streams. Ergosterol levels (a measure of fungal biomass) in needles were 4 x greater in the springbrook than for needles in the kryal and main channel sites. Last, abundances of macroinvertebrates colonizing <b>needle</b> <b>packs,</b> shredders in particular, {{were higher in the}} springbrook and a side-channel site than in the other stream types.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest in environmental analysis among the scientific community. Monitoring of organic and inorganic environmental pollutants and investigations into their potential to adversely affect human health has prompted {{the development of new}} methodologies for environmental analysis. Generally, the analytical procedure is comprised of several steps, such as sample collection, sample preparation, analysis, and data processing. Sample preparation is a critical step in the development of new methodologies, and considered the main source of uncertainty in the analysis of environmental samples. In this context, several sample preparation techniques have been recently developed and optimized with aims to miniaturize extraction, automate procedures, and reduce or circumvent solvent consumption. The currently presented research focused on further development and novel applications of two sample preparation methods, solid phase microextraction (SPME) and needle trap devices (NT). Solid phase microextraction (SPME) combines sampling, sample preparation, and sample introduction in one step. Analytical sampling by SPME has been employed in a variety of environmental applications. To quantify target analyte content, different calibration approaches can be performed based on the application process. This method is an equilibrium-based sample preparation technique that due to its currently presented configuration provides only information related to free molecules in gas phase. Conversely, the needle trap device, which contains a sorbent <b>packed</b> inside a <b>needle,</b> is an exhaustive, solventless, one-step sample preparation technique that can be easily calibrated. In addition, this approach eliminates errors associated with sample transportation and storage, which can consequently result in more accurate and precise analytical data. This technique is also useful {{for a wide variety of}} applications, including sample preparation of compounds with different chemical and physical properties, as well as varying volatilities. Furthermore, NT is a valuable sample preparation technique that, based on its geometry, allows it to act as a filter for collection of particles. The initial part of this research focused on new developments in the geometry of needle trap devices. Subsequently, particular attention was dedicated to the principles of collection efficiency as well as particle trapping mechanisms for filtration of particulate matter and aerosols by NTs. Finally, this thesis presents a joint application of NT and SPME for determination of target analytes in gaseous and particulate phases. The first part of this thesis provides a thorough evaluation of new prototypes of the extended tip needle trap device (NT), and a summary of their application towards in vivo sampling of biological emissions, as well as active/passive on-site sampling of indoor air. To increase desorption efficiency, the newly proposed NT device was constructed with a side hole above the sorbent and an extended tip that fits inside the restriction of the narrow neck liner. The commercial prototype <b>needles</b> were <b>packed</b> with divinylbenzene particles and evaluated in terms of robustness after multiple uses, as well as extracted amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Successively, <b>needles</b> were <b>packed</b> in-lab with synthesized highly cross-linked PDMS as a frit to immobilize carboxen (Car) particles. The performance of <b>needles</b> <b>packed</b> with PDMS and Car were then compared in regards to different flow rates. For passive sampling, the <b>needles</b> were <b>packed</b> with Car particles embedded in PDMS in order to simplify calculations in passive mode. Good performance was obtained using the NT devices as spot samplers, as well as passive samplers under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Commercial modified prototypes of NT were used to study biogenic emissions of pine trees. The new lab-made NT was then applied in the analysis of indoor air in a polymer synthesis laboratory in both active and passive approaches. Additionally, this thesis presents work conducted on the development and evaluation of an appropriate frit for NT devices. In order to investigate the feasibility of the NT device for analysis of nanometer-sized particles in high efficiency, three different filters, nanofibrous filter, porous membrane, and granular filter, were used to entrap dioctyl phthalate particles of diameters ranging between 10 - 200 nm. Subsequently, a series of experiments were carried out to estimate and compare the collection efficiency and pressure drop of the above mentioned filters. The effect of face velocity, fiber thickness, and fiber-packing density on filtration efficiency was also evaluated for each filter. The data showed that the efficiency curves for different filters demonstrated a lower efficiency for particle of sizes ranging between 40 to 60 nm, and at a face velocity of 17 cm/s. Calculated theoretical values based on the filtration model showed good agreement with the experimental data. This study demonstrated that use of the nanofibrous filter led to a significant improvement in the filtration efficiency of the NT device. Nevertheless, the proposed porous membrane was chosen as an appropriate filter instead for subsequent studies due to its relative simplicity of <b>packing</b> through the <b>needle</b> trap devices and high reproducibility in regards to packing procedure in comparison to the nanofribrous filter, which has high efficiency and poor reproducibility. Finally, needle-trap (NT) devices were applied in conjunction with solid phase microextraction (SPME) towards the measurement of free and particle-bound fragrances derived from personal care products. In order to simulate in-use exposure scenarios, the experiments were conducted in a specially constructed 0. 1 m 3 chamber configured to simulate in-use conditions in a bathroom. The perfumed body spray was introduced to the chamber in three second bursts to mimic typical consumer use. The produced aerosol was then continuously monitored using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) to determine the number and size of particles; characterization of the aerosol size distribution is an important factor when considering risk assessment, as particles < 7 µm are considered respirable and those of size < 20 µm inhalable. Needle trap devices using a range of packing materials were evaluated for measurement of total concentrations of target analytes, while free concentrations of the fragrance present in the aerosol spray were determined concurrently by SPME based on the external calibration method. The results showed similar concentration trends with the same sampling devices over different days...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study aims {{to provide}} a {{national}} picture of the extent and nature of public health services commissioned by local authorities (LAs) from community pharmacies across England in financial year 2014 / 15. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of public health services commissioned in community pharmacies by LAs, gathered via freedom of information requests and documentary analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All 152 LAs in England. RESULTS: A total of 833 commissioned services were reported across England (range 3 - 10 per LA). Four services were commissioned by over 90 % of LAs: emergency hormonal contraception (EHC), smoking cessation support, supervised consumption of methadone or other opiates and needle and syringe programmes (NSPs). The proportion of pharmacies commissioned to deliver these services varied considerably between LAs from < 10 %[*]to 100 %. This variation {{was not related to}} differences in relevant proxy measures of need. NHS Health Checks and alcohol screening and brief advice were commissioned by fewer LAs (32 % and 15 %,[*]respectively), again with no relationship to relevant measures of need. A range of other services were commissioned less frequently, by fewer than 10 % of LAs. Supervised consumption and NSPs were the most frequently used services, with over 4. 4 [*]million individual supervisions and over 1. 4 [*]million <b>needle</b> <b>packs</b> supplied. Pharmacies provided over 200 [*] 000 consultations for supply of EHC, over 30 [*] 000 supplies of free condoms and almost 16 [*] 000 chlamydia screening kits.

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{extended}} literature survey on ceramics and porcelains in particular, has been documented. Samples from two Ugandan deposits of each feldspar and quartz were characterised {{by means of}} X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, chemical analysis and scanning electron microscopy and found to possess requisite properties for making electro porcelain insulators. Five porcelain bodies were formulated and samples were fabricated from materials collected from selected deposits in Uganda using different mixing proportions of clay, feldspar and quartz. The properties of the formulated bodies were studied in relation to workability, firing temperature, dielectric and bending strengths. The strengths (both mechanical and dielectric) were found to decrease as the firing temperature was increased above 1250 °C. Additionally, ten formulations with components {{in the range of}} 30 - 60 % clay, 20 - 45 % feldspar and 20 - 25 % sand were prepared. Specimens for mechanical and physical characterisation were made using the plastic extrusion method. The samples were characterised in terms of constituent oxide composition, flexural strength, fracture toughness, dielectric strength along with microstructural and phase properties using ICP-AES analyses, 4 -point load bending strength test, Vicker’s indentation method, SEM and XRD analyses respectively. XRD studies revealed that the crystalline phases formed were mullite and quartz and their intensity was almost identical for all samples fired at 1250 °C but there was a decrease inquartz content as temperature was increased above 1250 °C. Samples with 20 % sandcontent resulted in higher density, MOR and fracture toughness compared to thosecontaining 25 % sand. Mullite content on the other hand did not change at temperatures above 1200 °C but there were significant differences in the morphologies of the mullite crystals in the samples. Optimum mechanical and electrical properties were found at maximum vitrification and a microstructure showing small closely <b>packed</b> mullite <b>needles.</b> This occurred at a firing temperature of 1250 °C. Three promising porcelain formulations from the above investigations were chosen and five glazes formulated to fit on biscuit fired specimens. The best-fitting glaze was adopted. The formulated specimens were investigated using dilatometry, Steger test, FEG-SEM, XRD, 4 -point bending, dielectric strength and fracture toughness tests. A porcelain specimen consisting of 68 % SiO 2, 19 % Al 2 O 3, 4. 7 % K 2 O and a glaze of Seger formula RO: 0. 57 Al 2 O 3 : 4. 86 SiO 2 exhibited MOR of 105 MPa with Weibull modulus of 5. 6 and a dielectric strength of 18 kV/mm upon firing at a heating rate of 6 ºC/min to 1250 ºC, soaking for 2 h at the top temperature and cooling down to 500 °C at a rate of 6 °C/min, followed by furnace cooling. The microstructure of the high strength specimen exhibited round mullite needles, quartz and glass. Holding samples for 2 h at peak temperature resulted in a 22 % increase in MOR compared to 1 h holding. Glazing further improved strength by 67 % for the best sample. Compressive stresses in glaze contributed to the strengthening effect. The dielectric and mechanical strengths obtained make the ormulated sample suitable for application in low voltage electrical insulation. QC 2010060...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Branches {{of adult}} Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees were sampled from boreal dry pine forests to study needle longevity, its {{variation}} {{and its relation}} to other shoot characteristics. The stands studied were located along transects from two smelters and one city, e. g. along gradients of pollution impact. Constant needle age structures were assumed and static life-tables generated. Mean needle longevity was calculated as the sum of the proportions of living needle fascicles on the successive annual shoots. It fully incorporated the information of the static life-tables and was preferred to median or maximum ages because of its significantly lower variation. The first half of the shedding span, the duration of the period when the needle survival gradually dropped from 90 to 50 %, proved to validly reflect the changes in the needle age structure. Needle longevity decreased 15 - 40 % towards the pollution sources along the transects studied. Near the smelters, needle longevity decreased with the increasing needle Fe, or Fe, Ni and Cu concentration that represented the main constituents of the airborne particle emissions. Near the city, needle longevity decreased with the increasing needle N and P concentrations, annual needle mass and <b>needle</b> mass <b>packing</b> and decreasing <b>needle</b> area <b>packing.</b> In the urban forests, needle Mg, P and K concentrations decreased linearly with the decreasing needle survival from the second to the fourth needle age class. Concentrations in the living needles of the fourth age class stayed over 80 % of the average for all the age classes, though needle survival dropped below 50 %. A decreasing needle Mn concentration was detected towards all the emission sources. Leaching, especially from the soil, as a possible cause was discussed. Needle longevity had the lowest variation among the shoot characteristics, which increases its value as a tool in ecological monitoring. Low plasticity in needle longevity could be an acclimation to the ambient environmental conditions and length of the growing season and to maximise the carbon gain per time. Needle longevity decreased and annual needle mass and leaf mass per area increased upwards in the crowns of mature Scots pines, reflecting the acclimation to irradiance...|$|R
