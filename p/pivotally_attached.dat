50|$|Vertical lift {{conveyors}} contain two adjacent, parallel conveyors for simultaneous {{upward movement}} of adjacent {{surfaces of the}} parallel conveyors. One of the conveyors normally has spaced apart flites for transporting bulk food items. The dual conveyors rotate in opposite directions, but are operated from one gear box to ensure equal belt speed. One of the conveyors is pivotally hinged to the other conveyor for swinging the <b>pivotally</b> <b>attached</b> conveyor away from the remaining conveyor {{for access to the}} facing surfaces of the parallel conveyors. Vertical lift conveyors can be manually or automatically loaded and controlled. Almost all vertical conveyors can be systematically integrated with horizontal conveyors, since both of these conveyor systems work in tandem to create a cohesive material handling assembly line.|$|E
40|$|An {{aircraft}} {{including a}} single fuselage having a main wing and a horizontal stabilizer airfoil <b>pivotally</b> <b>attached</b> at their centers to the fuselage is described. The pivotal attachments allow the airfoils to be yawed {{relative to the}} fuselage for high speed flight, and to be positioned {{at right angles with}} respect to the fuselage during takeoff, landing, and low speed flight. The main wing and the horizontal stabilizer are upwardly curved from their center pivotal connections towards their ends to form curvilinear dihedrals...|$|E
40|$|A robot and {{robot system}} that {{are capable of}} {{functioning}} in a zero-gravity environment are provided. The robot can include a body having a longitudinal axis and having a control unit and a power source. The robot can include a first leg pair including a first leg and a second leg. Each leg of the first leg pair can be <b>pivotally</b> <b>attached</b> to the body and constrained to pivot in a first leg pair plane that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} is {{a robotic}} joint which is operated by inflatable bladders and {{which can be}} used in applications where it is desired to move or hold an object. A support block supports an elongated plate to which is <b>pivotally</b> <b>attached</b> a finger. A tension strip passes over a lever attached to the finger and is attached at its ends to the support block {{on opposite sides of the}} plate. Bladders positioned between the plate and the tension strip on opposite sides of the plate can be inflated by pumps to pivot the finger, with one of the bladders being inflated while the other is being deflated...|$|E
40|$|A {{landing pad}} system is {{described}} for absorbing {{horizontal and vertical}} impact forces upon engagement with a landing surface where circumferentially arranged landing struts respectively have a clevis which receives a slidable rod member and where the upper portion of a slidable rod member is coupled to the clevis by friction washers which are force fit onto the rod member to provide for controlled constant force energy absorption when the rod member moves relative to the clevis. The {{lower end of the}} friction rod is <b>pivotally</b> <b>attached</b> by a ball and socket to a support plate where the support plate is arranged to slide in a transverse direction relative to a housing which contains an energy absorption material for absorbing energy in a transverse direction...|$|E
