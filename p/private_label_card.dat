It is carried amidst the transformations {{made possible by the}} economic growth and social development of Brazil over the last decade, and has special attention to the income group popularly known in the country as “C and D Classes”, or “the new middle class”. The offer of credit to this new emergent market is studied through a critical perspective, using elements of Baudrillard (1995) to better understand the creation of demand for consumer goods, and analyzing the repercussions of a managerial interpretation of the Bottom of the Pyramid idea of Prahalad and Hart. Both the public policy of credit stimulus of the last three Brazilian governments and the actions of corporations from the credit market are analyzed.

40|$|Nowadays {{two major}} <b>private</b> <b>label</b> {{development}} models are often {{applied to the}} retail industry. They are same <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand name (SPLB) model and different <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand name (DPLB) model. On the one hand, in the SPLB model, the brand names between retail stores and the <b>private</b> <b>label</b> products are same. On the other hand, retailers from some countries are likely to adopt the DPLB model where they name their <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands differently. However, the above <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand strategies raise two issues. Firstly, how do consumers change their attitudes toward a store and its <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands, especially when a high image store carries high image <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands only versus a high image store carries both high and low image <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands? Similarly, how do consumers change their attitudes toward a store and its <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands, especially when a low image store carries low image <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands only versus a low image store carries both low and high image <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands? Secondly, how do consumers change their attitudes toward a store and its <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands, especially under the SPLB model versus the DPLB model? Therefore, {{the aim of this}} paper is to investigate the impact of consistent (vs. inconsistent) images between a store and its <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands on consumers’ attitudes toward the store with its <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands under the SPLB and the DPLB models. Our empirical findings revealed that consumers generated more (or less) favourable attitudes toward a low (or high) image store that not only carried its low (or high) image <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands but also high (or low) image <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands. This finding was generally consistent with the implications of the averaging process view. The study provided an additional result which indicated that perceived <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand variety seem to have a significant positive impact on consumers’ attitudes toward the low image store. Results did not provide any significant moderating effects of <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand models on consumers’ attitudes toward a store with its <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands...|$|R

No significant relationship was found between <b>private</b> <b>label</b> purchase and the level of <b>private</b> <b>label</b> couponing activity. Although increasing <b>private</b> <b>label</b> couponing has no impact on increasing <b>private</b> <b>label</b> purchase, a strong negative relationship was found between national brand manufacturer couponing activity and <b>private</b> <b>label</b> purchase decision. Therefore, national brand couponing appears to be an effective strategy for manufacturers to deter the <b>private</b> <b>label</b> growth in the processed cheese market. retail promotion, coupon, <b>private</b> <b>label,</b> cheese consumption, probit, endogenous explanatory variable, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this study has been to examine if brand name strategy influences the perceived quality of <b>private</b> <b>label</b> grocery brands. The brand name strategy details how the <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand name {{is connected to the}} retailer brand, and the purpose is to understand if the choice of phantom, chain or chain endorsed brand names for <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands has an effect on quality evaluations. The study has also examined if retailer image, <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand proneness and <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand knowledge influences this relationship. This study has examined <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands in the Norwegian grocery market. <b>Private</b> <b>label</b> brands have evolved from no-frill generics to brands in their own right, with retailers now offering <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> that equal or surpass national brands in terms of quality and value. Previous research on <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> and quality has not examined the effect of a specific brand name, and this study therefore contributes to the research literature.

The overall findings {{of this study indicate that}} there is a relationship between the brand name strategy and the perceived quality of the <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand product.

For the consumer, <b>private</b> <b>label</b> represents the opportunity to purchase quality food and non-food products at savings compared to manufacturer brands. <b>Private</b> <b>label</b> items consist of the same or even better ingredients than the manufacturer brands, and because the retailers name or symbol is on the package, the consumer is assured that the product meets the retailers quality standards. <b>Private</b> <b>labels</b> can be divided in three categories: economic, standard and exclusive.

40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>labels</b> {{have become}} {{a major force in}} the global grocery market yet their market {{penetration}} varies between countries, retailers and product categories. Researchers have investigated consumer, retailer and market factors in a bid to identify and explain the determinants of <b>private</b> <b>label</b> success. While retailer differentiation has been recognised for some time as a key motivation for <b>private</b> <b>labels,</b> the link between retail image and <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> is currently receiving greater attention with the rise of the concept of retailer as brand. This concept is associated with major grocery retailers in developed European markets moving to enhance their overall image by coordinating all aspects of their operations, including their <b>private</b> <b>labels.</b> Although the wider store image literature suggests that store image and brand image are interdependent, only more recently has there been research of the role of store image in attitudes to <b>private</b> <b>labels.</b> This research addresses the gap in the literature by replicating and extending Collins-Dodd & Lindley’s (2003) (CDL) empirical study on the influence of store image on the perceptions of specific <b>private</b> <b>labels.</b> The New Zealand market context for the research allowed the relationship to be examined at two retail chain stores, both of which offered the same two <b>private</b> <b>labels.</b> The research confirms that store image is positively associated with attitudes to <b>private</b> <b>labels,</b> but finds that the nature of the store image determinants and their effect depend on both the retailer and the <b>private</b> <b>label.</b> Only weak support is found for CDL’s conclusion that attitudes to <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> are related to the unique positioning of stores. Rather, the quality of the store’s wider product assortment is the major determinant of attitude to <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> regardless of the store. These findings are at odds with the differentiation motive for <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> and point to the need for both practitioners and researchers to examine the ‘fit’ between store positioning and <b>private</b> <b>label</b> positioning. For retailers, the findings also highlight consumer reliance on extrinsic cues in the assessment of <b>private</b> <b>label</b> products, suggesting the need to reduce perceived <b>private</b> <b>label</b> risk. For researchers, the findings also suggest that store image should be incorporated in models predicting consumer proneness to <b>private</b> <b>labels...</b>|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in <b>private</b> <b>label</b> products in the food industry {{and it has become}} an important strategy for food retailers to own and manage their own <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands. <b>Private</b> <b>labels</b> have become a more popular topic to investigate, although so far, not much attention has been given towards the potential impacts <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> have on innovation. The focus of this thesis was therefore to analyze <b>private</b> <b>label</b> competition and the effects <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> have on innovation in the food industry.

40|$|This {{research}} provides {{insight into}} consumer perceptions of multiple <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands being simultaneously offered {{by an individual}} retailer. The primary {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the current consumer perceptions of the three <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands at Pick n Pay Stores, a South African retailer. Consumers are no longer being presented with a single <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand, but individual grocery retailers offer multiple <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands under one retailer. Pick n Pay Store’s current <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands co-exist as PnP no name, PnP and PnP Finest, and are synonymous with the generic, classic, and premium <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand concepts, respectively. The question can thus be posed whether consumers perceive <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands differently and whether they will eventually purchase the <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand. The research explores the subject of brand, and the nature and success factors of <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands in retail. This was done by reviewing the literature that traced the rapid changes in the retail sector because of the increasing influence of <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands on conventional retail practices and consumer behaviour. A conceptual framework was developed showing the constructs that may have relationships with the three <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands of Pick n Pay Stores. Information regarding the different <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brand concepts was obtained from primary as well as secondary research. An empirical study of a quantitative nature in the form of a paper-based and online-based questionnaire was undertaken. Altogether 375 usable questionnaires were collected. The results of the empirical study indicated positive relationships of perceptions between all three of the Pick n Pay <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands and their respective intention to purchase. Furthermore, there was a statistically positive relationship between the brand perceptions of Pick n Pay <b>private</b> <b>label</b> brands.
