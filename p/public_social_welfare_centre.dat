50|$|Prior to 1986, {{there was}} no {{structured}} reception for asylum seekers in Belgium. The federal government considered the <b>Public</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Centres</b> responsible for this and paid for their support services. In 1986, Belgium saw a steep {{rise in the number}} of asylum requests, owing in part to conflicts in Eastern Europe, Iraq and Iran, Ethiopia and Eritrea, which were displacing great waves of refugees. The federal government therefore decided to set up collective reception locations. The first to open, in November 1986, was the ‘Petit Château’, a former military barracks in Brussels, but by the end of 1992, it was no longer able to accommodate the flow of refugees. A total of almost 27,000 asylum seekers arrived in Belgium in 1993, which led the federal government to open multiple centres across the country. Over the years, Fedasil has needed to expand or reduce its reception capacity depending on the number of asylum seekers on Belgian soil. In the years 1999 and 2000, for example, Belgium saw a steep {{rise in the number of}} asylum requests. The year 2000, which also saw the one-off regularisation campaign, broke all records with 42,691 requests.|$|R
