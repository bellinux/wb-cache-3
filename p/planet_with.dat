5|$|Even {{when this}} inner <b>planet,</b> <b>with</b> a mass at least 78% {{times that of}} Jupiter was {{accounted}} for, the star still showed a drift in its radial velocity. This {{eventually led to the}} discovery of the outer planet 55 Cancri d in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Four star {{systems are}} known to harbour planets. HD 330075 is a sunlike star around 164light-years distant that is orbited by a hot Jupiter every 3.4days. Announced in 2004, {{it was the first}} planet {{discovered}} by the HARPS spectrograph. HD 148156 is a star 168 ± 7 light-years distant. Slightly larger and hotter than the Sun, it was found to have a roughly Jupiter-size <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> an orbital period of 2.8 years. HD 143361 is a binary star system composed of a sunlike star and a faint red dwarf separated by 30.9AU. A planet roughly triple the mass of Jupiter orbits the brighter star every 1057± 20days. HD 142415 is approximately 113light-years distant and has a Jupiter-sized <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> an orbital period of around 386 days.|$|E

5|$|Five star {{systems have}} been found to have planets, four of which have been {{discovered}} by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) in Chile. HD 4308 is a star with around 83% of the Sun's mass located 72 light-years away with a super-Earth <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> an orbital period of around 15 days. HD 215497 is an orange star of spectral type K3V around 142 light-years distant. It is orbited by a hot super-Earth every 3 days and a second planet around the size of Saturn with a period of around 567 days. HD 221287 has a spectral type of F7V and lies 173 light-years away, and has a super-Jovian planet. HD 7199 has spectral type KOIV/V and is located 117 light-years away. It has a <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> around 30% the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period of 615 days. HD 219077 has a planet around 10 times as massive as Jupiter in a highly eccentric orbit.|$|E

5|$|HD 154672 b is a Hot Jupiter, {{as it is}} {{a closely}} {{orbiting}} <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> a high mass. Specifically, HD 154672 has a mass that is 5.02 times greater than Jupiter's mass. It also orbits at a distance of 0.6 AU, or about 60% of the mean distance between the Earth and Sun. This orbit is completed every 163.91 days.|$|E
5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs. This correlation {{is unlikely to be}} the result of observational bias since it also appears in the nodal distribution of large semi-major axis centaurs and comets. If it is due to the extreme TNOs experiencing close approaches to Planet Nine, it is consistent with a <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU.|$|E
5|$|The early {{astronomy}} {{of ancient}} Greece {{was influenced by}} knowledge transmitted from the Mesopotamian culture. Thus the Babylonians associated Mars with Nergal, their god of war and pestilence, and the Greeks connected the <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> their god of war, Ares. During this period, the motions of the planets were of little interest to the Greeks; Hesiod's Works and Days (c. 650 BCE) {{makes no mention of}} the planets.|$|E

5|$|Using {{astronomy}} software, and {{an article}} written by astronomer Craig Chester {{based on the}} work of Ernest Martin, Larson thinks all nine characteristics of the Star of Bethlehem are found in events that took place in the skies of 3-2 BC. Highlights include a triple conjunction of Jupiter, called the king <b>planet,</b> <b>with</b> the fixed star Regulus, called the king star, starting in September 3 BC.

5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and geologist Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) have taken the TARDIS deep below the ground to the Silurian city where the Doctor's companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), a local man named Mo (Alun Raglan), and Mo's son, Elliot (Samuel Davies), are being held hostage. Meanwhile, above ground, Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill); Mo's wife, Ambrose (Nia Roberts); and Ambrose's father, Tony (Robert Pugh), keep watch over Alaya (Neve McIntosh), a captured Silurian who {{is the key to}} freeing the hostages. While the Doctor leaves Amy and Nasreen to negotiate sharing the <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> the Silurians, to help Mo find his son Eliot, it is revealed that Restac's sister Alaya has been killed by Ambrose on the surface.|$|E

5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules {{are required}} {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine {{the outer edge of the}} galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581c {{is likely}} to lie outside the {{habitable}} zone. No direct evidence has been found for water to be present, and it is probably not present in the liquid state. Techniques like the one {{used to measure the}} extrasolar planet HD 209458 b may in the future be used to determine the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the rare case of a <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> an orbit aligned so as to transit its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F7V that is around 1.22times as massive and 2.3times as luminous as the Sun. It has a Jupiter-sized <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> an orbital period of 280days that {{was discovered by}} the radial velocity method. WASP-7 is a star of spectral type F5V with an apparent magnitude of 9.54, about 1.28times as massive as the Sun. Its hot Jupiter planet—WASP-7b—was discovered by transit method and found to orbit the star every 4.95days. HD 202628 is a sunlike star of spectral type G2V with a debris disk that ranges from 158 to 220 AU distant. Its inner edge is sharply defined, indicating a probable planet orbiting between 86 and 158AU from the star.|$|E

5|$|His {{observations}} of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy: a <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> smaller planets orbiting it did not conform {{to the principles of}} Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth, and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing. His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the fifth}} planet from the Sun and {{the largest in the}} Solar System. It is a giant <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but {{two and a half times}} that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an {{apparent}} magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.|$|E
5|$|On {{the planet}} Krypton, using {{evidence}} {{provided to the}} Council by scientist Jor-El, the attempted insurrectionists General Zod, Ursa, and Non are sentenced to the Phantom Zone. For this, Zod swears revenge on Jor-El and his family. Jor-El, despite his eminence, is unable to convince the Council that Krypton will soon be destroyed when its red supergiant sun goes supernova. To save his infant son, Kal-El, Jor-El launches him in a spaceship to Earth, a <b>planet</b> <b>with</b> a suitable atmosphere where Kal-El's dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers. Shortly after the launch, Krypton's sun explodes, destroying the planet.|$|E
