5|$|Magda (Anna Crilly) is the Spleens' morose Eastern European housekeeper, who {{is often}} <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> British attitudes, {{language}} and, in her view, softness. She is a willing worker and generally suffers Rick's selfish eccentricities in sullen silence.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E

5|$|Shooting of Rashomon {{began on}} July 7, 1950, and, after {{extensive}} location {{work in the}} primeval forest of Nara, wrapped on August 17. Just one week was spent in hurried post-production, hampered by a studio fire, and the finished film premiered at Tokyo's Imperial Theatre on August 25, expanding nationwide the following day. The movie was met by lukewarm reviews, with many critics <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> its unique theme and treatment, but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Daiei.|$|E
5|$|Travers' working {{relationship}} with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> Travers' disdain for fantasy, {{given the nature of}} the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{governor}} of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy {{inhabitants of the}} Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected {{to be on the}} trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.|$|E

5|$|At Mars Investigations, Duncan and Lilly's mother, Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill) hires Keith to {{ascertain}} if her husband Jake {{is having an}} affair, despite her open contempt for both Keith and Veronica. Keith is busy with other projects, and Veronica takes it upon herself to follow Jake. Veronica takes photos of him at the Camelot hotel as he meets with an unseen woman after midnight. Once Keith sees the license plate number of the woman's car, he stops the investigation and files the photograph. <b>Puzzled</b> <b>by</b> his actions, Veronica finds the file and learns that Keith has continued his own personal investigation of Lilly's murder. Veronica discovers that the car belongs to her missing mother, Lianne, and begins to investigate the murder herself.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Tibbett {{travel to}} Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond is <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> {{a woman who}} rebuffs him and finds out that Zorin has written her a cheque for $5million. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's {{laboratory}} and learn that he is implanting adrenaline-releasing devices in the horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and believes that his attempt to assassinate Bond has been successful. Afterwards, General Gogol of the KGB confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission and reveals that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils {{to a group of}} investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give him—and the potential investors—a monopoly over the microchip industry.|$|E
5|$|Eddard says Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King {{have been}} killed and asks why Ser Arthur was not present at the Battle of the Trident. Ser Arthur replies that he has been ordered to stay at the tower. After Eddard demands to know where his sister is, a battle ensues. Eddard is able to defeat Ser Gerold, but Ser Arthur - {{wielding}} dual swords - easily defeats most of Eddard's men by himself. As Eddard and Ser Arthur duel one-on-one, Bran is <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> this vision, as his father had repeatedly boasted of his defeat of Ser Arthur. It is quite apparent that his father is no match for the superior swordsman. Just as Ser Arthur is about to defeat and kill Eddard, a wounded Howland rises and plunges his dagger through the back of Ser Arthur's neck, before Eddard delivers the fatal blow, leaving Bran shocked.|$|E

5|$|<b>Puzzled</b> <b>by</b> the {{geographical}} distribution of wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published {{in a series of}} books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.|$|E
5|$|Rounding a corner, {{they see}} a cat and hide under a basket, but the cat then sits {{on top of the}} basket for five hours, {{trapping}} the pair. Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her in the greenhouse, then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked in the greenhouse.|$|E
5|$|The stolen {{works were}} {{originally}} purchased by art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) and {{intended to be}} left on permanent display at the museum {{with the rest of}} her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. Experts are <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> the choice of paintings that were stolen, especially since more valuable artwork was untouched. Among the stolen works was The Concert, one of only 34 known works by Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting at over $200 million. Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, Rembrandt's only known seascape. Other works by Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, and Flinck were also stolen.|$|E

5|$|Tracking the Joker to the Gotham Royal Hotel, Batman {{discovers that}} the villain {{and his men}} have filled the hotel with explosives, murdered the staff, and taken the guests hostage. The Joker berates the assassins for their failure to kill Batman, {{throwing}} Electrocutioner out a window to his death: Batman recovers his electric gloves. The assassins leave, except for Bane, who thinks Batman is coming for the Joker. After traversing the building, Batman finds the Joker on the roof but is forced to battle Bane. Thinking Batman is outmatched, Alfred alerts the police so they will intervene. As Bane escapes by helicopter, he fires a rocket at the Joker, who is thrown from the hotel by the concussive force. Batman saves the Joker, leaving him with the police. <b>Puzzled</b> <b>by</b> the events, the Joker is imprisoned in Blackgate {{under the care of}} Dr. Harleen Quinzel; he tells Quinzel that he and Batman were destined to meet.|$|E
5|$|During {{their attempt}} to escape Nalbina Dungeon, Vaan, Balthier, and Fran {{discovered}} Basch chained in a cage suspended from the ceiling. Though all three were initially suspicious of him (especially Vaan, who blamed him for Reks's death), Basch protested his innocence and told them about his twin. The party decided his story was plausible and released him. After being freed, he made it his mission to protect Ashe and support the resistance. When {{he and his brother}} were reunited, Gabranth was deeply <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> Basch's continued ability to hold his head high in spite of his past failures. Basch explained that his vow to defend Ashe had given him purpose and a renewed sense of honor. After the final battle against Vayne, as Noah was dying, he asked Basch to take his place as Larsa's protector. Because it was still widely believed that Basch was dead, he adopted his brother's name and title when he entered Larsa's service. In Revenant Wings, Basch is sent by Larsa to be the Empire's representative in dealing with the Judge of Wings. Basch was voiced by Keith Ferguson in English and by Rikiya Koyama in Japanese. He also appears in Itadaki Street Portable.|$|E
