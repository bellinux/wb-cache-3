50|$|The {{cantilever}} brake is a {{class of}} brake in which each arm {{is attached to a}} separate pivot point {{on one side of the}} seat stay or fork. Thus all cantilever brakes are dual-pivot.

The <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together. In the first-class lever design, the arm pivots above the rim. The <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart.Due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads, cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres, such as on mountain bikes.

50|$|The {{braking force}} {{asserted}} {{is caused by}} the friction between the electromagnet and the face of the drum which depends on the current through the electromagnet (as stated before). The force applied on the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> is counteracted by one of the reactor springs (which one depends on the direction of the rotation) so when the current through the electromagnet is withdrawn the spring ensures that the actuating arm is returned to resting position and the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> are retracted from the drum.|$|R
50|$|Braking {{starts with}} {{applying}} a current {{proportional to the}} desired brake force to the electromagnet (5) which is pulled axially towards the drum. If the wheel is rotating the drum will then pull the actuating arm (4) either {{to the left or}} to the right depending on the rotation of the wheel. The actuating arm is pivoted on the black round pin that is anchored to the brake shield. This in turn applies pressure on one of the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> which comes into contact with the brake drum. The first <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> then tries to follow the rotation while asserting friction and thereby propagate the movement onto the second <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> through the adjuster which also pushes against the drum. The friction force is then caught by the stopper (Black trapezoid) mounted on the brake shield.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, a {{friction}} composite material {{which will be}} used for material of train <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> was investigated to study the effect of ingredients on flexural strength. The Taguchi method is used to measure relative effect of ingredients on flexural strength of composite. Taguchi L 8 orthogonal array which consists of 7 factors with 2 levels each is applied to perform experiment. Ingredients of friction composite were considered as factors or parameters and % volume for each factor was varied at 2 levels. Phenolic resin and barite (BaSO 4) were not included as factor. Phenolic resin was always kept constant at 30 % volume and % volume of barite (BaSO 4) was varied to compensate the changing of other ingredients amount. The results show that glass fiber and cast iron chip have significant effect on increasing of flexural strength of <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> composite. Conversely, NBR has significant effect on decreasing of flexural strength of <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> material.
