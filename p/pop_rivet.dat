50|$|The {{aircraft}} is a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed tailwheel undercarriage {{and an open}} cockpit. Construction is {{of metal}} throughout, with a forward fuselage of welded steel tube construction, with the rear fuselage built up of aluminium bulkheads and longerons. The wings and tail are also of aluminium construction, and the entire aircraft is skinned in the same material. <b>Pop</b> <b>rivets</b> are used extensively to simplify construction.|$|R
50|$|The Leyland National was {{a simple}} design: all parts could be replaced. Some operators, like London Transport, bought dual door models, and then later {{configured}} {{some of them to}} single door. This was helped by the design of the body, the fact that parts were inter-changeable and that the bus was constructed using Avdelok rivets, specially designed for the National, instead of the more usual <b>pop</b> <b>rivets</b> screws or welding.|$|R
50|$|On 2 January, not {{far from}} Golfo Ladrillero, the ship hit a rock and buckled her plates, <b>popping</b> <b>rivets</b> and {{breaching}} several compartments.

The Casma was able to continue for a further 600 m and run aground on a sandy beach, far from the main shipping channel in a sparsely inhabited region.|$|R

50|$|In 1960, {{almost in}} debt and with nothing left to do but axe steam propulsion, the PJ & MS Co decided to {{decommission}} the Curl Curl, which occurred on 25 October 1960.

50|$|The GB1 Hero proton packs were {{fiberglass}} shells {{mounted on}} aluminum motherboards with LC-1 ALICE Frames and straps. These packs had many aluminum parts on them, including: aluminum Ion Arm and cap, booster tube, injector tubes, HGA, vacuum line, PPD, Beamline and filler tube, {{as well as}} the N-Filter. The wands for these packs were also fully aluminum, minus the resin grips. All these external parts were <b>pop</b> <b>riveted</b> to the shell, which was then, in turn, mounted to the motherboard via L-Brackets and bolts at the four corners of the pack.|$|R

All flying surfaces are covered in doped aircraft fabric. The very first Pelicans had wire-bracing for the wing and spoilers for roll control. These were replaced with strut-bracing and one-third span ailerons. The enclosed cabin, designed for Quebec winters included Lexan doors. The Pelican's conventional landing gear consists of a fibreglass rod for the main gear, with a tailskid, replaced on later models by a steerable tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} aluminum tubing that is <b>pop</b> <b>riveted</b> together using gussets. On early examples the flying surfaces were covered in dope and aircraft fabric covering, but this was later changed to heat-shrunk Dacron sailcloth, to save weight. Its 30.8 ft span wing employs a modified Clark Y airfoil. The wings are supported by a single lift strut and a jury strut. The pilot is accommodated on an open seat, without a windshield. The controls are conventional three axis, but the aircraft uses a control yoke rather than the more common control stick. The landing gear features main wheel bungee suspension.|$|R

5000|$|No further mishaps {{occurred}} until 30 January when Arneb, the icebreaker , {{and cargo}} ship [...] attempted {{to push through}} the icepack off Knox Coast. A large chunk of ice broke off and brushed Arneb's port side, ripping a gash 12 feet long and one-half inch wide and once again flooding the holds as well as buckling plates, <b>popping</b> <b>rivets,</b> and opening seams. The experienced damage control parties used the same techniques to patch the new wounds in her hull. The ships then got underway again, with Glacier towing Arneb. Early the next morning, they arrived at Knox Coast and once again, the damage was repaired.|$|R

50|$|On June 16, 2004, the UCE {{traveled}} to Ron’s Body Shop with the $50,000 cash concealed in a hidden compartment in a Dodge Intrepid load car. This {{is the same}} load car subsequently driven by Reno Martin from Nashville to Chicago, with 30 kilograms of purported cocaine. Ron Middlebrook inspected the load car, replaced some missing upholstery plugs in the trunk and replaced some light bulbs. The $50,000 cash was retrieved from the hidden compartment. Ron Middlebrook {{made it clear that}} he knew what the compartment was for and remarked that he noticed it immediately while examining the trunk. Middlebrook recommended using spot-welds instead of <b>pop</b> <b>rivets</b> in the trunk because <b>pop</b> <b>rivets</b> would attract attention.On June 24 and 25, 2004, the UCE met with Middlebrook and Blaskis in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to discuss their money-laundering scheme. The UCE introduced Blaskis to his purported criminal associates and further discussed the criminal source of the cash that Middlebrook and Blaskis were laundering. Middlebrook continued to identify potential corrupt law enforcement officers. Blaskis agreed to launder additional illegal proceeds. On July 1, 2004, Blaskis advised that she and Middlebrook had discussed it and agreed they could launder between $50,000 and $75,000 per week for the next year. On July 28, 2004, during a meeting with the UCE, Blaskis advised that she and Middlebrook had established bank accounts in three different banks in order to minimize speculation caused by frequent cash deposits.On Sept. 1, 2004, Reno Martin asked the UCE about another job hauling narcotics for the UCE. Reno Martin also acknowledged knowing that the cash he has been transporting for the UCE is being laundered through Tennessee Motor Speedway.|$|R

50|$|Baslee {{constructed}} {{a series of}} homebuilt aircraft, selling each one {{to pay for the}} next one. He had aspired to build a Fokker Triplane, but found the existing replica plans very complex and slow to construct. He applied his engineering knowledge and created a new design of the DR.1, with a simplified structure and revised airfoil, a modified Clark Y, to improve handling. The resulting design uses aluminum tubing and <b>pop</b> <b>riveted</b> gussets, in place of wooden structure. All designs use a two-spar wing design to give redundancy not found in the original First World War designs. Most World War I designs were very tail-heavy and so the balance was adjusted in his designs to give a better center of gravity.|$|R
5000|$|Described in the New York Times as 'the king of garage rock', Thee Headcoats {{had their}} roots in the British punk scene of the 1970s (both Billy and Bruce playing in The <b>Pop</b> <b>Rivets</b> and The Milkshakes).
