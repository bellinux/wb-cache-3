40|$|There is spruce forests {{degradation}} {{observed in}} the Silesian Beskid. The aim of the work was the assessment of parameters diversifying organic layers of soils in two forest areas: degraded and healthy spruce forests of Silesian Beskid. 23 soil samples were collected from two fields— 14 soil samples from a degraded forest and 9 soil samples from a forest, where pandemic dying of spruce is not observed. Implementation of hierarchical clustering to experimental data analysis allowed drawing a conclusion that the two forest areas vary significantly in terms of content of aluminium extracted with solutions of barium chloride (Alexch), <b>sodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (Alpyr), and pHKCl and {{in the amount of}} humus in soil...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{metabolic}} experiments carried out on homogenates prepared from fresh human adenomatous prostates, we have observed that incubation of such homogenates at 37 °C. and pH 7 in tris buffer containing calcium chloride (0. 02 M) resulted in a rapid loss of phosphatase activity averaging 44 per cent after 3 hr. in 32 experiments. When adenosine triphosphate (0. 015 M) was added {{at the beginning of}} the incubation period, the loss of activity was reduced to an average value of 5 per cent under the same experimental conditions. Addition of adenosine triphosphate during or at the end of the incubation period resulted in complete regeneration of the acid phosphatase activity on further incubation (Fig. 1). We have observed also that adenosine triphosphate could be replaced by <b>sodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (versene) with identical results. © 1960 Nature Publishing Group.

40|$|Dj et al. {{reported}} in the last issue of 1990 a case of severe hypophosphatemia treated by intraperitoneal phosphate (1). Their patient probably had several causes ofhypophosphatemia, including inadequate intake, transcellular shift, increased intestinal and peritoneal loss of phosphorus. We reported a case of symptomatic hypophosphatemia in a dialysis patient suffering from Hungry Bone syndrome after parathyroidectomy treated with intraperitoneal phosphate (2). We used 1 molar <b>sodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> in a final concentration of 1. 61 mmoVL in the dialysate. In our case, we achieved a positive balance of phosphorus without complications. Indeed, serum calcium levels did not change, pH was not altered, and no precipitation of salts {{was seen in the}} dialysate. We are now treating another diabetic patient by intraperitoneal administration of phosphate (initial serum phosphate 0. 3 mmoVL, now 1. 33 mmoVL) due to his refusal of oral or IV replacement. In agreement with Dy et al., we believe that phosphate can be safely used in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis patients with hypophosphatemia...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin K {{comprises}} a {{group of}} substances, which are widespread in nature and are an essential co-factor in humans in the synthesis of several proteins that {{play a role in}} haemostasis and others that may be important in calcium homeostasis. The K vitamins all contain the 2 -methyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (menadione) moiety, and the various naturally occurring forms differ in the alkyl substituent at the 3 -position. Phylloquinone (vitamin K 1) is 2 -methyl- 3 -phytyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone and is widely found in higher plants, including green leafy vegetables, and in green and blue algae. The menaquinones (formerly vitamin K 2) have polyisoprenyl substituents at the 3 -position and are produced by bacteria. The compound menadione (formerly vitamin K 3) lacks an alkyl group at the 3 -position but can be alkylated in vivo in some species. Several synthetic water-soluble derivatives, such as the <b>sodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> ester of menadiol and the addition product of menadione with sodium bisulfite, also have commercial applications (Nationa...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -An attempt {{has been}} made to develop tritiated {{derivatives}} of Synkavit (menadiol <b>sodium</b> <b>diphosphate,</b> MNDP) of high specific activity as a radioactive drug. This paper summarizes the preliminary biological and physical studies, with emphasis on approximate radiation dosimetry and the necessary preliminary testing, and then gives an account of the clinical investigations and the trials carried out so far, which correspond essentially to Phases I and II trials for a chemotherapeutic agent. In all, 214 patients with different sites and types of advanced and recurrent, inoperable, histologically verified malignant tumours including reticuloses have been treated with doses of at least 1 Ci of the various preparations. Among the 203 evaluable treated cases, some form of response was observed in 23 out of 151 (15 - 2 %) receiving the drug by intravenous injections and 13 out of 52 (25 %) after intra-arterial injections. For the sites and types of malignant diseases which showed response...|$|R

40|$|Ab s t r a c t. The {{capacity}} to bind water exerts a crucial {{influence on the}} quality of cured prod-ucts manufactured from whole muscles and subjected to thermal treatment. The experimental mate-rial comprised the lumbar and thoracic parts of the longissimus dorsi (musculus longissimus lumborum et musculus longissimus thoracis) muscle of pigs. The aim of the performed experiments was to analyse the impact of different composition of brines which contained a specific quantity of salts of inorganic acids on the value of active acidity, water activity, water holding capacity and the way of water binding. It was found that both parts of raw longissimus dorsi muscle differed with regard to the pH value, water activity and molecular dynamics of bound water. The water holding capacity as well as the mutual relationships between the quantities of free and bound waters were identical. The type of the applied brine exerted some influence on the level of water holding capacity. The relative amount of free water in relation to bound water analysed on the basis of relaxation measurements was the highest when the mixture of sodium chloride and sodium triphosphate was applied. The mixture of chloride and <b>sodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> reduced the relative content of free water in relation to bound water in comparison with the application of brine which contained only NaCl and increased it in comparison with the application of diphosphate. The pres-ence of sodium chloride increased water activity, while the presence of phosphates decreased this parame-ter. The lumbar part of the examined muscle showed higher water activity. The application of the salt mixture did not change the value of water activity in comparison with NaCl alone for the lumbar part but increased water activity for the thoracic part of the muscle.

40|$|Crude {{extracts}} of Mycobacterium smegmatis catalyzed {{the synthesis}} of adenosine diphosphate-glucose (ADP-Glc), cytidine diphosphate-glucose, guanosine diphosphate-glucose (GDP-Glc), thymidine diphosphate-glucose (TDP-Glc), and uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDP-Glc). In these crude enzyme fractions, high concentrations of trehalose-P inhibited the ADP-Glc and GDP-Glc pyrophosphorylases but did not effect the UDP-Glc or TDP-Glc pyrophosphorylases. Both the ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase and the UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase were partially purified (about 140 -fold and 60 -fold, respectively), and their properties were compared. For the ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, the Km for adenosine triphosphate was 6 × 10 − 4 m, whereas that for glucose- 1 -P was 8 × 10 − 4 m. The optimal concentration of Mg 2 + was 1 × 10 − 3 m, and the pH optimum was 8. 5. For the UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, the Km for uridine triphosphate was 1 × 10 − 3 m and for glucose- 1 -P was 2 × 10 − 3 m. The optimal Mg 2 + concentration was 1 × 10 − 3 m, and the pH optimum was about 8. 0. The purified ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase was inhibited by fructose- 6 -P, fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate, glucose- 6 -P, and phosphoenolpyruvate. On the other hand, trehalose, trehalose <b>diphosphate,</b> <b>sodium</b> pyruvate, and ribose- 5 -P did not effect the ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase. None of these compounds, including trehalose-P, had any effect on the UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase...|$|R
