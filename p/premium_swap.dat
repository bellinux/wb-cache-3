Unfortunately, data on insecticide usage by crop at the county level is not available. The following case study seeks to uncover the reasons for this increase by analyzing county-level data in South Dakota with a fixed effects panel regression. The study links the proportion of acres planted for a specific crop to the proportion of total acres treated with insecticide. This approach provides insight on how changing cropping patterns in South Dakota have influenced insecticide use.

40|$|The turn of {{the century}} has seen the {{development}} and growth of more efficient vehicles for transferring the credit risk of individual credit exposures or a portfolio of them. This growth has been fostered by the emergence of credit derivatives, in particular credit default swaps (CDSs). In a CDS trade, a credit protection buyer acquires credit protection from the counterparty by paying a <b>premium.</b> The CDS <b>swap</b> <b>premium</b> has been viewed as a clean representation of credit risk. As a result, in the past few years, researchers have used data on CDS trades where the reference entity is a corporation to study the liquidity component of corporate bond spreads. Using a transaction dataset, we discover very large bid-ask spreads in CDS quotes. With a two-factor model, we show that such large bid-ask spreads can profoundly affect the estimation of credit risk, which in turn has a significant effect on the estimation of the liquidity spread for corporate bonds. Contrary to the literature, we show that while the bond and CDS markets appear to have two different values for the credit spread, once liquidity is accounted for we no longer find such a difference...|$|R

If two firms are competitions (copartners), the default intensity of one firm will decrease (increase) abruptly when the other firm defaults.

Previous studies estimate implied variance based on Black (1976) model or forecast variance using the GARCH models. Our implied variance approach, based on variance swap rate, is model independent. We compute the daily 60 -day variance risk premiums based on the difference between the realized variance and implied variance for the period from 1987 to 2009. We find negative and time-varying variance risk premiums in the corn market. Our results contrast with Egelkraut, Garcia, and Sherrick (2007), but are in line with the findings of Simon (2002). We conclude that our synthesized implied variance contains superior information about future realized variance relative to the implied variance estimates based on the Black (1976) model and the variance forecasted using the GARCH(1, 1) model.

Ab-normal bond returns are computed by subtracting return from a matching portfolio to {{the return of the}} observed bond return. Abnormal credit default swap return is calculated with a regression of the observed bond return on an equiweighted index that isconstructed to transpose our bond universe on the credit default swap market. Severalparametric and non parametric tests do not show any significant impact of these negative events as a whole on corporate bond prices, even though there is evidence of some impact of two subcategories of social events.

Second, larger transactions have a higher price impact. This finding stands {{in stark contrast to}} corporate bond markets. Third, traders charge higher premiums as a price for liquidity provision, not as compensation for asymmetric information. Fourth, buyside investors pay significantly higher prices than dealers for demanding liquidity. Last, inventory risk seems to matter little in explaining liquidity premiums...|$|R

Firstly, this study examines the pricing power of the default risk, measured by the market revealed credit default <b>swap</b> <b>premiums</b> for individual U. S. firms from 2004 to 2010, in average returns across stocks; secondly, it explores whether the size and BM effects are due to that they proxy for the default risk effect. The tests demonstrate that size effect dominates the joint effect of size and default risk, while both BM and default risk co-work for the joint effect of BM and default risk. Therefore, part of the size and BM effects {{can be interpreted as}} default risk effect. As expected, size is priced with a negative risk premium, and BM is priced with a positive risk premium. However, higher default risk is priced with higher expected stock returns only when BM is below a certain level and BM is not priced. Additionally, size indeed proxies for the sensitivity to the default risk factor. Furthermore, the Fama-French factors SMB (small-minus-big) and HML (high-minus-low), mimicking the risks related to size and BM, share some common information with the default risk factor in the asset pricing tests.

The model also captures the fact that book-to-market value dominates financial leverage in explaining stock returns.

Our approach consists of jointly modeling the Treasury, repo, and swap term structures using a general five-factor aﬃne credit framework and estimating the parameters by maximum likelihood. We find that the credit spread is driven by changes in a persistent liquidity process and a rapidly mean-reverting default intensity process. Although both processes have similar volatilities, we find that the credit <b>premium</b> priced into <b>swap</b> rates is primarily compensation for liquidity risk. The term structure of liquidity premia increases steeply with maturity. In contrast, the term structure of default premia is almost flat.

To accomplish this, we estimate the credit default <b>swap</b> <b>premium</b> (CDS) needed to insure each fund’s portfolio against credit losses. We also calculate by Monte Carlo the cost of insuring a fund against losses amounting to over 50 basis points. We find that credit risk of prime MMFs rose from June to December 2011 before receding in 2012. Contrary to common perceptions, this did not primarily reflect funds’ credit exposure to eurozone banks. Instead, credit risk in prime MMFs rose because of the deteriorating credit outlook of banks in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we find evidence that the SEC’s 2010 liquidity and weighted average life (WAL) requirements reduced the credit risk of prime MMFs. ...|$|R

Empirical analysis shows quantitative easing, in particular the first round, significantly contributed to the rebounding of capital inflows to the region after the onset of the crisis by lowering domestic yield rates as well as credit default <b>swap</b> <b>premiums.</b> Although the currency value responses differed across countries, it appears that economies with stable exchange rates roughly coincide with those in which housing prices have been rising, suggesting that monetary easing of advanced countries have affected Asian countries through either appreciation of currency values or increases in the prices of housing...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{propose a}} general pricing {{framework}} {{that allows the}} risk-neutral dynamics of loss given default (LQ) and default probabilities (lambdaQ) to be separately and sequentially discovered. The key is to exploit the differentials in LQ exhibited by different securities on the same underlying firm. By using equity and option data, I show that one can efficiently extract pure measures of LQ that are not contaminated by recovery information. Equipped with this knowledge of pure default dynamics, prices of any defaultable security on the same firm with non-zero recovery can be inverted to compute the associated LQ corresponding to that particular security. Using data on credit default <b>swap</b> <b>premiums,</b> I show that, cross-sectionally, lambdaQ and LQ are positively correlated. In particular, this positive correlation is strongly driven by firms' characteristics, including leverage, volatility, profitability and q-ratios. For example, 1 % increase in leverage leads to. 14 % increase in lambdaQ and. 60 % increase in LQ. These findings raise serious doubts about the current practice, by both researchers and practitioners, of setting LQ to a constant across firms. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper aims {{to assess}} dynamic tail risk {{exposure}} in the hedge fund sector using daily data. We use a copula function to model both lower and upper tail dependence between hedge funds, bond, commodity, foreign exchange, and equity markets as a func-tion of market uncertainty, and proxy the latter {{by means of}} a single index that combines the options-implied market volatility, the volatility risk <b>premium,</b> and the <b>swap</b> and term spreads. We find substantial time-variation in lower-tail dependence even for hedge-fund styles that exhibit little unconditional tail dependence. This illustrates well the pitfalls of confining attention to unconditional measures of tail risk. In addition, lower-tail depen-dence between hedge fund and equity market returns decreases significantly with market uncertainty. The only styles that feature neither unconditional nor conditional tail depen-dence are convertible arbitrage and equity market neutral. We also fail to observe any tail dependence with bond and currency markets, though we find strong evidence that the lower-tail risk exposure of macro hedge funds to commodity markets increases with liquid-ity risk. In stark contrast, there is not much action in the upper tails. Our results are robust to changes in the specific measure of tail dependence {{as well as in the}} factors tha...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the recent global {{financial}} crisis, this paper investigates the determinants of the Credit Default <b>Swap</b> <b>premium</b> in the UK banking sector for the period January 2004 -April 2011. Employing a VAR model, we focus on the roles played by house prices, the yield spread, the UK TED spread and the FTSE 100 index. Our main results suggest that the CDS premium significantly increases in the medium term following a positive shock to the house price index, reflecting that continued house price appreciation can hide the likelihood of default risk, as shown in the insignificant response in the short run. We also find that a positive shock to the CDS premium significantly reduces house prices because it induces banks and other financial institutions to lend less, reducing the demand for housing and exerting further downward pressure on house prices. While a positive shock to stock prices lowers CDS premium, a positive shock to the liquidity premium increases CDS premium. Finally, our variance decomposition analysis shows that the house price shock explains over 19 % of the long-run forecast-error variance of the CDS premium, while shocks in other variables each explain less than 8 % of this forecast-error variance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the impact of counterparty-risk in CDS (Credit Default Swap) pricing. The {{exponential}} growth of the Credit Derivatives Market in the last decade demands an upsurge in the fair valuation of various credit derivatives such as the Credit Default Swap (CDS), the Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO). Financial institutions suffered great losses from Credit Derivatives in the sub-prime mortgage market during the credit crunch period. Counterparty risk in CDS contracts has been intensively studied with a focus on losses for protection buyers due to joint defaults of counterparty and reference entity. Using a contagion framework introduced by Jarrow and Yu (2001) [48], we calculate the <b>swap</b> <b>premium</b> rate based on the change of measure technique, and further extend both the two-firm and three-firm model (with defaultable protection buyer) with continuous premium payment. The results show more explanatory power than the discrete case. We improve the continuous contagion model by relaxing the constant intensity rate assumption and found close results without loss of generality. Empirically this thesis studies the behaviour of the historical credit spread of 55 sample corporates/ financial institutions, a Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model is applied to calibrate spread parameters. A proxy for counterparty spread is introduced as the difference between the spread over benchmark rate and spread over swap rate for 5 year maturity CDS. We then investigate counterparty risk during the crisis and study the shape of term structure for the counterparty spread, where Rebonato’s framework is deployed to model the dynamics of the term structure using a regime-switching framework.

5000|$|A {{synthetic}} CDO tranche may {{be either}} funded or unfunded. Under the swap agreements, the CDO could {{have to pay}} {{up to a certain}} amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the CDO's reference portfolio. Some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches. Typically, the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing. Until a credit event occurs, the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in high-quality, liquid assets or placed in a GIC (Guaranteed Investment Contract) account that offers a return that is a few basis points below LIBOR. The return from these investments plus the <b>premium</b> from the <b>swap</b> counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches. When a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required, the required payment is made from the GIC or reserve account that holds the liquid investments. In contrast, senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower. Unlike a cash CDO, investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the CDO when entering into the investment. Instead, the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the CDO in the event the portfolio's losses reach the senior tranche. Funded synthetic issuance exceeded $80 billion in 2006. From an issuance perspective, synthetic CDOs take less time to create. Cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed, and the CDO's tranches can be precisely structured.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} the information fl ow between the {{credit default swap}} market {{and the stock market}} as well as insider trading in the credit default swap market. Methodology: For my analysis I use the event study methodology. Using the event study methodology I calculate abnormal stock returns and abnormal credit default <b>swap</b> <b>premium</b> changes. The analysis is based on 175, 874 observations collected for 92 companies between the years 2001 and 2010. Findings: The results show that the information fl ow from the credit default swap market to the stock market is the most signifi cant in terms of negative rating outlooks. The information fl ow is much less signifi cant in relations to negative surprises during announcements of annual fi nancial results and rating upgrades. Evidence of insider trading is also most evident with reference to negative rating outlooks. Additionally, a distinctive feature of the credit default swap market and the stock market is the asymmetric response to negative and positive credit information. Research limitations: The event study methodology does not consider other potentially important reasons for the information flow between markets than the ones actually investigated. The credit events and credit risk information used in this research are just a proposal and can be extended by future researchers. Originality: This paper discusses a new research area. The main research area in terms of insider trading is still the stock market, with special focus on the US market. I decided to explore the insider trading phenomenon in the credit default swap market. I only considered contracts that are quoted with reference to European underlying assets. This part of the fi nancial market is attractive in terms of economic research as credit derivatives are more commonly used not only in North America but also in Europe...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} two main topics. One {{is related to}} Real Options of {{competing}} firms {{and the other on}} pricing credit default swap (CDS). On real op-tions, we examines strategic investment games between two firms that compete for optimal entry in a project that generates uncertain revenue flows. Under asymmetry on both the sunk cost of investment and revenue flows of the two competing firms, we investigate the value of real investment options and strate-gic interaction of investment decisions. Compared to earlier models that only allow for asymmetry on sunk cost, our model demonstrates a richer set of strate-gic interactions of entry decisions. We provide a complete characterization of pre-emptive, dominant and simultaneous equilibriums by analyzing the relative value of leader's and follower's optimal investment thresholds. In a duopoly mar-ket with negative externalities, a firm may reduce loss on its real options value by selecting appropriate pre-emptive entry. When one firm has a dominant ad-vantage over its competitor, both the dominant firm and dominated firm enter at their respective leader's and follower's optimal thresholds. When the pre-emptive thresholds of both firms happen to coincide, the two firms enter simultaneously. Under positive externalities, firms do not compete to lead. On the second topic, we apply the multi-variate rational lognormal approach to model the interest rate process and default intensity processes of risky obligors. Under the rational lognormal framework, positivity of the default intensities and interest rate are guaranteed. In our model, pairwise correlation of the default processes is introduced through correlation among the stochastic factors. For pricing of single-name credit default swaps and swaptions, we manage to obtain analytic representation of the fair <b>swap</b> <b>premium</b> and option price. For pricing of basket default swaps, we derive the joint survival probabilities of default times and the probability density of the time of the nth-to-default under the assumption of conditional independence. Numerical simulation experiments were performed to demonstrate the dependence of the pricing of basket default swaps on default correlation among the risky obligors in the basket...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper (Los, 1998 a), the exact and {{complete}} return attribution framework of Singer and Karnosky (1995) {{was extended to}} include market risk measurements for n countries. Exploiting a selection matrix based on the cash accounting identities, the resulting degenerate portfolio choice problem is solved as a lower dimensional, non- degenerate problem of fundamental investment choices between stock market <b>premiums</b> and currency <b>swap</b> returns. The original n 2 multi- currency strategic investment allocations are uniquely retrieved from the resulting 2 n optimal fundamental choice allocations. This new optimal return-risk attribution accounting framework is applied to monthly return data of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the USA and Germany from June 1992 through December 1997. This includes the illustrative period of the Asian currency crisis of July - December 1997. The USA and Germany are included as alternative low risk strategic investment allocations in the Asian portfolio for further diversification. Throughout this {{five and a half}} year period, Asian risk levels, as measured by the GMV standard deviations of return, were about five times the corresponding average returns. The evidence shows that most of the strategic investment risk in Asian countries is attributable to the risk amplitudes of the stock markets, followed by those of the currency markets and, least, the cash markets. The Thai stock market was the most volatile market to invest in throughout the period. The currency swaps caused the spreading contagion. For a U. S. dollar based Asian investor, GMV portfolio risk could have been reduced by half and his return could have been doubled, when the USA would have been included in his portfolio. In contrast, diversification to Germany (Europe) would only marginally have contributed to portfolio risk reduction. Risk management in Asia was hazardous. Spectral analysis of the covariance risks shows that during the investigated period the Asian portfolio efficiency frontier was non- stationary and that the Asian diversification risk and systematic risk changed over time in a few specific countries. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis, I make use of the notion of {{excursion}} and occu-pation time of a diffusion process to study the effect of different repricing mech-anisms in the employee stock options and to price the Î±-quantile options. By modeling the repricing mechanisms of the employee stock options based on the excursion and occupation time, I investigate the impact of the embedded repric-ing flexibility on the market value of the employee stock options. The analytic representation of the price functions of the repriceable options are derived. To value the option numerically, the forward shooting grid technique in the lattice tree algorithm is used to handle the path dependent features in the repriceable option model. My calculations show that the repricing flexibility may have vary-ing degrees of impact on the option values and their comparative statics. On the other hand, the distribution functions of occupation times under the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) process are also derived. The distribution functions can then be used to price the Î±-quantile options. I also derive the fixed-floating symmetry relation for Î±-quantile options when the underlying asset price process follows the Geometric Brownian motion. In the second part of the thesis, I consider the finite time horizon dividend-ruin model. The asset value process is modeled as a restricted Geometric Brownian process with an upper reflecting (dividend) barrier and a lower absorbing (ruin) barrier. Analytic solutions to the value function of the restricted asset value process are provided. I also solve for the survival probability and the expected present value of future dividend payouts over a given time horizon. The sen-sitivities of the firm asset value and dividend payouts to the dividend barrier, volatility of the firm asset value and firm's credit quality are also examined. Finally, I present the Markov chain formulation of the credit contagion model with interacting intensities. The Markov chain framework is applied to calculate the joint default distributions of default times. Properties of various dependence measures on pairwise default correlation arising from credit contagion are ex-amined. I also apply the interacting intensities model to study the impact of counterparty risk on the <b>swap</b> <b>premium</b> of a credit default swap...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Applied Mathematics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Subprime {{residential}} {{mortgage loan}} securitization {{and its associated}} risks {{have been a major}} topic of discussion since the onset of the subprime mortgage crisis (SMC) in 2007. In this regard, the thesis addresses the issues of subprime residential mortgage loan (RML) securitization in discrete-, continuous-and discontinuous-time and their connections with the SMC. In this regard, the main issues to be addressed are discussed in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. In Chapter 2, we investigate the risk allocation choices of an investing bank (IB) that has to decide between risky securitized subprime RMLs and riskless Treasuries. This issue is discussed in a discrete-time framework with IB being considered to be regret- and risk-averse before and during the SMC, respectively. We conclude that if IB takes regret into account it will be exposed to higher risk when the difference between the expected returns on securitized subprime RMLs and Treasuries is small. However, there is low risk exposure when this difference is high. Furthermore, we assess how regret can influence IB's view - as a swap protection buyer - of the rate of return on credit default swaps (CDSs), as measured by the premium based on default swap spreads. We find that before the SMC, regret increases IB's willingness to pay lower premiums for CDSs when its securitized RML portfolio is considered to be safe. On the other hand, both risk- and regret-averse IBs pay the same CDS premium when their securitized RML portfolio is considered to be risky. Chapter 3 solves a stochastic optimal credit default insurance problem in continuous-time that has the cash outflow rate for satisfying depositor obligations, the investment in securitized loans and credit default insurance as controls. As far as the latter is concerned, we compute the credit default <b>swap</b> <b>premium</b> and accrued premium by considering the credit rating of the securitized mortgage loans. In Chapter 4, we consider a problem of IB investment in subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) and Treasuries in discontinuous-time. In order to accomplish this, we develop a Levy process-based model of jump diffusion-type for IB's investment in subprime RMBSs and Treasuries. This model incorporates subprime RMBS losses which can be associated with credit risk. Furthermore, we use variance to measure such risk, and assume that the risk is bounded by a certain constraint. We are now able to set-up a mean-variance optimization problem for IB's investment which determines the optimal proportion of funds that needs to be invested in subprime RMBSs and Treasuries subject to credit risk measured by the variance of IE's investment. In the sequel, we also consider a mean swaps-at-risk (SaR) optimization problem for IB's investment which determines the optimal portfolio which consists of subprime RMBSs and Treasuries subject to the protection by CDSs required against the possible losses. In this regard, we define SaR as indicative to IB on how much protection from swap protection seller it must have in order to cover the losses that might occur from credit events. Moreover, SaR is expressed in terms of Value-at-Risk (VaR). Finally, Chapter 5 provides an analysis of discrete-, continuous- and discontinuous-time models for subprime RML securitization discussed in the aforementioned chapters and their connections with the SMC. The work presented in this thesis is based on 7 peer-reviewed international journal articles (see [25], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48] and [55]), 4 peer-reviewed chapters in books (see [42], [50 j, [51 J and [52]) and 2 peer-reviewed conference proceedings papers (see [11] and [12]). Moreover, the article [49] is currently being prepared for submission to an lSI accredited journal. Master...|$|R
