40|$|Early order {{commitment}} (EOC) {{is one of}} {{the strategies}} for supply chain coordination, wherein a retailer places its orders to a supplier in advance, i. e., the retailer's ordering lead time is longer than the regular delivery time from the supplier to the retailer.

It also examines the impact of forecasting errors and inventory policies used by the retailers on the performance of the supply chain. The methodology adopted in this study is computer simulation. Analyses of the simulation outputs show that: 1) using the periodical review (s, S) policy can reduce the cost of the supply chain in many environments compared to deterministic lot-sizing rules such as the economic order <b>quantity</b> rule, the <b>periodic</b> order <b>quantity</b> rule and the Silver-Meal rule; 2) the EOC strategy can generate significant cost savings for the whole supply chain when the retailers' forecasting errors are not too large or the supplier's forecasting horizon is relatively long. However, the advantage of EOC disappears when the forecasting errors are large and the supplier's forecasting horizon is very short.

40|$|Managing {{inventories}} so {{that overall}} costs are kept low, while service levels are maintained {{is the central}} issue of inventory control, which only regulates two things: the size and the timing of orders. This is typically executed through a planning method, such as the reorder point system or, less frequently, the <b>periodic</b> order <b>quantity</b> system. These take into account a forecast, supposed to gauge the average future demand, and a predetermined safety stock, buffering against forecast errors and demand uncertainty. Pure demand also influences the system, as transactions affect the inventory level. It is crucial to understand how a complete system of demand, forecasts, safety stock calculations and planning methods work together to measure service level and overall cost of the system. This paper outlines a framework for the unambiguous representation of the relations between methods that interpret environmental parameters to plan orders. A number of simulations based on the framework are run to show, how {{the integration of the}} inventory control functions may affect the overall performance of the system. The usefulness of the framework lies in its ability to make a system duplicable (i. e. to transfer an inventory control system to a simulation model, or vice versa). Not only is this property important for creating simulation models that exactly depict the system being analysed, it also enables the study of a complete system for order planning, as opposed to optimising individual methods. Studying an inclusive system allow the same metrics to be used to evaluate changes to any method in the system.

40|$|Background: It is a known {{fact that}} blood flow pattern and more {{specifically}} the pulsatile time variation of shear stress on the vascular wall {{play a key role}} in atherogenesis. The paper presents the conception, the building and the control of a new in vitro test bench that mimics the pulsatile flows behavior based on in vivo measurements. Methods: An in vitro cardiovascular simulator is alimented with in vivo constraints upstream and provided with further post-processing analysis downstream in order to mimic the pulsatile in vivo blood flow quantities. This real-time controlled system is designed to perform real pulsatile in vivo blood flow signals to study endothelial cells' behavior under near physiological environment. The system is based on an internal model controller and a proportional-integral controller that controls a linear motor with customized piston pump, two proportional-integral controllers that control the mean flow rate and temperature of the medium. This configuration enables to mimic any resulting blood flow rate patterns between 40 and 700 ml/min. In order to feed the system with reliable <b>periodic</b> flow <b>quantities</b> in vivo measurements were performed. Data from five patients (1 female, 4 males; ages 44 - 63) were filtered and post-processed using the Newtonian Womersley's solution. These resulting flow signals were compared with 2 D axisymmetric, numerical simulation using a Carreau non-Newtonian model to validate the approximation of a Newtonian behavior. Results: This in vitro test bench reproduces the measured flow rate time evolution and the complexity of in vivo hemodynamic signals within the accuracy of the relative error below 5 %. Conclusions: This post-processing method is compatible with any real complex in vivo signal and demonstrates the heterogeneity of pulsatile patterns in coronary arteries among of different patients. The comparison between analytical and numerical solution demonstrate the fair quality of the Newtonian Womersley's approximation. Therefore, Womersley's solution was used to calculate input flow rate for the in vitro test bench. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to bring}} clarity to the {{dimensioning}} aspects and limiting factors of the modular multilevel converter (MMC). Special consideration {{is given to}} the dc capacitors in the submodules as they are a driving factor for the size and weight of the converter. It is found that if the capacitor voltages are allowed to increase by 10 % the stored energy must be 21 kJ/MW in order to compensate the capacitor voltage ripple. The maximum possible output power can, however, be increased by injecting a second-order harmonic in the circulating current. A great advantage of cascaded converters is the possibility to achieve excellent harmonic performance at low switching frequencies. Therefore, this thesis also considers the relation between switching harmonics, capacitor voltage ripple, and arm quantities. It is shown that despite subharmonics in the capacitor voltages, it is still possible to achieve <b>periodic</b> arm <b>quantities.</b> The balancing of the capacitor voltages is also considered in further detail. It is found {{that it is possible to}} balance the capacitor voltages even at fundamental switching frequency although this will lead to a comparably large capacitor voltage ripple. Therefore, in order to limit the peak-to-peak voltage ripple, it is shown that a predictive algorithm can be used in which the resulting switching frequency is approximately 2 – 3 times the fundamental frequency. This thesis also presents two new submodule concepts. The first submodule simply improves the trade-off between the switching frequency and capacitor voltage balancing. The second submodule includes the possibility to insert negative voltages which allows higher modulation indices compared to half-bridge submodules. A brief comparison of cascaded converters for ac-ac applications is also presented. It is concluded that the MMC appears to be well suited for ac-ac applications where input and output frequencies are close or equal, such as in interconnection of ac grids. In low-frequency applications such as low-speed drives, however, the difficulties with handling the energy variations in the converter arms are much more severe in the MMC compared to the other considered topologies.

40|$|This paper studies a two-echelon {{supply chain}} with {{stochastic}} and discrete consumer demand, batch order <b>quantities,</b> <b>periodic</b> inventory review, and deterministic transportation times. Reorder point policies manage inventories at every location. Average inventory, backorders and fill rates are evaluated exactly for each location. Safety stock is evaluated exactly {{at the lower}} echelon and a good approximation is detailed for the upper echelon. Numerical data are presented to demonstrate the model’s utility. It is found that system costs generally increase substantially if the upper echelon is restricted to carry no inventory, of if the upper echelon is required to provide a high fill rate. In many cases it is optimal to set the upper echelon’s reorder point to yield near zero safety stock, yet in some cases this simple heuristic can significantly increase supply chain operating costs. Finally, policies selected under the assumption of continuous inventory review can perform poorly if implemented in an environment with periodic review.

This article reports a retailer’s challenge to balance transportation, shelf space, and inventory costs. A retailer sells multiple products with stochastic demand. Trucks are dispatched from a warehouse and arrive at a store with a constant lead time. Each truck has a finite capacity and incurs a fixed shipping cost, no matter the number of units shipped. There is a per unit shelf-space cost as well as holding and backorder penalty costs. Three policies are considered for dispatching trucks: a minimum quantity continuous review policy, a full service periodic review policy, and a minimum <b>quantity</b> <b>periodic</b> review policy. The first policy ships a truck when demand since the previous shipment equals a fixed fraction of a truck’s capacity, i. e., a minimum truck utilization.

40|$|This thesis explores how a {{retailer}} should determine whether to source goods domestically vs. directly by imports through international sourcing. Through the research a landed cost model {{was developed and}} designed to calculate the total landed cost of items that were shipped from overseas locations into the US. The landed cost model is different from typical models in that it integrates the physical size of the item to be imported into the total landed cost considerations. With the landed cost estimates at SKU level, the decision of whether to import or to source domestically is derived. What attributes make better import candidates over others given that a landed cost calculator outputs "yes" to import? What {{are some of the}} risks? In addition to creating a landed cost calculator, the research presents approaches around these questions. The characteristics of good import candidates are analyzed through evaluating the variables that contribute to total landed cost. Basker and Van (2008) present theories that examine the two way relationship between the size of a dominant retailer and the imports of consumer goods. They conclude that a chain needs to reach a threshold size before it begins to import. Benchmark studies of import giants like Wal-Mart are presented in this paper to understand how a longer history in the retail sector along with a robust IT infrastructure gives a company an advantage in importing retail goods. The results of this research can help retail companies with new and small import programs understand the variables that are needed to calculate total landed costs with the consideration of container utilization. Additionally it will help the retailer to decide on the best items to import in a smaller program until they can acquire economies of scale through higher import quantities. Ordering methods such as the <b>Periodic</b> Order <b>Quantity</b> Method (POQ) for fixed order periods with variable demand and Newsvendor models for advance ordering are also addressed. The results show that given several import items of varying sizes, there is an optimum region of importing which relates to COGS, size, inventory holding cost, delta of domestic to imports COGS, demand and other costs. The retailer can find this optimum region by applying analytical techniques to evaluate the candidates that are under consideration for importing. In addition to these findings, the organizational and infrastructural needs of a small imports program are addressed.
