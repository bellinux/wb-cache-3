2500|$|An early special type {{of plastic}} film {{capacitors}} were the cellulose acetate film capacitors, also called MKU capacitors. The polar insulating dielectric cellulose acetate was a synthetic resin {{that could be}} made for metallized capacitors in <b>paint</b> <b>film</b> thickness down to about 3µm. [...] A liquid layer of cellulose acetate was first applied to a paper carrier, then covered with wax, dried and then metallized. During winding of the capacitor body, the paper was removed from the metallized film. The remaining thin cellulose acetate layer had a dielectric breakdown of 63V, enough for many of general purpose applications. The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other film capacitors of the time. MKU film capacitors are no longer manufactured, because polyester film capacitors can now be produced in the smaller sizes that were the market niche of the MKU type.|$|E

By removing the heavy metals in the <b>paint</b> <b>film,</b> and {{replacing them with}} more environmentally friendly additives, Clean Core Technology can {{reduce the amount of}} heavy metals released into our waters by up to 90%. These new additives have been specially formulated to provide a more “finetuned” and consistent release of the biocides from the <b>paint</b> <b>film.</b> This results in a more effective bottom paint that requires lower biocide levels to deliver full antifouling protection.|$|E

50|$|Oil paint dries at {{different}} rates due to the differing drying properties of the constituent pigment. However, everything else being equal, the higher the oil to pigment ratio, the longer the oil binder will take to oxidize, and the more flexible the <b>paint</b> <b>film</b> will be. Conversely, the lower the oil content, the faster the paint dries, and the more brittle it will be. Ignoring this practice, even in some alla prima painting, {{may result in a}} cracked and less durable <b>paint</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E

50|$|The leading use of dry-ground mica in the US is {{in joint}} {{compound}} for filling and finishing seams and blemishes in gypsum wallboard (drywall). The mica {{acts as a}} filler and extender, provides a smooth consistency, improves the workability of the compound, and provides resistance to cracking. In 2008, joint compound accounted for 54% of dry-ground mica consumption. In the paint industry, ground mica {{is used as a}} pigment extender that also facilitates suspension, reduces chalking, prevents shrinking and shearing of the <b>paint</b> <b>film,</b> increases resistance of the <b>paint</b> <b>film</b> to water penetration and weathering, and brightens the tone of colored pigments. Mica also promotes paint adhesion in aqueous and oleoresinous formulations. Consumption of dry-ground mica in paint, the second ranked use, accounted for 22% of the dry-ground mica used in 2008.|$|E

50|$|Fat over lean {{refers to}} the {{principle}} in oil painting of applying paint with a higher oil to pigment ratio ('fat') over paint with a lower oil to pigment ratio ('lean') to ensure a stable <b>paint</b> <b>film,</b> since {{it is believed that}} the paint with the higher oil content remains more flexible.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of paint strippers is {{penetration of the}} <b>paint</b> <b>film</b> by the molecules of the active ingredient, causing its swelling; this volume increase causes internal strains, which, together with the weakening of the layer's adhesion to the underlying surface, leads to separation of the layer of the paint from the substrate.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} deals with 20 th century {{manufactured}} artists' oil paints containing raw and burnt umber pigments, this is, natural earth pigments {{resulting from the}} combination of iron and manganese oxides.

Several manufactured artists' oil <b>paint</b> <b>films</b> containing manganese were selected. Dried films from raw and burnt umber oil paints by Winsor&Newton® (UK), Grumbacher® (USA), Gamblin® (USA) and Speedball® (USA) were studied and information about their chemical composition and mechanical behaviour is here presented. In addition to the identification and the study of the inorganic and organic components present in each formulation through LM, SEM-EDX, FTIR-ATR, XRD, GC-MS analysis, tensile tests were run and stress-strain curves were obtained. Together with evident hue differences, the obtained results showed significant differences in the chemical composition and the mechanical behaviour of the oil <b>paint</b> <b>films...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} some research into the evaluation of mineral spirits-based microemulsions as wet surface cleaning systems for artists’ acrylic emulsion <b>paint</b> <b>films.</b> Examples from four different mineral spirits-based microemulsion systems were evaluated, each having a different primary surfactant component. Particular attention is given here to determination, using surface-sensitive analytical techniques (ATR-FTIR, XPS and ToF-SIMS), of possible microemulsion surfactant residues remaining on <b>paint</b> <b>films</b> after wet cleaning treatment. Three different test <b>paint</b> <b>films</b> were subjected to simulated cleaning treatments: Golden Heavy Body Acrylic PY 3 (azo yellow); Liquitex Heavy Body Artist Acrylic PY 3 (azo yellow); and Liquitex Heavy Body Artist Acrylic PW 6 (titanium white). In comparison with untreated controls, samples were analysed by the above methods at two stages: after treatment with cleaning liquid but without any clearance step, and again after clearance of any residue with hydrocarbon solvent. These investigations have shown that only trace amounts of surfactant residues may remain on paint surfaces. Indications {{of the presence of}} residual surfactant naturally depends on the respective sensitivities of the different analytical techniques: the detection limit for ATR-FTIR is lower than XPS and ToF-SIMS. As {{has been shown to be}} the case for aqueous treatments, levels of intrinsic surfactant in acrylic <b>paint</b> <b>films</b> and migrated surfactant located at paint surfaces can also be affected by these cleaning treatments...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{changes to}} acrylic {{emulsion}} <b>paint</b> <b>films</b> duringwet surface cleaning treatments {{is a priority}} for conservatorsof modern painted surfaces. To explore the presence,extraction and removal of soluble components fromacrylic <b>paint</b> <b>films,</b> contemporar y <b>paint</b> samples and worksof art were examined using several FTIR-based techniquesincluding: transmission microscopy, attenuated totalreflectance (ATR) and in-situ non-invasive mid-IRreflectance spectroscopy. The major constituents identifiedon paint surfaces and extracted from bulk films werenon-ionic polyethoxylate (PEO) type surfactants used asdispersing agents and emulsion stabilisers. The identificationof other extracted constituents was hampered by lowconcentrations and the proprietar y nature of many additives. Surface surfactant was removed within five to twentyseconds by aqueous swabbing treatment, by acceleratedlight ageing, and was relatively unaffected by aliphatic solvents. Monitoring of contemporar y <b>paint</b> <b>films</b> after aqueouscleaning treatment confirms that surfactant continuesto migrate to the surface. The analysis of contemporar ypaint films suggests surface surfactant abundance is primarilyinfluenced by brand.
