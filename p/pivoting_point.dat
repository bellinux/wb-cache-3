The camshaft {{is surrounded by a}} partially open drum which has secondary rocker arms attached to it via a <b>pivoting</b> <b>point.</b> These secondary rocker arms, which have a varying depth profile (similar to cams), are directly actuated by the camshaft, in a scissor-like manner. The primary rocker arms are actuated by the secondary (drum attached) rocker arms. The drum will only rotate to advance or retard the position of the secondary rocker arms, to take advantage of their varying profiles. Thus, through varying the position of the drum about its axis, each cam profile is changed to an optimal height for maximum engine performance without sacrificing fuel efficiency at lower speeds.|$|E

40|$|A seesaw-like {{movement}} of the relay region upon the recovery step of myosin was recently simulated in silico. In this model the relay helix tilts around its <b>pivoting</b> <b>point</b> formed by a phenylalanine cluster (Phe 481, Phe 482, and Phe 652), which moves the lever arm of myosin. To study {{the effect of the}} elimination of the proposed <b>pivoting</b> <b>point,</b> these phenylalanines were mutated to alanines in two Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain constructs (MF 481 A, F 482 A and MF 652 A). The relay movement was followed by the fluorescence change of Trp 501 located in the relay region. The steady-state and transient kinetic fluorescence experiments showed that the lack of the phenylalanine fulcrum perturbs the formation of the “up” lever arm state, and only moderate effects were found in the nucleotide binding, the formation of the “down” lever arm position, and the ATP hydrolysis steps. We conclude that the lack of the fulcrum decouples the distal part of the relay from the nucleotide binding site upon the recovery step. Our molecular dynamics simulations also showed that the conformation of the motor is not perturbed by the mutation in the down lever arm state, however, the lack of the <b>pivoting</b> <b>point</b> rearranges the dynamic pattern of the kink region of the relay helix...|$|E

40|$|Insects show a large {{variety in}} prey capture strategies, with a {{correspondingly}} large diversity in predatory adaptations. We studied {{a specific type}} of predatory claws, these can for example be found in praying mantis species. The claw is closeable over its entire length and the prey is fixed between the femur (upper arm) and the tibia (lower arm) of the insect leg. The morphology of these predatory claws is diverse. Some species have straight claws covered with spines, while other species have smooth, curved claws. We have studied the mechanics of this femur-tibia type of predatory insect claws, by making a physical model, eventually trying to explain why in some insect species the claws are curved instead of straight. The main results are (1) when comparing curved claws to straight claws, curvature leads to a strong reduction of forces driving the prey away from the <b>pivoting</b> <b>point,</b> thereby reducing the need for friction generating structures. (2) In the curved claw model a position exists where the resulting force on the prey is exactly zero. This is because the normal forces on the femur and tibia are opposed, and in line. At this position the prey is perfectly clamped and not driven out of the claw. This feature does not exist in straight claws. (3) In the curved claw, the prey cannot be placed at a position further than a certain maximum distance from the <b>pivoting</b> <b>point.</b> Near this maximum position, the resulting force on the prey reaches high values because moment arms are near zero. (4) Between the zero position and the maximum position the resulting force is directed toward the <b>pivoting</b> <b>point,</b> which stabilizes prey fixation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{initiation}} of motion of an object lying on a horizontal floor due to the aerodynamic force produced by a time-dependent wind is considered. It is assumed in this paper that when the aerodynamic force is large enough, the body starts to rotate around the most rearward supporting contact point, or <b>pivoting</b> <b>point.</b> This motion is analyzed by studying {{the dynamics of the}} rotation of the body around a <b>pivoting</b> <b>point</b> fixed to the floor, and placed in a gravity field under time-dependent aerodynamic loads produced by a non-steady incoming flow. This rotation initiation phase, which is relevant {{in the case of a}} time-varying gusty flow, is an intermediate phase between the two stages generally considered, namely, the initial static equilibrium without motion, and the final flight. In this intermediate phase, which is studied here, the rotational dynamics of the body should be taken into account and the gust characteristics as well, in order to determine whether once initiated the motion it leads to either a frustrated motion or to a successful one. A non-linear mathematical model has been developed, and a linear approximation is deduced, which allows us to obtain the condition for a successful flight. This condition shows two limits, valid for either long or short duration gusts, respectively. Some experiments have been performed in a gust wind tunnel, and results show a satisfactory agreement. To take into account the intrinsic random character of the phenomena in practical situations, expressions for the probability of exceeding the condition for successful flight under short duration gusts are obtained, assuming common probability density functions for the random parameters involved...|$|E

In this thesis, we develop block iterative methods for the collocation equations of elliptic PDEs defined on a rectangle and subject to uncoupled mixed boundary conditions. For model problems of this type, we derive analytic expressions for the eigenvalues of the block Jacobi iteration matrix: and determine the optimal parameter for the block SOR method. For the case of general domains, the iterative solution of tile collocation equations is still an open problem. We address this open problem b...|$|E

2500|$|An {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a pendulum}} {{that has its}} center of mass above its <b>pivot</b> <b>point.</b> It is often implemented with the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> mounted on a cart that can move horizontally and may be called a cart and pole {{as shown in the}} photo. Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 degree of freedom by affixing the pole to an axis of rotation. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downwards, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a torque at the <b>pivot</b> <b>point,</b> by moving the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> horizontally as part of a feedback system, changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the pivot axis and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> vertically.

40|$|Myosins are actin-based motors {{that are}} {{generally}} believed to move by amplifying small structural {{changes in the}} core motor domain via a lever arm rotation of the light chain binding domain. However, {{the lack of a}} quantitative agreement between observed step sizes and the length of the proposed lever arms from different myosins challenges this view. We analyzed the step size of rat myosin 1 d (Myo 1 d) and surprisingly found that this myosin takes unexpectedly large steps in comparison to other myosins. Engineering the length of the light chain binding domain of rat Myo 1 d resulted in a linear increase of step size in relation to the putative lever arm length, indicative of a lever arm rotation of the light chain binding domain. The extrapolated <b>pivoting</b> <b>point</b> resided in the same region of the rat Myo 1 d head domain as in conventional myosins. Therefore, rat Myo 1 d achieves its larger working stroke by a large calculated ∼ 90 ° rotation of the light chain binding domain.

Thus, the basic elements of a lever include effort, load or resistance, a lever arm, <b>pivoting</b> <b>point</b> and a fulcrum. In this theoretical paper, I have mapped several concepts onto the following elements of a lever; the psychological world onto ‘effort’, the socio-material world onto ‘load’, history, culture, and tradition onto the ‘lever arm’, temporality onto the ‘pivoting point’, narratives onto the ‘fulcrum ’ and a ‘chronotope ’ onto the ground. Who is the ‘One ’ that attempts to move the ‘other ’ and how does he use the elements of a ‘lever ’ to do so? In a phallocratic culture, the difference between a set of dualities is constructed as binary opposites and the positive terms, which dominate the binary, are linked to one particular sex. Thus, man (the ‘One’) is valued over woman (its negative ‘other’). If we are to transform culture we need to destabilise the binary opposition that is founded in the male/female couple (Cixous, 1981).
