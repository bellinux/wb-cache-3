5|$|By September6, {{farmers in}} {{southern}} {{areas of the}} country requested aid from the government. In South Jeolla Province, ₩35billion (US$31.1million) was allocated for post-storm recovery. Of this, about half went to repairing <b>public</b> <b>facilities.</b> Across the province, repairs were expected to be completed by October or November 2012. On September11, the Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister announced that residents severely affected by the typhoon were eligible for up to ₩50million (US$44,000) in construction assistance. Economically, Typhoons Bolaven and Tembin contributed to a 6.6% decrease in construction investment, the largest drop since January 2003.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{suggests}} that a critical reassessment {{of the theory of}} <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> location is long overdue. A comprehensive theory should contain three standard analytical components: location as access; location as externality; and definition of the policy context for <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> planning. Recent empirical research on mental health facility location is used to illustrate the significance of these analytical themes. Ten years ago, Michael Teitz published an important paper which advocated the development of a distinctive theory for urban <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> location (Teitz 1968). In the decade that followed, a considerable litera-ture has appeared around this theme (Freestone 1977). That the majority of this subsequent research has remained within the bounds of the initial paradigm is a tribute to the synthesis achieved by Teitz. The contention of this essay is, however, that a fundamental realignment of the <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> location theory paradigm is necessary. There are two reasons for this asser-tion. First, in spite of the richness of the paradigm defined by Teitz, hi...|$|R

5|$|Marshall's {{last years}} were productive. By May 1937, he was {{appointed}} {{as director of the}} Forest Service's Division of Recreation and Lands. Over the next two years, Marshall worked on two major initiatives: an effort to extend national forest recreational opportunities to people with lower incomes (as well as dismantling discriminatory barriers against ethnic minorities), and a program to preserve more wilderness within the national forests. His biographer James Glover asserts that Marshall was probably the first high-level official to seriously fight ethnic discrimination in Forest Service recreational policies, at a time when racial segregation of <b>public</b> <b>facilities</b> was law throughout the Southern states and in some other states. During this time, Marshall continued to financially support The Wilderness Society, as well as various civil rights, labor, and socialist organizations.|$|E
