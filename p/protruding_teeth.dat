5|$|Over time, some {{attributes}} now {{regarded as}} integral became {{incorporated into the}} vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared {{over the course of}} the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing <b>protruding</b> <b>teeth,</b> and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.|$|E
5|$|With its heavyset body, conical bulbous snout, {{and large}} mouth filled with <b>protruding</b> <b>teeth,</b> the {{bigeye sand tiger}} looks much like the better-known sand tiger shark. The large eyes lack nictitating membranes, and behind them are small spiracles. The corner of the mouth extends to behind {{the level of the}} eyes, and the jaws are highly protrusible. There are 34–43 upper and 37–46 lower tooth rows; these include zero to two rows of small teeth at the upper {{symphysis}} (jaw midpoint) and two to four more rows at the lower symphysis. In each half of the upper jaw, the teeth in the first and second rows are large, those in the third and sometimes fourth rows are small, and those in the rows after are large again. Each tooth has a narrow, awl-like central cusp flanked by one smaller cusplet on each side; this contrasts with the smalltooth sand tiger, which has two or three lateral cusplets on each side. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
25|$|Daemonosaurus (pron.:"DAY-mow-no-SORE-us") is an extinct genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur {{from the}} Late Triassic of New Mexico. Fossils {{have been found}} from deposits in the Chinle Formation, which is latest Triassic in age. While theropods had diversified into several specialized groups by this time, Daemonosaurus is a basal theropod that lies outside the clade Neotheropoda. Daemonosaurus is unusual among early theropods in {{that it had a}} short skull and long <b>protruding</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E

25|$|The sand tiger {{is often}} {{associated}} with being vicious or deadly, due to its relatively large size and sharp, <b>protruding</b> <b>teeth</b> that point outward from its jaws; however, these sharks are quite docile, and are not a threat to humans. Their mouths are not large enough to cause a human fatality. Sand tigers roam the surf, sometimes in close proximity to humans, and there have been only a few instances of unprovoked sand tiger shark attacks on humans, usually associated with spear fishing, line fishing, or shark feeding. As of 2013, the database of Shark Attack Survivors does not list any fatalities due to sand tiger sharks. When the sharks become aggressive, they tend to steal fish or bait from fishing lines rather than attack humans. Owing to its large size and docile temperament, the sand tiger is commonly displayed in aquariums around the world.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the <b>protruding</b> <b>teeth.</b> Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|E
500|$|One {{thread of}} {{critical}} analysis of this tale focuses on the possibly racist implications of Poe's plot and imagery. One such plot element is the black cook who leads the mutiny on the Grampus and is its most bloodthirsty participant. Dirk Peters, a hybrid of white and Native American ancestry, is described as having a ferocious appearance, with long, <b>protruding</b> <b>teeth,</b> bowed legs, and a bald head like [...] "the head of most negroes." [...] The brilliant whiteness of the final figure in the novel contrasts with the dark-skinned savages and such a contrast may call to mind the escalating racial tensions over the question of slavery in the United States as Poe was writing the novel.|$|E

50|$|Their {{most obvious}} {{external}} differences from alligators are {{visible in the}} head. Crocodiles have narrower and longer heads, and more V-shaped than U-shaped snouts. The alligator's upper jaw is wider than its lower jaw, and the teeth in the lower jaw fit into small depressions in the upper jaw. The upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed. When the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the <b>protruding</b> <b>tooth</b> is the most reliable feature to define a species.|$|R
500|$|Drax is {{physically}} abnormal, as {{are many of}} Bond's later adversaries. He has very broad shoulders, a large head and <b>protruding</b> <b>teeth</b> with diastema; his face is badly scarred from a wartime explosion. According to the writers Kingsley Amis and Benson—both of whom subsequently wrote Bond novels—Drax is the most successful villain in the Bond canon. Amis considers this to be [...] "because the most imagination and energy has gone into his portrayal. He lives in the real world... his physical presence fills Moonraker. The view is shared by Chancellor, who considers Drax [...] "perhaps the most believable" [...] of all Fleming's villains. The cultural historian Jeremy Black writes that as with Le Chiffre and Mr Big—the villains {{of the first two}} Bond novels—Drax's origins and war history are vital {{to an understanding of the}} character. Like several other antagonists in the Bond canon, Drax was German, reminding readers of a familiar threat in 1950s Britain. Because Drax is without a girlfriend or wife he is, according to the norms of Fleming and his works, abnormal in Bond's world.|$|E
500|$|There {{were other}} {{considerable}} advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty. The 10th-century {{invention of the}} pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges. There was the Song-era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships. If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water. The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure. Stern-mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in {{a wider range of}} water depths. The Song arranged the <b>protruding</b> <b>teeth</b> of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction. David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement [...] " [...] them more reliable" [...] for anchoring ships.|$|E

60|$|They {{were a very}} {{singular}} trio.

The first was Sorley Wilson, {{the son of the}} owner of the Nonpareil Coalpit. He was a young blood of twenty, heir to a fortune, a keen sportsman, and down for the Easter Vacation from Magdalene College. He sat now upon the edge of the surgery table, looking in thoughtful silence at Montgomery and twisting the ends of his small, black, waxed moustache. The second was Purvis, the publican, owner of the chief beer-shop, and well known as the local bookmaker. He was a coarse, clean-shaven man, whose fiery face made a singular contrast with his ivory-white bald head. He had shrewd, light-blue eyes with foxy lashes, and he also leaned forward in silence from his chair, a fat, red hand upon either knee, and stared critically at the young assistant.

40|$|Background : Dento-alveolar trauma {{resulted}} from accidents involving the oral regions mostly affect the upper central incisors. Overjet {{that is beyond}} 5 mm and incompetent lip also contribute to increase the risk. Several literatures had already discussed different methods of replantation of avulsed teeth. However, it was not meant for further orthodontic treatment. Purpose : The objective of this review is to propose a simple replantation protocol of avulsed teeth which also prevent from ankylosis. Reviews : <b>Protruded</b> <b>teeth</b> usually need orthodontic treatment; therefore, an appropriate management {{should be done to}} avoid the development of ankylosis. Ankylosis of the periodontal ligament (PDL) becomes a problem in orthodontic tooth movement in repositioned or replanted teeth. In addition, ankylosed teeth also more susceptible to root resorption. Actually, it was caused by the endodontic treatment. In particular, severely <b>protruded</b> or unoccluded <b>teeth</b> are hypofunctional, therefore have narrow PDL, thus it may facilitate to ankylosis development. Ideal management protocol {{such as the use of}} root canal sealer i. e. mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA); the using of Emdogain, and resilient wiring or semi-rigid fixation with brackets has become a solution in avulsed teeth arranged for orthodontic treatment. Nevertheless, the presence of oral surgeon, endodontist and orthodontist in the same time, and also ideal preparations after an accident was difficult to achieve. Conclusion : Considering that reducing the ongoing PDL inflammation with intracanal medicaments and maintaining the functional force during mastication is possible; it is concluded that this simple replantation protocol is likely. </span...|$|R
