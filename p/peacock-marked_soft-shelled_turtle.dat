50|$|Scientifically, {{the black}} <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> or Bostami Turtle (Aspideretes Nigricans, {{sometimes}} placed in genus Nilssonia) is {{a species of}} freshwater turtle found in India (Assam) and Bangladesh (Chittagong). They have been long-believed to be inbred variants of the Ganges <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> (A. gangeticus or N. gangeticus) or the Peacock <b>Soft-shelled</b> <b>Turtle</b> (A. hurum or N. hurum). While it is a close relative of the latter, it is a distinct species. As of 2002, the IUCN classified the species as Extinct in the Wild.|$|R

Instead, we analyzed the embryos of a <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> species with highly emarginated skull. In fact, <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> have only a narrow bar of bone across the temporal region lateral to the external adductor muscles due to large scale emargination from the dorsal and ventral margins of the cheek (Ogushi, 1911, Sheil, 2003). In normal development of <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles,</b> the postorbital bone does not grow in a posterior direction significantly, keeping its relatively small size within the dermatocranium (Sheil, 2003;Sánchez-Villagra et al.,, Sánchez-Villagra et al., Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2009). Therefore, the small postorbital bone of <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> does not largely contribute {{to the formation of}} a bony roof at the temporal region of the skull.|$|R

40|$|The {{capability}} of Chlorella vulgaris to remove nitrogen {{in the form}} of ammonium ions from the <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> processing wastewater in a local agricultural products limited company (in Hangzhou, China) was studied. The <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> processing wastewater was found to include high concentrations of nitrogen (107. 63 ± 4. 84 mg/L) {{in the form of}} ammonium (NH 4 +) with the small amounts of nitrite (0. 32 ± 0. 04 mg/L on annual average) at pH 6. 7 and to be suitable for growing Chlorella vulgaris. When Chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in a batch mode, a majority of the nitrogen concentration was dramatically removed after a lag-phase period. The total biomass weight gained during the entire cultivation period balanced out well with the nitrogen removed from the culture medium. These results indicate that Chlorella vulgaris has potential to remove nitrogen (i. e., ammonium ion) and nitrite at a reasonable uptake rate from wastewater while being cultivated using the <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> processing wastewater...|$|R
5000|$|The head of Amyda cartilaginea can {{be black}} or brown. Its head {{typically}} displays yellow dots that sometimes appear to fuse together, creating elongated streaks. As the turtle ages, its nape region becomes white or gray. [...] A trait that helps differentiate the Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> from other similar species is its noticeably elongated snout. This is an adaptation that, coupled with its great flexibility, aids the turtle in breathing {{when it has}} buried itself. [...] Increased gas exchange, {{a result of an}} adaptation known as [...] "pharyngel breathing", allows the Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> to remain submerged in water for extended periods of time. [...] Amyda cartilaginea has several permanent tubercles on its neck; [...] these tubercles can appear yellow or black. The Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle's</b> limbs also have yellow spots, but these are usually less in quantity and difficult to distinguish. Its feet are wide and flat, resembling paddles. As a final descriptive note, the males have longer and thicker tails than females.|$|R

Thirty days exposure of short photoperiod with 2 L: 22 D increased relative weight, follicular epithelial height and peroxidase activity of the thyroid gland; whereas exposure of long photoperiod with 22 L: 2 D for 30 days showed reversed changes to those of the short photoperiod in adult female turtles. These findings indicate that short photoperiod stimulates thyroid activity and long photoperiod inhibits its activity in <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles.</b> It is suggested that photoperiod exerts its action on thyroid activity presumably via gonads and/or pineal-gonadal axis in turtles...|$|R
