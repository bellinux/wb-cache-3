In order {{to assess the impact}} of food environments on population diets, it is necessary to monitor <b>population</b> diet <b>quality</b> between countries and over time. This paper reviews existing data sources suitable for monitoring <b>population</b> diet <b>quality,</b> and assesses their strengths and limitations. A step-wise framework is then proposed for monitoring <b>population</b> diet <b>quality.</b> Food balance sheets (FBaS), household budget and expenditure surveys (HBES) and food intake surveys are all suitable methods for assessing <b>population</b> diet <b>quality.</b> In the proposed ‘minimal’ approach, national trends of food and energy availability can be explored using FBaS. In the ‘expanded’ and ‘optimal’ approaches, the dietary share of ultra-processed products is measured as an indicator of energy-dense, nutrient-poor diets using HBES and food intake surveys, respectively. In addition, it is proposed that pre-defined diet quality indices are used to score diets, and some of those have been designed for application within all three monitoring approaches. However, in order to enhance the value of global efforts to monitor diet quality, data collection methods and diet quality indicators need further development work...|$|R

These surgeries were instances of sterilization abuse, a term applied to any sterilization performed without the consent or knowledge of the recipient, or in which the recipient is pressured into accepting the surgery.

5000|$|An {{increase}} in the prevalence of ultrasound technology in the country has led to more screening for abnormal fetuses.9 While women in the Western world are commonly offered one or two ultrasounds throughout the entire duration of their pregnancy, {{it is not uncommon}} for Vietnamese women to have more than 20 ultrasounds during one pregnancy.9 The focus of these ultrasounds are often much different than in Western countries, where parents look forward to determining the sex of their baby or seeing photos of the developing fetus. Because of the prevalence of birth defects due to Agent Orange in Vietnam, ultrasounds are often a means for quelling the fears of expectant mothers.9 The Vietnamese Commission for Population, Family, and Children, gave a statement in 2004 describing their support for prenatal screening in hopes that it may promote <b>population</b> <b>quality</b> that would allow Vietnam to enter into a phase of modernization and industrialization alongside other Southeast Asian countries.9 This focus on Vietnam's national [...] "stock" [...] was in part based on Japan's efforts beginning in 1945 to strengthen the physicality and quality of their population through genetics programs, encouraging scientists to have many children, and the legalization of marriage with foreigners.9 ...|$|E

50|$|If {{you live}} in {{northern}} Idaho, and you develop back pain, {{chances are good that}} you’ll undergo surgery to treat your pain. Move to the southern tip of Texas, however, and the chances that you’ll undergo that same surgery will drop by a factor of 6. The surgery is no more effective in Idaho than it is in Texas. It’s just that doctors in the northwest are more likely than those in southern Texas to recommend surgery. This phenomenon, in which doctors practice medicine differently depending on where they’re from, is called practice pattern variation. And it isn’t limited to treating back pain, or even surgical decisions. There is also variation in treatment for chronic conditions, such as use of beta blockers for individuals with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) or lipid testing for those with diabetes.Wennberg and colleagues at the Dartmouth Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences documented these wide variations in how healthcare is practiced around the United States. They have asserted that most of this variation is unwarranted. Health Dialog was built to address unwarranted variation in healthcare: the overuse, underuse and misuse of medical care. Wennberg and his colleagues concluded that if unwarranted variation in the US healthcare system could be reduced, the quality of care would go up and healthcare costs would go down. Studies have shown that if unwarranted variation could be reduced in the Medicare <b>population,</b> <b>quality</b> of care would rise dramatically and costs could be lowered by as much as 30%.|$|E

Because many poor households around the world grow food that they both consume and sell for income, agricultural interventions can have a massive effect on the lives of people in developing countries. Through the decades, and most famously in Asia’s Green Revolution, development projects have sought to boost agricultural production of staple foods as a way of improving people’s nutrition. Yet, while consuming a sufficient quantity of calories is important, especially among undernourished <b>populations,</b> <b>quality</b> matters too. Thus, the traditional focus on producing enough food to meet people’s calorie needs has evolved into a deeper understanding that to improve nutrition, we also need people to consume balanced, high-quality, and diverse diets that contain enough essential nutrients to meet their daily requirements.
