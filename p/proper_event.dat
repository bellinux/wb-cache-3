Benefiting from the high statistics from e + e − experiments at the Z 0 resonance, {{it is possible to}} impose strong two-jet cuts on the data without loosing the statistical significance. In these events perturbative activity is suppressed and hadronization effects can be more prominent. We show that after <b>proper</b> <b>event</b> cuts a set of observables are sensitive to differences in the hadronization models.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the possible large extra dimensions (LED) effects {{induced by the}} Kaluza-Klein gravitons up to the QCD next-to-leading order (NLO) on $ZZW$ production at the large hadron collider (LHC). The integrated cross sections and some kinematic distributions are presented in both the standard model (SM) and the LED model. The numerical results demonstrate that the NLO QCD corrections are sizeable and remarkably reduce the leading order (LO) LED effect depending strongly on the phase space. The NLO LED relative discrepancies of the total cross section could become sizable for the $ZZW$ production, if we apply <b>proper</b> <b>event</b> selection criteria. We find that the LO result overestimates the LED effect and is insufficient to provide a believable theoretical prediction. Comment: 17 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|Automating {{software}} evolution requires both identifying {{precisely the}} affected program points and selecting the appropriate modification at each point. This task is particularly complicated when considering a large program, {{even when the}} modifications appear to be systematic. We illustrate this situation {{in the context of}} evolving the Linux kernel to support Bossa, an event-based framework for process-scheduler development. To support Bossa, events must be added at points scattered throughout the kernel. In each case, the choice of event depends on properties of one or a sequence of instructions. To describe precisely the choice of event, we propose to guide the event insertion by using a set of rules, amounting to an aspect, that describes the control-flow contexts in which each event should be generated. In this paper, we present our approach and describe the set of rules that allows <b>proper</b> <b>event</b> insertion. These rules use temporal logic to describe sequences of instructions that require events to be inserted.

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} general event classification from uncontrolled YouTube videos. It is a challenging task due {{to the number of}} possible categories and large intra-class variations. On one hand, how to define <b>proper</b> <b>event</b> category labels and how to obtain training samples for these categories need to be explored; on the other hand, it is non-trivial to achieve satisfactory classification performance. To address these problems, a text mining pipeline is first proposed to automatically discover a collection of video event categories. Part-of-Speech (POS) analysis is applied to YouTube video titles and descriptions, and WordNet hierarchy is employed to refine the category selection. This results in 29, 163 video event categories. A POS-based query method is then applied to video titles, and 6, 538, 319 video samples are obtained from YouTube to represent these categories. To improve classification performance, video content-based features are complemented with scores from a set of classifiers, which can be regarded as a type of high-level features.

40|$|The {{characterization}} {{and identification}} of small magnitude seismic sources using regional observations involves {{the analysis of}} signals from natural and man made sources. <b>Proper</b> <b>event</b> classification will depend upon the appropriate assessment of source and propagation path effects. Our work is intended to investigate supplementary procedures and data sets that can improve source characterization procedures. Several approaches to improved source identification procedures have been investigated including: (1) Execution of contained calibration explosions; (2) Utilization of regional array data for improved separation of source and propagation path effects; (3) Development of in-mine ground truth through mine records or on site instrumentation; (4) Combining seismic and infrasound data for source characterization. A series of single-fired calibration shots were detonated in a mine in NE Wyoming {{for the purpose of}} developing source scaling relations and comparison to typical delay-fired explosions.

40|$|The LPCTrap {{facility}} {{coupled to}} the low-energy beam line LIRAT of the SPIRAL installation at GANIL is a transparent Paul trap designed to perform in-trap decay experiments [1]. The first detection setup installed at this facility {{has been designed}} in order to precisely determine the b-n angular correlation coefficient abn in the pure Gamow-Teller decay of 6 He [2]. This coefficient constitutes a sensitive observable to search for exotic couplings in the weak interaction. In the case of 6 He decay, a deviation of abn from the Standard Model value (- 1 / 3) would imply {{the existence of a}} tensor like interaction mediated by new bosons called leptoquarks. The detection setup arranged in a back to back configuration enables to measure the positions and the energies of the b particle and the recoiling ion. This allows the full reconstruction of the decay kinematics and a <b>proper</b> <b>event</b> selection. During the first data taking at GANIL, up to 105 decay coincidences between the b particles and the recoiling ions were recorded, which corresponds to a statistical uncertainty of 2 % on the correlation parameter. The detailed analysis of these data was performed using a realistic simulation of the experiment, which accounts for several factors like the phase space of the decaying ions, the RF field effect on the recoil motion and the characteristics of the detection setup. In this contribution, the uncertainties induced on abn by these main systematic effects will be discussed. During the last experiment, more than 2 x 106 coincident events were recorded, which should enable to achieve a 0. 5 % statistical precision on the measurement of abn...|$|E

40|$|With proton beams colliding at {{an energy}} of 7 TeV in the center-of-mass (8 TeV in 2012), the Large Hadron Collider allows {{physicists}} to experimentally access {{regions of the}} phase-space that were previously unexplored. In this thesis, the cross-section of the top-antitop quark pair was measured, namely how often the top-antitop quark pair is produced, by identifying those topologies with a single-lepton in their final state. The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle known to date, and due to its mass {{it is expected to}} play an important role in understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism, the procedure with which particles gain mass. The top-antitop quark pair cross-section is the first step towards gaining a better understanding of the top quark physics at the energies provided by the LHC.

40|$|Projecte fet en col. laboració amb Lappeenrannan Teknillien Yliopisto, Department of Information Technology, Communications Software Laboratory. This {{project was}} born to cover a {{specific}} aspect of the wireless networks related to the service delivery considering a generic taxonomy where different agents can exhibit a heterogeneous offer of services and, at the same time, clients {{may be interested in}} different activities at the same time. In this scope, the need of a common way of interaction between clients and servers can be perceived to overcome the probable lack of generality in this whole picture. Two main objectives where defined and prosecuted in order to plant the first stone in the definition of a protocol to support a fair, transparent and effective service selection in wireless scenarios. First, the determination of a generic way of characterizing the different services therefore deriving to a template based descriptive object. Second, the implementation of a mechanism capable of using this format of description in order to inform the client about the best option to chose at any given moment. Following the first general objective, a series of analytical studies in terms of the parameters {{that could be used to}} describe a service where performed using as test examples Printing, Image Recognition and File Sharing services. The major efforts were done in the appliance of three discriminative patterns regarding how general or specific, static or variant and the type of limitation (maximum or minimum) each parameter is. The principle conclusions of these studies were the following. First, an important group of parameters were common to the different services under study. Second, the existence of a trade-off between the precision of the characterization (via more contextual parameters) and the homogenization of the descriptive set of parameters. Finally, each parameter could be expressed using the pair formed by the offered and demanded values. In the second place, a local agent supported by the PeerHood middleware designed to run on the client’s machine was defined and implemented in C++. This agent, known as 3 WAServer, is intended to act as an active environmental monitor to assist the client’s applications in the service selection process. The bases of this assistance rely on the definition of a profile describing mainly the client’s requirements and a template containing the server’s offer. Using that information, the 3 WA-Server is able to rate each particular service to provide each application with a numerical and normalized value between 0 and 1 where 0. 5 or higher means complete fulfillment of the requirements. Based on these grades, the application is in position of performing a solid decision concerning the next server provider to select. The assignation of the grade to each service relies on three layer neural network balanced with a set of weights specified by the application according to its particular requirements. The network is fed with the profile and the template associated to the application acting as a client and the service provided by a particular server respectively. An experiment was set and executed in order to get a first and introductory estimation of the validity of the 3 WA-Server as a service selection assistant. The experiment consisted in the deployment of two servers offering the same two services and a client moving from one to the other. This client was running local services as well. The results of the experiment pointed out that, first, the delays associated to the transmission of the parameters describing the service offered by the server were more than tolerable. Secondly, the management and execution of the neural network were proven to be effective and low resource demanding. Finally, the grading system and the proactive interaction between the local applications and the 3 WA-Server suggested an expected behavior in terms of <b>proper</b> <b>event</b> generation and result notification. Nonetheless, this approach stands for a very first simulation, hence, further study and exhaustive revision are to be done...|$|E
