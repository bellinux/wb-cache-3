"The {{service at}} sea, {{as it has}} been very large and {{extensive}} in itself, so it has been carried on, through the whole course of the war, in a manner highly disadvantageous to your Majesty and your kingdom: for the necessity of affairs requiring that great fleets should be fitted out every year, as well for the maintaining a superiority in the Mediterranean, as for opposing any force which the enemy might prepare, either at Dunkirk, or in the ports of West France, your Majesty's example and readiness in fitting out your proportion of ships, for all parts of that service, have been so far from prevailing with the States General to keep pace with you, that they have been deficient every year to a great degree, in proportion to what your Majesty hath furnished; sometimes no less than two-thirds, and generally more than half of their quota: from hence your Majesty has been obliged, for the preventing disappointments in the most <b>pressing</b> <b>services,</b> to supply those deficiencies by additional reinforcements of your own ships; nor hath the single increase of such a charge been the only ill consequence that attended it; for by this means the debt of the navy hath been enhanced, so that the discounts arising upon the credit of it have affected all other parts of the service. From the same cause, your Majesty's ships of war have been forced in greater numbers to continue in remote seas, and at unseasonable times of the year, to the great damage and decay of the British navy. This also hath been the occasion that your Majesty hath been straitened in your convoys for trade; your coasts have been exposed, for want of a sufficient number of cruisers to guard them; and you have been disabled from annoying the enemy, in their most beneficial commerce with the West Indies, from whence they received those vast supplies of treasure, without which they could not have supported the expenses of this war.|$|E

The availability of information and communication technology solutions provide libraries, archives and museums with a way forward. However, cost constraints present a real challenge to institutions, especially in the developing world where digitization projects must compete for scarce resources with many other <b>pressing</b> <b>services.</b> In the competition for resources special collections sometimes play second fiddle to immediate services, for example user facilities. The Library of the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona, faced with limited and declining financial resources, yet recognizing the value of its growing but hidden special collections especially to scholarship at the university, as well as to the cultural and historical significance of the Caribbean region, sought cost-effective and innovative solutions to address the situation and to go ‘global’ with these collections. This paper uses a case study approach and details the strategies employed by a Team at the University of the West Indies, Mona Library, including the acquisition of equipment, selection of collections to be included, digitization of thirty collections of varied formats as well as deliberate collaborative initiatives at training of staff to ensure sustainability. It discusses challenges in the ongoing process, and complications alluded to by Prochaska (2009) especially those of legal issues, politics, ownership, and values involved in stewardship of the collections.

40|$|Rural {{accessibility}} is {{a pressing}} issue {{in many parts}} of the world. Improved geographical accessibility to basic social service facilities for rural populations is a goal of most governments in developing countries. Development of a trail-based transport system is a key way to improve rural accessibility in mountainous and rugged terrain where trails criss-cross with numerous rivers. The present study focuses on Nepal, a developing country with rural accessibility challenges and a very challenging physical environment. This thesis reviews the existing accessibility patterns in rural areas of Nepal and proposes various approaches for identifying poorly served geographical areas and optimizing of location of additional new trail bridges to provide “best” links to social services. The methodology in this study is based on the concept of the gravity-based spatial interaction and accessibility models. GIS applications are used in different ways, such as in creating, acquiring, integrating spatial and attribute datasets, and spatial analysis and visualization of the output results. Amongst the different types of social services, health care and education centers are considered the most <b>pressing</b> <b>services</b> and hence are the objects of analysis. The main difference between health care service centers and educational facilities is that schools are usually very widespread across the district and serve for the school age population. Health service centers are sparsely and inequitably distributed, however, they serve the whole population at large. The results of the analysis show a fairly clear indication of problems relating to rural transport and access to social service centers in rural Nepal. This is attributed, in part, due to insufficient provision of social service centers and the lack of trail bridges over river crossing locations. The estimated numbers of trips over potential new bridges based on spatial integration modeling provides a basis for prioritization of river crossing locations for allocation of new trail bridges. The poorly served areas across the study district are identified on the basis of the results of the potential accessibility modeling. The trail network nodes with relatively low accessibility values are of prime concern and the subject of contemplation in the trail bridge planning decision-making process...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{growth is}} one of the most {{important}} objectives of macroeconomic policies of every country in the world. Various factors such as investment in physical capital, investment in human capital, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies, contribute to economic growth. Trade policy is another important factor determining economic growth. Trade openness may influence growth via access to new technologies from abroad. However, external trades have usually been subjected to various tariffs and non-tariffs barriers, erected for various reasons. The quantification of barriers to services trade {{is one of}} the most <b>pressing</b> issues in <b>services</b> trade since barriers to trade in services are mostly nontariffs in nature. Researchers have come up with various indices to measure restrictiveness in services trade.

40|$|There is a {{risk that}} urban climate change {{adaptation}} planning - often led by city environmental agencies - will remain isolated from ongoing city decision-making processes, and thus irrelevant, unless adaptation is mainstreamed into municipal line functions' existing activities and planning processes. Yet little empirical research exists showing what the adaptation "mainstreaming" process actually looks like for a city government department. This thesis addresses this gap, and identifies key drivers, limiting factors, and implications of adaptation mainstreaming within municipal service departments. Specifically, I analyze progress toward climate adaptation mainstreaming by the housing and stormwater management departments in Cape Town and Durban, South Africa: two cities that are widely considered adaptation frontrunners in the Global South. The experiences of the departments analyzed lead to several conclusions about the adaptation mainstreaming process for departments faced with <b>pressing</b> short-term <b>service</b> delivery challenges and capacity constraints. Foremost, the process encompasses, and requires, both substantive and conceptual elements. Substantively, departments start with complying with mandates and accommodating requests from other departments that advance adaptation. Gradually, they move to more deeply internalize these and other push factors, initiating actions to "climate proof' core activities and processes. Culminating the process, they eventually see climate change {{as a reason to}} more heavily collaborate and engage external actors around managing climate risks. Substantive mainstreaming progress, meanwhile, both depends on and advances a department's conceptual embedding of the adaptation agenda. Several enabling factors advance the process, prominently including access to additional funding and support to supplement scarce and inflexible resources. Progress is also influenced by the innate longevity of a department's planning horizon, its decisionmaking autonomy vis-a-vis higher levels of government, and its degree of regulatory vs. serviceprovision focus, among other pre-existing departmental qualities. (cont.) Tracing the adaptation mainstreaming process further suggests a few key implications for donors and others looking to support cities in their climate adaptation efforts. Firstly, the process of integrating adaptation into municipal line function core operations and decision making processes is undeniably challenging and slow. Thus, in light of scarce resources and other more seemingly pressing agendas, a department is unlikely to begin substantively embedding adaptation unless first seeing the agenda as conceptually intertwined with core functions and immediately actionable. Secondly, although this research did not control for the presence of a city-wide climate adaptation office, the experience of the featured departments suggests that such an office can {{play a critical role in}} pushing and supporting departments to mainstream adaptation. Such offices can identify and channel additional sources of funds for adaptation, educate departments about climate change risks, and keep the adaptation agenda politically visible. Thirdly, the way in which adaptation is framed as an agenda within a city has repercussions for departmental buy-in. For example, an environmental problem framing may not be the most advantageous for departments such as housing who historically see environmental agendas as external to, or even in conflict with, their core mandates. Meanwhile, other departments may be reluctant to respond to push factors or support from city-wide climate offices if they perceive adaptation as working against fulfillment of some core responsibilities, even if enhancing others. by Leanne A.

Azaconazole [1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichloropheny 1) - 1, 3 - dioxolan- 2 -ylmethyl]- 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole] was used as powder. The flakeboard panels (305 x 304 x 13 mm) were made using phenolformaldehyde powdered resin and wax. Distribution of CCA and TIM-BOR in treated flakes and panels was examined using x-ray fluorescence and titration methods. Concentrations were greater in the ends of flakes than in the center. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA) showed that CCA distribution was quite uniform on the surfaces examined. Concentrations of CCA and TIM-BOR in selected panel zones were uniform, indicating that the chemicals did not migrate significantly during panel manufacture. Distribution of azaconazole was not examined because a reliable method was not available. In water leaching test. CCA and azaconazole {{were found to be}} resistant to leaching, while TIM-BOR was not. Samples were tested for decay resistance using the soil block and vermiculite burial tests. Trametes versicolor, a white rot fungus, and Phialophora heteromorpha, a soft rot fungus, caused very low weight losses and did not appear to actively colonize even the untreated controls. Postia placenta, a brown rot fungus, caused substantial weight losses in untreated controls. With the latter fungus, CCA performed better than azaconazole and TIM-BOR, producing the lowest weight loss. The highest weight losses were associated with TIM-BOR, although some of the weight loss may have resulted from leaching during the decay test. The effect of each test chemical on dimensional stability, static bending and internal bond (IB) properties of treated panel was evaluated. When exposed to hot wet conditions, TIM-BOR treated samples had large thickness swell compared to CCA and azaconazole, and often delaminated. Samples placed in hot dry conditions had very small dimensional changes over time. In static bending and internal bond tests, strength reductions for TIM-BOR and CCA treated samples were clearly evident; however, reductions for TIM-BOR treated panels were greater than those for CCA. Azaconazole showed no deleterious effect on strength and generally performed well. A discussion of needs for future research is included.
