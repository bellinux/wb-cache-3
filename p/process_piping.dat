40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that automation can improve industrial pipe lifting productivity. However, there is little information on finding how much productivity can be improved in the other parts of pipe erection processes to coordinate with the productivity improvement in pipe lifting. The <b>processes</b> of <b>piping</b> construction include pipe delivery, pipe lifting, pipe alignment, pipe connection, and pipe inspection & connection. This paper studied the potential productivity improvement by simulating the <b>process</b> of <b>piping</b> operations in order to synchronize with the productivity improvement in piping lifting. This paper is based in part on previous findings from studies performed by Glass and Fisher at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984 and 1989. The semi-automated environment for piping erection assumes a Grove Pipe Manipulator attached to the boom nose of a 22 -ton crane as the base piece of equipment for piping erection. A system model is established to simulate and analyze the <b>process</b> of <b>piping</b> construction. A simulation technique is developed in this study to identify the possible critical tasks and the factors of obstruction in the <b>process</b> of <b>piping</b> construction that would eliminate the productivity improvement in piping erection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Only the {{preliminary}} stage of <b>piping</b> <b>process</b> can be simulated by current seepage-erosion coupled piping model. In order {{to enhance the}} simulation capability, a modified piping model is presented. Theory analysis shows that the governing equations of the modified piping model have significant advantages in practicality and solution accuracy. The solving process of the model is analyzed, with the result showing that the out-of-bounds appearance of the field variables is the major factor interrupting the solving process. Then a new solution technique called dynamic constraint is proposed, which can ensure the validity of field variables. Numerical example indicates that the new governing equations and dynamic constraint technique can enormously enhance the simulation capability of the model, and the <b>piping</b> <b>process</b> can be effectively simulated...|$|R

40|$|In the Ebro Basin, piping is an {{ubiquitous}} erosion {{process in}} badland areas, occurring in two main situations: on slopes of exposed Tertiary clays and in recently incised silty-clay Holocene valley-fill sediments. The quantitative {{importance of the}} main factors controlling <b>piping</b> <b>processes</b> in those conditions was obtained by statistical analysis based on multiple and stepwise regressions. Piping erosion is strongly related to a high sodium absorption ratio (SAR) which favours clay dispersion. However, the statistical analysis indicates that the chemical characteristics and the physical-chemical behaviour are a necessary condition but are not sufficient {{on their own to}} develop <b>piping</b> <b>processes.</b> On the slopes, piping is controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the material such as the dispersion index, the granulometric fraction smaller than 4 μm, pH and crack density. In the valley-fill sediments, piping is mainly controlled by the sulphate concentration in the water extract from saturated paste, which is also associated with high SAR values, and the dispersion index. In both geomorphic situations, piping is always related to high crack density and high topographic gradient.

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of triggering conditions and evolution <b>processes</b> of <b>piping</b> phenomena, in relation to both mechanical and hydraulic aspects. In particular, {{the aim of the}} study is to predict slope instabilities triggered by piping, analysing the conditions necessary for a flow failure to occur. Really, the mechanical effect involved in the loads redistribution around the pipe is coupled to the drainage process arising from higher permeability of the pipe. If after the pipe formation, the drainage goes prevented for pipe clogging, the porewater pressure increase can lead to the failure or even the liquefaction, with a subsequent flow slide. To simulate the piping evolution and to verify relevant stability conditions, a iterative coupled modelling approach has been pointed out. As example, the proposed tool has been applied to the Stava Valley disaster (July, 1985), demonstrating that piping might be one of triggering phenomena of the tailings dams collapse.

40|$|International audienceA <b>process</b> called <b>piping,</b> {{which often}} {{occurs in the}} soil at dams, levees, and dykes, {{involves}} the formation and development of a continuous tunnel between upstream and downstream ends. The hole erosion test is commonly used to quantify the critical stress {{and the rate of}} piping erosion progression. The aim {{of this study is to}} draw up a model for interpreting the results of this test. A characteristic internal erosion time is defined and expressed as a function of the initial hydraulic gradient and the coefficient of surface erosion. It is established here that the product of the coefficient of erosion and the flow velocity is a significant dimensionless number: when this number is small, the kinetics of erosion are low, and the particle concentration does not have any effect on the flow. This finding applies to most of the available test results. Theoretical and experimental evidence is presented showing that the evolution of the pipe radius during erosion with a constant pressure drop obeys a scaling exponential law...|$|R
