The currencies of the major players in agricultural markets have shown strong appreciation from 2002 to 2008. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the effect of a strong depreciation of the U. S. dollar on the world prices of food commodities. Given the current U.

To answer these questions we model and estimate the effect of oil <b>prices</b> on the <b>competitiveness</b> for the GCC then we provide a test statistic to test whether the conditional variance of the model has remained stable under the US dollar peg compared to a counterfactual scenario, where the GCC countries peg their currencies to the Euro dollar in 1991. We find the effect of the increase in the real price of oil on competitiveness of the GCC countries to be small, most of the domestic inflation is imported, {{and that there is a}} relatively large variation among the GCC economies with respect to the currency peg. The financial problems the GCC countries face today are not about which currency (or a basket of currencies) they should peg to, but rather about the choice of the monetary arrangement as a whole. ...|$|R

Given the saturation of the market, decreasing demand, and converging prices, importance of non-price competitiveness factors, such as quality, increases.
