5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the <b>pylon</b> attachment points revealed damage to the wing's <b>pylon</b> mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the <b>pylon</b> attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the <b>pylon</b> fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the <b>pylon</b> to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear <b>pylon</b> mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|Design of {{the bridge}} was awarded to Aas-Jakobsen and Det Norske Veritas, the former who also {{performed}} dynamic analysis and structural engineering. Architects were Hindhammer–Sundt–Thomassen, Lund & Løvseth, and Lund & Slaatto. An H <b>pylon</b> was chosen instead of an A <b>pylon</b> both because it was more functional, and would be more aesthetic {{in conjunction with the}} other bridges in the area, particularly three suspension bridges.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a <b>pylon</b> {{is to provide a}} space in which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the <b>Pylon</b> located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A <b>Pylon</b> is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term <b>pylon</b> derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pylons</b> has {{developed}} into the <b>Pylons</b> Project, {{and the old}} code from <b>Pylons</b> 1.0 is now in maintenance-only mode. However, pursuant to the project's merger with repoze.bfg since November 2010, newer versions of <b>Pylons</b> are actually different from the original <b>Pylons</b> 1.0. <b>Pylons</b> developers initially planned to rewrite certain portions of the code, but they observed that the new code was approximating repoze.bfg, {{which led to the}} merger of <b>Pylons</b> and repoze.bfg. This led to repoze.bfg (a part of the Repoze Python-based web framework) to become rebranded and relaunched as the Pyramid web framework.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower {{used was}} a massive self-supporting delta <b>pylon,</b> or waist <b>pylon,</b> which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. This type of <b>pylon</b> {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators. The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped insulator.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the <b>pylon</b> had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the <b>pylon</b> for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to attach the pylons, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E
50|$|Anchor <b>pylons</b> {{may also}} have a switch {{attached}} to their crossbeam. These so-called switch <b>pylons</b> are operated from the ground {{by the use of}} long rods. The attachment of circuit breakers to <b>pylons</b> is only practical when voltages are less than 50 kV.|$|R
25|$|This deep {{alignment}} station required heavy <b>pylons</b> {{to support}} the vaults. In 1930s, architects were obsessed with relieving passengers' anxiety of being underground, {{so one of the}} objectives was to make these <b>pylons</b> look slimmer. Dushkin proposed an interesting solution - decorate the <b>pylons</b> with wider arches, filling the gap between the fake and real arch with sculpture. This, he presumed, would narrow the perceived width of <b>pylons.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{the power}} line was rerouted and the 20 and 68 metre <b>pylons</b> were dismantled. The 128 metre <b>pylons</b> were left intact as a monument. Today, {{only one of}} the 128-metre <b>pylons</b> stands as the other was {{illegally}} demolished for steel scrap in May 2005.|$|R
5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced inertial guidance system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control. The missile was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a <b>pylon</b> for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B-58, the <b>pylon</b> replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E
5|$|The first {{prototype}} <b>pylon</b> {{was developed}} by Martin Jehart of Bellutti Protection Systems, an Austrian engineering firm specializing in the manufacturing of technical materials and tarpaulin. They initially used a latex balloon for crash tests and aerodynamic studies and after many tests and research settled {{on the use of}} a combination of different materials, the crucial component being spinnaker ripstop nylon, an extremely lightweight and flexible material used for making sails for boats. This would prove to be a breakthrough {{in the development of the}} Air Gates producing a <b>pylon</b> that would rip instantaneously when hit by a plane. Over 70 tests of the <b>pylon</b> were carried out on the ground using a car with a wing strapped on the roof before they were ready to undergo tests with a real plane. Eight different cars were used in these tests as well as a trailer and truck. Hungarian pilot, Péter Besenyei worked closely with the team and attempted the first deliberate <b>pylon</b> hit in early 2003 with positive results. The first Air Gates, which were cylindrical, were finally ready to be used at the very first Red Bull Air Races held in Austria and Hungary later that year.|$|E

5|$|All {{members of}} the Temple must be {{affiliated}} with a <b>pylon,</b> and thus membership is by application, requiring contact with a Setian priestess or priest followed by an evaluation period.

5|$|Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie uses several {{different}} types of electricity pylons to support their 735kV power lines. All of them are single-circuit, meaning that each <b>pylon</b> carries one power line with three bundles of four electrical subconductors separated by spacers, with each bundle transmitting one phase of current.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, a 220 kV {{overhead}} power line was built across the Strait of Messina. Its <b>pylons</b> are {{among the highest in}} the world.

5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the <b>pylon</b> tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first <b>pylon.</b> By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the <b>pylon</b> towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E

5|$|Many temples {{were now}} built entirely of stone, and their general plan became fixed, with the sanctuary, halls, courtyards, and <b>pylon</b> {{gateways}} oriented {{along the path}} used for festival processions. New Kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs a great distance from their mortuary temples. Without pyramids to build around, mortuary temples began using the same plan as those dedicated to the gods.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, Hydro-Québec {{researchers}} engineered a {{new type}} of <b>pylon,</b> the V-guyed tower, which reduced materials consumption to 11.8 tonnes of steel per kilometre of power line.
