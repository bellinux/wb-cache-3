5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA <b>polymerase</b> and RNA <b>polymerase</b> which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's <b>polymerase</b> enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA <b>polymerase</b> enzymes often make mistakes, {{and this is one}} of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E

40|$|During cell division, {{replication}} of the genomic DNA is performed by high-fidelity DNA <b>polymerases</b> but these error-free enzymes can not synthesize across damaged DNA.

We {{focus on the}} involvement of mammalian TLS <b>polymerases</b> in DNA damage tolerance mechanisms. In detail, we review the discovery of TLS <b>polymerases</b> and describe the molecular features of all the mammalian TLS <b>polymerases</b> identified so far. We give a short overview of the mechanisms that regulate the selectivity and activity of TLS <b>polymerases.</b> In addition, we summarize the current knowledge how different types of DNA damage, relevant either for the induction or treatment of cancer, are bypassed by TLS <b>polymerases.</b> Finally, we elucidate the relevance of TLS <b>polymerases</b> {{in the context of}} cancer therapy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMembers of the Y-family of DNA <b>polymerases</b> {{catalyze}} template-dependent DNA synthesis but share no {{sequence homology}} with other known DNA <b>polymerases.</b> Y-family <b>polymerases</b> exhibit high error rates and low processivity when copying normal DNA but {{are able to}} synthesize DNA opposite damaged templates. In the past three years, much has been learned about this family of <b>polymerases</b> including determination {{of more than a}} dozen crystal structures with various substrates. In this short review, I will summarize the biochemical properties and structural features of Y-family DNA <b>polymerases...</b>|$|R
5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative <b>polymerase</b> if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized <b>polymerase</b> is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive <b>polymerase</b> to a TLS <b>polymerase</b> such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive <b>polymerase</b> to continue replication.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA <b>polymerase</b> binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA <b>polymerase</b> to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA <b>polymerase.</b>|$|E
5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA <b>polymerase</b> responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the <b>polymerase</b> at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the <b>polymerase.</b>|$|E
40|$|DNA-dependent RNA <b>polymerases</b> of archaebacteria {{not only}} {{resemble}} the nuclear RNA <b>polymerases</b> of eukaryotes {{rather than the}} eubacterial enzymes in their complex component patterns but also show striking immunochemical, i. e., structural, homology with the eukaryotic <b>polymerases</b> {{at the level of}} single components. Thus, eukaryotic and archaebacterial RNA <b>polymerases</b> are indeed of the same type, distinct from the eubacterial enzymes, which, however, are also derived from a common ancestral structure...|$|R
40|$|DNA <b>polymerases</b> {{ensure the}} {{faithful}} duplication of genetic information inside the nuclease and mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the nucleoid of prokaryotic cells. These remarkable enzymes synthesize polynucleotide chains {{based on the}} complementarity of an incoming nucleotide to an existing DNA template. DNA <b>polymerases</b> are grouped into six families (A, B, C, D, X, and Y). The previous SnapShot (DNA <b>Polymerases</b> I Prokaryotes) described the structural and functional characteristics conserved across the families, using the DNA <b>polymerases</b> from the bacterium Escherichia coli as an example. In this SnapShot, we now highlight DNA <b>polymerases</b> from humans (Homo sapiens) {{and their relationship to}} human diseases. However, this list is certainly not exhaustive, and the number of putative links between DNA <b>polymerases</b> and diseases continues to grow...|$|R

5|$|Polyadenylate polymerases {{are not as}} ancient. They have {{separately}} {{evolved in}} both bacteria and eukaryotes from CCA-adding enzyme, which is the enzyme that completes the 3' ends of tRNAs. Its catalytic domain is homologous {{to that of other}} polymerases. It is presumed that the horizontal transfer of bacterial CCA-adding enzyme to eukaryotes allowed the archaeal-like CCA-adding enzyme to switch function to a poly(A) <b>polymerase.</b> Some lineages, like archaea and cyanobacteria, never evolved a polyadenylate <b>polymerase.</b>|$|E
5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA <b>polymerase</b> II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA <b>polymerase</b> II to slip {{off of the}} transcript. Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Transcription in archaea {{more closely}} resembles {{eukaryotic}} than bacterial transcription, with the archaeal RNA <b>polymerase</b> being {{very close to}} its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of RNA <b>polymerase,</b> its structure and function in transcription seems {{to be close to}} that of the eukaryotic RNA <b>polymerase</b> II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the RNA <b>polymerase</b> to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.|$|E
50|$|Its active metabolite, {{cidofovir}} diphosphate, inhibits {{viral replication}} by selectively inhibiting viral DNA <b>polymerases.</b> It also inhibits human <b>polymerases</b> but this action is 8-600 times weaker than its actions on viral DNA <b>polymerases.</b> It also incorporates itself into viral DNA hence inhibiting viral DNA synthesis during reproduction.|$|R
40|$|We {{have very}} {{recently}} highlighted possible connections between DNA <b>polymerases,</b> the main enzymes in the DNA metabolism, and human diseases (Ramadan, K., Maga, G. and Hübscher, U. : DNA <b>polymerases</b> and diseases, In: Genome Integrity: Facets and Perspectives ed. Lankenau, D. -H. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg Germany, Vol 1, pp. 69 - 102, 2007). Beside {{a role in}} DNA replication of the genome DNA <b>polymerases</b> have fundamental functions in other aspect of DNA metabolism, such as DNA repair, DNA recombination, translesion DNA synthesis and cell cycle checkpoint. In the last decade many novel DNA <b>polymerases</b> have been identified, but their exact cellular functions still await clarification. We know that many DNA <b>polymerases</b> have redundant functions. It {{is a fact that}} specific inhibition of certain DNA <b>polymerases</b> is a promising approach to develop anticancer drugs. In this review we will concentrate on DNA repair proteins and translesion DNA <b>polymerases</b> as possible targets for anti cancer drugs...|$|R
25|$|Given that DNA and RNA <b>polymerases</b> both {{carry out}} template-dependent {{nucleotide}} polymerization, {{it might be}} expected that {{the two types of}} enzymes would be structurally related, but they are not. They seem to have arisen independently twice during the early evolution of cells: one lineage led to the modern DNA <b>polymerases</b> and reverse transcriptases, as well as to a few single-subunit RNA <b>polymerases</b> from viruses; the other lineage formed all of the modern cellular RNA <b>polymerases.</b>|$|R
5|$|Transcription {{is carried}} out by a DNA-dependent RNA <b>polymerase</b> that copies the {{sequence}} of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA <b>polymerase</b> binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA <b>polymerase</b> II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates {{as part of a}} large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA <b>polymerase</b> II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind {{to a halt and}} the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA <b>polymerase</b> of Amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.|$|E

40|$|Models for {{replication}} and transcription often display <b>polymerases</b> {{that track}} like locomotives along their DNA templates. However, recent evidence supports an alternative {{model in which}} DNA and RNA <b>polymerases</b> are immobilized by attachment to larger structures, where they reel in their templates and extrude newly made nucleic acids. These <b>polymerases</b> do not act independently; they are concentrated in discrete "factories," where they work together on many different templates. Evidence for models involving tracking and immobile <b>polymerases</b> is reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Two DNA <b>polymerases</b> {{that can}} copy {{synthetic}} RNA polymers {{are present in}} human tissue culture cells.

These synthetic RNA-dependent DNA <b>polymerases</b> are identified by their ability to copy efficiently the ribo strand of synthetic oligonucleotide-homopolymer complexes, and differ in this respect from the known DNA-dependent DNA <b>polymerases</b> found in HeLa cells. The template requirements of these new DNA <b>polymerases</b> resemble that of the RNA-dependent DNA <b>polymerases</b> of the RNA tumor-viruses...|$|R
40|$|Viral and {{cellular}} RNA dependent RNA <b>polymerases</b> Krupicová Daniela Abstract RNA dependent RNA <b>polymerases</b> synthesize RNA strand from RNA template. They {{can be divided}} into two large groups - viral (RdRp) {{and cellular}} (RDR) <b>polymerases.</b> Viral RdRp {{play a key role in}} the life cycle of RNA viruses, ensuring replication and transcription of their genome. The structure, which resembles the "right hand", is similar to other types single-subunit <b>polymerases.</b> Large amounts of knowledge are available about the RdRp of RNA viruses with positive single strand RNA genome. This information then helps in the development of antiviral drugs targeting the RdRp. The second group consists of cellular RDR. These <b>polymerases</b> are found only in eukaryotes.

5|$|There {{are also}} a number of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that use RNA as their {{template}} for synthesis of a new strand of RNA.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{major role}} {{of various types}} of DNA <b>polymerases</b> is genome replication. However, DNA <b>polymerases</b> are also {{necessary}} to establish the accuracy, efficiency of replication, repairing process, and consequently decrease in mutations induced by DNA-damaging agents. Cancer initiation is usually associated with induction of mutations in specific oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes by endogenous or exogenous genotoxic agents. Various point mutations occurring in cancer cells arise from error-generating activities of DNA <b>polymerases.</b> Published data show that decrease in the accuracy of DNA <b>polymerases,</b> without affecting their activity, could be the causative agents of tumors. It has also been reported in literature that the expression of DNA <b>polymerases</b> is altered in human cancers compared to normal tissue. In this review, we discuss some evidences {{of the role of}} various DNA <b>polymerases</b> in cancer development. The results of this study showed that lack of proper activity of DNA <b>polymerases</b> causes tumors through {{increase in the number of}} generated mutations in the genome. Attitude towards the function of these enzymes can result in new achievements for cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
40|$|DNA <b>polymerases</b> are {{involved}} in different cellular events, including genome replication and DNA repair. In the last few years, {{a large number of}} novel DNA <b>polymerases</b> have been discovered, and the biochemical analysis of their properties has revealed a long list of intriguing features. Some of these <b>polymerases</b> have a very low fidelity and have been suggested to play mutator roles in different processes, like translesion synthesis or somatic hypermutation. The current view of these processes is reviewed, and the current understanding of DNA <b>polymerases</b> and their role as mutator enzymes is discusse...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ADP-ribose) <b>polymerases</b> are {{a family}} of DNA-dependent nuclear enzymes catalyzing the {{transfer}} of ADP-ribose moieties from cellular nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide {{to a variety of}} target proteins. Although they have been considered as resident nuclear elements of the DNA repair machinery, recent works revealed a more intricate physiologic role of poly(ADP-ribose) <b>polymerases</b> with numerous extranuclear activities. Indeed, poly(ADP-ribose) <b>polymerases</b> participate in fundamental cellular processes like chromatin remodelling, transcription or regulation of the cell-cycle. These new insight into the physiologic roles of poly(ADP-ribose) <b>polymerases</b> widens the range of human pathologies in which pharmacologic inhibition of these enzymes might have a therapeutic potential. Here, we overview our current knowledge on extranuclear functions of poly(ADP-ribose) <b>polymerases</b> with a particular focus on the mitochondrial ones and discuss potential fields of future clinical applications...|$|R
5|$|Thermus aquaticus is a {{bacterium}} {{found in the}} Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq <b>polymerase)</b> that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA <b>polymerase,</b> which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the <b>polymerase</b> first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the <b>polymerase,</b> or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E
5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA {{damage tolerance}} process {{that allows the}} DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA <b>polymerase</b> IV or V, from the Y <b>Polymerase</b> family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The <b>polymerase</b> switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA <b>polymerase</b> eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA <b>polymerase</b> knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E
40|$|Significant {{advances}} {{have been made}} recently {{in the study of}} <b>polymerases.</b> First came the realization that there are many more DNA <b>polymerases</b> than originally thought; indeed, no fewer than 14 template-dependent DNA <b>polymerases</b> are found in mammals. Concurrent structural studies of DNA <b>polymerases</b> bound to DNA and incoming nucleotide have revealed how these remarkable copying machines select the correct deoxynucleoside triphosphate among a sea of nucleotides. A whole new level of insight into DNA replication fidelity has been reached as a result of recently determined crystal structures of DNA lesions {{in the context of the}} active sites of repair, replicative and specialized DNA <b>polymerases.</b> These structures illustrate why some lesions can be bypassed readily, whereas others are strong blocks to DNA replication...|$|R

40|$|How {{spontaneous}} deletions form in bacteria {{is still}} a partly unresolved problem. Here, we show that deletion formation in Salmonella typhimurium requires the presence of functional translesion <b>polymerases.</b> First, in wild-type bacteria, removal of the known translesion DNA <b>polymerases,</b> PolII (polB), PolIV (dinB), PolV (umuDC), and SamAB (samAB), resulted in a 10 -fold decrease in the deletion rate, indicating that 90 % of all spontaneous deletions require these <b>polymerases</b> for their formation. Second, overexpression of these <b>polymerases</b> by derepression of the DNA damage-inducible LexA regulon caused a 25 -fold increase in deletion rate that depended {{on the presence of}} functional translesion <b>polymerases.</b> Third, overexpression of the <b>polymerases</b> PolII and PolIV from a plasmid increased the deletion rate 12 - to 30 -fold, respectively. Last, in a recBC− mutant where dsDNA ends are stabilized {{due to the lack of}} the end-processing nuclease RecBC, the deletion rate was increased 20 -fold. This increase depended on the translesion <b>polymerases.</b> In lexA(def) mutant cells with constitutive SOS expression, a 10 -fold increase in DNA breaks was observed. Inactivation of all 4 translesion <b>polymerases</b> in the lexA(def) mutant reduced the deletion rate 250 -fold without any concomitant reduction in the amount of DNA breaks. Mutational inactivation of 3 endonucleases under LexA control reduced the number of DNA breaks to the wild-type level in a lexA(def) mutant with a concomitant 50 -fold reduction in deletion rate. These findings suggest that the translesion <b>polymerases</b> are not involved in forming the DNA breaks, but that they require them to stimulate deletion formation...|$|R
