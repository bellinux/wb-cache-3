25|$|Tim Noakes, {{based on}} an earlier idea by the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill has {{proposed}} {{the existence of a}} central governor. In this, the brain continuously adjusts the power output by muscles during exercise in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in prior length of strenuous exercise, the <b>planned</b> <b>duration</b> of further exertion, and the present metabolic state of the body. This adjusts the number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, and is subjectively experienced as fatigue and exhaustion. The idea of a central governor rejects the earlier idea that fatigue is only caused by mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral fatigue"). Instead, the brain models the metabolic limits of the body to ensure that whole body homeostasis is protected, in particular that the heart is guarded from hypoxia, and an emergency reserve is always maintained. The idea of the central governor has been questioned since ‘physiological catastrophes’ can and do occur suggesting athletes (such as Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess) can over-ride the ‘‘central governor’.|$|E

2500|$|Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with {{multiple}} formats, {{depending on the}} standard of play, the desired level of formality, and the time available.

40|$|Propositional {{plans of}} all forms often display {{a certain level of}} {{concurrency}} which can be exploited by scheduling the plan. This reveals the earliest times at which each action can be applied whilst still achieving the goal and shortening the <b>plan</b> <b>duration.</b> However, the output of this scheduling process is simply a set of timestamped actions, losing implicit information present in the original plan such as the causal links between actions and states. In this paper we present PIMP (Plans Inside Multi-threaded Plans), a domain-independent algorithm which can schedule a plan whilst retaining the knowledge inherent in a traditional plan. We exploit this using the concept of threads to detect individual, concurrent and interleaved plans and discuss the benefits of these thread-scheduled plans and their possible applications. ...|$|R
