5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of <b>prey</b> animals mainly governs its food habits and <b>prey</b> choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the <b>prey,</b> habitat availability for the various <b>prey</b> species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in <b>prey</b> supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. fimbriata′s {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} <b>prey</b> are in the order: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live <b>prey</b> and motionless lures, and to P. fimbriata specimens without <b>prey</b> for 7days ("well-fed") and without <b>prey</b> for 14days ("starved"). P. fimbriata specimens without <b>prey</b> for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for different types of <b>prey.</b> The test included as <b>prey</b> several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} <b>prey</b> species showed no evidence of affecting the results. Insects were represented by the house fly Musca domestica.|$|E
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. labiata from the Philippines and from Sri Lanka have similar {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} <b>prey,</b> and that the order of preference is: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live <b>prey</b> and motionless lures, and to P. labiata specimens without <b>prey</b> for 7days ("well-fed") and without <b>prey</b> for 14days ("starved").

25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to state precisely what <b>preys</b> on what. For example, the young of herbivores may be <b>preyed</b> upon by lizards and snakes while the adults are <b>preyed</b> on by mammals. Conversely the young of many predators live largely on invertebrates and switch to vertebrates as they grow.|$|R
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. schultzi′s {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} <b>prey</b> are in the order: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects.

5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and <b>prey,</b> where distinctive features in <b>prey,</b> which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive <b>prey</b> is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of <b>prey,</b> and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of <b>prey</b> to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E
5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} <b>prey</b> that hit orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the <b>prey</b> (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the <b>prey</b> by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all <b>prey.</b> For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept <b>prey,</b> but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but {{would make it easier}} for potential <b>prey</b> to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night. In fact, there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and the <b>prey</b> they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of <b>prey.</b>|$|E
30|$|The second {{quantitative}} trait (<b>preying</b> {{potential of the}} 3 rd larval instar). The selection {{was based on the}} {{quantitative trait}} (<b>preying</b> potential, potential of the 3 rd larval instar (PPLI)). The parent pair was selected for the next generation, according to the highest <b>preying</b> potential of the 3 rd larval instar.|$|R
5000|$|It is very {{difficult}} to state precisely what <b>preys</b> on what.

30|$|The {{second group}} {{concerned}} with {{the expression of the}} feeding potential represented in the (<b>preying</b> potential of the 3 rd larval instar and <b>preying</b> potential of female) with superiority to the <b>preying</b> potential of the 3 rd larval instar. This is an important trait for predatory insects that are used in integrated pest management program.|$|R
5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} <b>prey</b> species are Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the <b>prey</b> selected) followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown bears may also fall <b>prey</b> to tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% {{of the diet}} of Siberian tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, <b>prey</b> include sambar deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, <b>prey</b> included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller <b>prey,</b> such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.|$|E
5|$|Most mantises chase tempting <b>prey</b> if it strays close enough, {{and will}} go further {{when they are}} {{especially}} hungry. Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the <b>prey</b> with their spiked raptorial forelegs. Some ground and bark species pursue their <b>prey</b> in a more active way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, Entella, Ligaria, and Ligariella run over dry ground seeking <b>prey,</b> much as tiger beetles do.|$|E
5|$|Mostly nocturnal, {{they rarely}} forage actively, preferring instead to ambush <b>prey</b> {{as it happens}} by. Their <b>prey</b> {{includes}} mammals, birds, amphibians, and lizards.|$|E

5|$|Other sharks feed on squid or fish, {{which they}} swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point {{outwards}} to strike and capture <b>prey</b> that it then swallows intact. The great white {{and other large}} predators either swallow small <b>prey</b> whole or take huge bites out of large animals. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir <b>prey</b> from the seabed or slash at swimming <b>prey</b> with their tooth-studded rostra.|$|E
5|$|Polyps feed on {{a variety}} of small organisms, from {{microscopic}} zooplankton to small fish. The polyp's tentacles immobilize or kill <b>prey</b> using their nematocysts. These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby <b>prey</b> touching the trigger (cnidocil). A flap (operculum) opens and its stinging apparatus fires the barb into the <b>prey.</b> The venom is injected through the hollow filament to immobilise the prey; the tentacles then manoeuvre the <b>prey</b> to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Predators and <b>prey</b> {{interact}} and coevolve, the predator {{to catch the}} <b>prey</b> more effectively, the <b>prey</b> to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between <b>prey</b> and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E

50|$|Emesopsis streiti {{was found}} of {{decaying}} bamboo culms of Gigantochloa scortechinii. The species <b>preyed</b> upon {{a wide variety}} of insect and arthropod groups. E. streiti is apparently <b>preyed</b> upon by theridiid spiders.|$|R
5|$|Predatory and parasitoidal wasps subdue their <b>prey</b> by {{stinging}} it. They hunt a {{wide variety}} of <b>prey,</b> mainly other insects (including other Hymenoptera), both larvae and adults.|$|E
5|$|Sharks often employ complex hunting {{strategies}} to engage large <b>prey</b> animals. Great white shark hunting strategies may {{be similar to}} how megalodon hunted its large <b>prey.</b> However, megalodon bite marks on whale fossils suggests that it employed different hunting strategies against large <b>prey</b> than the great white shark.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel forages undercover, {{to avoid}} being seen by foxes and birds of <b>prey.</b> It is adapted for {{pursuing}} its <b>prey</b> down tunnels, though it may also bolt <b>prey</b> from a burrow and kill it in the open. The least weasel kills small <b>prey,</b> such as voles, with a bite to the occipital region of the skull or the neck, dislocating the cervical vertebrae. Large <b>prey</b> typically dies of blood loss or circulatory shock. When food is abundant, {{only a small portion}} of the <b>prey</b> is eaten, usually the brain. The average daily food intake is , which is equivalent to 30–35% of the animal's body weight.|$|E
50|$|They often {{form one}} of the bottom rungs {{of the food chain}} with many species <b>preying</b> on them (millipedes, shrews, etc.) and one species of spider (Dysdera crocata) <b>preying</b> entirely on woodlice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure there's {{nothing to}} keep me out. That's the worst of these lonely places: my mind <b>preys</b> upon itself. That's what Dr. Nixon always said: {{he said it was}} no use in air so long as my mind <b>preyed</b> upon itself.

50|$|Abyssinian ground {{hornbills}} are <b>preyed</b> on {{by large}} carnivores, such as leopards. Human predation for food occurs in some countries, including northern Cameroon and Burkina Faso. The nests may be <b>preyed</b> upon by smaller terrestrial predators.|$|R
5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with <b>prey</b> consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the <b>prey</b> {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual leaf blade around <b>prey</b> to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the <b>prey</b> exude additional mucilage to mire down the <b>prey,</b> which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the <b>prey</b> has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
5|$|The rush: If the <b>prey</b> {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This {{is the most}} critical stage of the hunt, as wolves may never catch up with <b>prey</b> running at top speed. If their <b>prey</b> is travelling in a group, the wolves either attempt {{to break up the}} herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{salamander}} (Ambystoma tigrinum) {{is typical of}} the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the Bufo spp. toads, actively search for <b>prey,</b> while the Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) lures inquisitive <b>prey</b> closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes. Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt <b>prey</b> have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged. Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their <b>prey</b> by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the <b>prey</b> and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued <b>prey</b> is gulped down whole.|$|E
50|$|With {{these two}} terms the {{equation}} above {{can be interpreted}} as follows: the rate of change of the <b>prey's</b> population is given by its own growth rate minus the rate at which it is <b>preyed</b> upon.|$|R
