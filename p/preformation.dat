The idea that the interdependence between parts would have implications for the origins of living things was raised by writers starting with Pierre Gassendi in the mid-17th century and by John Wilkins (1614-1672), who wrote (citing Galen), [...] "Now to imagine, that all these things, according to their several kinds, could be brought into this regular frame and order, to which such an infinite number of Intentions are required, without the contrivance of some wise Agent, must needs be irrational in the highest degree." [...] In the late 17th-century, Thomas Burnet referred to [...] "a multitude of pieces aptly joyn'd" [...] to argue against the eternity of life. In the early 18th century, Nicolas Malebranche wrote [...] "An organized body contains an infinity of parts that mutually depend upon one another in relation to particular ends, all of which must be actually formed in order to work as a whole", arguing in favor of <b>preformation,</b> rather than epigenesis, of the individual; and a similar argument about the origins of the individual was made by other 18th-century students of natural history. In his 1790 book, The Critique of Judgment, Kant is said by Guyer to argue that [...] "we cannot conceive how a whole that comes into being only gradually from its parts can nevertheless be the cause of the properties of those parts".|$|E
6000|$|The {{two parts}} of Bonnet's hypothesis, namely, the {{doctrine}} that all living things proceed from pre-existing germs, and that these contain, one inclosed within the other, the germs of all future living things, which is the hypothesis of [...] "emboîtement;" [...] and the doctrine that every germ contains in miniature all the organs of the adult, which is the hypothesis of evolution or development, in the primary senses of these words, must be carefully distinguished. In fact, while holding firmly by the former, Bonnet more or less modified the latter in his later writings, and, at length, he admits that a [...] "germ" [...] need not be an actual miniature of the organism; but {{that it may be}} merely an [...] "original preformation" [...] capable of producing the latter. [Footnote: [...] "Ce mot (germe) ne désignera pas seulement un corps organisé réduit en petit; il désignera encore toute espèce de <b>préformation</b> originelle dont un Tout organique peut résulter comme de son principe immédiat."--Palingénésie Philosophique, part X. chap.

6000|$|By the {{circumstances}} here enumerated {{as so many}} predisposing causes, Edmund’s character might well be deemed already sufficiently explained; and our minds prepared for it. But in this tragedy the story or fable constrained Shakespeare to introduce wickedness in an outrageous form in the persons of Regan and Goneril. He had read nature too heedfully not to know that courage, intellect, and strength of character are the most impressive forms of power, and that to power in itself, without reference to any moral end, an inevitable admiration and complacency appertains, whether it be displayed in the conquests of a Buonaparte or Tamerlane, or in the foam and the thunder of a cataract. But in the exhibition of such a character it was of the highest importance to prevent the guilt from passing into utter monstrosity,—which again depends on {{the presence or absence}} of causes and temptations sufficient to account for the wickedness, without the necessity of recurring to a thorough fiendishness of nature for its origination. For such are the appointed relations of intellectual power to truth, and of truth to goodness, that it becomes both morally and poetically unsafe to present what is admirable—what our nature compels us to admire—in the mind, and what is most detestable in the heart, as co-existing in the same individual without any apparent connection, or any modification of the one by the other. That Shakespeare has in one instance, that of Iago, approached to this, and that he has done it successfully, is perhaps the most astonishing proof of his genius, and the opulence of its resources. But in the present tragedy, in which he was compelled to present a Goneril and a Regan, it was most carefully to be avoided;—and therefore the only one conceivable addition to the inauspicious influences on the <b>preformation</b> of Edmund’s character is given, in the information that all the kindly counteractions to the mischievous feelings of shame, which might have been derived from co-domestication with Edgar and their common father, had been cut off by his absence from home, and foreign education from boyhood to the present time, and a prospect of its continuance, as if to preclude all risk of his interference with the father’s views for the elder and legitimate son:— ...|$|E

5000|$|Germ {{cells are}} {{specified}} early in development [...] {{and can only}} differentiate into gametes. The segregation of germ cells is often determined by the species, with some undergoing <b>preformation,</b> where the germ cells are determined by maternally inherited factors before or immediately after fertilisation, and others undergoing epigenesis, where the germ cell lineage is determined from signalling from surrounding tissues. <b>Preformation</b> was initially perceived as more common than epigenesis, as it appears in many model organisms like the common fruit fly, roundworms and some amphibians.

He created detailed drawings of his studies of chick embryo development, seed development in plants (such as the lemon tree), and the transformation of caterpillars into insects. His discoveries helped to illuminate philosophical arguments surrounding the topics of emboîtment, pre-existence, <b>preformation,</b> epigenesis, and metamorphosis.|$|E
50|$|Ancient {{understandings}} of heredity transitioned to two debated doctrines in the 18th century. The Doctrine of Epigenesis and the Doctrine of <b>Preformation</b> were two distinct {{views of the}} understanding of heredity. The Doctrine of Epigenesis, originated by Aristotle, claimed that an embryo continually develops. The modifications of the parent’s traits are passed off to an embryo during its lifetime. The foundation of this doctrine {{was based on the}} theory of inheritance of acquired traits. In direct opposition, the Doctrine of <b>Preformation</b> claimed that “like generates like” where the germ would evolve to yield offspring similar to the parents. The Preformationist view believed procreation was an act of revealing what had been created long before. However, this was disputed by the creation of the cell theory in the 19th century, where the fundamental unit of life is the cell, and not some preformed parts of an organism. Various hereditary mechanisms, including blending inheritance were also envisaged without being properly tested or quantified, and were later disputed. Nevertheless, people were able to develop domestic breeds of animals as well as crops through artificial selection. The inheritance of acquired traits also formed a part of early Lamarckian ideas on evolution.|$|E
50|$|According to Kant's {{view the}} aptitudes are both innate and a priori not {{given by a}} creator. Contrary to Kant's position, the <b>preformation</b> theory avoids {{skepticism}} {{about the nature of}} the noumenal world (Kant believed that the real world is unknowable). It does so by claiming that the rational structures of the human mind are similar to the rational order of the real world because both are created by God to work together, and this similarity makes the attaining of accurate knowledge about the real world possible.|$|E
50|$|Pre-{{existence}}, preexistence, beforelife, or premortal existence {{refers to}} the belief that each individual human soul existed before mortal conception, and at some point before birth enters or is placed into the body. Concepts of pre-existence can encompass either the belief that the soul came into existence at some time prior to conception or the belief that the soul is eternal. Alternative positions are traducianism and creationism, which both hold that the individual human soul does not come into existence until conception. It is to be distinguished from <b>preformation,</b> which is about physical existence and applies to all living things.|$|E

During his time there, he did not make an appearance for the senior side. After 5 seasons, {{he decided to go}} a different route, signing with SR Delémont in Switzerland. 3 seasons later he moved to Ethnikos Piraeus F.C. in Greece. After only one season, he moved back to SR Delémont. In 2010, he signed with US Pont-de-Roide in the French CFA 2. One year later he moved again, joining Belgian side Royal Mouscron-Péruwelz of the Belgian Third Division.|$|E
50|$|Kolodziejczak {{began his}} career {{at the age of}} seven playing for local club US Saint-Maurice Loos-en-Gohelle. In July 1999, he moved to {{hometown}} club CS Avion where he spent a year. In June 2000, Kolodziejczak joined the professional club of RC Lens. While in the club's youth academy, he trained alongside youth and international teammate Gaël Kakuta at the Centre de <b>Préformation</b> de Football in nearby Liévin, a training center exclusively for players brought up in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. He spent two years at the center training there during the weekdays and playing with Lens on the weekends. One of his trainers at the facility was former Polish international Joachim Marx.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{influence}} of his teacher Haeckel, Driesch had tested the mechanistic embryological theories of another of Haeckel's students, Wilhelm Roux. By 1885 Driesch's experiments on the sea urchin embryo suggested {{that it was possible}} to remove large pieces from eggs, shuffle the blastomeres and interfere in many ways without affecting the resulting embryo. It appeared that any single monad in the original egg cell was capable of forming any part of the completed embryo. This important refutation of both <b>preformation</b> and the mosaic theory of Wilhelm Roux was to be subject to much discussion in the ensuing years, and caused friction among Driesch, Roux and Haeckel.|$|E
50|$|As {{a master}} of micro-surgical technique, {{beginning}} with his continuing work on the amphibian eye, Spemann's papers {{in the early years}} of the 20th century on this vexed question were to be a great contribution to the development of experimental morphogenesis, causing him to be hailed in some quarters as the true founder of micro-surgery. He succeeded in dividing the cells with a noose of baby hair. Spemann found that one half could indeed form a whole embryo, but observed that the plane of division was crucial. This dispatched the theory of <b>preformation</b> and gave some support to the concept of a morphogenetic field, a concept of which Spemann learned from Paul Alfred Weiss.|$|E
50|$|Some plants flower {{immediately}} after snow melting or soil thawing. These early flowering plants always form their {{flowers in the}} previous season, called <b>preformation.</b> Consequently, they risk frost damage to the preformed inflorescence. In order to minimize frost damage, preformed flowers are often surrounded by tightly packed bracts that are densely covered in trichomes. This helps to keep {{the interior of a}} flower bud warm. Because of early season pollinator limitation, plants that bloom early generally have a low rate of reproductive success. One advantage of flowering early is that seeds that are produced have a greater chance of developing to maturity before the next freeze. They also have a high outcrossing rate, which helps to increase genetic diversity.|$|E
50|$|Gaël Kakuta {{first started}} playing {{football}} {{at the age}} of seven, after seeing his uncle play for the reserve team of Lille. He began his career with local club US Lille-Moulins. In his first match with the club, they won 33 - 1, however, the defeat was not enough to put him off. In 1999, he joined Lens as a youth player, and spent five years there. In 2004, Towerton was selected to attend the Centre de <b>Préformation</b> de Football in nearby Liévin, a training center exclusively for players brought up in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. He spent two years at the center training there during the weekdays and playing with Lens on the weekends. One of his trainers at the facility was former Polish international Joachim Marx.|$|E
50|$|As {{recently}} as the 18th century, the prevailing notion in western human embryology was preformation: the idea that semen contains an embryo - a preformed, miniature infant, or homunculus - that simply becomes larger during development. The competing explanation of embryonic development was epigenesis, originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by Aristotle. Much early embryology came {{from the work of}} the Italian anatomists Aldrovandi, Aranzio, Leonardo da Vinci, Marcello Malpighi, Gabriele Falloppio, Girolamo Cardano, Emilio Parisano, Fortunio Liceti, Stefano Lorenzini, Spallanzani, Enrico Sertoli, and Mauro Rusconi. According to epigenesis, the form of an animal emerges gradually from a relatively formless egg. As microscopy improved during the 19th century, biologists could see that embryos took shape in a series of progressive steps, and epigenesis displaced <b>preformation</b> as the favoured explanation among embryologists.|$|E
50|$|Varane {{was born}} in the city of Lille in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. He is of Martiniquais {{heritage}} through his father, Gaston, who is originally from Le Morne-Rouge, while his French mother, Annie, was raised in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux. Varane began his football career in the Arrondissement of Lille playing for local club AS Hellemmes at the age of seven. After spending two years at the club, in July 2002, he joined professional club RC Lens, despite some interest from Derby du Nord rivals and hometown club Lille OSC. Similar {{to the development of the}} club's previous prized assets such as Gaël Kakuta and Timothée Kolodziejczak, Varane spent time at the Centre de <b>Préformation</b> de Football in nearby Liévin, a training center exclusively for players brought up in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region.

5000|$|ONE of the {{symbolic}} figures for the Dual creative power in Nature (matter and force on the material plane) is Padma, the water lily of India. The Lotus {{is the product of}} heat (fire) and water (vapour or Ether); fire standing in every philosophical and religious system as a representation of the Spirit of Deity, the active, male, generative principle; and Ether, or the Soul of matter, the light of the fire, for the receptive female principle from which everything in this Universe emanated. Hence, Ether or Water is the Mother, and Fire is the Father. Sir W. Jones (and before him archaic botany) showed that the seeds of the Lotus contain — even before they germinate — perfectly formed leaves, the miniature shape of what one day, as perfect plants, they will become: nature thus giving us a specimen of the <b>preformation</b> of its production ...the seed of all phanerogamous plants bearing proper flowers containing an embryo plantlet ready formed.|$|E
50|$|Hence, pseudoprolines fulfill two {{functions}} simultaneously: {{they serve}} (1) as temporary side-chain protection for Ser, Thr, and Cys and (2) as solubilizing building blocks to increase solvation and coupling rates during peptide synthesis and in subsequent chain assembly. Pseudoprolines are obtained by reacting the {{free amino acids}} with aldehydes or ketone. The coupling of amino acid derivatives to a growing peptide chain containing N-terminal pseudoproline generally results in low yields because of the sterically hindered nature of the oxazolidine (thiazolidine) ring system and the decreased nucleophilicity of the nitrogen atom. Consequently, the <b>preformation</b> of suitably protected dipeptide derivatives of the type FMOC-Xaa1-Oxa/THz-OH is preferable for use in peptide synthesis. Two conceptually different approaches are feasible for preparing oxazolidine- and thiazolidine-ring-containing dipeptide derivatives: (1) the in situ acylation of Ser- or Thr-derived oxazolidines or Cys-derived thiazolidines using acid fluorides or N-carboxyanhydrides (NCA); and (2) the direct insertion of the oxazolidine systems into dipeptides (post-insertion) containing C-terminal Ser or Thr. The method of choice strongly depends {{on the nature of}} the pseudoproline as welI as on the substituents at C2 of the cyclic system.|$|E
50|$|Results in {{embryology}} had been contradictory: in 1888 Wilhelm Roux, who had introduced the experimental {{manipulation of the}} embryo to discover the rules of development, performed a series of experiments in which he inserted a hot needle into one of two blastomeres to kill it. He then observed how the remaining blastomere developed, {{and found that it}} became a half embryo. In 1892 Hans Driesch performed similar experiments on sea urchin embryos, but instead of killing one of the two blastomeres he put many embryos in a tube and shook it to separate the cells. He reported that, contrary to Roux's findings, he ended up with completely formed but smaller embryos. The reason for this discrepancy has been widely attributed to Driesch separating the two blastomeres completely rather than just killing one as Roux had done. Others, including Thomas Hunt Morgan and Oscar Hertwig, attempted to separate the two cells, for the matter was of great importance, particularly to the arguments between proponents of epigenesis and <b>preformation,</b> but satisfactory results could not be achieved.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1795 {{textbook}} on zoology, André {{showed his}} {{understanding of how the}} characteristics of both parents contribute to those of a new individual, as against the older concept of <b>preformation.</b> In 1815 he drew up a research programme for the Moravian Agricultural Society, stressing the need for basic and applied research in natural science. In many journal articles he disseminated the progress being made, within this Society and in England, on scientific animal and plant breeding. He was instrumental in setting up a sheep-breeding section within the Society - the first animal-breeding association in continental Europe - which investigated methods of artificial selection and the transmission of traits of wool from parents to offspring, i.e. heredity. André addressed in detail the problem of how and in what circumstances inbreeding was liable to lead to weakening of the organism. In 1819 he demonstrated a recently designed micrometer for evaluating wool quality, recognised as marking [...] "the beginning of a new epoch of scientific breeding defined with mathematical precision" [...] His son Rudolf (1792-1827) also studied the theory and practice of sheep-breeding.|$|E

In 1759 he {{graduated}} as an M.D. from the University of Halle with his dissertation [...] "Theoria Generationis" [...] where he revived and supported the theory of epigenesis previously proposed by Aristotle and William Harvey. The paper consisted of three parts devoted to (1) development of plants, (2) development of animals, and (3) theoretical considerations. It indicated that organs are formed in differentiated layers from undifferentiated cells.Traditional and prevailing theory had speculated that organisms were already preformed in the seed (theory of <b>preformation),</b> {{that is in the}} human a homunculus was already sitting in the sperm. His views were not well received. Albrecht von Haller was a powerful antagonist. During the Seven Years' War, Wolff was required to practice as a field doctor in the Prussian Army. Thereafter he had difficulty entering academic life. Finally, in 1767, with help of the mathematician Leonhard Euler he obtained the chairmanship of anatomy at the St.Petersburg Academy of Sciences (now Russian Academy of Sciences). He died in Saint Petersburg.|$|E

5000|$|Among Greek scholars, Hippocrates (c.460 - c.370 BC) {{believed}} that the embryo {{was the product of}} male semen and a female factor, but Aristotle (384 - 322 BC) held that only male semen gave rise to an embryo, while the female only provided a place for the embryo to develop.
