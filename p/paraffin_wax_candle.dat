50|$|Based on {{measurements}} of a taper-type, <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> <b>candle,</b> a modern candle typically burns {{at a steady}} rate of about 0.1 g/min, releasing heat at roughly 80 W. The light produced is about 13 lumens, for a luminous efficacy of about 0.16 lumens per watt (luminous efficacy of a source) - almost a hundred times lower than an incandescent light bulb.|$|E

40|$|A {{cold plasma}} {{discharge}}, {{such as a}} corona discharge generates biologically reactive ionized species that are lethal {{to a range of}} microorganisms. A number of workers have reported log number reductions in bacteria seeded onto solid surfaces, fabrics and agar media when in close proximity to the ions source (1 - 4). The aim of this research was to investigate and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of two sources of ionisation â€“ a corona discharge and a flame. The use of antimicrobial volatile compounds to increase the antibacterial efficacy for these ionisation sources was also investigated. <b>Paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> <b>candles</b> and an ion wind generator delivering an air flow of 0. 6 m/second were used as ion sources and dispersal methods for the volatile ?-pinene. Experiments were conducted in enclosed test booths. The results demonstrated that the combination of an ionising source, such as a corona discharge or a candle flame, with a bactericidal volatile have a greater effect on surface-borne bacteria than either treatment alone. These effects could arise through the direct vapour adsorption onto microorganisms being promoted through the impingement and action of ions...|$|R

They {{also discovered that}} bases smeared with dopes brewed from vegetable and/or animal compound helped increase skiing speeds. This led {{to some of the}} first commercial ski wax (even though they contained no wax at all), such as Black Dope and Sierra Lighting; both were mainly composed of sperm oil, vegetable oil and pine pitch. However, some instead used <b>paraffin</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax</b> that melted onto ski bases, and these worked better under colder conditions.|$|R

A lower limit of final percent O sub 2 is found that is consistent with theory, but these experiments do not always reach this limit, leading to non-repeatability. Many factors, such as the relevant fluid dynamical and flame dynamical systems, known combustion models such as the those given by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Boussinesq model of buoyant combustion, and other current combustion studies have been considered and controlled for without success...|$|R
50|$|Another {{variant of}} a Great Depression-era shotgun slug design is the wax slug. These {{were made by}} hand by cutting the end off a {{standard}} birdshot loaded shotshell, shortening the shell very slightly, pouring the lead shot out, and melting <b>paraffin,</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax,</b> or crayons in a pan on a stovetop, mixing the lead birdshot in the melted wax, and then using a spoon to pour the liquified wax containing part of the birdshot back into the shotshell, all while not overfilling the shotgun shell. Once the shell cooled, the birdshot was now held in a mass by the cooled paraffin, and formed a slug. No roll or fold crimp was required to hold the wax slug in the hull. These were often used to poach deer during the Depression.|$|R
40|$|Latent {{heat energy}} storage systems using <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> could have lower heat {{transfer}} rates during melting/freezing processes {{due to its}} inherent low thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> can be enhanced by employing high conductivity materials such as alumina (Al 2 O 3). A numerical analysis {{has been carried out}} to study the performance enhancement of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> with nanoalumina (Al 2 O 3) particles in comparison with simple <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> in a concentric double pipe heat exchanger.

40|$|Microencapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> with {{polyaniline}} shells is synthesised as {{thermal energy}} storage material by in situ polymerisation. <b>Paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is the core material and polyaniline is the shell in this preparation. These materials are environment-friendly. The chemical structure, surface morphologies, thermal properties and thermal stability of the encapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> are determined by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetry analysis, respectively. The field-emission scanning electron microscopic {{results indicate that the}} <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is encapsulated well and that the capsules are spherical in shape. The differential scanning calorimetric analysis shows that the encapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> has a large energy storage and releases capacity (22 - 121 J g(- 1)) depending on the different ratios of the <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> and polyaniline. The thermogravimetric analysis results indicate that polyaniline can improve the thermal stability of encapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> because of the synergistic effect between the two (<b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> and polyaniline). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the microencapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> that acts as a microencapsulated phase change material has a good potential for {{thermal energy storage}} purposes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple and rapid method of modifying poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) {{surfaces}} with <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax.</b> PDMS that contains a layer of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> at its surface resists the absorption of hydrophobic molecules; we used fluorescence microscopy to confirm that paraffin-modified PDMS resists the absorption of rhodamine B. Furthermore, we demonstrated that microfluidic devices made from PDMS that contains a surface layer of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> prevent efficiently the transport of gas molecules through the bulk and into microchannels. We characterized the surface of PDMS that contains <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> using the water contact angle, optical transmission, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We show that PDMS that contains <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> can be substituted for native PDMS; specifically, we fabricated peristaltic valves in PDMS that contains <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax,</b> and the valves showed no degradation in performance after multiple open/close cycles. Finally, we show how to use PDMS that has been treated with <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> as a mold for the fabrication of PDMS replicas; this approach avoids silanization of PDMS, which is a time-consuming step in soft lithography. The wax-modified PDMS channels also show performance superiro to that of bare PDMS in micellar electrokinetic chromatography for quantitative analysis...|$|R

40|$|Petroleum wax is a substance, {{which has}} many {{applications}} and economical value today. The production of petroleum wax {{in the world}} about 3. 6 x 109 ton per year, valued at nearly $ 2 billion. The basic raw material for <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is petroleum crude oil and lubricating oil. Although the availability of Sudan petroleum crude oil which contain large amount of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> and availability of refineries for crude oil, there are no units in these refineries for production of wax. Sudan now imports <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> to cover its needs (145. 3058 ton). In this research, <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is extracted from Nile Blend oil under {{the best and most}} economical operating conditions (the used sample contains 26 % <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax).</b> The laboratorial experiments of extraction are done in three steps: In the first step the asphaltene is removed, in the second step the solvents in which the <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> dissolves is added and in the last step the solution is chilled to precipitate the <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax.</b> For dissolution of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> in Nile Blend oil, the following solvents are used: -Methyl ethyl ketone, -Methyl ethyl ketone(75 %) + Toluene(25 %) -Methyl ethyl ketone(50 %) + Toluene(50 %) -Methyl ethyl ketone(70 %) + Toluene (20 %) and Naphtha(10 %) The laboratorial experiments of extraction wax is done {{for a wide range of}} temperature (28 â€“ 70 Â°C), mixing time of solvent and sample (5 â€“ 30 minutes) and solvent to sample ratio (16 : 1 â€“ 32 : 1).

50|$|Microcrystalline waxes are {{a type of}} wax {{produced}} by de-oiling petrolatum, {{as part of the}} petroleum refining process. In contrast to the more familiar <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> which contains mostly unbranched alkanes, microcrystalline wax contains a higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons. It is characterized by the fineness of its crystals in contrast to the larger crystal of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax.</b> It consists of high molecular weight saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is generally darker, more viscous, denser, tackier and more elastic than <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes,</b> and has a higher molecular weight and melting point. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical microcrystalline wax crystal structure is small and thin, making them more flexible than <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax.</b> It is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|R
