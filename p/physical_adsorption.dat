25|$|Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an anti-fouling surface coating, typically through <b>physical</b> <b>adsorption</b> or through chemical modification of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with barnacle attachment. The biocides often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically bacteria. Once dead, {{they are unable to}} spread and can detach. Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used biocide, and anti-fouling agent, is the tributyltin moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms. Biocides are also added to pool water, drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control biological growth.|$|E

The modification performance was evaluated by comparing the activation index, oil absorption value, rest angle, and dispersibility in polypropylene (PP) resin prior to and after treatment. It was found that the surface properties of the whiskers were improved by sodium stearate modification. In particular, the improvement in the dispersibility in PP was significant. Surface characterization was conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for the raw and modified whiskers.

25|$|Applying {{a voltage}} to an {{electrochemical}} capacitor causes both electrodes in the capacitor to generate electrical double-layers. These double-layers consist of {{two layers of}} charges: one electronic layer is in the surface lattice structure of the electrode, and the other, with opposite polarity, emerges from dissolved and solvated ions in the electrolyte. The two layers are separated by a monolayer of solvent molecules, e. g. for water as solvent by water molecules, called inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). Solvent molecules adhere by <b>physical</b> <b>adsorption</b> {{on the surface of}} the electrode and separate the oppositely polarized ions from each other, and can be idealised as a molecular dielectric. In the process, there is no transfer of charge between electrode and electrolyte, so the forces that cause the adhesion are not chemical bonds but physical forces (e.g. electrostatic forces). The adsorbed molecules are polarized but, due to the lack of transfer of charge between electrolyte and electrode, suffered no chemical changes.|$|E
50|$|Carbon dioxide adsorbs in appreciable {{quantities}} onto many {{porous materials}} through van der Waals interactions. Compared to N2, CO2 adsorbs more strongly because the molecule is more polarizabable and possesses a larger quadrupole moment. However, stronger adsorptives including H2O often {{interfere with the}} <b>physical</b> <b>adsorption</b> mechanism. Thus, discovering porous materials that can selectively bind CO2 under flue gas conditions using only a <b>physical</b> <b>adsorption</b> mechanism is an active research area.|$|E

40|$|Activated carbons (ACs) were {{prepared}} by pyrolysis of seeds mango in presence of sodium and potassium hydroxide (chemical activities). Seeds mango from Colombian Mango cultives were impregnated with aqueous solutions of NaOH and KOH following {{a variant of}} the incipient wetness method. Different concentrations were used to produce impregnation ratios of 3 : 1 (weight terms). Activation was carried out under argon flow by heating to 823 K with 1 h soaking time. The porous texture of the obtained ACs was characterized by <b>physical</b> <b>adsorptions</b> of N 2 at 77 K and CO 2 at 273 K. The impregnation ration and hydroxide type had a strong influence on the pore structure of these ACs, which could be easily controlled by simply varying the proportion of the hydroxides used in the activation. Thus, the development of porosity for precursors with low structural order (high reactivity) is better with NaOH than KOH, whereas the opposite is observed for the highly ordered ones. Variable adsorption capacities and porosity distributions can be achieved depending on the activating agent selected. In general, KOH produces activated carbons with narrower micropore distributions than those prepared by NaOH...|$|R

50|$|Hydrogen {{storage is}} a key {{enabling}} technology {{for the advancement of}} fuel cell power systems in transportation applications. Solid adsorbents which can store fuel gases such as hydrogen and methane at high density have been requested for environments protection, because hydrogen and methane vehicles have low emissions of CO2. However, it is difficult to store these gases in a highly dense state, because supercritical gases do not condense to liquid at room temperature even under high pressure. Carbon materials such as Graphite nanofibers (GNF), single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT),and modified carbon nanotubes are hopeful hydrogen storage candidates. The gas storage mechanism includes four different concepts, that is <b>physical</b> <b>adsorption,</b> chemisorption, absorption, and occlusion. <b>Physical</b> <b>adsorption</b> is the most suitable mechanism to the application of fuel cells because it is reversible and both adsorption and desorption rates are very large, although the ordinary storage capacity by <b>physical</b> <b>adsorption</b> is limited because of weak hydrogen-hydrogen and hydrogen-carbon interactions. Although chemisorption is realized to have the high adsorption capacity, it is not reversible. On the other hand, absorption and occlusion are usually difficult in carbon materials because the carbon structure is rigid. SWNH is a new material that is similar to SWNT. Due to its high purity (>95%) without any metal catalyst, SWNH has been thought to be an ideal candidate for hydrogen storage study, without any possible effect by metallic particles as catalyst on hydrogen storage capacity. Murata et al.s study determined the exact <b>physical</b> <b>adsorption</b> amounts of supercritical hydrogen on the single-wall carbon nanohorn (SWNH) assemblies were at 77, 196, and 303 K. There are two <b>physical</b> <b>adsorption</b> sites of SWNH, that are interstitial and internal sites. Although the interaction potential depths of interstitial and internal spaces different, hydrogen densities in both spaces were similar. Hydrogen molecules adsorbed in the interstitial spaces cannot form the stable cluster owing to the space limitation, however, hydrongen can be stabilized by the strong fluid-fluid interaction due to the cluster formation in the internal spaces.|$|E

It is desirable to produce insoluble CD-containing particles for adsorption, liquid chromatography and other applications. This work pre-sents a novel method of synthesizing CD-containing resins.

50|$|Bio-immobilization and bio-conjugation is the {{purposeful}} {{manipulation of}} a biomolecule’s mobility by chemical or physical means {{to obtain a}} desired property. Immobilization of biomolecules allows exploiting characteristics of the molecule under controlled environments. For example, the immobilization of glucose oxidase on calcium alginate gel beads {{can be used in}} a bioreactor. The resulting product will not need purification to remove the enzyme because it will remain linked to the beads in the column. Examples of types of biomolecules that are immobilized are enzymes, organelles, and complete cells. Biomolecules can be immobilized using a range of techniques.

40|$|The {{effect of}} ferric ions (Fe 3 +) on the {{flotation}} of zircon and cassiterite using sodium oleate (NaOL) was investigated by single mineral flotation tests, adsorption density tests, zeta potential measurements, solution chemistry analyses, and FTIR analyses. It {{is difficult for}} zircon {{to be separated from}} cassiterite by using NaOL alone. Nevertheless, the flotation of zircon was activated while that of cassiterite was depressed in the presence of Fe 3 +. Adsorption density tests indicated that the addition of Fe 3 + enhanced the adsorption of NaOL on zircon surfaces, whereas it receded on cassiterite surfaces. Zeta potential measurements and solution chemistry analyses found that H(OL) 2 − was the predominant species to determine the flotation behaviors of zircon and cassiterite. Furthermore, the addition of Fe 3 + at pH < 8 reduced the negative charges on the zircon and cassiterite surfaces. It was confirmed that the positive charges of zircon were caused by the positively charged species of Fe 3 +, including Fe 3 +, Fe(OH) 2 +, and Fe(OH) 2 +. Meanwhile, these results revealed that the hydroxy complex and the precipitate of Fe(OH) 3 (s) adsorbed onto the cassiterite surfaces caused the flotation of cassiterite to be inhibited. It can be concluded from FTIR analyses that the peaks of zircon at 894. 14 cm− 1 and 611. 65 cm− 1 were strengthened and the adsorption on zircon surfaces was found to be chemisorption due to the addition of Fe 3 +, whereas both chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>adsorptions</b> of NaOL on cassiterite surfaces were weakened, resulting in the different flotation behaviors of zircon and cassiterite in the presence of Fe 3 +...|$|R

30|$|To {{increase}} immobilization efficiency, enzyme immobilization through cross-linker glutaraldehyde was studied (Table 2, Figure 2 b). In that case, the cysteamine monolayer was adsorbed on Au-citr(CTAB) nanoparticles' {{surface and}} exposed the amine group toward the solution (Figure 1, reaction 4). Then, Au-NH 2 (CTAB) nanoparticles were activated with GA (in concentration range of 0.3 % to 1.8 % (v/v)) through Schiff-base reaction. The TbADH molecules {{were bound to}} Au-NH 2 (CTAB) utilizing Schiff-base reaction. The key to this process is the formation of Schiff-base between aldehyde group of GA and amine group of Au-NH 2 (CTAB) nanoparticles and TbADH molecules. Increasing GA concentration in the solution of Au-NH 2 (CTAB) nanoparticles, a decreasing in enzyme activity was observed in all cases at almost constant enzyme loading (92 % to 96 %) in 7 [*]h. Results showed that TbADH retained about 70 % of its native activity on the treated with 0.7 % and 1.0 % glutraldehyde Au-NH 2 (CTAB) nanoparticles, respectively, with the highest enzyme binding (96 % on Au-(1.0 %)glut). A loss in enzyme activity was observed up to 1.4 % GA in the solution of Au-NH 2 (CTAB) nanoparticles (Figure 2 b). Although, no precipitation occurs when glutaraldehyde concentration in the solution increases. Immobilizations using GA showed a higher activity than through covalent and <b>physical</b> <b>adsorptions.</b> The presence of glutaraldehyde {{may be useful in}} the creation of additional covalent bonds between the enzyme and the nanoparticles. This usually result in a stabilization of the enzyme (Figure 2 b) by preventing the enzyme leaching [6, 10]. Also, higher GA concentration (up to 1.0 % (v/v)) promoted loss in TbADH activity (to 80 % of native activity). Similar observations have been found by others suggesting the formation of more rigid preparations with retaining of activity to some extent [6, 8].|$|R

40|$|Cancer {{progression}} {{relies on}} deregulation of normal immune cell functions. One of the signature strategies utilized by tumor cells is immunosuppression. Deregulation of cytosolic kinases negatively alters immune cell signaling, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Small molecule kinase inhibitors offer unique opportunities to enhance anti-tumor immunity by inhibition of immunosuppressive kinases. However, potent inhibitors are often poorly soluble in physiological conditions and suffer from poor pharmacokinetics in vivo. In this thesis we designed a small molecule cytosolic delivery platform based on cell-penetrating amphiphilic nanoparticles (amph-NPs), which {{are capable of}} embedding within and subsequently penetrating cell membranes without toxicity. Amph-NPs have dual properties of entrapping concentrated hydrophobic small molecules in their ligand shells and preferentially targeting lymph nodes post subcutaneous injection. Successful reversal of immunosuppression in T cells via diacylglycerol kinase inhibitors (DGKi) was achieved via amph-NP delivery, while DGKi delivered in its soluble form was ineffective. A hydrophobic small molecule antimicrobial ciprofloxacin loaded in amph-NPs resulted in early clearance of local bacterial infection, while ciprofloxacin delivered freely was significantly less effective. This novel cytosolic delivery platform is broadly applicable {{to a variety of}} hydrophobic small molecules because drug loading solely relies on <b>physical</b> <b>adsorptions.</b> Ongoing work focusing on delivering small molecule immunosuppression-reverting drugs to the cytosol of autologous T cells prior to adoptive transfer therapies may effectively protect T cells in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and significantly improve anti-tumor immunity. In conclusion, this effective cytosolic delivery platform may accelerate accurate evaluation of new drugs that target cytosolic signaling pathways and ultimately the development of new translational therapeutics. by Yu-Sang Sabrina Yang.

50|$|A {{fundamental}} difference between redox reactions in batteries and in electrochemical capacitors (supercapacitors) {{is that in the}} latter, the reactions are a very fast sequence of reversible processes with electron transfer without any phase changes of the electrode molecules.
