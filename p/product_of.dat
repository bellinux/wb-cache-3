5|$|The GCD of two numbers a and b is the <b>product</b> <b>of</b> {{the prime}} factors {{shared by the}} two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used {{multiple}} times, but {{only as long as}} the <b>product</b> <b>of</b> these factors divides both a and b. For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2×3×3×7×11, and 3213 can be factored into 3×3×3×7×17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63=3×3×7, the <b>product</b> <b>of</b> their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the empty product), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.|$|E
