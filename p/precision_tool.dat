After {{residing}} for nearly a year in rooming houses, they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Lauderdale Courts. Enrolled at L. C. Humes High School, Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher informed him {{that he did not have}} an aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, [...] "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me", in an effort to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled that the teacher [...] "agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing." [...] He was usually too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a [...] "mama's boy". In 1950, he regularly began practicing guitar under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior. They and three other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts. That September, he began ushering at Loew's State Theater. Other jobs followed, including <b>Precision</b> <b>Tool,</b> Loew's again, and MARL Metal Products.|$|E

40|$|<b>Precision</b> machine <b>tools</b> are {{essential}} {{elements in the}} fabrication of high-quality micro-sized products or micro-sized features and they directly affect the machining accuracy, repeatability, and efficiency. There is a significant literature {{on the design of}} the components that constitute an industrial machine tool.

In this paper, the issues associated with the design of <b>precision</b> machine <b>tools</b> are presented with particular emphasis being placed on dynamic aspects as the major factors that affect the performance of the <b>precision</b> machine <b>tool</b> and the machining processes. A brief review of the design principles of <b>precision</b> machine <b>tools</b> with an emphasis on machining dynamics is presented. Then, the design processes of <b>precision</b> machine <b>tools</b> and practical modelling and simulation approaches are discussed. Case studies on the design and analysis of a fast tool servo system and a five-axis bench-top micro-milling machine are reported.
