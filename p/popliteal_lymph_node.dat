Cryostat sections were stained with MoAbs directed against lymphocyte and macrophage subpopulations, and studied by image analysis. Throughout the arthritic period, high numbers of ED 1 + and ED 3 + macrophages were seen in both lymphoid compartments and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) expression also increased in some zones of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and spleen.

In synovia from AA rats, ED 2 + macrophages proliferated but α/β T cell infiltration was only occasionally observed, accompanied by ED 1 + cells and ICAM- 1 expression.

40|$|We {{present a}} patient with {{malignant}} melanoma on his heel. Wide local excision was performed, along with sentinel lymph node biopsy of the inguinal and popliteal lesions. The primary site was clear of tumor at all margins; the inguinal nodes were negative, but the popliteal node was positive for metastatic melanoma. Only radical <b>popliteal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection was performed. The patient went on to receive adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.

Popliteal drainage from below the knee is uncommon, {{and the rate of}} popliteal-positive and inguinal-negative cases is estimated to be less than 1 % of all melanomas. There is no established evidence about how to treat lymph nodes in these cases. Because we considered popliteal nodes as a regional, not interval, lymph node basin, only <b>popliteal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection was performed, and good postoperative course was achieved. The first site of drainage is the sentinel node, and the popliteal node can be a sentinel node. The inguinal node is not a sentinel node in all lower extremity melanomas.
