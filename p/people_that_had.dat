5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about the number of <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been killed, and he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E

5|$|By mid-afternoon {{of the day}} of the programme, protesters {{had begun}} {{gathering}} outside Television Centre and there were also protesters outside regional BBC offices. By 4.30pm (BST) police estimated there were 500 chanting protesters; around 25 people who reached the main entrance of Television Centre after breaking through a cordon were expelled. They were {{part of a group of}} about 40 <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> made a dash for an iron gate that had been left open. After this breach, stand-by officers reinforced the police cordon and protesters moved to block Wood Lane, hoping to prevent Griffin entering the studios. Griffin arrived at 5.17pm unnoticed and entered on foot through a rear entrance on Frithville Road. It was reported that around 600 people had turned up to protest against Griffin.|$|E

5|$|From about 10,000 BCE, Paleo-Indians {{and later}} Archaic-Indians lived as {{communities}} of hunter-gatherers {{in the area}} that covers the modern day southern United States. Approximately 800 CE to 1600 CE, the Mississippi River Delta was populated by tribes of the Mississippian culture, a mound-building Native American <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> developed in the late Woodland Indian period. The Tipton Phase people were a local expression of the Mississippian culture. They inhabited the region of modern-day Tipton County during the time of first contact with Europeans, at the arrival of the de Soto Expedition. By the end of the Mississippian period the land was claimed and populated by the Chickasaw tribe. The exact origins of the Chickasaw are uncertain. Several prehistoric Indian settlements were located in the vicinity of what would later become Randolph.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Maiza {{and a few}} immortals {{appear in}} a rural European town to {{apprehend}} a fellow alchemist and immortal Elmer C. Albatross, who had been masquerading as a demon and was imprisoned by the locals. They uncover an age old conspiracy detailing the origins of water homunculi from the 1930s (Sham and Leeza Laforet, sister of Chane) and also putting a stop the experiments on the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been ongoing in the town as they remained unaware of Szilard Quaite's demise for almost the remaining century, his descendant Bild Quaites later encounters the immortals and reveals the horrific secrets of the village.

25|$|The Bengal {{renaissance of}} the 19th century was a {{remarkable}} period of societal transformation in which {{a whole range of}} creative activities – literary, cultural, social and economic – flourished. The Bengal Renaissance was the culmination of the process of emergence of the cultural characteristics of the Bengali <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> started in the age of Hussein Shah (1493–1519). This spread over, covering around three centuries, and had a tremendous impact on Bengali society. Incidentally that coincided with the rise of the Tagore family. The Tagore family attained prominence during this period through its unusual social positioning between Indian and European influences.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, when Pedro was eight, the Zamoras left Cuba for the United States {{during the}} Mariel Boat Lift. After {{five days of}} {{processing}} in Cuba, the entire family was set to board on May 30, 1980, when, hours before they were to do so, Cuban officials ruled that his four older brothers were too close to draft age and had to remain. His oldest sister, a communist official, chose to stay. The older siblings insisted, over their parents’ objections, {{that the rest of}} the family go to the U. S. without them so that the younger ones could have a better life. Zamora's parents took him, his sister Mily, and his brother Jesus onto a boat filled with 250 <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been built for half that number. For most of Pedro's life the Zamoras resided in Hialeah, Florida, a suburb of Miami where, in part as a result of the family’s continuing separation, Pedro became very close to his mother.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{colleague}} Barbara Walters, Couric anchors specials for {{the network}} and for the newsmagazine 20/20. While she contributes to the news program all throughout the year, in 2011, Couric created her newly annual special The Year with Katie Couric, which is a program that {{marks the end of}} the year and covers some of the biggest newsmakers and news events of that year. This is a collaboration with People magazine, which also reflects events in the world of news, sports, politics, and major headlines that helped shape the world. This is very similar to that of Walters's iconic Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People, a year end program that marks {{the end of the year}} and acknowledges the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> the most impact on the year at hand with interviews on their perspective of the year. As part of the special, Couric interviews fellow members of the media that can provide some insight on some events that occurred.|$|E
25|$|Gustav Eriksson had {{reasons to}} fear {{for his life}} and left Räfsnäs. He {{travelled}} to the province of Dalarna, {{in what was then}} northwestern Sweden. What happened there has been described in Peder Svart's chronicle, which can be described as a strongly biased heroic tale about Gustav Eriksson. The Dalarna adventures of Gustav that could be described {{as a part of the}} national heritage of Sweden, can therefore not be verified in a satisfying way. He is supposed to have tried to gather troops among the peasantry in the province, but with little success initially. Being chased by men loyal to king Christian and failing at creating an army to challenge the king, Gustav Eriksson had no other alternative but to flee to Norway. While he made his way from Mora via Lima to Norway, <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> recently turned down Gustav's call for support against the king changed their minds. Representatives of that group caught up with Gustav before he had reached Norway and convinced him to follow them back to Mora. Gustav Eriksson's run towards Norway and back has formed the background to the famous cross-country ski race Vasaloppet.|$|E
25|$|King Alexander died {{of blood}} {{poisoning}} {{caused by a}} monkey bite, {{two months after the}} signing of the treaty, on 25 October 1920. His death revived the constitutional question of whether Greece should be a monarchy or a republic and transformed the November elections into a contest between Venizelos and the return of the exiled king Constantine, Alexander's father. In the elections anti-Venizelists, most of them supporters of Constantine, secured 246 out of 370 seats. The defeat came as a surprise to most people and Venizelos failed even to get elected as an MP. Venizelos himself attributed this to the war-weariness of the Greek <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been under arms with almost no intermission since 1912. Venizelists believed that the promise of demobilization and withdrawal from Asia Minor was the most potent weapon of opposition. Abuse of power by Venizelists in the period of 1917–1920 and prosecution of their adversaries were also a further cause for people to vote in favor of the opposition. Thus, on 6 December 1920, King Constantine was recalled by a plebiscite. This caused great dissatisfaction not only to the newly liberated populations in Asia Minor but also to the Great Powers who opposed the return of Constantine. As a result of his defeat Venizelos left for Paris and withdrew from politics.|$|E
