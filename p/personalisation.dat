25|$|Rockstar has {{emphasised}} the <b>personalisation</b> of {{the main}} protagonist by adding role-playing game elements. Clothing, accessories, haircuts, jewellery, and tattoos are available for purchase by the player, and have more of an effect on non-player characters' reactions than the clothing in Vice City. CJ's level of respect among his fellow recruits and street friends varies according to his appearance and actions, as do his relationships with his girlfriends. Players must ensure CJ eats to stay healthy and exercises properly. The balance of food and physical activity {{has an effect on}} his appearance and physical attributes.|$|E
500|$|Denning {{has been}} {{described}} as the most influential judge of the 20th century, in part because of his changes to the common law and also due to his <b>personalisation</b> of the legal profession. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher referred to Lord Denning as [...] "probably the greatest English judge of modern times" [...] and former Prime Minister Tony Blair lauded him as [...] "one of the great men of his age". The Lord Chief Justice Lord Bingham said [...] "Lord Denning was the best-known and best-loved judge of this or perhaps any generation" [...] and [...] "a legend in his own lifetime".|$|E

2500|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} concepts for the game, Madison visited her news office, the America Tribune, numerous times, where she could investigate possible suspects, speak to her boss, as well as write articles. For her first scene in the game, in her apartment, the developers wanted to ensure she came across as more than [...] "the standard female video game stereotype" [...] and make the player feel like they closely knew her. Her apartment was originally to be in the process of redecorating, and the player was able to repaint the walls and change its layout, giving the player a chance for <b>personalisation.</b> Another scene, where Paco forces the character to strip at gunpoint, was intended to make the character feel uncomfortable, and also demonstrate how strong-minded the character was and how far she was willing to go for her information.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the specific packages above, all variants of the Vantage series are offered {{with a wide range}} of <b>personalisation</b> options, particularly in the interior where several different shades of leather – and even stitching – may be chosen to complement or contrast each other and the body (and, in the case of the convertible, the roof). The [...] "N400" [...] engine modifications and/or sports chassis are also available individually for those owners who would like to combine the increased power or handling of the special edition with the more subtle original body, interior, and badging – much like the [...] "POW" [...] Vantages of the 1980s. Many thousands of choices of colour, trim, and options combined with the in house [...] "customisation" [...] available through Works Service make it possible for a Vantage owner to configure a unique individual car to his or her specifications.|$|E
2500|$|The Tenth Doctor's era is also heavily revisited. [...] His {{marriage}} to Queen Elizabeth I, mentioned in [...] "The Shakespeare Code" [...] and The End of Time, is finally depicted. The Tenth Doctor mentioned the Fall of Arcadia in [...] "Doomsday". When the Eleventh Doctor tells Clara {{that the situation}} is [...] "timey-wimey stuff," [...] and the War Doctor ridicules him for it, the Tenth Doctor remarks, [...] "I have no idea where he picks that stuff up"; the Tenth originally used the phrase in [...] "Blink". When he leaves after learning of Trenzalore, the Tenth Doctor remarks, [...] "I don't want to go…", his incarnation's final words from The End of Time; the Eleventh Doctor tells Clara that [...] "he always says that" [...] after his TARDIS leaves. The Moment device was originally mentioned in The End of Time, but had not been explored in depth until now, where it takes the form of [...] "Bad Wolf", a seemingly omnipotent being and <b>personalisation</b> of the Time Vortex itself, which manifested in Rose Tyler when she absorbed the Time Vortex in the first series finale, [...] "The Parting of the Ways". During the negotiations with the Zygons Kate mentions the Sycorax from [...] "The Christmas Invasion".|$|E
