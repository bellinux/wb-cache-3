The presence of second-phase particles (slag and unreduced iron oxides) in the microstructure of the iron, that of high amounts of phosphorus in the metal, and the alternate wetting and drying existing under atmospheric conditions are the three main factors in the three-stage formation of that protective <b>passive</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E
50|$|While tribocorrosion {{phenomena}} {{may affect}} many materials, {{they are most}} critical for metals, especially the normally corrosion resistant so-called passive metals. The vast majority of corrosion resistant metals and alloys used in engineering (stainless steels, titanium, aluminium etc.) fall into this category. These metals are thermodynamically unstable {{in the presence of}} oxygen or water and they derive their corrosion resistance from the presence at the surface of a thin oxide film, called the <b>passive</b> <b>film,</b> which acts as a protective barrier between the metal and its environment. Passive films are usually just a few atomic layers thick. Nevertheless, they can provide excellent corrosion protection because if damaged accidentally they spontaneously self-heal by metal oxidation. However, when a metal surface is subjected to severe rubbing or to a stream of impacting particles the <b>passive</b> <b>film</b> damage becomes continuous and extensive. The self-healing process may no longer be effective and in addition it requires a high rate of metal oxidation. In other words, the underlying metal will strongly corrode before the protective <b>passive</b> <b>film</b> is reformed, if at all. In such a case, the total material loss due to tribocorrosion will be much higher than the sum of wear and corrosion one would measure in experiments with the same metal where only wear or only corrosion takes place. The example illustrates the fact that the rate of tribocorrosion is not simply the addition of the rate of wear and the rate of corrosion but it is strongly affected by synergistic and antagonistic effects between mechanical and chemical mechanisms. To study such effects in the laboratory, one most often uses mechanical wear testing rigs which are equipped with an electrochemical cell. This permits one to control independently the mechanical and chemical parameters. For example, by imposing a given potential to the rubbing metal one can simulate the oxidation potential of the environment and in addition, under certain conditions, the current flow {{is a measure of the}} instantaneous corrosion rate. Volume loss due to electrochemical dissolution can be measured by Faraday's laws of electrolysis and subtracted from total volume loss in tribocorrosion so the sum of mechanical wear loss and the synergies can be calculated. For a deeper understanding tribocorrosion experiments are supplemented by detailed microscopic and analytical studies of the contacting surfaces.|$|E

50|$|Pitting Corrosion {{is defined}} by {{localised}} attack (microns - millimetres in diameter) in an otherwise passive surface and only occurs for specific alloy / environment combinations. Thus, this type of corrosion typically occurs in alloys that are protected by a tenacious (passivating) oxide film such as stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminium alloys in environments that contain an aggressive species such as chlorides (Cl-). In contrast, alloy / environment combinations where the <b>passive</b> <b>film</b> is not very protective usually will not produce pitting corrosion. A {{good example of the}} importance of environment / alloy combinations is carbon steel. In environments where the pH is less than 10, carbon steel does not form a passivating oxide film and the addition of chloride results in uniform attack over the entire surface. However, at pH greater than 10 (alkaline) the oxide is very protecting and the addition of chloride results in pitting corrosion.|$|E
50|$|Co-Cr alloys show high {{resistance}} to corrosion due to the spontaneous formation of a protective <b>passive</b> <b>film</b> composed of mostly Cr2O3, and minor amounts of cobalt and other metal oxides on the surface. As its wide application in biomedical industry indicates, Co-Cr alloys are well known for their biocompatibility. Biocompatibility also depends on the film and how this oxidized surface interacts with physiological environment. Good mechanical properties {{that are similar to}} stainless steel are a result of a multiphase structure and precipitation of carbides, which increase the hardness of Co-Cr alloys tremendously. The hardness of Co-Cr alloys varies ranging 550-800 MPa, and tensile strength varies ranging 145-270 MPa. Moreover, tensile and fatigue strength increases radically as they are heat-treated. However, Co-Cr alloys tend to have low ductility, which can cause component fracture. This is a concern as the alloys are commonly used in hip replacements. In order to overcome the low ductility, nickel, carbon, and/or nitrogen are added. These elements stabilize the γ phase, which has better mechanical properties compared to other phases of Co-Cr alloys.|$|E

50|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of {{a stainless steel}} {{is dependent on the}} presence of an ultra-thin protective oxide film (<b>passive</b> <b>film)</b> on its surface, but it is possible under certain conditions for this oxide film to break down, for example in halide solutions or reducing acids. Areas where the oxide film can break down can also sometimes be the result of the way components are designed, for example under gaskets, in sharp re-entrant corners or associated with incomplete weld penetration or overlapping surfaces. These can all form crevices which can promote corrosion. To function as a corrosion site, a crevice has to be of sufficient width to permit entry of the corrodent, but narrow enough to ensure that the corrodent remains stagnant. Accordingly crevice corrosion usually occurs in gaps a few micrometres wide, and is not found in grooves or slots in which circulation of the corrodent is possible. This problem can often be overcome by paying attention to the design of the component, in particular to avoiding formation of crevices or at least keeping them as open as possible. Crevice corrosion is a very similar mechanism to pitting corrosion; alloys resistant to one are generally resistant to both. Crevice corrosion {{can be viewed as a}} less severe form of localized corrosion when compared with pitting. The depth of penetration and the rate of propagation in pitting corrosion are significantly greater than in crevice corrosion.|$|E

At first, the formation process of the <b>passive</b> <b>film</b> on iron in neutral aqueous is described. The process involves the formations of Fe(OH) 2, Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3. The content of Fe 2 + in a <b>passive</b> <b>film</b> reflects {{the stability of the}} <b>passive</b> <b>film.</b> Then, the electronic properties and the pitting susceptibility of passive films formed on iron and an iron-based alloy and their relation are considered. The <b>passive</b> <b>film</b> formed on iron or iron-based alloy has a structure with point defects that consist of metal interstitials, metal vacancies and oxygen vacancies. The nature of the <b>passive</b> <b>film</b> depends on the point defects that can be represented by the donor density of the <b>passive</b> <b>film.</b> Mott-Schottky relation can be used to determine the electronic properties of the <b>passive</b> <b>film.</b> The relationship between reciprocal square capacitance and potential meeting the Mott-Schottky behavior is limited at a narrow range of low potentials. At higher potentials, the reciprocal capacitance not reciprocal square capacitance is proportional to potential, which is ascribed to the increasing thickness of the <b>passive</b> <b>film</b> with potential.

The model investigates the effect of eroded {{particles}} on a metal on which a <b>passive</b> (oxide) <b>film</b> has formed. To date, many of the existing erosion models have concentrated on normal angle erosion of the oxide layer. This new approach considers the effect of oblique impacts on the oxide layer {{and the effect of}} its thickness on the amount of metal and oxide layer removal. The model is then tested by comparision to previous experimental work...|$|R
