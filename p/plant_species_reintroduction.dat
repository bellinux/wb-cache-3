40|$|<b>Reintroduction</b> {{of native}} <b>species</b> has become {{increasingly}} important in conservation worldwide for recovery of rare species and restoration purposes. However, few studies have reported the outcome of <b>reintroduction</b> efforts in <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Using data from the literature combined with a questionnaire survey, this paper analyses 249 <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions</b> worldwide by assessing the methods used and the results obtained from these reintroduction experiments. The objectives were: (1) to examine how successful <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions</b> have been so far in establishing or significantly augmenting viable, self-sustaining populations in nature; (2) to determine {{the conditions under which}} we might expect <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions</b> to be most successful; (3) to make the results of this survey available for future plant reintroduction trials. Results indicate that survival, flowering and fruiting rates of reintroduced plants are generally quite low (on average 52 %, 19 % and 16 %, respectively). Furthermore, our results show a success rate decline in individual experiments with time. Survival rates reported in the literature are also much higher (78 % on average) than those mentioned by survey participants (33 % on average). We identified various parameters that positively influence plant reintroduction outcomes, e. g. working in protected sites, using seedlings, increasing the number of reintroduced individuals, mixing material from diverse populations, using transplants from stable source populations, site preparation or management effort and knowledge of the genetic variation of the target species. This study also revealed shortcomings of common experimental designs that greatly limit the interpretation of plant reintroduction studies: (1) insufficient monitoring following reintroduction (usually ceasing after 4 years); (2) inadequate documentation, which is especially acute for reintroductions that are regarded as failures; (3) lack of understanding of the underlying reasons for decline in existing plant populations; (4) overly optimistic evaluation of success based on short-term results; and (5) poorly defined success criteria for reintroduction projects. We therefore conclude that the value of plant reintroductions as a conservation tool could be improved by: (1) an increased focus on species biology; (2) using a higher number of transplants (preferring seedlings rather than seeds); (3) taking better account of seed production and recruitment when assessing the success of reintroductions; (4) a consistent long-term monitoring after reintroduction.

40|$|Native {{plants are}} {{important}} for maintaining biodiversity and supporting birds, mammals, and insects in a particular region. The interaction of plants with other organisms is what makes up food webs, and a shift in one will result in change in the other, change that is often detrimental to both. Invasive <b>plant</b> <b>species,</b> which include many nonnative types, can alter ecosystems with lasting effects on hydrology, nutrient cycling, and habitat. Similar to other regions, the Central Plains is increasingly threatened by the establishment of invasive <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> The <b>reintroduction</b> of native <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> not only in large natural areas, but also in smaller settings such as home gardens, small pastures, and urban centers, will be critical in combating the advancement of invasive <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> In The Midwestern Native Garden, Adelman and Schwartz set forth a simple and timely strategy for reducing invasive plant species: plant natives, thereby helping to restore critical ecosystem function {{in a range of}} settings. The book is ideal for plant enthusiasts, home gardeners, and anyone who manages landscapes in rural and urban areas of the Central Plains and neighboring regions. The authors have put together a list of nonnative and potentially invasive plants currently available at retail outlets and unknowingly used for display in private and public settings. For each nonnative plant, at least three to four native alternatives are suggested, along with written and pictorial information on plant characteristics and beneficial insects.

40|$|Strong {{competition}} from invasive <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> {{often leads to}} declines in abundances and may, in certain cases, cause localized extinctions of native <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Nevertheless, {{studies have shown that}} certain populations of native <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> can co-exist with invasive <b>plant</b> <b>species,</b> suggesting the possibility of adaptive evolutionary responses of those populations to the invasive plants.

40|$|Lyons, Robert E. An {{increasing}} number of <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> are being threatened with population fragmentation and extinction, mainly due to anthropogenic actions. Populations with low numbers usually consist of low genetic diversity, which can result in deleterious symptoms that cause further species decline. As a result, numerous species currently exist only as a few genotypes in botanical collections around the world, with little hope of successful reintroduction back into the wild. This research will explore how species with low genetic diversity can best be managed to facilitate reintroduction back into a natural ecosystem, {{and what can be}} done to save those species that are on the verge of extinction. This research investigated the current management practices used for plants with a known low genetic diversity through a survey of botanic garden conservation programs, case studies and interviews. Alternate methods of increasing genetic diversity of plant material in other sectors were also explored as potential conservation measures. Survey results showed most institutions utilize general management practices to facilitate <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction,</b> but few have specialized methods of maintaining or increasing genetic diversity apart from mixing of seed sources. Case studies and interviews with reintroduction experts and crop geneticists supported the development of a set of guidelines for best management practices pertaining to genetic diversity. These guidelines focus on knowledge of species demographics and distribution, stored germplasm, <b>species</b> biology, <b>reintroduction</b> history and the potential for conservation breeding and managed relocation. Additionally, several methods of gene manipulation were identified that may be useful in creating diversity in genetically depauperate species.

25|$|Elements {{of concern}} to the area are fire, over- or under-grazing, native <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction,</b> human {{recreational}} (camping and hunting) and educational/scientific use, resource exploration, linear development, and invasive species. Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat that crowd out native <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity. Linear developments such as roads, pipelines, and powerlines often provide a vector for invasive species to enter new areas. Because of their rapid and opportunistic spread, weeds also often lack the deep root system of native plants and thus contribute to bank instability and soil erosion. The nodding thistle weed (Carduus nutans) was discovered {{in the area in}} 2006. Several other weed species have been found in the natural area, including the highly aggressive downy brome (Bromus tectorum), creeping meadow foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Several of these species have invaded from across the U.S. border into Canada. Formerly utilized as a reclamation species, crested wheatgrass has had detrimental effects on soil and grazing. Russian olive, imported as a soil stabilizer, windbreak, and ornamental, reduces biodiversity of riparian areas.|$|R

40|$|Mycorrhizas are {{interactions}} between fungi and plant roots whereby plants receive inorganic nutrients {{in return for}} providing carbon to their fungal partners. There is considerable evidence that different assemblages of mycorrhizal fungi in soils can have specific impacts on plant communities. This {{has important implications for}} threatened <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> and indicates that associated mycorrhizal fungi must be identified prior to conservation procedures. Molecular methods based on PCR amplification of taxonomically important DNA regions are currently being utilized for mycorrhizal fungal identification in threatened Australian native plants. DNA can be extracted from plant root samples which contain difficult to culture mycorrhizal fungi and fungal DNA selectively amplified using fungal specific primers. Cloning and sequencing of amplicons, followed by database searching for closest species matches has revealed an array of previously undocumented mycorrhizal fungal taxa and addressed a number of important ecological questions. In the vulnerable orchid Dipodium hamiltonianum, these techniques have identified ectomycorrhizal fungi as the main partners of the species, highlighting the interconnectedness between orchid, fungus and local tree species and the importance of habitat retention for protection of orchid populations. Molecular taxonomic techniques are currently being used to identify the mycorrhizal partner of the endangered orchid Arachnorchis atroclavia so that plants can be successfully grown horticulturally and the distribution of the fungal symbiont determined in natural localities prior to <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions.</b> In the vulnerable native pea, Sophora fraseri, PCR, cloning and sequencing of root fungal DNA have shown that the plant preferentially associates with certain arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi - a finding that may explain why horticultural growth of the plant is variable in success.

40|$|Endemic {{seed plants}} are {{important}} floral components in tropical rainforests, {{and are often}} sensitive to human disturbance. However, few reports exist of the impacts of forest logging on these species. In this study, based on surveys of 164 quadrats of 25 mÃ 25 m in Jianfengling, Hainan Island, the species composition and relationships between species richness of Hainan endemic seed plants and the total <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> richness were analyzed. Each of the 164 quadrats was grouped into one of three forest types, including old-growth, selectively logged and clear-cut forests. Then changes in species diversity were studied by comparing speciesâarea relationships, cumulative speciesâindividual relationships and species abundance distributions for the Hainan endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> among the three forests types. Results highlighted the abundance and diversity of endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> in Jianfengling. We found 158 species which acount for 40 % of all endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> found on Hainan Island, including 98 woody species (excluding lianas). Fifty-two woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> (excluding lianas) from Hainan Island were recorded in the 164 quadrats; 53 % of all woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> in Jianfengling. Among them, Lauraceae, Fagaceae and Rubiaceae are dominant families. The richness of the woody seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> endemic to Hainan Island was linearly correlated with the total <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> richness in the quadrat. After forest logging, the number of woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> appears to increase slightly, especially in selectively logged forests. However, the woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> that appear to increase post-logging only occur in 1 â 2 quadrats and have relatively small and unstable populations, and may therefore disappear during forest succession. On the other hand, some endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> still have medium populations after logging, such as Nephelium topengii, Madhuca hainanensis and Castanopsis jianfenglingensis...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested that ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> are {{adapted to the}} seasonal variation in ant activity, i. e. that ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> produce ripe fruits when the activity of their seed dispersers is especially high. Two testable predictions of this hypothesis exist: 1. Ant dispersed and differently dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> differ in their seasonal development, i. e. ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> fruit (flower) earlier or {{later in the year}} than other <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Floristic investigations yielded ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> to flower and fruit 1. 5 - 2 month earlier than non-ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Since other factors such as growth form, seed size or pollination mode may have caused this seasonal difference, multivariate analyses were performed. The results demonstrated that these additional factors had only little influence on the seasonal difference and that the effect was mainly due to the mode of seed dispersal. 2. At times when ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> produce ripe fruits the ant activity must be higher than at times when non-ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> do. Investigations of seasonal frequencies of ant individuals and of seasonal seed removal rates revealed ant activity to be especially high from May to July. Mean fruiting time of ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> was the beginning of July. Mean fruiting time of non-ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> was end of August / beginning of September. Statistical tests revealed that if ant dispersed plants had fruited as late as the other plants, they would have suffered a significant loss in seed removal. These results support the hypothesis drawn up in the beginning. The early fruiting times of ant dispersed plants appear to be an adaptation to the seasonal variation in ant activity...|$|R
