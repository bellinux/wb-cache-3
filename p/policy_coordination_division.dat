40|$|Abstracts: With {{the recent}} {{advent of the}} global {{financial}} crisis initiated {{by the collapse of}} the US mortgage loan market, the importance of international <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> for financial market regulation has been reemphasized. We examine the condition for the cooperative <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> for financial regulation to be self-enforcing considering asymmetric political economic structures of involved countries. It is demonstrated that when the level of asymmetries are within the range of critical value while the policy-continuity is higher than the critical value, a simple introduction of <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> mechanism itself can make the cooperative <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> as self-enforcing even without external credible enforcement mechanism. However, when the country asymmetry in political structure is higher than the critical value, and the policy continuity is lower than the critical value, an external enforcement should be adopted for credible <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> for financial regulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications of}} international <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> when both monetary and fiscal policy choices are endogenous. We show that a movement from insular monetary commitment to international monetary <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> will, if fiscal policies are not coordinated, produce higher output and public expenditure levels {{at the expense of}} higher inflation rates. We also show that the concurrent coordination of monetary and fiscal policies raises output and inflation while lowering public expenditure relative to a regime of monetary coordination alone. We conclude that the arguments for concurrent monetary and fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> fail to have a clear-cut theoretical basis.

40|$|Macroeconomic {{policies}} {{are meant to}} achieve non-inflationary, stable growth. There are two major groups of policy instruments to achieve the purpose; one is related to monetary conditions {{and the other to}} fiscal conditions. Monetary instruments are employed by the central bank and fiscal instruments are employed by ministry of finance. The objectives and implications of policy measures taken by the two institutions often conflict with each other and thus call for <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> for effective implementation of policy decisions to achieve the set targets. The <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> has to be supported by concrete institutional and operating arrangements like monetary and fiscal coordination board. In Pakistan there was no concept of such <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> before financial sector reforms which were initiated in 1989 - 90.

Without coordination, however, governments choose inefficient tax rates. But taxes may be either higher or lower than under <b>policy</b> <b>coordination.</b> As a consequence, growth rates may be lower or higher than those under <b>policy</b> <b>coordination.</b> Copyright 1992 by Economics Department of the University of Pennsylvania and the Osaka University Institute of Social and Economic Research Association. ...|$|R

When donor countries are altruistic with higher welfare from the increased income of the poor in the recipient country, {{it has been argued}} for aids <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> to reduce a common good problem. Based on a simple model considering asymmetric donors making endogenous decision on the amount of aids and recipient country making decision on the income transfer for the poor people, we demonstrate that aids <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> does not always welfare dominates the non-cooperative aids policies.

40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} {{international}} <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> requires to include both monetary {{as well as}} fiscal policy because both sides include policy instruments that allow the strategic manipulation of the country’s terms of trade. Hence, the coordination of one part of national macroeconomic policies through an international agreement still leaves room for national authorities to still unilaterally manipulate the terms of trade by means of different policy instruments. In a simple and tractable dynamic stochastic two-country sticky-wage model {{in line with the}} recent New Open Economy Macroeconomics it is demonstrated that potential gains from international <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> are squandered if policymakers only cooperate on monetary policy. Moreover, by letting the fiscal policy instruments be chosen non-cooperatively, monetary <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> might even create welfare losses as compared to no macroeconomic <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> at all...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the intra-daily {{volatility}} of the yen/dollar exchange rate over three different regimes from 1979 to 1988 which correspond to different degrees of international <b>policy</b> <b>coordination.</b> In each regime we test for heat wave vs. meteor shower effects. The heat wave hypothesis assumes that volatility has only country specific autocorrelations, while the meteor shower hypothesis allows volatility spillovers from one market to the next. Meteor showers can be caused by stochastic <b>policy</b> <b>coordination,</b> by gradual release of private information, or by market failures such as fads, bubbles or bandwagons. The rejection of the heat wave model over the first half of the 1980 s discredits the stochastic <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> interpretation because there was little <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> among industrial countries prior to the Plaza Agreement in 1985. ...|$|R
40|$|Fifty years ago, the Chicago School {{argued that}} {{flexible}} exchange rates would insulate employment from foreign economic disturbances: {{there is no need}} for policy coordination; {{flexible exchange rates}} suffice. Twenty five years later, the Bretton Woods system was gone, and the first generation of <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> models was introduced. Chicago School arguments not withstanding, these Old-Keynesian models provided a theoretical rational for <b>policy</b> <b>coordination.</b> Now, a new generation of <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> models is emerging. These New-Keynesian models incorporate optimizing households, monopolistic competition and nominal inertia. Here, we examine macroeconomic interdependence and the scope for <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> in a tractable second generation model that has received much recent attention. We relate our discussion to the old Chicago School arguments, to earlier analyses of first generation models, to recent empirical work on productivity, and to recent theoretical work on closed economy models. We conclude that second generation models may have more scope for <b>policy</b> <b>coordination</b> than did the first, and we identify the empirical work that is needed to give a serious answer to the question. ...|$|R
