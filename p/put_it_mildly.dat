They note that [...] "Borglum's past insolence had not left him in the good graces of the art community" [...] and his designs met a hostile reception at the commission. Sculptor member James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel, rejected Borglum's initial design on July 22, eight days after they were received. [...] The inscription on the reverse included a tribute to Harding; Fraser deemed it inartistic. [...] Borglum submitted a second set on August 14, this was again rejected; the commission criticized the design, {{which seemed to be}} only a segment of a larger one, rather than specifically designed to fit a half dollar. [...] Borglum wanted to ignore what he deemed [...] "damn fool suggestions", but the Association threatened to fire him if he did not complete the coin. Borglum was concerned the reverse was still too crowded, and proposed leaving off the eagle, but space was saved when Coolidge did not like the reference to Harding, and it was omitted. [...] With the eagle still in place on the reverse, Fraser finally approved the designs on October 10, 1924. [...] In all, Borglum made nine plaster models for the design.|$|E
