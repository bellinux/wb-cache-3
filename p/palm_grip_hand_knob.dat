40|$|The finger <b>grip</b> and the <b>palm</b> <b>grip</b> are {{the most}} common needle holder <b>grips</b> for <b>hand</b> suturing in surgery. The major {{advantages}} of the <b>palm</b> <b>grip</b> are an increased versatility and the possibility to apply controlled force. However, there is a risk for a potential loss of precision and uncontrolled movement of the needle when disengaging the ratchet mechanism of the palmed instrument. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a new needle holder, referred to as the Frimand needle holder (FNH), and evaluate surgeons' perception of it. It was designed to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages, hence facilitating <b>palm</b> and finger <b>grip</b> suturing. Moreover, we evaluated suture precision and attitudes related to the use of the finger <b>grip</b> and the <b>palm</b> <b>grip...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background Vascular {{damage in}} the central <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area can mimic {{peripheral}} motor nerve deficits. Case presentation We describe {{the case of a}} woman presenting with apparent peripheral neuropathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography revealed an infarct in the precentral <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area, with significant stenosis in the right proximal middle cerebral artery trunk. Subsequent 3 -Tesla magnetic resonance imaging of the brain suggested cerebral angiitis. The patient experienced improved hand function following combined glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide treatment. Conclusion Vascular {{damage in the}} <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area should be considered when evaluating peripheral motor nerve deficits in the presence of normal nerve conduction velocities. The diagnosis of cerebral angiitis remains a major challenge for clinicians...|$|R

40|$|Purpose.  Volume {{rendering}} (VR) of three-dimensional (3 D) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) images shows regional intensity differences, reflecting the central sulcus (CS) region and occipital cortex. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether 3 D FLAIR with VR could be used as an alternative method to localise the CS region in comparison with functional and conventional MR-imaging in patients with perirolandic glioma. Methods.  Eleven patients with intracranial gliomas were studied with single-slab 3 D FLAIR including VR and conventional T 1 -weighted imaging. In all patients, preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed with a motor paradigm of the hand. The hypo-intense central gyri on 3 D FLAIR with VR were interpreted as the CS area. Localisation of the motor <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> on anatomical images and fMRI results were used for identification of the primary motor cortex. Results.  Anatomical localisation of the motor <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> on T 1 -weighted images was possible in 91 % of both hemispheres. In 73 % of the affected hemispheres (AH) and 91 % of the unaffected hemispheres (UH) the <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> and CS region could be identified on 3 D FLAIR axial and VR images, respectively. With one exception, fMRI activation confirmed the CS region as observed with 3 D FLAIR with VR. Conclusions.  Volume rendering of 3 D FLAIR MR images shows central hypo-intensities frequently corresponding with the CS region. Two-dimensional localisation of the CS region on conventional T 1 -weighted images and fMRI seems favourable compared to 3 D FLAIR. However, in selected cases, especially where fMRI is not possible or feasible, volume rendering with 3 D FLAIR may enhance the 3 D visualisation of gliomas in relation to the CS region which can be used as an alternative method in the presurgical structural and functional evaluation of neurosurgical patient...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>grip</b> {{strength}} (a biomechanical parameter) {{plays an}} important role in daily life and especially during the sportive activities to get the maximum efficiency.

This study was carried out on 22 elite wrestlers who wrestle for professional Turkish wrestling clubs in Ankara. <b>Hand</b> <b>grip</b> strength of wrestlers in 66 kilogram category was only measured in this study for standardization. Maximum and minimum right and left <b>hand</b> <b>grip</b> strengths of the wrestlers were measured when the arms positioned in 90 ˚ and 180 ˚ degree angles.
