5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When <b>physical</b> <b>chemist</b> Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{followed}} up the work by constructing a particle accelerator that could fire protons {{with up to}} 600,000 electronvolts of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockroft and Walton on the artificial disintegration of the nucleus and positive ions. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years. In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received {{a gift from the}} American <b>physical</b> <b>chemist</b> Gilbert N. Lewis of a few drops of heavy water. The accelerator was used to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons, which Rutherford called diplons) at various targets.

5|$|Levi {{worked as}} Franck's assistant, {{publishing}} two papers {{with him on}} the fluorescence of chlorophyll, until he left Denmark for the United States in 1935. She then became assistant to the Hungarian <b>physical</b> <b>chemist</b> George de Hevesy. The recent discovery of induced radioactivity and the consequent creation of short-lived radioactive isotopes opened up a number of new uses for radioactive substances in biology which she explored with de Hevesy, publishing a number of papers with him. The University of Berlin cancelled Levi's doctorate in 1938. In April 1940, the Germans occupied Denmark. When the Nazis began rounding up Danish Jews in September 1943, Levi was one of the thousands of Jews who fled to Sweden. For the rest of the war she worked for the biologist John Runnström at the Wenner-Gren Institute for Experimental Biology in Stockholm.|$|E

40|$|Ions {{in water}} are the liquid of life. Life occurs almost entirely in 'salt water'. Water itself (without ions) is lethal to animal cells and {{damaging}} for most proteins. Water must conta{{in the right}} ions in the right amounts {{if it is to}} sustain life. Physical chemistry is the language of electrolyte solutions. Physical chemistry and biology are intertwined. <b>Physical</b> <b>chemists</b> and biologists come from different traditions that separated for several decades as biologists described the molecules of life. Communication is not easy between a fundamentally descriptive tradition and a fundamentally analytical one. Biologists have now learned to study well defined systems with physical techniques, of considerable interest to <b>physical</b> <b>chemists.</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>chemists</b> are increasingly interested in spatially inhomogeneous systems with structures on the atomic scale so common in biology. <b>Physical</b> <b>chemists</b> will find it productive to work on well defined systems built by evolution to be reasonably robust, with input output relations insensitive to environmental insults. This article deals with properties of ion channels that in my view can be dealt with by 'physics as usual', with much the same tools that <b>physical</b> <b>chemists</b> apply to other systems. Indeed, I introduce and use a tool of physicists-a field theory (and boundary conditions) based on an energy variational approach developed by Chun Liu-not too widely used among <b>physical</b> <b>chemists.</b> My goal is to provide the knowledge base, and identify the assumptions, that biologists use in studying ion channels, avoiding jargon. Rather simple models of selectivity and permeation in ion channels work quite well in important cases. Those physical models and cases are the main focus of this review because they demonstrate the strong essential link between the traditional treatments of ions in chemical physics, and the biological function of ion channels.

He attended Audlem grammar school in Cheshire beginning in 1896; the next year, the County Council built a laboratory at the school, sparking young Freeth's interest in the subject. He excelled at chemistry but had poor mathematical skills. On his second attempt, he passed the matriculation exam to study at Liverpool University from 1900, graduating with first-class honours in 1905 and then a master's degree in 1906.

25|$|Also in 1934, {{scientists}} Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck, {{produced the}} radioactive isotope tritium by hitting deuterium with high energy nuclei. The deuterium {{used in the}} experiment was a generous gift of heavy water from the Berkeley physicist Gilbert N Lewis. Interestingly, bombarding deuterium produced two previously undetected isotopes, helium-3 and hydrogen-3. Rutherford and his colleagues successfully created tritium, but incorrectly assumed that helium-3 was the radioactive component. The work of Luis Walter Alvarez and Robert Cornog first isolated tritium and reversed Rutherford's incorrect notion. Alvarez reasoned that tritium was radioactive, but did not measure the half life, although calculations at the time suggested over ten years. At the end of World War II, the <b>physical</b> <b>chemist</b> Willard Libby detected the residual radioactivity of a tritium sample with a Geiger counter, providing a more accurate understanding of the half life, now accepted at 12.3 years.|$|E
