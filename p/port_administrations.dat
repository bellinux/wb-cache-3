40|$|Prediction {{of cargo}} volumes is {{important}} for authorities such as <b>port</b> <b>administrations</b> and port operators, as cargo throughput affects port planning and operation. The forecasting results help planners and policy-makers to take decisions {{on issues such as}} port investment, port development, berth location selection, port operation, and freight rate. The success of the port operation policy depends on the accuracy of the cargo forecast. This paper presents an improved model known as dynamic regression (DR) model to forecast cargo demand simultaneously for ports within a port system; the model is applied to forecast cargo demand at major seaports in India. Past cargo flow data from years 1980 - 1981 to 2013 - 2014 at 11 major ports in India are used for estimating the proposed model. Average prediction error is found to be within 10 % for most of the ports. The DR model is used to produce forecasts up to 2019 - 2020 for all the ports studied. The model forecast is compared with the projections of the Ministry of Shipping, Government of India. This study is intended to provide guidance to planners in taking decisions on issues related to port infrastructure development, such as construction of new terminals and improvement of access roads to ports for the major ports in India. The study will also be beneficial to shipping agencies for their investment strategies in the Indian ports sector...|$|E
40|$|Ports {{located in}} the Portuguese west coast have been collectively defined as the ?Portuguese Range?, constituting a {{multi-port}} gateway system integrated within the broader context of an already well-established traditional maritime region. The aim {{of this paper is}} to identify how the Portuguese ports have been developing and how they can establish themselves as a gateway to the Iberian Peninsula and Western Europe. In fact, Portuguese range ports, located at the extreme of rail freight corridor n 4, could greatly benefit from ?port regionalization? into bordering regions of Spain, the Madrid Community and Northern Europe, forming in this way a competitive gateway to foreland regions along the Atlantic Ocean, such as Latin America, North America, West Africa and Southern Africa. The paper first describes the current situation of Portuguese ports regarding infrastructure, superstructure and throughput, aiming at establishing its capabilities, level of activity and potential problems. Regional transport infrastructures current status, such as rail lines, inland terminals and dry ports are also reviewed, including projects currently foreseen by authorities. Main problems and bottlenecks in regional connections are identified. Main shipping lines calling in Portuguese ports, terminal operators, railway operators and 3 P logistics service providers operating in Portugal are also identified. The strategies for promoting ?port regionalization? adopted by these different players in the supply chain are reviewed and analyzed, with focus on shipping lines, terminal operators, freight forwarders, <b>port</b> <b>administrations</b> and Governments. Conclusions are drawn and policy suggestions are made for further improvements in the regionalization of Portuguese ports, taken as an enhancer of economic growth...|$|E

40|$|From the First World War Australian <b>port</b> <b>administration</b> {{came under}} {{criticism}} from exporters, shipping {{companies and the}} Commonwealth government, all of whom argued that port authorities charges imposed an excessive burden on exporters. They sought the replacement of public port authorities by trusts representative of business interests. The campaign for <b>port</b> <b>administration</b> reform also diverted farmers from criticism of shipping freights and to secure their acquiescence in anti-competitive practices in the shipping industry. The formation of the Australian Overseas Transport Association in 1929 {{was the culmination of}} this campaign. Elite conservative political support for such anti-competitive practices reflected a belief that competitive capitalism was inherently unstable. The Scullin Labor of 1929 - 31 government abandoned Labor 2 ̆ 7 s earlier hostility to shipping companies to support cartelisation. Conservative state governments, in a more competitive electoral position than their federal counterparts and under greater financial pressure, deflected business calls for <b>port</b> <b>administration</b> reform. Business groups expected the NSW conservative government elected in 1932 to reform <b>port</b> <b>administration</b> towards a representative model, but the Maritime Services Board established in 1935 merely rationalised existing administrative structures. In the 1980 s international economic instability legitimated the project of microeconomic reform, particularly in the maritime sector, but in the interwar period a different balance of capital, labour and the state meant that economic isolationism rather than integration was the policy outcome. <br /...|$|R
