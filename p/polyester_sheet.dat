50|$|Silk screens {{are created}} by {{printing}} a black outline {{on a sheet of}} clear acetate, such as with an ink jet printer, then burning the image onto a frame holding a <b>polyester</b> <b>sheet</b> on which a plastic-like emulsion has been applied. Exposing the emulsion to light causes the emulsion to dry or “fix,” while the emulsion directly underneath the black lines on the acetate remain soft and unfixed. When the silk screen is “washed out” by a hose, or even power-washed, the emulsion directly under the black outline of the image is vacated, leaving a porous outline. The black line, semi-liquid can now be pushed, usually with a squeegee, through the porous outline onto a piece of tile. Good silk screens are extremely useful in that, once created, the pattern can be applied repeatedly to many tiles, of course, even changing the colors for any given project.|$|E

Plants from under and outside the screens were sampled seven times over 35 days. Correlative analyses indicated that concentrations of an anthocyanin-like pigment located in leaf tips were positively associated with UV-B transmission at the last two samplings, that concentrations of total chlorophylls were negatively associated with UV-B transmission at the final sampling, and that those of UV-B screening pigments were positively correlated with transmission at three intermediate samplings. Plants exposed to low UV-B transmission levels were visibly greener than those exposed to high transmission levels after approximately 23 days. The closest relationships between the treatment and concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were associated with increased ambient biologically weighted UV-B dose received by plants in the 5. 5 h before each sampling, which coincided {{with the passage of}} the ozone hole over Rothera Point.
