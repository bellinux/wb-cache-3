40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted aimed first at establishing {{the reliability and}} validity of a measure of individual differences in sleeping schedules. Two samples of subjects completed a questionnaire concerning their sleeping behavior which was scored according to the diurnal or nocturnal pattern of their responses. The scores were then used to classify subjects as morning <b>people</b> or <b>evening</b> <b>people.</b> Both the internal reliability and cross-time reliability of the scale were assessed and found to be high. In addition, three indices of construct validity, obtained 4 months after the administration of the scale, supported its validity. In a second part of the experiment, subjects classified as either morning or <b>evening</b> <b>people</b> rated themselves on a set of behavioral and personality dimensions. Another sample of subjects indicated their perceptions of morning <b>people</b> and <b>evening</b> <b>people</b> in general, along the same dimensions. It was found that subjects did have strong beliefs about personality and behavioral differences between morning <b>people</b> and <b>evening</b> <b>people.</b> However, the self-perceptions of the actual morning and <b>evening</b> <b>people</b> did not differ, thereby casting doubt on the validity of popular stereotypic perceptions about the two groups...|$|R

However, McGuire did capture a number of Ziegfeld's traits, such as sending telegrams to <b>people</b> <b>even</b> in close proximity, his belief that elephants were a symbol of good luck, his exquisite taste in costumes and design, and perfectionism over his productions, especially lighting and rostrum pedestaling. McGuire's script, now in the Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, California, is dated September 21, 1935, probably the date when it was finalized.|$|E
5|$|After {{the presidential}} visit, the royal party headed to Baltimore where Secretary of State William H.

The King {{was interested in the}} institution's role in educating Native Americans in the industrial trade, a model he wanted to bring back to his <b>people,</b> <b>even</b> though Samuel Armstrong had modeled his school after the Hilo Boarding School in Hawaii. After a visit to the Old Soldier's Home and a reception at Virginia Hall, the party returned north to Fortress Monroe, where they witnessed a review, and then proceeded to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. It was reported that the royal party also visited Yorktown to observe the centennial celebration of its siege.|$|E

5|$|In the Roman {{system of}} direct democracy, two primary types of gatherings {{were used to}} vote on legislative, electoral, and {{judicial}} matters. The first was the Assembly (comitia), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman <b>people,</b> <b>even</b> {{if it did not}} contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the comitia curiata, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (concilium), which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.|$|E
5|$|Mauricio Macri, {{mayor of}} Buenos Aires, was elected {{president}} in the 2015 presidential elections, defeating the Kirchnerite candidate Daniel Scioli in a ballotage. During the transition period, Macri reported that Kirchner was creating obstacles and problems {{in an attempt to}} undermine his government. She changed the 2016 budget, increasing spending in several areas (even the broadcasting of soccer matches), despite the huge fiscal deficit. A number of Kirchnerite officials refused to resign their offices to allow Macri to appoint his own <b>people.</b> <b>Even</b> the handover ceremony became controversial, as Kirchner refused to attend it. It was {{the first time since the}} end of military rule in 1983 that the outgoing president did not hand over power to the incoming one.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people in}} the stadium were unaware that the (first) Ibrox {{disaster}} had happened. <b>People</b> <b>even</b> re-occupied the damaged area, despite the danger of further collapse. A definite reason for the disaster was not agreed upon, partly {{because there was no}} public inquiry held. Some experts blamed the quality of wood and the supplier was tried for culpable homicide, but was acquitted. The design was also cited as a possible cause. Generally, wooden structures of that size were not trusted. Rangers removed the wooden terraces, reducing capacity to 25,000. The criticism of the design did not deter Rangers from hiring Leitch in the future. He designed an expansion of Ibrox to a 63,000 capacity by 1910, using slopes made of earth. By this point, the city of Glasgow had the three largest purpose-built football grounds in the world.|$|E
