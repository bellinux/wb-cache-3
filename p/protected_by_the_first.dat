Mademoiselle de Maupin described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than The Well did. According to Ernst, The Well had greater social value because it was more serious in tone and made a case against misunderstanding and intolerance.|$|E

25|$|Zimmermann {{challenged}} {{these regulations}} in an imaginative way. He published the entire source code of PGP in a hardback book, via MIT Press, which was distributed and sold widely. Anybody wishing {{to build their}} own copy of PGP could cut off the covers, separate the pages, and scan them using an OCR program (or conceivably enter it as a type-in program if OCR software was not available), creating a set of source code text files. One could then build the application using the freely available GNU Compiler Collection. PGP would thus be available anywhere in the world. The claimed principle was simple: export of munitions—guns, bombs, planes, and software—was (and remains) restricted; but the export of books is <b>protected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Amendment. The question was never tested in court with respect to PGP. In cases addressing other encryption software, however, two federal appeals courts have established the rule that cryptographic software source code is speech <b>protected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Amendment (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bernstein case and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Junger case).|$|E

40|$|Bankruptcy judges {{routinely}} enjoin {{debt and}} equity trading during Chapter 11 proceedings {{in order to}} protect bankrupt corporations 2 ̆ 7 net operating loss (NOL) tax credits. These credits disappear if a corporation changes ownership. Firms and judges reason that Chapter 112 ̆ 7 s automatic stay prohibits any trading that would imperil NOL credits by causing a change in ownership. The automatic stay protects a debtor corporation 2 ̆ 7 s assets, and firms and judges argue that tax credits are assets <b>protected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stay. At <b>first</b> glance, this argument makes sense. However, a deeper analysis reveals serious legal and policy concerns with trading injunctions in Chapter 11. Prohibiting trading is an extreme step that lacks a clear foundation in previous legislative and judicial treatment of the automatic stay. In addition to imposing costs on shareholders and debtholders in a bankrupt corporation, trading injunctions provide a debtor corporation 2 ̆ 7 s management with a powerful-and potentially coercive-tool to entrench its position. Furthermore, NOL credits for reorganized corporations make little sense from a tax policy perspective: NOL credits are meant to offset profits from the project that created the losses, but reorganized corporations use NOL credits to offset gains from reorganization. This Note critiques the treatment of NOLs during Chapter 11 from both bankruptcy and tax angles. Thus far, there has been almost no policy conversation surrounding NOLs in bankruptcy.
