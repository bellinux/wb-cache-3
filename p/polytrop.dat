40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{issues on the}} {{thermodynamic}} property of stellar self-gravitating system arising from Tsallis ’ non-extensive entropy. Previous papers (Physica A 307 (2002) 185; ibid. (2003) in press (cond-mat/ 0204315)) have revealed that the extremum-state of Tsallis entropy, so-called stellar polytrope, has consistent thermodynamic structure, which predicts the thermodynamic instability due to the negative specific heat. However, their analyses heavily relies on the old Tsallis formalism using standard linear mean values. In this paper, extending our previous study, {{we focus on the}} quasi-equilibrium structure based on the standard framework by means of the normalized q-expectation values. It then turns out that the new extremumstate of Tsallis entropy essentially remains unchanged from the previous result, i. e., the stellar quasi-equilibrium distribution can be described by the stellar polytrope. While the thermodynamic stability for a system confined in an adiabatic wall completely agrees with the previous study and thereby the stability/instability criterion remains unchanged, the stability analysis reveals a new equilibrium property for the system surrounded by a thermal bath. In any case, the stability/instability criteria are consistently explained from the presence of negative specific heat and within the formalism, the stellar polytrope is characterized as a plausible non-extensive meta-equilibrium state.

40|$|In this paper, we {{continue}} to investigate the thermodynamic properties of stellar self-gravitating system arising from the Tsallis generalized entropy. In particular, physical interpretation of the thermodynamic instability, as has been revealed by previous paper(Taruya & Sakagami, Physica A 307 (2002) 185), is discussed in detail based on the framework of non-extensive thermostatistics. Examining the Clausius relation in a quasi-static experiment, we obtain the standard result of thermodynamic relation that the physical temperature of the equilibrium non-extensive system is identified with the inverse of the Lagrange multiplier, Tphys = 1 /β. Using this relation, the specific heat of total system is computed, and confirm the common feature of self-gravitating system {{that the presence of}} negative specific heat leads to the thermodynamic instability. In addition to the gravothermal instability discovered previously, the specific heat shows the curious divergent behavior at the polytrope index n> 3, suggesting another type of thermodynamic instability {{in the case of the}} system surrounded by the thermal bath. Evaluating the second variation of free energy, we check the condition for onset of this instability and find that the zero-eigenvalue problem of the second variation of free energy exactly recovers the marginal stability condition indicated from the specific heat. Thus, the stellar polytropic system is consistently characterized by the non-extensive thermostatistics as a plausible thermal equilibrium state. We also clarify the non-trivial scaling behavior appeared in specific heat and address the origin of non-extensive nature in stellar polytrope.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the theory of Newtonian and {{relativistic}} polytropes with generalized polytropic equation of state. For this purpose, we formulated the general framework to discuss the physical properties of <b>polytrops</b> with anisotropic inner fluid distribution under conformally flat condition in the presence of charge. We investigate the stability of these <b>polytrops</b> in the vicinity of generalized polytropic equation through Tolman-mass. It is concluded that one of the derived models is physically acceptable.
