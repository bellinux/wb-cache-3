50|$|Xiaomi {{announced}} the Mi Smart Scale for CNY 99 on 31 March 2015. According to Xiaomi, the smart <b>personal</b> <b>weighing</b> <b>scale</b> makes measurements ranging from 5 kg to 150 kg, with a 50 g precision, and shows {{weight in kg}} and lbs. When paired with the Mi Fit app, which itself pairs with the Mi Band, users can track their weight and BMI. The Mi Smart Scale is equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 and is compatible with both Android and iOS. The maker of the scale is Huami, a company Xiaomi invested in.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the reproducibility of the BCG obtained from different <b>weighing</b> <b>scales.</b> First, the natural frequency of three commercial bathroom scales {{has been characterized}} by an impulse excitation test. Second, the BCG and the ECG from 5 healthy subjects (27 ± 4 years) have been recorded for 60 s by sequentially standing on these <b>weighing</b> <b>scales</b> connected to the same analog front-end and signal acquisition system. An ensemble average representative of each subject and <b>weighing</b> <b>scale</b> has been obtained by applying Woody’s method with the ECG as a timing reference. Consecutive BCG signals obtained from the three scales show consistent systematic intra-subject differences in {{the timing of the}} J peak that can reach up to 30 ms. This timing error is relevant because it is about 50 % of the changes induced by typical respiratory maneuvers, such as Valsalva’s, used to modulate hemodynamic parameters in correlation studies between changes in J timing with respect to different cardiac fiducial points. Due to its ubiquity, <b>weighing</b> <b>scales</b> are promising devices for monitoring cardiovascular function at home but their frequency response must be accounted for and minimal performance standards should be defined for them.
