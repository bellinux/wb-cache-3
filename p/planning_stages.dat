40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{issues associated}} {{with the needs of}} collaborative supply chain management (CSCM) and proposes a <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> of a CSCM framework. Design/methodology/approach– The proposed <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> of a CSCM framework incorporates issues of organisation profile, internal functional strategy and supplier‐customer strategy. The gauging absence of prerequisites (GAP) analysis technique which embedded in the knowledge‐based system is proposed in the <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> to analyse the gap between the current and the desirable position (benchmark) for an effective implementation in organisation. Findings – The <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> framework provides information specifically for designing a CSCM by focusing on the organisation capability and business processes and discussed the important issues in planning a CSCM for business organisations, specifically for a manufacturing environment. Research limitations/implications – Further research could be carried out to capitalise the framework for improving the CSCM. Practical implications– The proposed <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> of a CSCM framework enables the chain members to identify key factors or issues for CSCM development. Originality/value– The new aspects of the proposed CSCM are firstly, the proposed <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> model is supported by a KBS approach. Secondly, the use of GAP analysis technique and finally, the <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> framework provides information and issues for the design stage of CSCM framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{construction}} industry is still plagued by poor quality, poor workmanship, poor {{safety and health}} environment, and poor practices. The current main problem in the Malaysian Construction Industry is delayed projects under the Ninth Malaysia Plan. The idea of introducing formal risk assessment among Malaysian contractors during the project <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> is a proactive approach to achieve project objectives. Therefore, this research intends to achieve the following objectives: (1) to investigate the contractors’ approaches of risk assessment techniques at the project <b>planning</b> <b>stage,</b> (2) to investigate the consequences of risk assessment techniques at the project <b>planning</b> <b>stage,</b> and (3) to determine the appropriate risk assessment techniques {{in dealing with the}} potential risk factors at the project <b>planning</b> <b>stage.</b> The research methodology applied for this research includes literature reviews and questionnaires. Findings from this research show that the application of risk assessment techniques in the Malaysian Construction Industry is still moderate. Hence, it is suggested that these contractors should try to implement formal risk assessment techniques during the project <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> in order to achieve the project objectives. ...|$|R

5|$|When the Interstate Highway {{system was}} in the <b>planning</b> <b>stages,</b> the western {{terminus}} of I-70 was proposed to be at Denver. The portion west of Denver was included into the plans after lobbying by Governor Edwin C. Johnson, for whom one of the tunnels along I-70 is named. East of Idaho Springs, I-70 was built along the corridor of U.S. Highway40, {{one of the original}} transcontinental U.S. Highways. West of Idaho Springs, I-70 was built along the route of U.S. Highway6, which was extended into Colorado during the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|After McDougall {{was unable}} to persuade {{existing}} shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in Superior, Wisconsin in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted his design and company by sending the SS Charles W. Wetmore to London, and starting another shipyard in Everett, Washington, which built the SS City of Everett. When the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, {{to be held in}} Chicago, Illinois, was in the <b>planning</b> <b>stages,</b> McDougall recognized another opportunity to publicize his design. The Columbus, conceived as an elaborate ferry, was intended to demonstrate that the whaleback design would work well in passenger service, and would be able to travel at high speed. The ship's name honored the explorer Christopher Columbus as did the World's Columbian Exposition itself, timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of his first voyage to the New World.|$|E

5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the <b>planning</b> <b>stages,</b> the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E
5|$|From {{the initial}} <b>planning</b> <b>stages,</b> proponents and opponents {{speculated that the}} large size of the {{reservoir}} created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, {{and most of the}} reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around Great Slave Lake and Lake Baikal, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of lake-effect snow. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land around the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, the {{executive}} board of the state railways wanted to centralise the operation of restaurant carriages {{and the most important}} station restaurants in Norway under one management. The board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the dining-car operator. They also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate a larger share of the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines. At that time the Sørland Line and Dovre Line were in the <b>planning</b> <b>stages,</b> and the NSB intended to introduce dining services on these when they opened. Oslo East Station and its restaurant were operated by the private Norwegian Trunk Railway. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918 both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, but this company had to abide by the NSB's decision of how many restaurant carriages to operate on any line.|$|E
