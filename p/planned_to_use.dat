5|$|According to On a Field of Red, {{a history}} of the Comintern (Communist International) by Anthony Cave Brown and Charles B. MacDonald, Fuchs's {{greatest}} contribution to the Soviets may have been disclosing how uranium could be processed for use in a bomb. Fuchs gave Gold technical information in January 1945 that was acquired only after two years of experimentation at a cost of $400 million. Fuchs also disclosed the amount of uranium or plutonium the Americans <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in each atomic bomb.|$|E

5|$|Another revolutionary, José Manuel Herrera, {{created a}} {{government}} on Galveston Island in September 1816 which he proclaimed {{part of a}} Mexican Republic. A group of French exiles in the United States attempted {{to create their own}} colony on the Trinity River, known as Le Champ d'Asile. The exiles <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the colony as a base to liberate New Spain and then free Napoleon from St. Helena. They abandoned the colony shortly and returned to Galveston.|$|E
5|$|Block II {{had already}} been <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened {{in less than five}} seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the explosive bolts used on Project Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Five North Korean {{divisions}} amassed {{to oppose}} the UN at Taegu; from south to north, the 10th, 3rd, 15th, 13th, and 1st Divisions occupied a line from Tuksong-dong and around Waegwan to Kunwi. The North Koreans <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the natural corridor of the Naktong valley from Sangju to Taegu as their main axis of attack for the next push south. Elements of the NK 105th Armored Division were also supporting the attack.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Crawford married Franchot Tone, a stage actor from New York who <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{his film}} {{earnings}} to finance his theatre group. The couple built a small theatre at Crawford's Brentwood home {{and put on}} productions of classic plays for select groups of friends. Tone and Crawford had first appeared together in Today We Live (1933) but Crawford was hesitant about entering into another romance so soon after her split from Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|Koji Kondo (credited as Konchan) {{composed}} the game's music. He initially <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Maurice Ravel's Boléro as the game's title theme, but {{was forced to}} change it when he learned, late in the game's development cycle, that the copyright for the orchestral piece had not yet expired. As a result, Kondo wrote a new arrangement of the overworld theme within one day.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the march, {{organizers}} surveyed Tom McCall Waterfront Park {{and posted}} flyers about {{the event in}} the surrounding area.

5|$|The Marines {{began their}} attack, codenamed Operation Vigilant Resolve, on 5 April. The overall ground {{commander}} in Anbar, 1st Marine Division commander General James Mattis, initially <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his only available units, 1st Battalion 5th Marines and 2nd Battalion 1st Marines. They would push {{in from the}} east and west and methodically contain the insurgents. This plan was underway when on 9 April, General Sanchez ordered an immediate halt.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{production}} variant was the H-20, which entered into production in early 1944. It was <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> two 1,305kW (1,750hp) Junkers Jumo 213E-1 engines, turning three-blade, Junkers VS 11 wooden-bladed variable-pitch propellers. It would appear this plan was never developed fully. Though the later H-22 {{was given the}} E-1, the F-2 remained the H-20s main power plant. Heinkel and its licensees built 550 H-20s through the summer of 1944, while 586 H-6s were upgraded to H-20 standard.|$|E
5|$|When Scott finally read Zelda's book, a {{week after}} she'd sent it to Perkins, he was furious. The book was a semi-autobiographical account of the Fitzgeralds' marriage.

5|$|At {{its peak}} in 1912, the B {{operated}} 12 Boston-Albany round trips, one Boston-Pittsfield round trip, {{and as many as}} 10 Pittsfield-North Adams round trips. Around 1913 the New Haven <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Housatonic as part of a New York-Montreal through route to compete with the NYC, but this never materialized and service levels were never high. After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential toxic waste site {{in the path of the}} subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E
5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Ball Z: Attack of the Saiyans, {{known in}} Japan as Dragon Ball Kai: Saiyan Invasion, is {{a video game}} based on the manga and anime series Dragon Ball for the Nintendo DS. The game is {{developed}} by Monolith Soft and distributed by Namco Bandai in North America and everywhere else under the Bandai label. It was released in Japan on April 29, 2009. The game was released in Europe and North America in November 2009. The game was originally <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Z moniker, despite starting with events that occur in Dragon Ball, but was changed to Kai to associate it with the Dragon Ball Kai revision.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasm {{for game}} {{distribution}} ebbed, and CD Projekt's founders {{wondered if the}} company should continue as a distributor or a game developer after Dark Alliances cancellation. With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt, the company <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> them to develop their first original game. They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedźmin books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired {{the rights to the}} Wiedźmin franchise. According to Iwiński, he and Kiciński {{had no idea how to}} develop a video game at that time.|$|E
5|$|Five KPA {{divisions}} amassed {{to oppose}} the UN at Taegu. From south to north, the 10th, 3rd, 15th, 13th, and 1st Divisions occupied a wide line encircling Taegu from Tuksong-dong and around Waegwan to Kunwi. The KPA <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the natural corridor of the Naktong valley from Sangju to Taegu as its main axis of attack for the next push south, so the divisions all eventually moved through this valley, crossing the Naktong at different areas along the low ground.
