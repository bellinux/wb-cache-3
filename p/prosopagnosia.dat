5|$|In {{the true}} ending, Junpei learns that the {{previous}} Nonary Game consisted of nine pairs of kidnapped siblings separated onto the ocean-bound Gigantic and in a mock-up in Building Q in the Nevada desert. The game was designed to explore morphic fields; the research anticipated that {{the stress of the}} game would activate the fields between siblings, allowing solutions solved by one to be sent via these fields to their counterpart at the other location. This research was to help Ace cure his <b>prosopagnosia.</b> This Nonary Game went awry: Akane and her brother Santa were placed at the same location instead of being separated, and Seven discovered the kidnappings and rescued the children from the ship. Ace grabbed Akane before they could escape, and forced her into the incinerator room where she faced a sudoku puzzle that she could not solve, and apparently died.|$|E

25|$|Evolutionary psychologists {{contend that}} {{perception}} demonstrates {{the principle of}} modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks. For example, people with damage to a particular {{part of the brain}} suffer from the specific defect {{of not being able to}} recognize faces (<b>prosopagnosia).</b> Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, {{individuals}} with associative visual agnosia experience difficulty {{when asked to}} name objects. Associative agnosia is associated with damage to both {{the right and left}} hemispheres at the occipitotemporal border. [...] A specific form of associative visual agnosia is known as <b>prosopagnosia.</b> [...] <b>Prosopagnosia</b> is the inability to recognize faces. [...] For example, these individuals have difficulty recognizing friends, family and coworkers. However, {{individuals with}} <b>prosopagnosia</b> can recognize all other types of visual stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|These {{strategies}} elicit {{the use of}} an unaffected modality. [...] For example, visual agnosics can use tactile {{information in}} replacement of visual information. [...] Alternatively, an individual with <b>prosopagnosia</b> can use auditory information in order to replace visual information. [...] For example, an individual with <b>prosopagnosia</b> can wait for someone to speak, and will usually recognize the individual from their speech.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Prosopagnosia</b> is an {{inability}} to identify faces and face-like objects. [...] This represents a failure to encode incoming visual information. Neurological studies indicate that <b>prosopagnosia</b> is associated with bilateral lesions of the central visual system, primarily located in the mesial occipitotemporal region. The inability to correctly recognize a face can have detrimental consequences for building social relationships {{due to the fact}} that recognition is required for associating feelings or experiences with a stimulus.|$|E
2500|$|Sacks {{believed}} his shyness stemmed from his <b>prosopagnosia,</b> {{popularly known as}} [...] "face blindness", a condition that, coincidentally, he also studied {{in some of his}} patients, including the titular man from his work The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. This neurological disability of his, whose severity and life-impacts Sacks did not fully grasp until he reached middle age, even prevented him from recognising his own reflection in mirrors. Sacks' eldest brother Marcus also had <b>prosopagnosia.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Two subtypes are {{distinguished}} behaviorally {{as being}} associative or apperceptive in nature. [...] Associative <b>prosopagnosia</b> {{is characterized by}} an impairment in recognition of a familiar face as familiar; however, individuals retain the ability to distinguish between faces based on general features, such as, age, gender and emotional expression. [...] This subtype is distinguished through facial matching tasks or feature identification tasks of unknown faces.|$|E
2500|$|Alternate cues may be {{particularly}} useful to an individual with environmental agnosia or <b>prosopagnosia.</b> [...] Alternate cues for an individual with environmental agnosia may include color cues or tactile markers to symbolize a new room or to remember an area by. [...] Prosopagnosics may use alternate cues such as a scar on an individual's face or crooked teeth in order to recognize the individual. Hair color and length can be helpful cues as well.|$|E
2500|$|Category-specific agnosias are {{differential}} {{impairments in}} subject knowledge or recognition abilities pertaining to specific classes of stimuli, such as living things vs. non-living things, animate vs. inaminate things, food, metals, musical instruments, etc. [...] Some {{of the most}} common category-specific agnosias involve recognition impairments for living things, but not non-living things, or human faces, as in <b>prosopagnosia.</b> [...] This type of deficit is typically associated with head injury or stroke, though other medical conditions have been implicated, such as, herpes encephalitis.|$|E
2500|$|Anosognosia, {{a lack of}} {{awareness}} of the deficit, is common and can cause therapeutic resistance. [...] In some agnosias, such as <b>prosopagnosia,</b> awareness of the deficit is often present; however shame and embarrassment regarding the symptoms can be a barrier in admission of a deficiency. [...] Because agnosias result from brain lesions, no direct treatment for them currently exists, and intervention is aimed at utilization of coping strategies by patients and those around them. [...] Sensory compensation can also develop after one modality is impaired in agnostics ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Prosopagnosia</b> (or [...] "face blindness") is a category-specific visual object agnosia, specifically, {{impairment}} in visual recognition of familiar faces, such as close friends, family, husbands, wives, {{and sometimes even}} their own faces. [...] Individuals are often able to identify others through alternate characteristics, such as, voice, gait, [...] context or unique facial features. [...] This deficit is typically assessed through picture identification tasks of famous persons. This condition is associated with damage to the medial occipito-temporal gyri, including the fusiform and lingual gryi, as the suggested location of the brain's face recognition units.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of prosopagnosia: {{acquired}} and congenital (developmental). Acquired <b>prosopagnosia</b> results from occipito-temporal lobe damage and is most often found in adults. This is further subdivided into apperceptive and associative <b>prosopagnosia.</b> In congenital <b>prosopagnosia,</b> the individual never adequately develops the ability to recognize faces.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} <b>prosopagnosia</b> has been crucial in the {{development}} of theories of face perception. Because <b>prosopagnosia</b> is not a unitary disorder (i.e., different people may show different types and levels of impairment), {{it has been argued that}} face perception involves a number of stages, each of which can cause qualitative differences in impairment that different persons with <b>prosopagnosia</b> may exhibit.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{children}} with <b>prosopagnosia</b> {{can have a}} difficult time at school, as many school professionals are not well versed in <b>prosopagnosia,</b> if they are aware of the disorder at all.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>prosopagnosia,</b> {{congenital}} and acquired. Congenital <b>prosopagnosia</b> is an inability to recognize faces without a history of brain damage; while acquired <b>prosopagnosia</b> is caused by damage to the right occipital-temporal region of the brain. In the 1950s it was theorized that the right cerebral hemisphere was involved in facial recognition and in the 1960s this theory was supported by many experiments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Prosopagnosia,</b> an {{inability}} to recognize human faces. Individuals with <b>prosopagnosia</b> {{know that they are}} looking at faces, but cannot recognize people by the sight of their face, even people whom they know well.|$|E
5000|$|Management {{strategies}} for acquired <b>prosopagnosia,</b> {{such as a}} person who has difficulty recognizing people's faces after a stroke, generally have a low rate of success. [...] Acquired <b>prosopagnosia</b> sometimes spontaneously resolves on its own.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, {{individuals}} with associative visual agnosia experience difficulty {{when asked to}} name objects. Associative agnosia is associated with damage to both {{the right and left}} hemispheres at the occipitotemporal border. [...] A specific form of associative visual agnosia is known as <b>prosopagnosia.</b> <b>Prosopagnosia</b> is the inability to recognize faces. For example, these individuals have difficulty recognizing friends, family and coworkers. However, {{individuals with}} <b>prosopagnosia</b> can recognize all other types of visual stimuli.|$|E
50|$|Acquired <b>prosopagnosia</b> {{can develop}} {{as the result}} of several neurologically {{damaging}} causes. Vascular causes of <b>prosopagnosia</b> include posterior cerebral artery infarcts (PCAIs) and hemorrhages in the infero-medial part of the temporo-occipital area. These can be either bilateral or unilateral, but if they are unilateral, they are almost always in the right hemisphere. Recent studies have confirmed that right hemisphere damage to the specific temporo-occipital areas mentioned above is sufficient to induce <b>prosopagnosia.</b> MRI scans of patients with <b>prosopagnosia</b> showed lesions isolated to the right hemisphere, while fMRI scans showed that the left hemisphere was functioning normally. Unilateral left temporo-occipital lesions result in object agnosia, but spare face recognition processes, although a few cases have been documented where left unilateral damage resulted in <b>prosopagnosia.</b> It has been suggested that these face recognition impairments caused by left hemisphere damage are due to a semantic defect blocking retrieval processes that are involved in obtaining person-specific semantic information from the visual modality.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, a study led by Ingo Kennerknecht showed {{support for}} the {{proposed}} congenital disorder form of <b>prosopagnosia.</b> This study provides epidemiological evidence that congenital <b>prosopagnosia</b> is a frequently occurring cognitive disorder that often runs in families. The analysis of pedigree trees formed within the study also indicates that the segregation pattern of hereditary <b>prosopagnosia</b> (HPA) is fully compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. This mode of inheritance explains why HPA is so common among certain families (Kennerknecht et al. 2006).|$|E

50|$|Developmental <b>prosopagnosia</b> {{can be a}} {{difficult}} thing {{for a child to}} both understand and cope with. Many adults with developmental <b>prosopagnosia</b> report {{that for a long time}} they had no idea that they had a deficit in face processing, unaware that others could distinguish people solely on facial differences.|$|E

5000|$|Apperceptive <b>prosopagnosia</b> has {{typically}} {{been used}} to describe cases of acquired <b>prosopagnosia</b> {{with some of the}} earliest processes in the face perception system. The brain areas thought to {{play a critical role in}} apperceptive <b>prosopagnosia</b> are right occipital temporal regions. [...] People with this disorder cannot make any sense of faces and are unable to make same-different judgments when they are presented with pictures of different faces. They are unable to recognize both familiar and unfamiliar faces. However, they may be able to recognize people based on non-face clues such as their clothing, hairstyle, skin color, or voice.|$|E
50|$|The test may {{be useful}} for {{identifying}} patients with apperceptive <b>prosopagnosia,</b> since this is mainly a matching test and {{they are unable to}} recognize both familiar and unfamiliar faces. They would be unable to pass the test. It would not be useful in diagnosing patients with associative <b>prosopagnosia</b> since they are able to match faces.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} <b>prosopagnosia</b> (an {{impairment}} in recognizing faces {{which is usually}} caused by brain injury) has been particularly helpful in understanding how normal face perception might work. Individuals with <b>prosopagnosia</b> may differ in their abilities to understand faces, {{and it has been}} the investigation of these differences which has suggested that several stage theories might be correct.|$|E
