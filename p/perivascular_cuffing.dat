40|$|The {{mononuclear}} {{cells of}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) inflammatory response were characterized in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meningeal exudate, and brain parenchyma of mice 3 - 14 d after infection with Sindbis virus. The inflammatory infiltrate in CSF peaked and resolved before that of the parenchyma or meningeal exudate. Immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal antibodies identified CSF inflammatory cells to be almost exclusively T cells, while inflammatory cells in the brain parenchymal <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> and the meninges were a mixture of T cells, B cells, and macrophages. The percentage of B cells and macrophages increased at the later time points. Approximately 20 % of CSF and 50 % of the cells present early in the <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> were not identified, suggesting that another subset of inflammatory cells may be present.

40|$|The {{expression}} of inducible {{nitric oxide synthase}} (iNOS) was studied in the brains of cattle, sheep, and goat that succumbed to a natural infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The lesions in infected brains are characterized by microabscesses, <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs,</b> gliosis, glial nodules, and large areas of malacia. Using immunocytochemistry, we detected bacteria in microabscesses, particularly in sheep and goats, and in areas without signs of inflammation, but not in perivascular infiltrates. iNOS was expressed by macrophage (Mphi) -type cells of microabscesses and glial nodules but rarely by Mphi in areas of malacia, as determined by immunohistochemistry with iNOS-specific antibodies. iNOS was not detected in <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs.</b> Major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHC-II), another marker of cell activation, showed a different pattern of distribution. <b>Perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> contained high numbers of MHC-II-positive cells, including some with Mphi characteristics. Microabscesses in sheep and goats showed low {{expression of}} MHC-II, particularly in iNOS-expressing cells. In cattle, the expression of markers for activated or recruited phagocytes, the calcium-binding proteins S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 (formerly called MRP- 8 and MRP- 14, respectively), was largely restricted to cells showing weak or undetectable iNOS expression; iNOS-positive Mphi showed a low expression of S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9. Thus, iNOS is expressed by a restricted subset of Mphi in listeric encephalitis. In cultured sheep and goat Mphi, a low proportion of cells expressed iNOS upon activation by L. monocytogenes and gamma interferon, resulting in nitrite generation at least 1 order of magnitude lower than that in similarly treated cattle Mphi.

50|$|Granulomatous amoebic {{encephalitis}} {{is caused}} by amoeba infection of the central nervous system. It is characterized by neurological symptoms including headache, seizures, and mental status abnormalities. These worsen progressively over weeks to months, leading to death in most patients. Infection is generally associated with underlying conditions such as immunodeficiency, diabetes, malignancies, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus, and alcoholism. The parasite enters the body through cuts in the skin or by being inhaled into the upper respiratory tract. The parasite then spreads through the blood into the central nervous system. Acanthamoeba crosses the blood-brain barrier by means that are not yet understood. Subsequent invasion of the connective tissue and induction of pro-inflammatory responses leads to neuronal damage that can be fatal within days. Pure granulomatous lesions are rare in patients with AIDS and other related immunodeficiency states as the patients do not have adequate numbers of CD+ve T-cells to mount a granulomatous response to Acanthamoeba infection in CNS and other organ and tissues. A <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffing</b> with amoebae in necrotic tissue is usual finding in the AIDS and related T-cell immunodeficiency conditions. A post mortem biopsy reveals severe oedema and hemorrhagic necrosis. A patient who has contracted this illness usually displays subacute symptoms, including altered mental status, headaches, fever, neck stiffness, seizures, focal neurological signs (such as cranial nerve palsies and coma), all leading to death within one week to several months. Due to the rarity of this parasite {{and a lack of}} knowledge, there are currently no good diagnoses or treatments for Acanthamoeba infection. Acanthamoeba keratitis cases in the past, when were managed by atropine given as an adjuvant therapy without anti-parasitic drugs added to the regime, had been reported to halt the vision loss. Recent publications debate these successes related to an action of Atropine on muscarinic receptors on Acanthamoeba spp.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan {{protozoan}} that {{is considered}} one of the main agents responsible for abortion in ruminants. The lesions found in the central nervous system (CNS) of aborted fetuses show multifocal necrosis, gliosis, and <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> of mononuclear cells, but the inflammatory and glial cells have not been immunophenotypically characterized. The lesions in the CNS of infected adult animals have rarely been described. Therefore, in this study, we characterized the lesions, the immunophenotypes of the inflammatory and glial cells and the expression of MHC-II and PCNA in the CNS of goats infected with N. caninum. The CNS of eight aborted fetuses and six adult male goats naturally infected with N. caninum were analyzed with lectin histochemistry (RCA 1) and immunohistochemistry (with anti-CD 3, −CD 79 α, −GFAP, −MHC-II, and -PCNA antibodies). All animals were the offspring of dams naturally infected with N. caninum. Results The microscopic lesions in the CNS of the aborted fetuses consisted of <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> composed mainly of macrophages (RCA 1 +), rare T lymphocytes (CD 3 +), and rare B lymphocytes (CD 79 α+). Multifocal necrosis surrounded by astrocytes (GFAP+), gliosis composed predominantly of monocytic-lineage cells (macrophages and microglia, RCA 1 +), and the cysts of N. caninum, related (or not) to the lesions were present. Similar lesions were found in four of the six male goats, and multinucleate giant cells related to focal gliosis were also found in three adult goats. Anti-GFAP immunostaining showed astrocytes characterizing areas of glial scarring. Cysts of N. caninum were found in three adult male goats. The presence of N. caninum was evaluated with histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and PCR. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated anti-PCNA labeling of macrophages and microglia in the <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> and the expression of MHC-II by microglia and endothelial cells in the CNS of the aborted fetuses and adult male goats. Conclusions Macrophages and microglia were the predominant inflammatory cells in the CNS of aborted fetuses and healthy adult male goats infected with N. caninum.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{and experimental}} autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are autoimmune inflammatory diseases in which cytokines are intimately involved. Here we test {{the hypothesis that}} injection of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor-?

We were particularly interested to learn whether a local increase in cytokines influenced the pathology locally, or more extensively, within the CNS. EAE was induced in female adult Lewis rats. Eight days post-inoculation, TNF? or INF? was injected into one cerebral hemisphere. Days 11 and 13 post-inoculation (3 and 5 days after the injection of cytokine) inflammation was quantified by the number of <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> and the degree of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression by microglia. Normal animals injected with cytokines, and EAE animals with saline injection served as controls. Results: microglial activation was increased three- to fourfold in the brain and eightfold in the spinal cord (P ? 0. 05); lymphocyte invasion was increased sixfold in the brain and three- to fourfold in the spinal cord (P ? 0. 01) following injections of TNF? or INF? in EAE animals compared with controls. Significant axonal damage was observed in white matter associated with the <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs.</b> Conclusion: local changes in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the brain in EAE results in the widespread enhancement of autoimmune inflammation within the brain and cord, and exacerbation of clinical symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{and stroke}} pathology are characterized blood-brain barrier breakdown, leucocyte emigration, and tissue destruction. Each process {{is thought to}} involve the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), but little is known of their expression. We undertook to investigate whether MMP expression {{is dependent on the}} nature of the CNS lesion and whether expression would coincide with the histopathology. MS or cerebral-infarct tissue was examined for the presence of gelatinase-A, gelatinase-B, matrilysin and stromelysin- 1. Gelatinases A and B and matrilysin expression was found to be up-regulated in microglia/macrophages within acute MS lesions. In active-chronic MS lesions, matrilysin and gelatinase-A expression was pronounced in the active borders. In chronic MS lesions, the expression of matrilysin was confined to macrophages within <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs.</b> The pattern of MMP expression in infarct lesions differed considerably. Gelatinase-B was strongly expressed by neutrophils in tissue from patients up to 1 week after an infarct, whereas gelatinase-A and matrilysin staining was much less marked. From 1 week to 5 years, neutrophils were absent and the large number of macrophages present were expressing matrilysin and gelatinase A. Only a low level of gelatinase-A and matrilysin expression was observed in normal brain controls. Thus, MMPs are expressed in inflammatory lesions in the CNS, but their individual expression is dependent on the nature and chronicity of the lesion. However, the general pattern of expression, in <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> and in active lesions, supports a role for these enzymes as mediators of blood-brain barrier breakdown and tissue destruction, both in MS and in cerebral ischaemia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{occurrence}} of idiopathic pulmonary lesions in laboratory rats, characterized by lymphohistiocytic inter-stitial pneumonia with dense <b>perivascular</b> lymphoid <b>cuffs,</b> {{has been reported}} over the past decade. Although the term rat respiratory virus (RRV) was adopted to confer a puta-tive viral etiology to the idiopathic pulmonary lesions, the etiology of this disease remains to be elucidated. Recently, inflammatory lesions have been observed in the lungs of immunocompetent laboratory rats similar to those previ-ously described. Based on the latest evidence indicating that Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii), and not putative RRV, causes infectious interstitial pneumonia in laboratory rats, {{the present study investigated}} whether the pulmo-nary lesions observed were caused by P. carinii infection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, free of known pathogens, were introduced into a rat colony positive for RRV-type lesions. Routine histopathological examinations were performed on the rat lung tissues following exposure. The presence of Pneumocystis organisms was confirmed using Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) staining. At week 3 following introduction, a few small lymphoid aggregates were located adjacent to the edematous vascular sheath. By week 5, foci of dense <b>perivascular</b> lymphoid <b>cuffing</b> were observed. Multifocal lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia and prominent lymphoid <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> were observed between week 7 and 10. GMS staining confirmed the pres-ence of Pneumocystis cysts. Thus, {{the results of the present}} study demonstrated that P. carinii caused lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia in a group of laboratory rats.

40|$|A male, six-year-old pudu (Pudu puda) from an Italian zoo was {{submitted}} for postmortem examination after sudden death. Necroscopy revealed non-suppurative bronchopneumonia and degeneration {{of the liver}} and haemorrhagic lesions of the thymus, pericardium and spleen. Microscopically, multifocal perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed in the kidneys, lungs, spleen, and the portal triads of the liver. Histological examination of the brain showed meningitis, vasculitis and <b>perivascular</b> <b>cuffs</b> of mononuclear inflammatory cells. A region of the DNA polymerase gene of malignant catarrhal fever viruses was amplified by real-time PCR and nested PCR. PCR products from the tissue samples were sequenced and analysed. The sequences showed 99 % similarity with {{a portion of the}} caprine herpesvirus 2 DNA polymerase gene. This is the first report of malignant catarrhal fever in a captive pudu...|$|R
