40|$|Distributed {{shared memory}} (DSM) systems simplify {{the task of}} writing distributedmemory {{parallel}} programs by automating data distribution and communication. Unfortunately, DSM systems control memory and communication using fixed policies, even when programmers or compilers could manage these resources more efficiently. This thesis proposes a new approach that lets users efficiently manage communication and memory on DSM systems. Systems provide primitive DSM mechanisms without binding them to fixed protocols (policies). Standard shared-memory programs use default protocols {{similar to those found}} in current DSM machines. Unlike current systems, these protocols are implemented in unprivileged software. Programmers and compilers are free to modify or replace them with optimized custom protocols that manage memory and communication directly and efficiently. To explore this new approach, this thesis:. identifies a set of mechanisms for distributed shared memory,. develops Tempest, a <b>portab</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a program that}} performs compression of waveform files such as audio data. A simple predictive model of the waveform is used followed by Huffman coding of the prediction residuals. This is both fast and near optimal for many commonly occuring waveform signals. This framework is then extended to lossy coding under the conditions of maximising the segmental {{signal to noise ratio}} on a per frame basis and coding to a fixed acceptable signal to noise ratio. 1 Introduction It is common to store digitised waveforms on computers and the resulting files can often consume significant amounts of storage space. General compression algorithms do not perform very well on these files as they fail {{to take into account the}} structure of the data and the nature of the signal contained therein. Typically a waveform file will consist of signed 16 bit numbers and there will be significant sample to sample correlation. A compression utility for these file must be reasonably fast, <b>portab</b> [...] ...|$|E
