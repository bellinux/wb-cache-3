5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{example in}} England is the Exeter puzzle jugâ€”an example of medieval pottery in Britain. The Exeter <b>puzzle</b> <b>jug</b> dates from about 1300 AD and was originally made in Saintonge, Western France. [...] The <b>puzzle</b> <b>jug</b> is {{a descendant of}} earlier drinking puzzles, such as the fuddling cup and the pot crown, {{each of which has}} a different solution.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>puzzle</b> <b>jug</b> is {{a puzzle}} {{in the form}} of a jug, popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Puzzle jugs of varying quality were popular in homes and taverns. An {{inscription}} typically challenges the drinker to consume the contents without spilling them, which, because the neck of the jug is perforated, is impossible to do conventionally.|$|E
2500|$|Smaller {{and more}} {{everyday}} wares were also made: paving tiles, mugs, drug jars, dishes, wine bottles, , salt pots, candlesticks, fuddling cups, <b>puzzle</b> <b>jugs,</b> barber's bowls, pill slabs, bleeding bowls, porringers, and [...]|$|R
50|$|A Frog mug, Toad mug or Surprise mug {{also known}} as an Ague mug {{is a type of}} ceramic vessel mainly used for {{drinking}} beer or similar alcoholic beverages. They were first produced in Sunderland before being copied in such places as Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Newcastle. These mugs were part of the tradition of drinking games such as fuddling cups and <b>puzzle</b> <b>jugs.</b> In this case the drinking vessels featured one or more painted or three-dimensional ceramic frogs or toads that slowly emerged {{at the bottom of the}} vessel it was drained.|$|R
50|$|Many {{everyday}} wares were made: tiles, mugs, drug jars, dishes, wine bottles, posset pots, salt pots, candlesticks, fuddling cups (that is, ale mugs {{joined in}} groups of three, four or five with connecting holes to confuse the drinker), <b>puzzle</b> <b>jugs</b> (similar to fuddling cups), barber's bowls, pill slabs, bleeding bowls, porringers and flower bricks. Humble undecorated items included chamberpots, colanders and small disposable ointment pots (gallipots), dispensed by apothecaries. Large decorative dishes, often called chargers, were popular, and included much {{of the most ambitious}} painting, often stretching the artists to the edge of their capabilities, and beyond.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a common}} assumption, stated as part of these <b>puzzles,</b> that the <b>jugs</b> in the <b>puzzle</b> are irregularly shaped and unmarked, {{so that it is}} {{impossible}} to accurately measureany quantity of water that does not completely fill a jug. Other assumptions of these problems may include that no water can be spilled, and that each step pouring water from a sourcejug to a destination jug stops when either the source jugis empty or the destination jug is full, whichever happens first.|$|R
