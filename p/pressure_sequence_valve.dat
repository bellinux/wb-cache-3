40|$|The binlifts of refuse {{collectors}} have {{a problem}} with binlift oscillations when the binlift is lowered slowly. The problem escalates with hot oil that has lower viscosity. Most problematic the oscillations are with an accessory scale on the binlift as it does not tolerate oscillations in the position where it takes measurements. These oscillations are caused by load control valves and wrong directional control valve spools make these oscillations worse. To figure out possible solutions for the oscillations the thesis has comprehensive load control valve theory part which summarizes all the traditional and latest inventions related to load control valves. This information is used in selecting valves for measurements. In this thesis there are measurements with different load control valves, directional control valve spools, restrictors, hoses and <b>sequence</b> <b>valves.</b> Measurements are done with a rear loader and they include flow and pressure measuring.

Small intestinal pressures were recorded from six duodenal (1 cm apart) and six jejunal (1 cm apart) sites after a standard lunch (1892 kJ) and dinner (3305 kJ) and an overnight fast in seven ambulant subjects.

Past research showed that monitoring patient breathing can lower the associated mortality rates for long-term bedridden patients.

Such systems aim to extract respiratory signals from time-series <b>pressure</b> <b>sequences.</b> However, variance of movements, such as unpredictable extremities activities, affect the quality of the ex-tracted respiratory signals. BreathSens, a high-density pressure sensing system made of e-Textile, profiles the underbody pressure distribution and localizes torso area based on the high-resolution pressure images. With a robust bodyparts localization algorithm, respiratory signals extracted from the localized torso area are in-sensitive to arbitrary extremities movements.
