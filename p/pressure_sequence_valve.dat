40|$|The binlifts of refuse {{collectors}} have {{a problem}} with binlift oscillations when the binlift is lowered slowly. The problem escalates with hot oil that has lower viscosity. Most problematic the oscillations are with an accessory scale on the binlift as it does not tolerate oscillations in the position where it takes measurements. These oscillations are caused by load control valves and wrong directional control valve spools make these oscillations worse. To figure out possible solutions for the oscillations the thesis has comprehensive load control valve theory part which summarizes all the traditional and latest inventions related to load control valves.

Past research showed that monitoring patient breathing can lower the associated mortality rates for long-term bedridden patients.

Such systems aim to extract respiratory signals from time-series <b>pressure</b> <b>sequences.</b> However, variance of movements, such as unpredictable extremities activities, affect the quality of the ex-tracted respiratory signals. BreathSens, a high-density pressure sensing system made of e-Textile, profiles the underbody pressure distribution and localizes torso area based on the high-resolution pressure images. With a robust bodyparts localization algorithm, respiratory signals extracted from the localized torso area are in-sensitive to arbitrary extremities movements.
