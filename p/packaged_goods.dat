25|$|The European Union {{used the}} Units of Measure Directive {{to attempt to}} achieve a common system of weights and {{measures}} and to facilitate the European Single Market. Throughout the 1990s, the European Commission helped accelerate the process for member countries to complete their metric conversion processes. Among them is the United Kingdom where laws in some or all contexts mandate or permit many imperial measures, such as miles and yards for road-sign distances, road speed limits in miles per hour, pints of beer, and inches for clothes. The United Kingdom secured permanent exemptions for the mile and yard in road markings, and (with Ireland) for the pint (Imperial) of draught beer sold in pubs (see Metrication in the United Kingdom). In 2007, the European Commission also announced that (to appease British public opinion and to facilitate trade with the United States) it was to abandon the requirement for metric-only labelling on <b>packaged</b> <b>goods,</b> and to allow dual metric–imperial marking to continue indefinitely.|$|E

500|$|In the {{countries}} of the Commonwealth of Nations the metric system has replaced the imperial system by varying degrees: Australia, New Zealand and Commonwealth countries in Africa are almost totally metric, India is mostly metric while Canada is partly metric. In the United Kingdom, the metric system, the use of which was first permitted for trade in 1864, [...] is used in much government business, in most industries including building, health and engineering and for pricing by measure or weight in most trading situations, both wholesale and retail. However the imperial system is widely used by the British public, such as feet and inches as a measurement of height, weight in stone and pounds, and is legally mandated in various cases, such as road-sign distances, which must be given in yards and miles. In 2007, the European Commission announced that it was to abandon the requirement for metric-only labelling on <b>packaged</b> <b>goods</b> in the UK, and to allow dual metric–imperial marking to continue indefinitely.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, {{the process}} of {{metrication}} and European units of measurement directives were expected to eliminate {{the use of the}} pound and ounce, but in 2007 the European Commission abandoned the requirement for metric-only labelling on <b>packaged</b> <b>goods</b> there, and allowed for dual metric–imperial marking to continue indefinitely. When used as a measurement of body weight the UK practice remains to use the stone of 14 pounds as the primary measure e.g. [...] "11 stone 4 pounds", rather than [...] "158 pounds" [...] (as done in the US), or [...] "72 kilograms" [...] as used elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|The {{treaty of}} {{accession}} to the European Economic Community (EEC), which the United Kingdom joined in 1973, obliged the United Kingdom to incorporate into domestic law all EEC directives, {{including the use}} of a prescribed SI-based set of units for many purposes within five years. By 1980 most pre-packaged goods were sold using the prescribed units. Mandatory use of prescribed units for retail sales took effect in 1995 for <b>packaged</b> <b>goods</b> and in 2000 for goods sold loose by weight. The use of [...] "supplementary indications" [...] or alternative units (generally the traditional imperial units formerly used) was originally to have been permitted for only a limited period. That period being extended a number of times due to public resistance, until in 2009 the requirement to ultimately cease use of traditional units alongside metric units was finally removed.|$|E
