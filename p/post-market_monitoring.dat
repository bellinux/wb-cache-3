30|$|European Union {{legislation}} [69] specifies {{framework for}} <b>post-market</b> <b>monitoring</b> of GM plant material, to ensure traceability of individual feed-lots entering the European common market. This is important, as only such traceability through proper labeling {{will ensure that}} possible adverse effects from specific harvests or specific batches of feed can be identified. At present the USA, {{which is the largest}} market for genetically modified food for human consumption, has a lack of such traceability. In the USA, this situation has been established through commercial and political influence. Contrary to this, European legislation accommodates traceability of feed for industrial scale production of farmed animals, such as pigs, poultry and cattle. This traceability, however, is not enforced at present. It has been claimed that such a deductive approach to material quality of GM crops would be unfeasible [22]. Contrary to this {{it can be argued that}} labeling and traceability should be used systematically in enforced <b>post-market</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Especially as this systematic approach allows for efficient identification of possible adverse effects from novel feed ingredients following large-scale introduction.

The likelihood of horizontal gene transfer (HGT; CS- 2) of GMO-related DNA to different species is not different from that for other DNA and is unlikely to raise health concerns. Concerning mycotoxins (CS- 3), insect-resistant GM maize may reduce fumonisins contamination as a health benefit, yet other Fusarium toxins and aflatoxins show inconclusive results. For nutritionally altered crops (CS- 4), the genetic modifications applied lead to compositional changes which require special considerations of their nutritional impacts.

30|$|For the record, {{it must be}} {{said that}} very few tests on humans have been carried out up to now. Moreover, {{epidemiological}} studies are not feasible in America, since there is no organized traceability of GMOs anywhere on the continent, where, by far, most of edible GMOs are cultivated (97 %). As a consequence, a <b>post-market</b> <b>monitoring</b> (PMM) is offered to the population. The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol identifying GMOs at the borders of a country has now been signed by over 150 countries, including the member states of the European Union. PMM may have some value in detecting unexpected adverse effects. It could therefore be considered as a routine need. This approach makes it possible to collect information related to risk management. It can be relied upon as a technique for monitoring adverse events or other health outcomes related to the consumption of GM plant-derived foods, provided that the Toxotest approach, together with the SSC method, should have already been applied. The PMM should be linked with the possibility of detecting allergenicity reactions to GMOs in routine medicine, thanks to the very same routine cutaneous tests that should be developed prior to large-scale commercialization. A screening of serum banks of patients with allergies could be also put forward in order to search for antibodies against the main GMOs and not only their transgenic proteins, since they may induce secondary allergenic metabolites in the plant not visible in the substantial equivalence study.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biologic {{drugs have}} revolutionised the {{management}} of many inflammatory conditions. Patent expirations have stimulated development of highly similar but non-identical molecules, the biosimilars. Extrapolation of indications is a key concept {{in the development of}} biosimilars. However, this has been met with concerns around mechanisms of action, equivalence in efficacy and immunogenicity, which are reviewed in this article. METHODS: Narrative overview composed from literature search and the authors' experience. Literature search included Pubmed, Web of Science, and online document archives of the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency. RESULTS: The concepts of biosimilarity and extrapolation of indications are revisited. Concerns around extrapolation are exemplified using the biosimilar infliximab, CT-P 13, focusing on mechanisms of action, immunogenicity and trial design. The opportunities and cautions for using biologics and biosimilars in unlicensed inflammatory conditions are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Biosimilars offer many potential opportunities in improving treatment access and increasing treatment options. The high cost associated with marketing approval means that many bio-originators may never become licenced for rarer inflammatory conditions, despite clinical efficacy. Biosimilars, with lower acquisition cost, may improve access for off-label use of biologics in {{the management of}} these patients. They may also provide opportunities to explore off-label treatment of conditions where biologic therapy is less established. However, this potential advantage must be balanced with the awareness that off-label prescribing can potentially expose patients to risky and ineffective treatments. <b>Post-market</b> <b>monitoring</b> is critical to developing long-term evidence to provide assurances on efficacy as well as safety...|$|E

It then summarizes increasing demands of consumers for safe and healthy produce, generally represented by “quality signs”. After summarizing the European regulatory framework, it develops the actions undertaken by the European Commission and EU member states for satisfying the often conflicting, freedom of cultivation of the farmers and freedom of choice for European consumers. The 2 main results are the coexistence of supply chains’ with an important traceability framework. The actions encompass, in particular, an enforcement network for traceability, with the duties for companies to provide detection methods of GMOs and to financially participate to the incurred costs of methods validation, research projects on traceability and coexistence issues.

Cost-effectiveness is concerned with providing evidence to compare the (economic) costs and the health outcomes of competing health interventions or technologies. This also affects {{translational research}} in all stages, including clinical trials, <b>post-market</b> <b>monitoring</b> and population health outcome assessment. Indeed, economic considerations are important in determining the development and diffusion of a new technology in any scientific field. This is particularly true in health-related sectors, wherein governments and regulatory agencies with a mandate and commitment to efficient and rational allocation of resources require transparent and rigorous economic evidence to support or decline {{the adoption of a}} new technology. In the context of personalized medicine and theragnostics (i. e., the fusion of therapeutics and diagnostics), the use of genomics in clinical practice can be markedly facilitated by tandem evaluation of the clinical benefits/risks of customized health interventions and their cost-effectiveness.

We conclude that despite the recent efforts, there is still a scarcity of convincing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of genomics products that creates a barrier in the uptake of pharmacogenetics in personalized medicine.

A wealth {{of different types of}} monitoring data from various sources including existing environmental monitoring programmes is expected to accumulate. This requires an information system to efficiently structure, process and evaluate the monitoring data. A structure for an Information System for Monitoring GMO (ISMO) was developed by a multidisciplinary research team. It is based on the requirement to organise all relevant information in a logical, readily accessible and functional manner. For the ISMO, we present a combination of three interrelated components: Firstly, an ISMO should comprise a knowledge database structured according to information related to the different scale levels of biological organisation relevant to GMO monitoring and scientific hypotheses on cause-effects which should be validated by monitoring data. Secondly, a monitoring database should be part of an ISMO containing GMO-specific monitoring data and meta-data. This monitoring database should be linked with monitoring data from other monitoring programmes which are relevant for GMO-related questions. Thirdly, an ISMO should encompass a database covering administrative and procedural data. Neither national nor international approaches to an ISMO exist yet. An ISMO as designed in this paper could support competent authorities in both the GMO notification process and in <b>post-market</b> <b>monitoring.</b> This includes evaluating the environmental risks of experimentally releasing GMO and placing them on the market, assessing monitoring plans and evaluating monitoring results. The ISMO should be implemented on both the national and international level, preferably combining different administrative scales. Harmonisation approaches towards GMO monitoring data are at an initial stage, but they are a precondition to coordinated GMO monitoring and to successfully implementing an ISMO. It is recommended to set up a legal basis and to agree on common strategies for the data coordination and harmonisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} Lenziaren is a polynuclear Fe(III) starch/saccharose complex {{intended to}} be used in food for adult cats to reduce phosphate absorption in the gastrointestinal tract in order to prevent chronic kidney disease. The recommended minimum and maximum levels are 0. 25 g and 1. 0 g per cat per day, equivalent to 5   000 and 20   000 mg/kg feed, respectively. The FEEDAP Panel considers that Lenziaren is safe for adult cats at the maximum recommended dose. However, the consequences of chronic exposure have not been investigated. The additive is not genotoxic. No adverse effects were seen in a repeat-dose toxicity study in mice. Lenziaren had no adverse effects on reproduction and development at dose levels that were not toxic to the mother. A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 500 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day was identified for Lenziaren on the basis of maternal toxicity (diarrhoea and reduced body weight gain), which was seen in rabbits at an oral dose of 1   000 mg/kg bw per day or greater. Similar effects were seen in rats, dogs and monkeys at higher doses in repeat-dose toxicity studies. No NOAELs were identified in these studies. Lenziaren is not regarded as an irritant to skin or eyes or as a skin sensitiser. Although some inhalation exposure is possible, it is not expected to be harmful to those exposed as a result of handling the additive. Based on the results of three in vivo efficacy studies, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Lenziaren {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in cats at the highest recommended dose of 1 g/cat per day (equivalent to 20   000 mg/kg feed). However, the FEEDAP Panel has some reservations regarding the value of its long-term use in healthy cats. The Panel concludes that there is a need for a <b>post-market</b> <b>monitoring</b> plan...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA GMO Panel) {{assessed}} the <b>post-market</b> environmental <b>monitoring</b> (PMEM) report for the 2013 growing season of maize MON 810 provided by Monsanto Europe S. A. The EFSA GMO Panel concludes that the data related to insect resistance monitoring does not indicate a significant and consistent decrease in susceptibility of the target pest field populations to Cry 1 Ab protein in Spain over the 2013 growing season. However, considering that the methodology for insect resistance monitoring remained unchanged compared to previous PMEM reports, the EFSA GMO Panel reiterates its previous recommendations for improvement of the insect resistance management plan of maize MON 810. The EFSA GMO Panel also recommends, as part of general surveillance, {{the continuation of the}} screening and discussion of literature on possible adverse effects of maize MON 810 on rove beetles. In the absence of information on the general surveillance of maize MON 810 in 2013, the EFSA GMO Panel cannot conclude on potential unanticipated adverse effects due to the cultivation of maize MON 810 in 2013, or on possible changes to the methodology as compared to previous growing seasons...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{submission}} of application EFSA-GMO-RX- 001 under Regulation (EC) No 1829 / 2003 from Pioneer Overseas Corporation and Dow Agrosciences LLC, the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (GMO Panel) was asked to deliver a scientific risk assessment on the data submitted {{in the frame of}} a renewal of authorisation application of the insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant genetically modified (GM) maize 1507. The data package received in the frame of this renewal application contained <b>post-market</b> environmental <b>monitoring</b> reports, a systematic search and evaluation of literature, an updated bioinformatics analysis and additional documents or studies performed by or on behalf of the applicant. The GMO Panel assessed this data package for possible new hazards, modified exposure or new scientific uncertainties identified during the authorisation period and not previously assessed in the frame of the original application. Under the assumption that the DNA sequence of the event in maize 1507 considered for renewal is identical to the corrected sequence of the originally assessed event, the GMO Panel concludes that no new hazards or modified exposure and no new scientific uncertainties were identified for the application for renewal that would change the conclusions of the original risk assessment on maize 1507 (EFSA, 2005 b, 2009...|$|R
40|$|<b>Post-market</b> {{environmental}} <b>monitoring</b> (PMEM) {{of genetically}} modified (GM) crops is required by EU legislation {{and has been a}} subject of debate for many years; however, no consensus on the methodology to be used has been reached. We explored the suitability of carabid beetles as surrogates for the detection of unintended effects of GM crops in general PMEM surveillance. Our study combines data on carabid communities from five maize field trials in Central Europe. Altogether, 86 species and 58, 304 individuals were collected. Modeling based on the gradual elimination of the least abundant species, or of the fewest categories of functional traits, showed that a trait-based analysis of the most common species may be suitable for PMEM. Species represented by fewer than 230 individuals (all localities combined) should be excluded and species with an abundance higher than 600 should be preserved for statistical analyses. Sixteen species, representing 15 categories of functional traits fulfill these criteria, are typical dominant inhabitants of agroecocoenoses in Central Europe, are easy to determine, and their functional classification is well known. The effect of sampling year is negligible when at least four samples are collected during maize development beginning from 1 April. The recommended methodology fulfills PMEM requirements, including applicability to large-scale use. However, suggested thresholds of carabid comparability should be verified before definitive conclusions are drawn...|$|R
