5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of <b>plant</b> <b>organisation</b> is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} major management challenges and tensions within the European nuclear power industry {{in the context of}} safety. The results show that human resource management, organisational climate and culture, and public confidence and trust are the three most challenging areas for nuclear managers across Europe. Managerial tensions typically relate to the setting of priorities and maintaining focus, and to the need to find a balance between diverging demands and expectations, such as perceived conflicts between economy- and safety-related objectives. Overall, the results suggest that nuclear managers need and use complex models for structuring their realities and that the safety of a nuclear power plant cannot be managed independently of the other goals of the <b>plant</b> <b>organisation.</b> Nuclear power industry Management Safety Challenges Tensions Europe...|$|E
40|$|Drought is a multiform {{constraint}} whose {{impact on}} the vegetal metabolism is very variable according to its duration, intensity and phenological stage of the vegetal development where it occurs. Thus, the plant resistance is expressed at different <b>plant</b> <b>organisation</b> levels. The present study was aimed at integrating knowledge generated by experiments carried out in Senegal on groundnut {{within the framework of}} a breeding programme geared towards improving groundnut yield under drought conditions. Three studies involved in the breeding work, are presented. The first chapter analyses an incomplete half-diallel cross performed on an original population under recurrent selection for drought adaptation. The study confirmed the weak heritability of yields but concludes that the best predictor of pod-yield was the pod-yield itself. By contrast, the study of the genetic correlations showed that a selection for high haulm-yield could lead to poor pod-maturity under drought constraint. The selection indices were performed and used to estimate genetic gains relative to the main agronomic characters according to selection pressure. The second chapter covers the genetic variability of phenological, agronomic and physiological characters studied in two series of quasi-isogenic early lines. It has indicated that genetic variability was expressed in these lines despite its closeness. Some correlations between yield and physiological parameters, i. e. mainly fluorescence parameters, were significant but not stable across lines and environments showing that groundnut have different drought adaptation strategies according to genetic background and drought pattern. This work was pursued at the molecular level with three reference cvs involving the both recurrent parents of the precedent study. The gene transcript kinetics under drought, obtained using RT-PCR, showed that Phospolipase D and Cysteine protease gene expressions were stimulated by stress in the most susceptible cultivars, whereas their was higher LEA gene expression in the resistant one. These interconnected experiments conducted at different <b>plant</b> <b>organisation</b> levels {{led to the development of}} a general methodological model and of new improved genotypes to meet the social demand...|$|E

40|$|Drought is a multiform {{constraint}} expressing {{at different}} <b>plant</b> <b>organisation</b> levels. It is recognised {{as the first}} factor limiting the agriculture production in the world. The Sahel subtropical regions were the most exposed to the devasting effects of the recent climate change. A state of knowledge referring to the plant responses to drought is a fundamental initial step to any program of selection. This review concerns more particularly groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), {{which is a very}} common legume in the Sahel areas. Critical evaluations of traits as relevant selection criteria for a breeding program aiming at improving yield and yield stability under drought constraint were made. The genetic specificities of the species are exposed in the first part. Then {{a detailed description of the}} grain-legume traits related to drought adaptation is presented. The review was widened to other plants for the molecular responses to water deficit, supposed to be more general. Finally, the last part supplied an updated synthesis of the recent advances in biotechnology on groundnut with special focus on drought tolerance...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{methods for}} {{analyzing}} plant performance and its genetic variability under {{a range of}} environmental conditions. Biomass accumulation is linked every day to available light in the PAR domain, multiplied by the proportion of light intercepted by plants and by the radiation use efficiency. Total biomass is cumulated over {{the duration of the}} considered phase (e. g. plant cycle or vegetative phase). These durations are essentially constant for a given genotype provided that time is corrected for temperature (thermal time). Several ways of expressing thermal time are reviewed. Two alternative equations are presented, based either on the effect of transpiration, or on yield components. Their comparative interests and drawbacks are discussed. The genetic variability of each term of considered equations affects yield under water deficit, via mechanisms at different scales of <b>plant</b> <b>organisation</b> and time. The effect of any physiological mechanism on yield of stressed plants acts via one of these terms, although the link is not always straightforward. Finally, I propose practical ways to compare of the productivity of genotypes in field environments, and a ‘minimum dataset’ of environmental data and traits that should be recorded for that...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{climate change}} is characterised by {{increased}} temperatures and altered precipitation patterns. In addition, {{there has been an}} increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events such as drought. Episodes of drought induce a series of interconnected effects, all of which have the potential to alter the carbon balance of forest ecosystems profoundly at different scales of <b>plant</b> <b>organisation</b> and ecosystem functioning. During recent years, considerable {{progress has been made in}} the understanding of how aboveground parts of trees respond to drought and how these responses affect carbon assimilation. In contrast, processes of belowground parts are relatively underrepresented in research on climate change. In this review, we describe current knowledge about responses of tree roots to drought. Tree roots are capable of responding to drought through a variety of strategies that enable them to avoid and tolerate stress. Responses include root biomass adjustments, anatomical alterations, and physiological acclimations. The molecular mechanisms underlying these responses are characterized to some extent, and involve stress signalling and the induction of numerous genes, leading to the activation of tolerance pathways. In addition, mycorrhizas seem to play important protective roles. The current knowledge compiled in this review supports the view that tree roots are well equipped to withstand drought situations and maintain morphological and physiological functions as long as possible. Further, the reviewed literature demonstrates the important role of tree roots in the functioning of forest ecosystems and highlights the need for more research in this emerging field...|$|E

40|$|Traits {{influencing}} plant {{water use}} eventually define the fitness of genotypes for specific rainfall environments. We assessed {{the response of}} several water use traits to vapour pressure deficit (VPD) in pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) genotypes known to differ in drought adaptation mechanisms: PRLT 2 / 89 – 33 (terminal drought-adapted parent), H 77 / 833 – 2 (terminal drought-sensitive parent) and four near-isogenic lines introgressed with a terminal drought tolerance quantitative trait locus (QTL) from PRLT 2 / 89 – 33 (ICMR 01029, ICMR 01031, ICMR 02042, and ICMR 02044). Plant water use traits at various levels of <b>plant</b> <b>organisation</b> were evaluated in seven experiments in plants exposed either transiently or {{over the long term}} to different VPD regimes: biomass components, transpiration (water usage per time unit) and transpiration rate (TR) upon transient VPD increase (g H 2 O cm– 2 h– 1)), transpiration efficiency (g dry biomass per kg H 2 O transpired), leaf expansion rate (cm per thermal time unit) and root anatomy (endodermis dimensions)). High VPD decreased biomass accumulation by reducing tillering, the leaf expansion rate and the duration of leaf expansion; decreased root endodermis cell size; and increased TR and the rate of TR increase upon gradual short-term VPD increases. Such changes may allow plants to increase their water transport capacity in a high VPD environment and are genotype-specific. Some variation in water use components was associated with terminal drought adaptation QTL. Knowledge of water use traits’ plasticity in growth environments that varied in evaporative demand, and on their genetic determinacy, is necessary to develop trait-based breeding approaches to complex constraints...|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} office users’ perceptions of their working environment in relation to the addition of plants. Methodology/Approach Office users’ perceptions were examined using a survey, administered to an experimental group and a control group before and after the installation of plants. The results were analysed to determine any statistically significant differences between the two groups and between the pre-test and post-test surveys for the experimental group. Absence data was analysed to establish any changes in absence rates. Findings Significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups for the work environment contributing to pressure, health concerns, morale and preference for plants. There were also perceived improvements in productivity, pressure, privacy and comfort although these were non-significant. Sickness absence reduced substantially in the area with plants and increased slightly in the control area. Research Limitations It would be useful to extend this research over a longer time frame and in a greater range of buildings to validate the results. Practical Implications By providing well designed workplaces, including living <b>plants,</b> <b>organisations</b> can potentially improve employee perceptions, leading to performance gains and reduced absence. This paper suggests that significant savings can be achieved in comparison to the cost of plants. Originality/Value The role of indoor nature has received relatively little attention compared to the number of studies on outdoor nature.

40|$|Design flaws {{have been}} {{contributing}} to major industrial accidents. However, design activities are understudied in human and organisational factors studies. In {{the nuclear power}} domain, both pre-operational design and design of modifications depend on a network of organizations, and aim at developing solutions which meet different criteria. Nuclear power companies often outsource the design work to organisations, which might not be hitherto familiar with the safety requirements of nuclear industry. The final phase of SADE project focused on testing and evaluating {{the results of the}} first two phases through in depth analysis of case studies conducted in Finland and Sweden. The study aimed at providing insights on the inter-organizational challenges related to design activities, which could potentially affect safety of the Nordic nuclear power plants. In 2013 we carried out 14 semi-structured interviews with representatives of power <b>plant</b> <b>organisations,</b> design organisations and regulators. Interviews of the Finnish case studies were complemented by one group interview each. The study indicated that design-related challenges in the nuclear domain are mainly inter-organizational. This implies that safety management and safety culture approaches should take better into account the inter-organisational nature of work processes. For some of the challenges (e. g. coordination) many coping practices exist throughout the network, whereas for others (e. g. shared understanding) just a few were mentioned. This signifies that design organisations have learned the consequences of insufficient coordination in previous projects, while reaching a shared understanding proves to be challenging. The design process involves both rational and creative approaches to deal with real-life problems. In nuclear industry, designers face the need to balance between fulfilling requirements and doing an extensive amount of paperwork, and creating new, safe and functional solutions. To better manage safety culture in design activities in a networked context, nuclear power companies and design supply chains need to reach a shared understanding on achieving this balance. Finally, the study provides a set of recommendations to support and improve the design process and to help anticipate emerging risks in the nuclear industry...|$|R

This approach reveals significant links between taxonomic practice at the NIAB and historical questions around agricultural research, intellectual property and scientific values.
