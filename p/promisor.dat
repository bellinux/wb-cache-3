25|$|A {{legally binding}} {{contract}} occurs when one party makes an offer and receives an acceptance {{from the other}} party. A contract must consist of an offer and acceptance, the intention to create legal relations and consideration all must be present to make the contract legally enforceable. In contract law consideration {{is concerned with the}} bargain of the contract, each party to a contract must be both a <b>promisor</b> and a promisee. They must each receive a benefit and each suffers a detriment. The classic definition of consideration was given by the court in the case of Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the <b>promisor,</b> Lush J: “A valuable consideration, {{in the sense of the}} law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other".|$|E

40|$|This Comment on Omri Ben-Shahar 2 ̆ 7 s {{excellent}} article {{makes two}} points: 1. Entitlements {{might be more}} valuable under an erosion rule than under a no-erosion rule. 2. In contractual settings, any observed irrelevance {{is likely to be}} the product of forces that are independent of Omri Ben-Shahar 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 litigation commitment 2 ̆ 2 antierosion effect. But before discussing these two issues, let me briefly reformulate Ben-Shahar 2 ̆ 7 s contribution. First, erosion rules can give rise to an 2 ̆ 2 antierosion 2 ̆ 2 effect because erosion rules are a litigation commitment device that helps entitlement holders commit to prosecuting a broader class of opportunistic breaches. In Ben-Shahar 2 ̆ 7 s model, erosion is caused by <b>promisors</b> who intentionally chisel on their duties, knowing, because of the costs of litigation, that the promisees cannot credibly threaten to sue. Second, Ben-Shahar 2 ̆ 7 s irrelevance claim is both stronger and weaker than he acknowledges. The irrelevance claim is stronger, because his model shows not just that erosion costs will be the same under different erosion rules, but that we know that these costs will always be exactly equal to litigation costs saved. The <b>promisors</b> will always chisel to the point where the promisee is almost indifferent between paying litigation costs and swallowing the erosion costs. The irrelevance claim is weaker than Ben-Shahar suggests because, while total erosion costs stay the same, different erosion rules produce different profiles (or cash flows) of erosion. The model predicts that no-erosion rules will produce constant amounts of erosion in each period, but that erosion rules will produce increasing amounts of erosion in each period (less erosion than under a no-erosion rule in early periods and more erosion than under a no-erosion rule in later periods). These different erosion profiles predicted by the model provide an important testable implication. If we don 2 ̆ 7 t think that <b>promisors</b> increase their chiseling through the course of their performance, then we might question whether other parts of Ben-Shahar 2 ̆ 7 s model are accurate...|$|R
40|$|Insincere Promises {{advances}} {{an economic}} theory of promissory fraud. Ayres and Klass {{argue that the}} doctrine of promissory fraud helps to induce efficient reliance from promisees by penalizing <b>promisors</b> who misrepresent the objective probability of their performance. The authors propose a revised doctrine aimed at inducing optimal reliance with minimal transaction costs. I show that Ayres and Klass have all but abandoned the role of intent in the common law of misrepresented intent. Ayres and Klass are concerned only with making available to promisees accurate information about the probability of performance by <b>promisors.</b> I suggest that whatever the merits of their approach, it is inconsonant with the everyday practice of promising, which as a moral practice attaches great significance to subjective intent. Contrasting the common law of promissory fraud with securities regulation of expressions of corporate intent, I argue that the “errors” which Ayres and Klass identify in the case law reflect {{the origins of the}} common law doctrine in the moral practice of promising. The relevance of subject intent to that practice explains why even Ayres and Klass would make subjective intent essential to the crime of false promise, and also explains why they couch their theory of the tort of promissory fraud in intentional terms. I conclude that, though their proposed reforms are consistent with economic theories of contract law, if given effect they would result in a radical overhaul of existing doctrine...|$|R
40|$|Contract rules may be {{dissolving}} into tort-type {{notions of}} unfairness and injustice. Traditionally, promissory estoppel {{was viewed as}} a substitute for consideration in situations where <b>promisors</b> made promises knowing that promisees would act in reliance on them, the promisees did act on the promises, and the <b>promisors</b> refused to do what they promised to do, to the promisees detriment. The purpose of promissory estoppel was clearly one of fairness and preventing injustice by enforcing a promise not supported by consideration in very limited circumstances. In recent cases, however, courts have been approving the use of promissory estoppel as an independent cause of action to provide remedies for alleged contracts that otherwise would be unenforceable. If contract rules are frequently displaced by ad hoc decisions about unfairness, the predictability and reliability of business transactions will diminish to the detriment of all who engage in them. This Article will review the development of the doctrine of promissory estoppel and the variations in its acceptance among the states. It will consider the classification of promissory estoppel as an action at law or in equity and the doctrines weakening of traditional contract rules, particularly the statute of frauds. This Article concludes that it is not in the interest of businesspeople for their contractual obligations to be governed by the communitys shared sense of fairness rather than their specific bargained-for exchanges of promises, as governed by classic contract rules. The former provides no reliability or predictability, just confusion and more opportunity for litigation...|$|R

2500|$|The {{full force}} {{application}} of the equitable maxim estoppel only allows a litigant to “use it as a shield {{and not as a}} sword” restricts the application of this doctrine to as far as only to provide a defence to a party and not {{to be used as a}} cause of action against another. In Combe v Combe [...] 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking promissory estoppel. The court held that promissory estoppel does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant. Promissory estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents the <b>promisor</b> from denying the truth of statement which the promisee had relied. Denning LJ said: [...] "The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them".

40|$|According to some ethical theorists, {{specific}} performance reinforces the moral obligation that promises should be kept. Economists sometimes argue that {{specific performance}} promotes efficient contract bargaining. This Article challenges this conventional wisdom, showing that moral evaluations {{and the willingness}} to bargain are themselves strongly affected by whether specific performance is available as a default remedy or not. Our insight {{is based on a}} novel experiment that measures the decisions and motivations involving the performance, breach, and enforcement of valid legal contracts. Our findings suggest that a specific performance default triggers conflicting moral intuitions about contract breach among contracting parties: it makes the ethical norm to adhere to the contract more salient to promisees, while <b>promisors</b> focus on the efficiency of the breach...|$|R
50|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate in the legal {{literature}} regarding the desirability of specific performance. Economists, generally, take the view that specific performance should be reserved to exceptional settings, because it is costly to administer and may deter <b>promisors</b> from engaging in efficient breach. Professor Steven Shavell, for example, famously argued that specific performance should only be reserved to contracts to convey property and that in all other cases, money damages would be superior. In contrast, many lawyers from other philosophical traditions take the view that specific performance should be preferred as it is closest to what was promised in the contract. There is also uncertainty arising from empirical research whether specific performance provides greater value to promisees than money damages, given the difficulties of enforcement.|$|R
40|$|Promises lie at {{the center}} of persons 2 ̆ 7 moral {{experience}} of one another, and contracts {{lie at the}} center of their legal experience of one another. Many of the most important relationships in our moral and legal culture characteristically arise in connection with promises and contracts of some form or other: Persons 2 ̆ 7 families are connected to marriage promises, their work is connected to employment contracts, and even their citizenship is connected (albeit metaphorically) to the social contract. In all these cases, and in myriad others, promises and contracts establish relations among the persons who engage them. But in spite of the obviously communal character of promise and contract, the most prominent accounts of these practices remain firmly individualistic, seeking to explain the obligations they involve in terms of one or another service that these practices render to the several parties who engage them. Some theories emphasize that promissory and contractual obligations increase the freedom of <b>promisors,</b> by enabling them to project their intentions into the future and rendering plans of action that require such precommitments available to them. Other theories emphasize that promissory and contractual obligations reflect concern for the reasonable expectations of promisees and the harms that promisees suffer when these expectations are disappointed. And, most prominently, yet other theories emphasize that promissory and contractual obligations promote the well-being of both promisees and <b>promisors,</b> by increasing the reliability of social coordination and promoting the efficient allocation of resources. These theories differ from one another in many ways, to be sure, and they often cast themselves as competitors. But they are of a piece insofar as they all seek the roots of the morality of promise and contract in properties of the several individual participants in such agreements...|$|R

40|$|This chapter defends an {{instrumental}} justification of contract law. The {{reason to have}} contract law is to make possible socially beneficial transactions that otherwise would not occur.

The basic role of contract law is to support the practice of the making and keeping of promises and agreements, and encourage its use. This makes performance or something just as good the natural remedy.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{understand}} contractual rights through {{an examination of}} the possible ‘property’ content in contracts {{in the context of the}} inducement tort and conversion. It argues that, contrary to popular perception, contracts and property are different shades of a similar phenomenon. Not being a reified ‘thing’ with stable features and structure, property is a relative rather than an absolute concept. To determine whether the holder of an intangible resource ought to be conferred with ‘property’ or exclusive control of access to such resource, one has to evaluate the relevant practical, legal and moral considerations. Applied to the context of inducing breach of contract and conversion, this analysis demonstrates that a contractual right is in fact a composite collection of distinct interests and each tort may be protective of one or more of such interests. Thus, liability is imposed for inducing breach of contract because tort law recognizes the promisee’s exclusive right to the peremptory status of the <b>promisor’s</b> promise. On the other hand, the wrongfulness of converting a contract lies in the usurpation of a contracting party’s control, or the exclusive entitlement to decide whether and how to exercise her rights under the contract...|$|R
50|$|A problem arises with {{unilateral}} contracts {{because of}} the late formation of the contract. With classical unilateral contracts, a <b>promisor</b> can revoke his offer for the contract at any point prior to the promisee's complete performance. So, if a promisee provides 99% of the performance sought, the <b>promisor</b> could then revoke without any remedy for the promisee. The <b>promisor</b> has maximum protection and the promisee has maximum risk in this scenario.|$|E
50|$|Section 5 helps {{protect the}} <b>promisor</b> from double {{liability}} (having to pay {{two sets of}} damages for the same breach, one to the third party and one to the promisee) if the <b>promisor</b> breaches the contract. It does so in a very limited way, though - the <b>promisor</b> is only protected if he has first paid damages to the promisee, and the third party's claim comes after that. In addition the Act only limits damages paid in this situation, it does not eliminate them. If the promisee brings an action against the <b>promisor</b> and wins, any damages paid to the third party in a subsequent action must take the previous damages paid to the promisee into account.|$|E
50|$|The option {{contract}} provides {{an important role}} in unilateral contracts. In unilateral contracts, the <b>promisor</b> seeks acceptance by performance from the promisee. In this scenario, the classical contract view was that a contract is not formed until the performance that the <b>promisor</b> seeks is completely performed. This is because the consideration for the contract was the performance of the promisee. Once the promisee performed completely, consideration is satisfied and a contract is formed and only the <b>promisor</b> is bound to his promise.|$|E
40|$|The promise theory {{views the}} origin of {{contract}} {{in the making of}} a promise. This means that it views the creation of contracts as arising, in an important part, from the voluntary acts of <b>promisors</b> rather than from third parties like the State. In this regard, the theory facilitates the classical liberal value of freedom to contract. The promise theory also supports the notion that contracts should be interpreted according to the terms of the promise rather than by imposing terms on the parties. In this regard, the theory facilitates the classical liberal value of freedom from contract. These strengths of the promise theory are why the author credits Professor Farnsworth [...] one of the leading proponents of this theory of contract [...] with helping to keep contract alive. By promoting the promise theory so effectively, he has helped bolster both freedom from and freedom to contract.

40|$|This Article {{initially}} set out {{to consider}} how unanticipated causes of price rises, of which inflation is a paradigm example, affected the enforceability of sales contracts. In fact, these causes traditionally have {{had no effect on}} the enforceability of sales contracts; courts required defaulting <b>promisors</b> to pay damages. Recent commentators, however, have argued that to impose on sellers all costs attributable to unanticipated events is unacceptably harsh. They are supported in this view by a comment to the Uniform Commercial Code (Code), which suggests unforeseeable cost increases should excuse sellers. Moreover, a few cases decided under the Code have excused sellers when events unexpectedly made performance more costly. The question of the effect unanticipated events should have on the enforceability is also an important question because is inflation, and this country apparently has failed to achieve domestic price stability. Section I of this Article briefly describes the cases. Section II analyzes the themes that apparently underlie the commentators 2 ̆ 7 distaste for enforcement, and develops the only appealing case for excuse. Section III, however, shows that application of this case would require courts to make extraordinarily difficult factual inquiries and to engage in complex economic analysis. The confusions that inevitably arise when courts are required to do more than they can would here render judicial outcomes so uncertain as to impair contract stability. A concern to ensure contract stability, Section I concludes, thus explains and justifies the courts 2 ̆ 7 decision to enforce. Section IV then argues that that decision is also anti-inflationary. Finally, Section V shows that the Uniform Commercial Code permits enforcement...|$|R
40|$|Focusing on the {{interaction}} of law and emotions, this Article unfolds in three parts. Part I illuminates {{the connection between the}} affective background of donative promises and their modem unenforceability. It hypothesizes that rejecting promises that are not supported by consideration can be seen as an effort to distance law from any association with irrational decisionmaking and to disassociate it from 2 ̆ 2 emotional 2 ̆ 2 spheres. Part II seeks to correct the erroneous way affective giving has been perceived by law in the gifts context. The law must carefully analyze each relevant emotion concretely and separately, rather than treating emotion as an undifferentiated aggregate. This part is dedicated to an interdisciplinary investigation of the leading emotions that {{play a role in the}} context of gifts and altruistic behavior: empathy and gratitude. Part III integrates the knowledge gained in Part II with the normative question of the desirable rule for donative promises. It suggests that given the special function of empathy and gratitude in the gift setting, the main justifications for the enforcement of bargained-for promises support the enforcement of donative promises. Part III concludes with the suggestion that enforcement should not be dependent on the motives that led to promising and instead would depend on the intention of <b>promisors</b> to be legally bound by their promises. It is suggested that the freedom to make legally binding promises would be afforded to players in all spheres of life and less biased toward profit-seeking activities. The Article ends with a concrete suggestion to move from total refusal to enforce donative promises to a cautious willingness to enforce them 2 ̆ 2 consciously 2 ̆ 2 : only in cases of provable intention to create legally binding promises...|$|R
50|$|Section 3 {{covers the}} defences {{available}} to the <b>promisor</b> if the third party brings an action against him. In a dispute between the <b>promisor</b> and the third party over a term, the <b>promisor</b> can rely on any defence he would have if the dispute was with the promisee, {{as long as the}} defence is applicable to the term under dispute. The Law Commission directly rejected the suggestion that the <b>promisor</b> should have every defence in a dispute with a third party that he would have in a dispute with the promisee (regardless of whether or not it could be applied to the disputed term). Part III is directly modelled on the similar section of the New Zealand Contracts (Privity) Act 1982.|$|E
50|$|A {{creditor}} beneficiary can sue {{both the}} <b>promisor</b> and the promisee, but the beneficiary cannot recover against both. If {{the suit is}} successful against one party to the contract, the other party will be dismissed. Because the creditor beneficiary is receiving {{the performance of the}} <b>promisor</b> in order to fulfill the promisee's debt, the failure of the <b>promisor</b> to perform means that the beneficiary can still sue the promisee to recover the preexisting debt. The failure of performance simply means that the debt has never been paid.|$|E
50|$|An illusory promise, or {{one which}} the <b>promisor</b> {{actually}} has {{no obligation to}} keep, does not count as consideration. The promise must be real and unconditional. This doctrine rarely invalidates contracts; it is a fundamental doctrine in contract law that courts should try to enforce contracts whenever possible. Accordingly, courts will often read implied-in-fact or implied-in-law terms into the contract, placing duties on the <b>promisor.</b> For instance, if a <b>promisor</b> promises to give away {{a third of his}} earnings for the year and earns nothing, he has no actual obligation to do anything.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} one of {{the central}} problems of contract law, a puzzle that has troubled generations of contracts scholars: Why do we only enforce promises backed by consideration? Or, how can we justify insisting on the bargain context, but not requiring that the bargains be adequate? The lack of a theoretical solution to this puzzle has plagued the application of the consideration doctrine in courts of law. We resolve this paradox through two innovations. First, using a game theory model based on asymmetric information, we dispute the common wisdom that the law should honor parties’ intentions as articulated at the time of contract formation. We show how parties’ expressed intentions may not conform to their underlying desires. Crucially, the mere fact that parties take advantage of a legally binding option does not imply that they desire the existence of that option. When courts create an option for the legal enforcement of promises, parties can essentially be forced into exercising that option. How then can the law determine which promises to enforce? Our second innovation shows how social norms against commodification limit the availability of the consideration form. Where previous scholarship has assumed that anyone so wishing can invoke nominal consideration, we argue that anti-commodification norms make even nominal consideration unavailable within certain social contexts. Moreover, the contexts in which norms block the use of consideration are precisely the circumstances where creating a legally binding option would be most likely to harm both <b>promisors</b> and promisees. Ultimately, what matters is not whether the parties actually do offer consideration, but rather whether they can voice consideration. Only when norms allow the use of consideration should we conclude that parties truly desire the option to have their promises legally enforced...|$|R
50|$|The {{promisee}} {{can also}} sue the <b>promisor</b> {{for failing to}} pay the third party beneficiary. Under the common law, such suits were barred, but courts have since determined that the promisee can sue for specific performance of the contract, provided that the beneficiary has not already sued the <b>promisor.</b> Furthermore, if the promisee was in debt to a creditor beneficiary, {{and the failure of}} the <b>promisor</b> to perform caused the promisee to be held liable for that debt, the promisee can sue to recover the amount of the debt.|$|E
50|$|Where a {{contract}} {{for the benefit of}} a third party is breached by the non-performance of the <b>promisor,</b> the beneficiary can sue the <b>promisor</b> for the breach just as any party to {{a contract}} can sue the other. Because the rights of the third party are defined by the contract created between the <b>promisor</b> and the promisee, the <b>promisor</b> may assert against the beneficiary any defenses to the contract that could be asserted against the promisee. These include all of the traditional basis by which the formation of a contract may be challenged (e.g., lack of capacity, lack of consideration, the statute of frauds) and all of the traditional bases by which non-performance on the contract may be excused (e.g., failure of consideration, impossibility, illegality, frustration of purpose).|$|E
