5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a <b>porphyrin</b> ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the <b>porphyrin</b> ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E
5|$|The first {{structure}} of an organic compound, hexamethylenetetramine, was solved in 1923. This {{was followed by}} several studies of long-chain fatty acids, which are {{an important component of}} biological membranes. In the 1930s, the structures of much larger molecules with two-dimensional complexity began to be solved. A significant advance was the {{structure of}} phthalocyanine, a large planar molecule that is closely related to <b>porphyrin</b> molecules important in biology, such as heme, corrin and chlorophyll.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{typically}} use {{the color}} green as camouflage, blending {{in with the}} chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment. Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also {{be affected by the}} surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of <b>porphyrin</b> pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.|$|E

50|$|Extended <b>porphyrins,</b> or <b>porphyrins</b> with {{extended}} pi-system, form a {{class of}} <b>porphyrins</b> in which the pyrrole rings are fused with external aromatic fragments via the β-carbon atoms. The best known and most useful representatives of this class are the linearly annelated π-extended <b>porphyrins,</b> i.e. tetrabenzoporphyrins (TBP), tetranaphthoporphyrins (TNP), tetraanthraporphyrins (TAP), the optical and other properties of which are the subjects of materials research.|$|R
5|$|When {{deoxyhemoglobin}} {{picks up}} an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached {{to form a}} hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the <b>porphyrin</b> ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges {{that would lead to}} electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than myoglobin in the low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue, resulting in oxygen transfer. This is further enhanced by the concomitant Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), in which lowered pH (as occurs when carbon dioxide is released in the muscles) further lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.|$|E

Thus two series of carborane-carrying <b>porphyrins</b> were constructed, with additional functionality for attachment of uncharged potentially water-solubilising polyethers. 3 -(1, 2 -Dicarbaclosododecaboran(12) - 1 -ylmethoxy) benzaldehyde was prepared by protection of the aldehyde of 3 -(prop- 2 -ynyloxy) benzaldehyde as a dithioacetal, treatment with decaborane(14) and deprotection. Condensation with a 3 -nitrophenyldipyrromethane gave a separable mixture of meso-(3 -nitrophenyl) meso-(3 -carboranylmethoxyphenyl) <b>porphyrins,</b> resulting from extensive scrambling at the porphyrinogen stage. Similarly, condensation of 3 -(1, 2 -dicarbaclosododecaboran(12) -l-yl) benzaldehyde with this dipyrromethane gave an analogous mixture of meso-(3 -nitrophenyl) -meso-(3 -carboranylphenyl) <b>porphyrins.</b> In this second series, the two regioisomeric bis(nitrophenyl) bis(carboranylphenyl) <b>porphyrins</b> could only be distinguished by X-ray crystallography, their NMR spectra being identical.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was the syntheses and {{functionalization}} of meso -substituted <b>porphyrins.</b> A main focus was on <b>porphyrins</b> of the ABCD-type. The starting point was the syntheses of mono- meso -substituted <b>porphyrins.</b> The use of dipyrromethane, pyrrole- 2 -carbaldehyde, and various aldehydes realized a simple and straightforward method to synthesize mono- meso -substituted <b>porphyrins</b> in yields of 2 - 12 %. In many cases the 5, 15 -disubstituted <b>porphyrins</b> were observed as a second product. The introduction of aryl and alkyl substituents into the meso position was realized via subsequent aromatic nucleophilic substitution with organolithium compounds. With this method we succeeded {{in the preparation of}} several <b>porphyrins</b> of the 5, 10 -AB-, 5, 15 -AB-, ABC- and ABCD-type. Individual mono- and 5, 15 -disubstituted <b>porphyrins</b> were metalated to the appropriate metal complexes. The crystal structure allowed an X-ray analysis and thus a comparison of properties depending on the substituents and central ion. Another main focus was the syntheses of <b>porphyrins</b> of the 5, 10 -A 2 - 15, 20 -B 2 -type. Starting from <b>porphyrins</b> of the 5, 10 -A 2 -type the modification of the macrocycle using organolithium compounds was developed. The Heck reaction provided another possibility to introduce substituents into the meso position.

The results show hypochromicity along with a red shift in the Soret band of the <b>porphyrins,</b> This {{suggests}} that these <b>porphyrins</b> bind to BSA as monomers. Further analysis of these data supports the noninteractive binding of T 4 CPP and T 3 CPP with BSA and the cooperative binding of T 3, 4 BCPP with BSA. These binding data have been interpreted in terms of one specific binding site and several non-specific binding sites on BSA for the <b>porphyrins.</b> The absorption spectral changes of the <b>porphyrins</b> between 400 and 450 nm when titrated with BSA {{suggest that there is}} another specific binding site on BSA for the <b>porphyrins,</b> These two specific binding sites have also been supported by circular dichroism (CD) studies. The absorption spectral and CD studies on the interactions of the <b>porphyrins</b> with BSA further suggest that these interactions are dependent on the number and configuration of substituents in the phenyl groups of the <b>porphyrins.</b> The contact energy transfer from the aromatic amino acid residues tryptophan and tyrosine of BSA to the <b>porphyrins</b> in the BSA-porphyrin complexes has also been studied using fluorescence spectroscopy. These energy transfer data show the energy transfer from tryptophan to the <b>porphyrins</b> for their binding to site I of BSA and from tyrosine to the <b>porphyrins</b> for their binding to site II of BSA, Unfolding studies of the BSA-porphyrin systems indicate that the tertiary structure is essential for the binding of the <b>porphyrins.</b> A correlation between the accumulation of Tc- 99 m-labelled T 4 CPP and T 3, 4 BCPP in tumour tissue and their binding at site II of BSA is possible.
