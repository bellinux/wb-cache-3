Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness.

40|$|Background: Mental {{health is}} one of the most {{important}} dimensions of life and its quality. Minor <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>Disorder</b> as a type of mental health problem is prevalent among health workers. Nursing is considered to be one of the most stressful occupations. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of minor <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> and its associated factors among nurses in southern Iran. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 771 nurses working in 20 cities of Bushehr and Fars provinces in southern Iran. Participants were recruited through multi-stage sampling during 2014. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) was used for screening of minor <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> in nurses. Latent Class Regression was used to analyze the data. Results: The prevalence of minor <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> among nurses was estimated to be 27. 5 %. Gender and sleep disorders were significant factors in determining the level of minor <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> (P Values of 0. 04 and < 0. 001, respectively).

40|$|Background. Fatigue and {{psychiatric}} symptoms {{are common in}} the community, but their association and outcome are sparsely studied. Method. A total of 1177 patients were recruited from UK primary care on attending their general practitioner. Fatigue and <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> was measured at three time points with the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire and the 11 -item Fatigue Questionnaire. Results. Total scores for fatigue and <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> did not differ between the three time points and were closely correlated (r around 0. 6). The association between non-co-morbid ('pure') fatigue and developing <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> 6 months later {{was the same as}} that for being well and subsequent <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder.</b> Similarly, having non-co-morbid <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> did not predict having fatigue any more than being well 6 months previously. Between 13 and 15 % suffered from non-co-morbid fatigue at each time point and 2. 5 % suffered from fatigue at two time points 6 months apart. Less than 1 % of patients suffered from non-co-morbid fatigue at all three time points. Conclusions. The data are consistent with the existence of 'pure' independent fatigue state. However, this state is unstable and the majority (about three-quarters) of patients become well or a case of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> over 6 months. A persistent, independent fatigue state lasting for 6 months can be identified in the primary-care setting, but it is uncommon - of the order of 2. 5 %.

40|$|Study Objectives: This study {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} sleep disturbance in the period immediately prior to a traumatic event predicted development of subsequent <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder.</b> Design: Prospective design cohort study Setting: Four major trauma hospitals across Australia Patients: A total of 1033 traumatically injured patients were initially assessed during hospital admission and followed up at 3 months (898) after injury Measures: Lifetime <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> was assessed in hospital with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Sleep disturbance in the 2 weeks prior to injury was also assessed using the Sleep Impairment Index. The prevalence of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> was assessed 3 months after traumatic injury. Results: There were 255 (28 %) patients with a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> at 3 months. Patients who displayed sleep disturbance prior to the injury were more likely to develop a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> at 3 months (odds ratio: 2. 44, 95 % CI: 1. 62 – 3. 69). In terms of patients who had never experienced a prior disorder (n = 324), 96 patients (30 %) had a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> at 3 months, and these patients were more likely to develop disorder if they displayed prior sleep disturbance (odds ratio: 3. 16, 95 % CI: 1. 59 – 4. 75).

Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality.

The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization.

5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{explored}} how adult {{social class}} and social mobility between parental and own adult social class {{is related to}} <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder.</b> Material and Methods: In this prospective cohort study, over 1 million employed Swedes born in 1949 - 1959 were included. Information on parental class (1960) and own mid-life social class (1980 and 1990) was retrieved from the censuses and categorised as High Non-manual, Low Non-manual, High Manual, Low Manual and Self-employed. After identifying adult class, individuals were followed for <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> by first admission of schizophrenia, alcoholism and drug dependency, affective psychosis and neurosis or personality disorder (N= 24 659) from the Swedish Patient Register. We used Poisson regression analysis to estimate first admission rates of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> per 100 000 person-years and relative risks (RR) by adult social class (treated as a time-varying covariate). The RRs of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> among the Non-manual and Manual classes were also estimated by magnitude of social mobility.

40|$|Background: Few {{studies of}} the {{association}} between <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> and premature death have adjusted for key confounders and used structured psychiatric interviews. We aimed to investigate if <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> {{was associated with a}} higher risk of mortality and whether any excess mortality was due to suicide, or explained by other health or socioeconomic risk factors. Methods: We used data from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, a nationally representative UK birth cohort. 3283 men and women completed the Present State Examination at age 36. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality before age 60. Results: Those with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> at age 36 had a higher risk of death even after adjusting for potential confounders (Hazard ratio = 1. 84, 95 % C. I. 1. 22 - 2. 78).

Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions).

5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E

RESULTS The findings show that 26. 8 % of the health service workers reported significant levels of minor <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder,</b> compared with 17. 8 % of people in the general population. Psychiatric morbidity was highest among managers, doctors, nurses and professions allied to medicine, with each of these groups recording higher rates than their professional counterparts outside the health service.
