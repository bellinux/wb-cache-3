The field of the instrument is energized by the circuit current flow. The two moving coils, A and B, are connected in parallel with the circuit load.

At unity power factor, the current in A is in phase with the circuit current, and coil A provides maximum torque, driving the instrument pointer toward the 1.0 mark on the scale. At zero power factor, the current in coil B is in phase with circuit current, and coil B provides torque to drive the pointer towards 0. At intermediate values of power factor, the torques provided by the two coils add and the pointer takes up intermediate positions.|$|E

In the modern life, an easy-captured data yet cost effective power factor measurement device is vital in the electrical power engineering studies. The unstable reading of the analogue based <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> <b>meter</b> especially in the disturbance situations emerged the development of digital based <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> <b>meter</b> (PFM) to replace the conventional electro-dynamic types. The major advantage of using the digital based PFM is the data read by the meter can be stored easily for other applications or studies. This paper presents the development of a cost effective digital PFM which is based on an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) provided with ratiometric facilities. Generally, the digital <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> <b>meter</b> consists of four main parts which are power supply, inputs circuit, signal processing, and the display part. A signal proportional to the peak voltage (Vm) is applied to the reference input voltage of the ADC, while another signal proportional to the product of the peak voltage (Vm) and power factor is applied to the analogue input. Both signals are processed through various operational amplifier based circuits such as averager, zero detector, and differentiator. The developed digital PFM has been tested and performed for single phase laboratory measurements with three decimal digits display on a liquid crystal display (LCD) unit. The results achieved validate the functionality of the developed digital PFM...|$|E
