2500|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that at the beginning of the Spanish conquest, the inhabitants of the Island numbered 50,000. But it was observed that this number was immediately reduced to half upon the coming of the Spaniards. Although the phenomenon was attributed to terrible famine, nothing was said about islanders dying in great number. The coincidence of this <b>phenomen</b> with another observation about the existence of the mundos, a third race in Panay (aside from the Visayans, and the Agtas or negritos) supports the fact regarding the massive evacuation of the Visayans of Panay to the hinterlands. Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, historian during the later part of the 20th century colonial Philippines, described the mundos as Visayans, who committed crimes and went to the mountains for fear of punishment or of being reduced to cruel slavery. It was noted that these mundos would descend and attack the towns of the valleys. This colonial historian's description of the local inhabitants contradicts the initial observation of the first Spanish conquerors regarding the Visayans of Panay as [...] "peaceful people, open to conversion". The fact that a large number of them (forming another race) would go to the mountain because of [...] "crimes committed" [...] and, later, would attack the valleys leads to a plausible explanation that a considerable portion of the citizens of the Confederation, who would not give up their independence and culture, chose to preserve what they had in the mountains of Panay, and would, for some time, fight to regain their homeland.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} key threads {{followed}} there are clearly two which attract most attention: Carlist position towards the Francoist regime and internal conflicts within Carlism, sometimes both merged {{as having been}} closely interrelated. Most of the works quoted earlier deal with these topics one way or another. All scholars - also those writing from Traditionalist and Progressist perspective - advance the thesis of intrinsic hostility between Carlism and Francoism, {{but there is no}} major scholarly work which systematically and comprehensively captures the problem of mutual relations between the two. The work approaching the topic is a collection of 3 essays by Martorell and Miralles (2009) and a brief study of Calero Delso (2003). In case of internal conflict it is quite the opposite: there are many works dedicated almost entirely to the problem, but they offer competitive visions emphasizing either change or continuity. The first one is championed by already noted book of Caspistegui; apart from minor works listed earlier, it is presented also in some sketchy overviews. Blinkhorn (1991), Vázquez de Prada, Caspistegui (1991 and 1995) and MacClancy (1998), tend to view the change sympathetically, while Bartyzel (2011) builds a case-study, striving to present a unique European <b>phenomen</b> of a large and historically grounded political movement turned into its own ruinous negation. The key work adhering to the continuity reading is already noted PhD thesis of Martorell and the booklet of Pérez-Nievas. Countless and highly repetitive books of Clemente, dealing with the history of Carlism in general, advance the same theory, also from the Progressist perspective (1995, 1999, 2006, 2011, 2013). There is historiographical work which adheres to the continuity theory from the Traditionalist perspective, though the book of Gambra (1976) seems to fall rather into philosophy.|$|E
