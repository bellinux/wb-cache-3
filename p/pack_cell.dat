5000|$|The {{prototype}} Solution F/Chretien Helicopter is a coaxial rotor [...] "hang" [...] helicopter [...] Pitch {{and roll}} {{are controlled by}} weight shift. The entire rotor is tilted {{in relation to the}} suspended airframe to shift the center of gravity, thus no cyclic control is required. These features were generally implemented on the demonstrator for simplicity and expedience and were incidental to the research and demonstration goals. Yaw is controlled by differential torque applied to the two rotors. The two rotors are each driven by a separate 20 KW electric motor. Power is supplied by twenty one, 106 AH Li-ion Polymer cells with a power density of 160 WH/Kg. The unique cooling solution developed for the pack allows 500 Amps to be delivered for 10 minutes, while keeping the battery pack’s frame and cooling system down to less than 5% of the <b>pack</b> <b>cell</b> weight.|$|E

The structure is {{formed by the}} tendency of Cu(I) to form two collinear sp bonds to oxygen atoms which result in short O - Cu - O groups with the O - Cu bond length being approximately 196vpm. Due to the bonding properties of the Cu(I) metal the structure is built of layers of composition Cu2SO4. Due {{to the loss of}} only one electron and the bonding properties of copper(I) the structure is built up from four oxygen atoms of each sulfate group bonding to four other sulfate groups of the same layer via symmetrical O - Cu - 0 bridging. The layer structure of Cu2SO4 is built {{as a consequence of the}} formation of unsymmetrical O - H - O hydrogen bridges. Due to its unstable nature it is difficult to obtain an accurate 3D structure, but was first successfully done in 1987 by Berthold, Born, and Wartchow.|$|E

Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) {{was used to}} investigate trace element patterns in serum, <b>packed</b> <b>cells,</b> and dialysate of CAPD patients. The concentrations of the elements Cs, Cu, Fe, and Mn in serum and <b>packed</b> <b>cells</b> appeared to be maintained within the normal range, while the levels of the non-essential element Br in both serum and <b>packed</b> <b>cells</b> were subnormal. The serum Cr values were extremely high (20 to 50 {{times higher than the}} normal serum level). The amount of Cr absorbed from the dialysate was calculated to be ten times higher than the daily dietary uptake. The Co concentrations were normal in <b>packed</b> <b>cells</b> but were significantly increased in serum. The Rb content in <b>packed</b> <b>cells</b> was slightly lower than normal, while the serum value was normal. Se was maintained within the normal range in <b>packed</b> <b>cells,</b> but the serum concentration was slightly lower than normal. The concentrations of Zn were low in serum and appeared to be higher than normal in <b>packed</b> <b>cells.</b> In conclusion, this analysis of the trace element status of CAPD patients reveals two major abnormalities. There is an apparent loss of Br from the blood towards the dialysate and on the other hand, a dramatic accumulation of Cr into the blood {{as a result of the}} very high Cr content in the dialysate...|$|R

40|$|This paper summarises {{the studies}} of dynamic {{behaviour}} and energy absorption performance of the following regularly <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> systems under axial (in 1 D cases) or in-plane (in 2 D cases) impact loading: 1 D and 2 D ring systems, a chain of type II cells, and a 2 D honeycomb block. Under impact loading, these <b>packed</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit complicated dynamic behaviour, such as localisation and propagation of the deformation, the dependence of deformation mode on the impact velocity, significant effect of lateral inertia displayed by type II cells, and so on. It is revealed that the early response of these <b>packed</b> <b>cells</b> {{is dominated by the}} collision between the striker and the impinged end of the <b>packed</b> <b>cells.</b> Since the dynamic deformation mode of these regularly <b>packed</b> <b>cells</b> is notably affected by the impact velocity, while different deformation modes often lead to different energy absorption capacity and failure mechanisms, particular attention is paid to the determination of mode transition velocities...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study that was carried out on patients that underwent CABG in Shiraz Namazi hospital in 2004. The sample size was 480 and we did systematic random sampling, and a questionnaire contained factors that effect on blood need was filling out. Independent t-test, multivariate logistic regression and Poason correlation were used for data analysis. Results: The average age of patients was 59. 15 ± 10. 6 years, 69. 2 % were male and the mean Hct before surgery was 39. 86 ± 6. 38 % and after operation was 32. 68 ± 5. 84 % and the duration of surgery was 2 hours and 48 minutes. The average of <b>pack</b> <b>cell</b> was 5. 76 ± 1. 52 unit and average of FFP was 2. 82 ± 7. 72 unit.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found that there is a {{correlation}} between mothers' haemoglobin concentration or <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> volume and infants' birth weight, and that iron supplementation increases mothers' haemoglobin concentration. The purpose of this study, using the data of a large randomised trial on iron prophylaxis during pregnancy, was to find out whether iron supplementation causes fetal growth to deteriorate. At their first antenatal visit, 2912 pregnant women were randomised into non-routine iron and routine iron supplementation. The mean length of gestation was shorter in the non-routine group. Birth weight did not differ between the groups, but due to longer gestations boys in the group receiving routine iron were taller than in the non-routine group. In both groups, whether studied by various values of <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> volume or correlation coefficients, the lower the <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> volume, the heavier and taller the infant and heavier the placenta. These negative correlations could be seen even with a <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> volume measured early in pregnancy. Standardising for blood pressure did not influence the correlation coefficients.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate pack cells and the factors affecting on the amount of their hematocrit and their association with increase in hematocrit after blood injection. Methods: This is descriptive-analytical study. Characteristics including age, size, type of anticoagulant hemoglobin and hematocrit were recorded and one CBC was taken before injection and as well, one and twenty four hours after injection to assessment hemoglobin and hematocrit. The data were analyzed by SPSS. Results: The bag containing the anticoagulant substance CPDA- 1 has more hematocrit than bags containing anticoagulant CPD + SAGM. Bags of low leukocytes have more hematocrit than bags of conventional type (P> 0. 05). With increase in <b>pack</b> <b>cell</b> volume, hematocrit will be decreased (P< 0. 001). Besides, the amount of hematocrit is more 24 hours after the injection than one hour later (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the rate and causes of wastage of blood and blood products (packed red cells, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate) in Qazvin hospitals. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in all hospitals in Qazvin, including 5 teaching hospitals, 2 social welfare hospitals, 3 private hospitals, 1 charity hospital, and 1 military hospital. This descriptive study was based on available data from hospital blood banks in the province of Qazvin. The research instrument was a 2 -part questionnaire. The first part was related to demographic characteristics of hospitals and the second part elicited information about blood and blood component wastage. The collected data were then analyzed using descriptive statistic methods and SPSS 11. 5. Results: Blood wastage may occur for a number of reasons, including time expiry, wasted imports, blood medically or surgically ordered but not used, stock time expired, hemolysis, or miscellaneous reasons. Data indicated that approximately 77. 9 % of wasted <b>pack</b> <b>cell</b> units were wasted for the reason of time expiry. <b>Pack</b> <b>cell</b> wastage in hospitals is reported to range from 1. 93 % to 30. 7 %.

40|$|Abstract: Non-uniformity of Lithium-ion {{cells in}} {{a battery pack}} is {{inevitable}} and has become the bottleneck to the pack capacity, especially in the fast charging process. Therefore, a balancing approach is essentially required. This paper proposes an active online cell balancing approach in a fast charging process using the state of charge (SOC) as balancing criterion. The goal {{of this approach is}} to complete pack balancing within the limited charging time. An adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) is applied to estimate the <b>pack</b> <b>cell</b> SOC during the charging process to obtain accurate results under modeling errors and measurement noises. To implement the proposed AEKF, only one additional current sensor is required to obtain the current of each cell required for the SOC estimation. An experimental platform is established to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed balancing approach with the SOC as a balancing criterion can overcome the challenges of non-uniformity and flat voltage plateau and charge more capacity into a LiFePO 4 battery pack than those with the terminal voltage as a balancing criterion in the fast charging process...|$|E
