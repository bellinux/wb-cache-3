25|$|In {{response}} to aforementioned shortcoming in the tsunami warning system, JMA have started investigation in year 2011 and updated their system in 2013. In the updated system, for powerful earthquake with possibility {{to cause the}} JMA magnitude scale to saturate, no quantitative prediction will be released in the initial warning, and instead there will be words that describe the situation's emergency. It have been planned to install new teleseismometers with ability to measure larger earthquake to prevent the inability to calculate moment magnitude scale in timely manner. A simpler empirical method to integrate data from GPS tidal meter as well as undersea water <b>pressure</b> <b>meter</b> into tsunami warning have been deployed, {{and there are also}} plan to install more of these meters and develop further technology to utilize data observed from them. To prevent under-reporting tsunami height, early quantitative observation data that are smaller than expected amplitude will be overridden and public will instead get told the situation is under observation.An additional report on possibility of tsunami about 90 seconds after earthquakes will also be included into observation report in order to warn people before JMA magnitude can be calculated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Automatic {{measurement}} of arterial {{blood pressure is}} important, but the available commercial automatic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>meters,</b> mostly based on oscillometry, are of low accuracy. Methods In this study, we present a cuff-based technique for automatic {{measurement of}} systolic blood pressure, based on photoplethysmographic signals measured simultaneously in fingers of both hands. After inflating the pressure cuff to a level above systolic blood pressure in a relatively slow rate, it is slowly deflated. The cuff pressure for which the photoplethysmographic signal reappeared during the deflation of the pressure-cuff was taken as the systolic blood pressure. The algorithm {{for the detection of}} the photoplethysmographic signal involves: (1) determination of the time-segments in which the photoplethysmographic signal distal to the cuff is expected to appear, utilizing the photoplethysmographic signal in the free hand, and (2) discrimination between random fluctuations and photoplethysmographic pattern. The detected pulses in the time-segments were identified as photoplethysmographic pulses if they met two criteria, based on the pulse waveform and on the correlation between the signal in each segment and the signal in the two neighboring segments. Results Comparison of the photoplethysmographic-based automatic technique to sphygmomanometry, the reference standard, shows that the standard deviation of their differences was 3. 7 mmHg. For subjects with systolic blood pressure above 130 mmHg the standard deviation was even lower, 2. 9 mmHg. These values are much lower than the 8 mmHg value imposed by AAMI standard for automatic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>meters.</b> Conclusion The photoplethysmographic-based technique for automatic measurement of systolic blood pressure, and the algorithm which was presented in this study, seems to be accurate. </p...|$|R

40|$|Blood {{pressure}} is vital sign information that physicians often need as preliminary data for immediate intervention during emergency situations or for regular monitoring {{of people with}} cardiovascular diseases. Despite the availability of portable blood <b>pressure</b> <b>meters</b> in the market, they are not regularly carried by people, creating a need for an ultra-portable measurement platform or device {{that can be easily}} carried and used at all times. One such device is the smartphone which, according to comScore survey is used by 26. 2 % of the US adult population. the mass production of these phones with built-in sensors and high computation power has created numerous possibilities for application development in different domains including biomedical. Motivated by this capability and their extensive usage, this thesis focuses on developing a blood pressure measurement platform on smartphones. Specifically, I developed a blood pressure measurement system on a smart phone using the built-in camera and a customized external microphone. the system consists of first obtaining heart beats using the microphone and finger pulse with the camera, and finally calculating the blood pressure using the recorded data. I developed techniques for finding the best location for obtaining the data, making the system usable by all categories of people. the proposed system resulted in accuracies between 90 - 100 %, when compared to traditional blood <b>pressure</b> <b>meters.</b> the second part of this thesis presents a new system for remote heart beat monitoring using the smart phone. with the proposed system, heart beats can be transferred live by patients and monitored by physicians remotely for diagnosis. the proposed blood pressure measurement and remote monitoring systems will be able to facilitate information acquisition and decision making by the 9 - 1 - 1 operators...|$|R

The only accurate, precise and patient specific calibration free non-invasive absolute ICP value measurement method relies not on the correlation but on direct ICP and extracranial pressure comparison principle. [...] Innovative method using Two-Depth Transorbital Doppler (TDTD) of intracranial pressure quantitative absolute (ICP) value measurement relies on the same fundamental principle as used to measure blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer. A sphygmomanometer works using a pressure balance principle - an air-filled pressure cuff wrapped around the arm compresses the brachial artery {{to a point where}} blood can no longer flow. Externally applied pressure is equal to systolic blood pressure in this case. The examiner slowly releases the air from the cuff and uses a stethoscope to listen for the return of blood flow. At the pressure balance point, where pressure in the cuff equals systolic artery pressure, a ‘whooshing’ noise can be heard as blood flows through the artery again. Pressure balance based non-invasive blood <b>pressure</b> <b>meter</b> does not need a patient specific calibration.|$|E
