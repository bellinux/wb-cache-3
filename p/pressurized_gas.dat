25|$|Pyrophoric flares {{work on the}} {{principle}} of ejecting a special pyrophoric material out of an airtight cartridge, usually using a gas generator, e.g. a small pyrotechnic charge or <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas.</b> The material then self-ignites in contact with air. The materials can be solid, e.g. iron platelets coated with ultrafine aluminium, or liquid, often organometallic compounds; e.g. alkyl aluminium compounds, e.g. triethylaluminium. Pyrophoric flares may have reduced effectiveness at high altitudes, due to lower air temperature and lower availability of oxygen; however oxygen can be co-ejected with the pyrophoric fuel.|$|E

25|$|Chemical rockets are {{the most}} common type of high power rocket, {{typically}} creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an oxidizer.

Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.|$|E

The SRM configuration selected is inspired to the P 105, VECEP first stage, designed as a stretched version of the P 80 SRM, with an aft-finocyl configuration and the same igniter and nozzle configuration of the P 80.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{as workers}} {{struggled}} to supply {{power to the}} reactors' coolant systems and restore power to their control rooms, a number of hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred, the first in Unit 1, on 12 March and the last in Unit 4, on 15 March. It is estimated that the hot zirconium fuel cladding-water reaction in Reactors 1–3 produced 800 to 1000 kilograms of hydrogen gas each. The <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas</b> was vented out of the reactor pressure vessel where it mixed with the ambient air, and eventually reached explosive concentration limits in Units 1 and 3. Due to piping connections between Units 3 and 4, or alternatively from the same reaction occurring in the spent fuel pool in Unit 4 itself, Unit 4 also filled with hydrogen, resulting in an explosion. In each case, the hydrogen-air explosions occurred {{at the top of}} each unit, that was in their upper secondary containment buildings.

25|$|In 1928, DuGas (later {{bought by}} ANSUL) {{came out with}} a cartridge-operated dry {{chemical}} extinguisher, which used sodium bicarbonate specially treated with chemicals to render it free-flowing and moisture-resistant. It consisted of a copper cylinder with an internal CO2cartridge. The operator turned a wheel valve on top to puncture the cartridge and squeezed a lever on the valve {{at the end of the}} hose to discharge the chemical. This was the first agent available for large-scale three-dimensional liquid and <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas</b> fires, and was but remained largely a specialty type until the 1950s, when small dry chemical units were marketed for home use. ABC dry chemical came over from Europe in the 1950s, with Super-K being invented in the early 60s and Purple-K being developed by the US Navy in the late 1960s. Manually applied dry agents such as graphite for class D (metal) fires had existed since WWII, but it wasn't until 1949 that Ansul introduced a pressurized extinguisher using an external CO2 cartridge to discharge the agent. Met-L-X (sodium chloride) was the first extinguisher developed in the US, with graphite, copper, and several other types being developed later.|$|E

Clem has a small one-person boat ready to sail, but needs Torque's help fighting creatures emerging from a wrecked slave ship before he can leave. Torque sets fire to the wreck, enabling Clem to escape. He enters Abbot's sewer system where he encounters Horace, who tells him Abbot wants his soul. He then heads to the electric chair, destroying it and releasing Horace's spirit. Returning to death row, he finds Killjoy's diagnosis, and then returns to the radio room. Successfully sending a signal, he learns a Coast Guard vessel is on the way. However, Carnate's lighthouse is not working, and must be reactivated before the vessel can approach the island. Torque heads to the lighthouse, passing through the old military barracks, Fort Maleson. In the fort, he encounters Hermes, who forces him to fight. Torque defeats him by using <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas</b> to push Hermes into a furnace. He continues to the lighthouse, outside of which he meets Ernesto Alverez, who is trying to find his family.

500|$|A {{tracheal}} tube is a catheter that is {{inserted into the}} trachea for {{the primary purpose of}} establishing and maintaining a patent (open and unobstructed) airway. Tracheal tubes are frequently used for airway management in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine. Many different types of {{tracheal tube}}s are available, suited for different specific applications. An endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). It is a breathing conduit designed to be placed into the airway of critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical positive pressure ventilation of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction. The endotracheal tube has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas</b> such as oxygen. At the other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into the lungs and may also include a balloon (referred to as a cuff). The tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned above the carina (before the trachea divides to each lung) and sealed within the trachea so that the lungs can be ventilated equally. A tracheostomy tube is another type of tracheal tube; this [...] curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a tracheostomy stoma or a cricothyrotomy incision.|$|E

2500|$|The {{technology}} for pre-combustion is widely applied in fertilizer, chemical, gaseous fuel (H2, CH4), and power production.

The resulting [...] can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. The H2 can now be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture. The [...] is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants, or to existing plants where re-powering is an option.

2500|$|Many <b>pressurized</b> <b>gases</b> are {{actually}} supercritical fluids. For example, nitrogen has {{a critical point}} of 126.2K (−147°C) and 3.4 MPa [...] (34 bar).

At room temperature, they are well above their critical temperature, and therefore behave as a gas, similar to CO2 at 400K above. However, they cannot be liquified by pressure unless cooled below their critical temperature.|$|R
