50|$|Halsted was {{credited}} with starting the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States at Johns Hopkins. The program began with an internship of undefined length (individuals advanced once Halsted believed they were {{ready for the next}} level of training), followed by six years as an assistant resident, and then two years as house surgeon. Halsted trained many of the prominent academic surgeons of the time, including Harvey Williams Cushing and Walter Dandy, founders of the surgical subspecialty of neurosurgery; and Hugh H. Young, a founder of the specialty of urology.He is also known for many other medical and surgical achievements.

50|$|Adaptive {{collaborative}} {{control is}} most accurately modeled as a {{closed loop feedback}} control system. Closed loop feedback control describes the event where the outputs of a system from an input are used to influence the present or future behavior of the system. The feedback control model is governed {{by a set of}} equations that are used to predict the future state of the simuland and regulate its behavior. These equations - in conjunction with <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> theory - are used to evolve physical operations of the simuland to include, but not limited to: dialogue, path planning, motion, monitoring, and lifting objects over time. Many times, these equations are modeled as nonlinear partial differential equations over a continuous time domain. Due to their complexity, powerful computers are necessary to implement these models. A consequence of using computers to simulate these models is that continuous systems cannot be fully calculated. Instead, numerical solutions, such as the Runge-Kutta methods, are utilized to approximate these continuous models. These equations are initialized from the response of one or more sources and rates of changes and outputs are calculated. These rates of changes predict the states of the simuland a short time in the future. The time increment for this prediction is called a time step. These new states are applied to the model to determine the new rates of changes and observational data. This behavior is continued until the desired number of iterations is completed. In the event a future state violates or comes within a tolerance of the violation the simuland will confer with its human counterpart seeking advice on how to proceed from that point. The outputs, or observational data, are used by the human operators to determine what they believe is the best course of action for the simuland. Their commands are fed with the input into the control system and assessed regarding its effectiveness in resolving the issues. If the human commands are determined to be valuable, the simuland will adjust its control input to what the human suggested. If the human’s commands are determined to be unbeneficial, malicious, or non-existent, the model will seek its own correction approach.|$|E
