40|$|<b>Print</b> <b>newspapers</b> in South Africa are {{the oldest}} formal mode {{of news and}} {{information}} dissemination but which has come under tremendous pressure with the advent and spread of technological innovation involving information communication infrastructure and processes, but specifically the internet. The main challenge facing <b>print</b> <b>newspapers</b> in terms of circulation growth of print and advertising revenue is speed to market. The internet has not only provided {{a new avenue for}} news and information dissemination but has the distinct advantage of tremendous speed to deliver news and information to readers. Meanwhile, <b>print</b> <b>newspapers</b> whose production is still almost entirely dependent on traditional structures, processes and physical mode of delivery are battling to stay afloat as the chase for readers' attention is gaining more ground on digital platforms. This new competition landscape has now cast focus fully on traditional print media‟s production processes competency levels as well as their suitability for the nature of competition posed by digital news platforms. The processes involved in the production of a <b>print</b> <b>newspaper</b> can be described as hybrid (Davis and Heineke. 2005 : 220) in that they involve different types of processes at different stages to produce the final product. The focus of this study at Avusa Media (Port Elizabeth) was on the post production processes involving the printing and distribution of <b>printed</b> <b>newspapers</b> with the objective of gaining an understanding of the extent and impact of the information technology advancement in the post production phase of <b>printed</b> <b>newspapers.</b> v In pursuing the goal, the case study research followed a phenomenological paradigm involving exploratory and descriptive research processes as described by Yin (1994) in Collis and Hussey (2003 : 69) and Clifford Geertz (1973) in Babbie and Mouton (2005 : 272) The research found that the traditional business structure for <b>printed</b> <b>newspapers</b> is increasingly becoming unviable due to poverty of technological innovation in critical parts of the production value chain; namely post production processes that encompass printing and distribution of <b>printed</b> <b>newspapers.</b> The research established and revealed that while there are some technological innovations and advances in the <b>print</b> <b>newspaper</b> publishing industry value chain worldwide, they are not only severely limited and disjointed but are also seemingly moving apart rather than towards consolidation in terms of the speed to market need faced by <b>print</b> <b>newspaper</b> publisher...|$|R
