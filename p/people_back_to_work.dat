40|$|Incentives-based {{social policy}} offers one {{particular}} thing : financial rewards for specific behavior. The goal seems plain and simple: reducing poverty by making financially attractive some “choices” that poor {{people would not}} have made otherwise. That could be taking their kid to the doctor, accepting a job or working more hours, or for their children having a good grade, getting a library card or graduating from college. That's for the U. S. version of what is called “conditional cash transfer”, or CCT. The New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, launched the very first merican CCT in 2007 as a mean to “incentivize” poorest New Yorkers to “do the right thing”. In France, poor households are also “incentivized” <b>to</b> <b>work</b> rather than <b>to</b> “rely on” welfare. During the last presidential campaign, the conservative candidate Nicolas Sarkozy urged French poor households to “work more to earn more”.

Conditional cash transfers are claimed to be an “investment in human capital”. How new are they? Both happened in a crisis context, but also both were prepared in an election context.

Projects have been set up to lead unemployed, often deprived young <b>people</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> school or <b>work.</b> However, not all of these youths want to participate in the projects and some leave early. Is this is a problem? Are these young people capable of finding employment by themselves or do their problems increase without the support of these projects? To answer these questions we studied deprived unemployed youths who belonged to the target group of an unemployment project (Route 23). The results of the research show that most of the former dropouts can look after themselves well. Many are working or are back at school, and they have fewer problems than they had before. Participants who left the project early are slightly less well off than the others. We advise monitoring all persons in the target group who fail to enter the project or leave early, and give them the opportunity to re-enter the project or ask for support. This is how the project can provide an additional safety net for these groups...|$|R

40|$|This project {{comes from}} the passion of urban life, the desire <b>to</b> do {{meaningful}} <b>work</b> for Muncie, Indiana, and eagerness to create better communities. Muncie, Indiana {{is a good place}} to live, full of history, contradictions and potential. Here, groups in different areas are dedicating both money and time to build a thriving and sustainable downtown. However, the central city, especially downtown, is losing its population and vibrancy, like many other small and medium sized American cities. Even worse, the connections of downtown Muncie with Ball State University have historically not been strong. Students do not typically go downtown. However, connecting BSU with downtown physically and socially could be means to activate Downtown’s vibrancy. Based on U. S. Census data, Muncie still has significant population. More positive are the signs of population restoration. Both the enrollment expansion of Ball State University and the increasing elder population contribute to the population increases. With people returning to the city, opportunities exist <b>to</b> bring <b>people</b> <b>back</b> downtown <b>to</b> live, <b>work,</b> and play. There are arguable significant to attract people as an increased presence downtown. Instead of attracting them from elsewhere, it is more reasonable to revitalize downtown by increasing in numbers of those making their homes downtown. Functional and physical improvements are needed to enhance living conditions and community pride. This creative project begins with literature review and case studies to explore strategies of small-city downtown revitalization. And then, the project exams existing development assets in downtown Muncie and local history when downtown was an active commercial and cultural center for the area. Since students and elders are major segments population of Muncie, the project focuses on providing comfortable living conditions to attract these two groups back downtown. It also proposes a city framework with exemplary complete street sections, and building facades; a district master plan with housing typologies, landscape systems, and a pedestrian network between campus and city; and student and elder housing detail design demonstrations.

40|$|Today's {{society is}} forcing a reevaluation {{of the role}} of our urban areas and the design {{profession}} is one of many fields which is being called upon to assist in the definition of the future of them. While many communities have been successful in creating unique individual elements within their urban areas, the difficulty has been maintaining the vitality and energy necessary downtown to support them. In addition to this, urban downtowns suffer from a lack of collective vision which can serve as both unifying and promotional impetus for attracting people <b>to</b> live, shop, <b>work,</b> and recreate downtown. We are all aware of the problems that the increased mobility that the automobile has created, parking, traffic, etc.; however, as natural resources become scarce {{it is clear that the}} downtown once again holds the potential for future social interaction. A successful downtown or urban area is the result of a collective spirit in which their are many individual contributors. Not only can individual buildings and spaces be created, but entire cities and urban areas as well. It is true that much of what a city has to offer has evolved over time and cannot simply be "placed" into an urban area with hope that it will attach itself and work. Too often in the recent past, cities have looked for the universal solution to their economic woes by taking a concept from a neighboring community, specifically, a hotel - convention center complex, an enclosed urban mall, a closed pedestrian mall, to name only a few. What this practice has failed to recognize and utilize are the unique features that already exist within that community in order that a personal solution be made for that particular community, not an inappropriate, applied solution. Now that the background has been established it is possible to explore the specific objective of my thesis research which will be a synthesis of many issues from urban design, historic preservation, and creative new design. As was mentioned, cities of all sizes are looking for ways of getting <b>people</b> <b>back</b> downtown <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> shop, live, and recreate and this desire is forcing aggressive strategies to accomplish this goal. I strongly believe that every community should try to promote the unique cultural, design, geographic, and historical aspects which it possesses to address this need to promote the return to the city. What I hope to explore is the relationship between a strong individual project design and the connection or implication it can have on the surrounding urban fabric. As is evident by observing life on the street, a street is a stage on which life takes place, a strong physical manifestation of culture and its influence on built form. Therefore, the role of streetscape in the success of urban areas is critical and also the impact of new design on that streetscape can greatly influence the quality of that urban area. Through the use of a contextural or historic parameters I feel that it will be possible to explore both the evolution of both urban design as well as the streetscape so vital to the success of an urban area. It is for this reason that I have chosen an urban project that will allow me to explore the relationship between individual project design and surrounding context using a historical structure as a springboard for this exploration.
