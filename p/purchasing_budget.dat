40|$|Traditionally, in {{the fashion}} industry, {{purchasing}} decisions for retailers are made based on {{various factors such as}} budget, profit target, and interest rate. Since the market demand is highly volatile, risk is inherently present and it is critically important to incorporate risk consideration into the decision making framework. Motivated by the observed industrial practice, we explore via a mean-variance approach the multi-period risk minimization inventory models for fashion product purchasing. We first construct a basic multi-period risk optimization model for the fashion retailer and illustrate how its optimal solution can be determined by solving a simpler problem. Then, we analytically find that the optimal ordering quantity is increasing in the expected profit target, decreasing in the number of periods of the season, and increasing in the market interest rate. After that, we propose and solve several extended models which consider realistic and timely industrial measures such as minimum ordering quantity, carbon emission tax, and carbon quota. We analytically derive the necessary and sufficient condition(s) for the existence of the optimal solution for each model and show how the <b>purchasing</b> <b>budget,</b> the profit target, and the market interest rate affect the optimal solution. Finally, we investigate the supply chain coordination challenge and analytically illustrate how an upstream manufacturer can offer implementable supply contracts to optimize the supply chain.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a hedonic price {{function for}} Stellenbosch wines {{to determine the}} association between market value and different characteristics of these wines. In such a hedonic price function, {{the price of a}} bottle of wine is ascribed to the implicit value of its attributes. Besides contributing to both South African and international wine pricing literature, the benefits of developing a hedonic wine pricing model extend to numerous players in the wine industry. Consumers are provided with guidelines on how to utilize their wine <b>purchasing</b> <b>budget</b> more efficiently, while producers are able to use estimates of the function to guide future investment decisions. The hedonic price function estimated in this paper includes numerous ‘objective’ characteristics, appearing on the label of the bottle, as well as subjective characteristics in the form of expert wine ratings. In an effort to address possible heterogeneity of wine as a product, separate regressions are run for red and white wines. The estimation of the hedonic price equation shows that, in general, wine quality (as modelled by blind and sighted wine ratings) and age of the wine are relevant in accounting for price deviations from average red wine prices. Further, it is found that only limited numbers of red wine varieties and sub-districts of production significantly influence the average price of Stellenbosch red wines. For white wines, only sighted wine ratings as well as age of the wine were found to significantly account for deviations from average white wine prices. While blind wine ratings and white wine varieties were not found to significantly influence average white wine prices, certain regions of production where found to be relevant in accounting for deviations from average white wine prices.

40|$|Dynapac GmbH is a {{manufacturer}} of road construction equipment and has historically been acquired and merged with several companies, resulting in an expansion of their supplier base. Currently, they are experiencing a large supplier base within direct material causing {{a decrease in the}} effectiveness and efficiency in the management of the suppliers. Dynapac GmbH therefore wishes to lower the number of suppliers in order to obtain desired effects, such as cost savings, reduction of administrative workload, higher control, higher quality and improved communication with suppliers. The purpose of the study is therefore to develop a methodology that describes all the activities needed to successfully reduce the number of suppliers. At the moment, approximately 80 percent of the total <b>purchasing</b> <b>budget</b> is allocated to only 14 percent of the supplier base. The supplier base can therefore be assumed to consist of a high number of suppliers supplying only a few products with a low turnover. Based on this, it can be concluded that the supplier base includes several opportunities for supplier base reduction. The action of reducing the supplier base is perceived as being in line with the sourcing strategy as well as the business strategy and the needed support is therefore believed to be present in order to succeed with performing supplier base reduction. Based on existing research, a conceptual model for supplier base reduction was created. The current situation at Dynapac GmbH was thereafter analysed in order to enable a customization of the model. Interviews were held to obtain input regarding the model and the activities. The overall view on the model was positive and all activities were considered to be relevant to include. Possible customizations of the activities were discussed during the interviews, which resulted in a customized model consisting of activities with either two types of customizations: (1) defined variables or (2) developed processes. Lastly, the model was validated in a pilot test before it was reconfigured and handed over as a methodology. The finalized methodology included a thorough description on how to conduct supplier base reduction from beginning to end, consisting of 14 activities corresponding to five different phases. The first two phases intend to lay the basis for enabling a reduction of the supplier base and the third phase aims at implementing it in practice. The fourth phase consists of analysing the result of the implementation followed by the last phase with focus on continuous improvement of the supplier base...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSupply base {{consolidation}} is {{an important}} issue in many business markets. Against this background, the allocation of <b>purchasing</b> <b>budgets</b> across vendors becomes an area of vital interest to suppliers. In the present research, we argue that customer share is a key decision variable in business marketing settings and investigate how a supplier can proactively manage the share of its customer's business. We report the results of a cross-sectional study among purchasing managers in U. S. manufacturing industries. Our findings confirm the role of customer value as an antecedent to customer share in business relationships. The study further shows that customer share influences the stability of key supplier relationships. Rather than displaying a direct impact, our results suggest that trust mediates and dependence moderates the link between customer share and search for alternative suppliers. Based on these findings, we propose a framework for managing customer share in key supplier relationships. Four approaches of how industrial vendors can proactively manage customer share are discussed...|$|R
