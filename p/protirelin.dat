40|$|The {{increases}} in the growth hormone (GH) level following intravenous infusion of the 5 -hydroxytryptamine precursor tryptophan, the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist clonidine hydrochloride, and subcutaneous injection of the dopamine agonist apomorphine hydrochloride were determined in volunteers before and in {{the third week of}} a weight-reducing diet (1200 kcal/d). The {{increases in}} the prolactin level following intravenous infusion of tryptophan and in response to <b>protirelin</b> were also determined. In male subjects, the GH responses to tryptophan and apomorphine were markedly increased by dieting; while also significantly increased, the GH responses to clonidine were much less affected. Female subjects showed similar trends in the GH responses to tryptophan and clonidine. In male subjects, prolactin responses to tryptophan and <b>protirelin</b> were not increased by dieting. In females, the prolactin response to <b>protirelin</b> was similarly not increased, but the prolactin response to tryptophan was markedly enhanced. These results are relevant to the use of neuroendocrine tests in depression. In addition, they suggest different effects of weight loss on neurotransmitter function in men and women...|$|E

40|$|The neuroendocrine {{response}} to sexual activity in humans {{is characterized by}} a pronounced orgasm-dependent increase of plasma levels of prolactin. In contrast to the well-known inhibitory effects of chronic hyperpro-lactinemia on sexual drive and function, the impact of acute prolactin alterations on human sexual physiology is unknown. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} investi-gate the effects of acute manipulation of plasma prolactin on sexual behavior. Ten healthy males participated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over design. Prolactin levels were pharmacologically increased to high levels (<b>protirelin,</b> 50 µg i. v.) or reduced to low physiological concentrations (cabergoline, 0 · 5 mg p. o.). Sexual arousa...|$|E
40|$|Neuroendocrine {{testing was}} carried out in seven male volunteers before {{and at the end of}} a 10 -day course of {{carbamazepine}} (up to 700 mg daily). After carbamazepine treatment, the prolactin response to intravenous administration of the serotonin precursor tryptophan (5 g) was significantly enhanced, but there was no change in basal plasma tryptophan level or in tryptophan disposition after infusion. The prolactin response to intravenous <b>protirelin</b> (6. 25 micrograms) was unaltered. Carbamazepine treatment also produced an increase in the growth hormone response to subcutaneous administration of the dopamine agonist apomorphine hydrochloride (5 micrograms/kg). These data suggest that carbamazepine may alter brain serotonin and dopamine function in humans. Such effects could be involved in the therapeutic properties of carbamazepine in affective disorder...|$|E
40|$|A 17 -year-old female with {{adjustment}} disorder repeated {{suicide attempts}} (self poisoning and cutting) several times due to unstable mental {{states such as}} impulsive behaviors. She developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) after taking large amounts of drugs (analgesics and antipyretics) and {{was admitted to the}} emergency center at Nara Medical University. She was treated intensively, but cerebellar ataxia such as intention tremor and vertical nystagmus occurred subsequently after physical improvement. She understood spoken words, but did not speak any words herself. Some mental influences on her symptoms were suspected and she was moved to a psychiatric ward. We speculated that exposure to abnormal high temperature damaged Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and started to administer tartaric acid <b>protirelin</b> intravenously. Several days later explosive speech appeared and three months later atrophic changes were found in the cerebellar hemisphere by brain MRI. Her cerebellar ataxia was gradually improved by medication and physical therapy, and control of her impulsiveness was also improved by intrafamilial adjustment...|$|E
40|$|In anesthetized rats, massive {{bleeding}} to a severe condition of hemorrhagic shock (invariably leading to death within 30 min) was obviously {{associated with a}} dramatic decrease in tissue blood flow and with profound modifications of several blood parameters leading to metabolic acidosis: decrease in arterial and venous pH, bicarbonate and BE, decrease in arterial pCO 2 and in venous pO 2 and SO 2, increase in arterial pO 2, venous pCO 2 and venous lactate. The i. v. bolus injection of <b>protirelin</b> tartrate (TRH-T, 4 mg/kg), which produces a prompt and sustained reversal of the shock condition, caused a rapid increase in venous pO 2, pCO 2 and SO 2; on the other hand, arterial and venous pH, bicarbonate and BE continued to decrease [...] and venous lactate to increase {{during the first few}} minutes after treatment. However venous pCO 2 and lactate, as well as arterial and venous pH, returned to the pre-bleeding values within 60 min after treatment. The data are in keeping with the TRH-T-induced improvement of circulatory and respiratory functions, with mobilization of the residual blood from its capillary pooling and consequent immission of acid metabolites into the blood stream...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{retrospective}} analysis {{was made of}} 405 thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation tests on children who were successful applicants for growth hormone (GH) therapy in the UK between 1977 and 1981 inclusive. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responses to TRH were divided into normal and those indicating pituitary or hypothalamic disease {{on the basis of}} criteria which eliminated variation in TSH assay between laboratories. Among children known to be hypothyroid 93 % had abnormal TRH stimulation tests, but 35 % of those children who were clinically euthyroid and who had normal serum thyroxin levels also had abnormal TSH responses to TRH. Abnormal TRH tests in the latter group were most common in euthyroid children who had GH deficiency with clearly defined aetiology and least common in those with idiopathic GH deficiency. Further work is required to clarify the interpretation of an abnormal TRH stimulation test in this group of children, but until this is done, such patients should be kept under regular review with respect to thyroid function. <b>Protirelin,</b> or thyrotrophin-releasinghormone (TRH), is a tripeptide amine synthesised in the hypothalamus and a powerful stimulus to both thyroid-stimulatin...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation {{testing in}} 18 nondepressed patients with primary degenerative dementia (10 M, 8 F; average age +/- SD = 68 +/- 7) and 12 elderly controls (7 M, 5 F; average age +/- SD = 61 +/- 6). Six patients were retested approximately 2 years later. Initial Mini-Mental State Examination scores for patients ranged from 2 to 28 (average +/- SD = 18 +/- 6) and {{the scores for}} the control subjects were all equal to 30. <b>Protirelin</b> (500 [mu]g) was injected iv and blood was sampled at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min for thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin (PRL). There {{were no significant differences}} between patients and controls in baseline T 4, T 3 uptake, TSH, or PRL. No significant differences were found between patients and controls for either TRH-stimulated TSH or PRL at all time points. Duration of illnes, severity of dementia, and severity of depressive symptoms did not correlate significantly with stimulation test results. There were, however, significantly greater responses in stimulated TSH and PRL for women compared with men in both patients and controls. Upon repeat testing (n = 6), TRH-stimulated TSH and PRL were not significantly different from the initial results...|$|E
40|$|An {{extremely}} severe hypovolemic shock {{was produced}} in urethane-anesthetized rats by massive bleeding. In such preterminal conditions (mean arterial pressure = 19 - 25 mmHg; pulse pressure = 10 - 18 mmHg; death of all saline-treated animals in 26. 16 +/- 3. 18 min) the i. v. injection of <b>protirelin</b> tartrate (TRH-T) within 5 min after shock induction promptly and dose-dependently improved arterial pressure, pulse pressure and respiration, the dose of 4 mg/kg ensuring survival for 402. 01 +/- 39. 45 min {{without the need for}} the restoration of blood volume. The injection of TRH-T 20 min after shock induction, on the other hand, was ineffective. The concurrent administration of morphine (2. 5 mg/kg i. v.) partially antagonized the effect of TRH-T; however, if the dose of the peptide was increased, its effect was restored. The effect of TRH-T in haemorrhagic shock was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} volume of residual circulating blood. The present data (i) confirm that TRH-T improves cardiovascular function and greatly prolongs survival in an otherwise irreversible model of haemorrhagic shock; (ii) show that this effect is associated with mobilization of residual blood and that respiratory function is greatly improved as well; (iii) indicate that the anti-shock effect of TRH-T is partially antagonized by morphine in a surmountable way. Finally, on the basis of our results, it appears that TRH-T has to be given rapidly after shock induction to be effective...|$|E
40|$|Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; <b>Protirelin),</b> an {{endogenous}} neuropeptide, {{is known}} to have anticonvulsant effects in animal seizure models and certain intractable epileptic patients. Its duration of action, however, is limited by rapid tissue metabolism and the blood—brain barrier. Direct nose-to-brain delivery of neuropeptides in sustained-release biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) is a promising mode of therapy for enhancing CNS neuropeptide bioavailability. To provide proof of principle for this delivery approach, we used the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy to show that 1) TRH-loaded copolymer microdisks implanted in a seizure focus can attenuate kindling development in terms of behavioral stage, after-discharge duration (ADD), and clonus duration; 2) intranasal administration of an unprotected TRH analog can acutely suppress fully kindled seizures in a concentration-dependent manner in terms of ADD and seizure stage; and 3) intranasal administration of polylactide nanoparticles (PLA-NPs) containing TRH (TRH-NPs) can impede kindling development in terms of behavioral stage, ADD, and clonus duration. Additionally, we used intranasal delivery of fluorescent dye-loaded PLA-NPs in rats and application of dye-loaded or dye-attached NPs to cortical neurons in culture to demonstrate NP uptake and distribution over time in vivo and in vitro respectively. Also, a nanoparticle immunostaining method was developed as a procedure for directly visualizing the tissue level and distribution of neuropeptide-loaded nanoparticles. Collectively, the data provide proof of concept for intranasal delivery of TRH-NPs as a viable means to 1) suppress seizures and perhaps epileptogenesis and 2) become the lead compound for intranasal anticonvulsant nanoparticle therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Sixty {{eight women}} {{referred}} {{for treatment of}} hyperprolactinaemia entered a three year follow up study to determine the clinical and endocrine course {{of the disease and}} its association with microadenoma of the pituitary. Details recorded before treatment included medical history, gonadotrophin and ovarian hormonal concentrations, and release of prolactin in response to <b>protirelin</b> (thyrotrophin releasing hormone), benserazide, cimetidine, and nomifensine. Sellar tomography was then performed yearly for three years in all women, 54 of them also undergoing computed coronal and sagittal tomography. At baseline evaluation 27 women showed radiological evidence of pituitary adenoma; {{at the end of the}} follow up period the number had increased to 41. Amenorrhoea, steady and raised serum prolactin concentrations, a low ratio of luteinising hormone to follicle stimulating hormone, a longer duration of disease, and low serum progesterone concentrations were more common in women with a final diagnosis of pituitary adenoma than in those whose sella remained normal. Tests for release of prolactin had yielded abnormal results from the outset in all 41 women with radiological evidence of pituitary adenoma and in about half of those whose sella had remained radiologically normal. Response to medical treatment (metergoline in 20 patients, bromocriptine in 21) was similar and showed no difference between patients with tumorous and non-tumorous hyperprolactinaemia. These findings suggest that a large proportion of women with hyperprolactinaemia may harbour a prolactin secreting pituitary adenoma which becomes apparent over a relatively short period. Amenorrhoea and steady and raised serum prolactin concentrations are more common in these women. Tests for release of prolactin are of predictive value in identifying women who will develop a pituitary adenoma...|$|E
40|$|The {{distinct}} EEG theta rhythm {{from the}} frontal midline area during performance of mental tasks {{has been called}} Fmθ. It is suggested that anxiety is negatively associated {{with the appearance of}} Fmθ. In the present study, the relationship between anxiety level assessed by the appearance of Fmθ and neuroendocrinolgical function was investigated using male university students with (n= 9) and without (n= 9) Fm< 9. Three endocrinological tests such as TRH test, L-Dopa test and DST were performed in all subjects. In the TRH test, blood samples were drawn at 15 min before and at 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 180 min after <b>protirelin</b> 3. 5 mg injection. In the L-Dopa test, blood samples were obtained at 15 minbefore and at 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 180 min after levodopa 500 mg administration. In the DST, blood samples were drawn at 5 min before and at 9 hr, 17 hr, and 24 hr after dexamethasone 1 mg administration. The concentrations of serum TSH, PRL and GH in TRH test, of serum PRL and GH in the L-Dopa test, and of plasma cortinol, CRF and ACTH in the DST were measured. On the baseline values, only PRL concentration in the non-Fmθ group was greater than that in the Fmθ group. PRL values of the non-Fmθ group were lower than those of the Fmθ group in the L-Dopa test. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups in the TRH test and the DST. These results suggest that high anxious humans without Fmθ might show higher function of D_ 2 receptor activity as compared with low anxious persons with Fmθ...|$|E
