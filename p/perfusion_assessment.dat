40|$|Purpose: <b>Perfusion</b> <b>assessment</b> during {{septic shock}} {{resuscitation}} {{is difficult and}} usually complex determinations. Capillary refill time (CRT) and central-to-toe temperature difference (Tc-toe) have been proposed as objective reproducible parameters to evaluate peripheral perfusion. The comparative evolution of peripheral vs metabolic perfusion parameters in septic shock resuscitation has not been studied. We conducted a prospective observational clinical-physiologic study to address this subject. Methods: Patients with sepsis-related circulatory dysfunction were resuscitated according to a standard local algorithm. <b>Perfusion</b> <b>assessment</b> included serial determinations of metabolic (central venous O- 2 saturation [ScvO(2) ] and central venous to arterial PCO 2 gradient [P(cv-a) CO 2]) and peripheral perfusion parameters (CRT and Tc-toe, among others). Successful resuscitation {{was defined as a}} normal plasma lactate at 24 hours. Results: Forty-one patients were included. The presence of normal values for both CRT and Tc-toe considered together at 6 hours was independently associated with a successful resuscitation (P =. 02), as compared with the behavior of metabolic parameters. Capillary refill time was the first parameter to be significantly normalized. Conclusion: Early recovery of peripheral perfusion anticipates a successful resuscitation compared with traditional metabolic parameters in septic shock patients.

Tests reflecting tissue perfusion, including infrared detectors, transcutaneous oxygen tension, laser Doppler, capillaroscopy and skin temperature were also reviewed. Non-invasive {{laboratory tests}} reduce the requirement for invasive investigations and their inherent risks. More traditional non-invasive methods are being replaced by evolving techniques employing ultrasound technology. Arterial calcification and peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes can potentially reduce the reliability of these methods.

Image analysis was carried out using semi-automated software. The calculated mean LV mass was lower when derived from the post-contrast images, relative to those derived pre-contrast (102 vs 108. 1 g, p< 0. 0001). Small but systematic significant differences were also found between the mean pre- and post-contrast values of EF (69. 4 % vs 68. 7 %, p< 0. 05), EDV (142. 4 vs 143. 7 ml, p< 0. 05) and ESV (44. 2 vs 45. 5 ml, p< 0. 005), but no significant differences in SV were identified. This study has highlighted that contrast agent delivery can influence the numerical outcome of cardiac variables calculated from MRI and this was particularly noticeable for LV mass. This may have important implications for the correct interpretation of patient data in clinical studies where post-contrast images are used to calculate LV variables, since LV normal ranges have been traditionally derived from pre-contrast data sets.

The aim {{of this study was to}} generate a method for gastric microvascular perfusion analysis using laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) and to test the hypothesis that LSCI is able to identify ischemic regions on GTRs. Patients requiring elective laparoscopy-assisted GTR participated in this single-center observational investigation. A method for intraoperative evaluation of blood perfusion and postoperative analysis was generated and validated for reproducibility. Laser speckle measurements were performed at 3 different time pointes, baseline (devascularized) stomach (T 0), after GTR (T 1), and GTR at 20 ° reverse Trendelenburg (T 2). Blood perfusion analysis inter-rater reliability was high, with intraclass correlation coefficients for each time point approximating 1 (P  <  0. 0001). Baseline (T 0) and GTR (T 1) mean blood perfusion profiles were highest at the base of the stomach and then progressively declined towards significant ischemia at the most cranial point or anastomotic tip (P  <  0. 01). After GTR, a statistically significant improvement in mean blood perfusion was observed in the cranial gastric regions of interest (P  <  0. 05).

The main aims {{of this study were}} to examine the utility of both invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) and non-invasive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) amongst patients with a recent diagnosis of NSTEMI. In summary, the findings of this thesis are: (1) the use of FFR combined with intravenous adenosine was feasible and safe amongst patients with NSTEMI and has clinical utility; (2) there was discordance between the visual, angiographic estimation of lesion significance and FFR; (3). The use of FFR led to changes in treatment strategy and an increase in prescription of medical therapy in the short term compared with an angiographically guided strategy; (4) in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 12 months follow up was similar in the two groups. Cardiac MRI was used in a subset of patients enrolled in two hospitals in the West of Scotland. T 1 and T 2 mapping methods were used to delineate territories of acute myocardial injury. T 1 and T 2 mapping were superior when compared with conventional T 2 -weighted dark blood imaging for estimation of the ischaemic area-at-risk (AAR) with less artifact in NSTEMI. There was poor correlation between the angiographic AAR and MRI methods of AAR estimation in patients with NSTEMI.

Published thresholds exist for noncontrast CT (NCCT) ASPECTS, which may distinguish outcome/complication risk, but early ischemic signs are difficult to detect. We hypothesized that different ASPECTS thresholds exist for CTP parameters versus NCCT and that these may be superior at predicting clinical and radiologic outcome in the acute setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six baseline acute stroke NCCT and CTP studies within 3 hours of symptoms were blindly reviewed by 3 neuroradiologists, and ASPECTS were assigned. Treatment response was defined as major neurologic improvement when a 8 -point National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement at 24 hours occurred.
