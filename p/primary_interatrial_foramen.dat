40|$|Previously {{the author}} {{undertook}} the investigation {{on the early}} stages of development of the heart of the birds and published the results. On the later stages of development of the heart, the mode of formation of the interatrial septum is very complicated so that many investigators failed to reach the same conclusion hither-to-fore. Consequently Prof. Shikinami gave me the problem on the first appearance and the further developmental stages of the interatrial septum, especially its fenestration using the pig embryos. First an attempt was made to ascertain if the reports published in the literature on the formation of the interatrial septum is correct or not. As the material, the pig embryos were used. A large majority of them were fixed in Zenker's fluid, and stained with borax carmine. After the subsequent treatment in the usual manner, these specimen were embedded in paraffin, trimmed and cut in transverse serial sections with a thickness of ten microns. A number of models were prepared according to Born-Peter's method of wax-plate reconstruction. From the results of my experiments, the following summary and conclusions may be made: 1) The interatrial septum is first formed in an embryo 45 mm. in greatest length with 23 - 24 somites on the vault of the atrium in the median line, and it is a little more eminent on the ventral than on the dorsal side. 2) The interatrial septum is first formed by the cessation of the development of the heart wall along the median line, and then it grows up to the atrial canal by the actual protrusion of the part formed by the endothelial proliferation. 3) The interventricular septum is first formed in an embryo 4, 0 mm. in greatest length with 24 - 25 somites. 4) The interatrial septum is first perforated with several small openings (<b>interatrial</b> <b>foramen</b> secundum) in an embryo 6. 0 mm. in length with 45 somites. 5) These openings increase in both their numbers and sizes, and are confluent in a single opening at first in an embryo 7. 0 mm. in length. 6) The closure of the <b>interatrial</b> <b>foramen</b> primum is completed in an embryo 6. 5 mm. in length. It is a little later than the first appearance of the <b>interatrial</b> <b>foramen</b> secundum. 7) The partition of the chambers of the heart except the interatrial septum is accomplished in an embryo 17. 0 mm. in length...|$|R
40|$|Correção simultânea de defeito congênito intracardíaco e {{pectus excavatum}} Simultaneous repair of {{congenital}} heart defect and pectus excavatum The author describes the simultaneous treatment of pectus excavatum and congenital intracardiac defect (atrial septal defect) {{represented by the}} <b>interatrial</b> <b>foramen</b> secundum. An 8 -year-old boy, with clinical and echocardiography diagnosis of atrial septal defect associated with pectus excavatum was referred to a simultaneous surgical treatment of both abnormalities. The simultaneous surgical treatment of both pectus excavatum and congenital intracardiac defects {{make it difficult to}} access the heart. In this case, the simultaneous surgical treatment of atrial septal defect and pectus excavatum was a valuable alternative to surgical repair of both abnormalities, mainly due to its cosmetic outcome.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the impact of transeophageal echocardiography on management of patients at low-risk for cardiogenic embolism to prevent new potential cardiovascular sources of emboli. METHODS: We studied 69 patients with ischemic stroke at low-risk for cardiogenic embolism. Transeophageal echocardiography was performed to access: left atrium enlargement; communication or aneurysm of the <b>interatrial</b> septum; patent <b>foramen</b> ovale; spontaneous echo contrast or intracavitary thrombi; the presence of intraaortic atherosclerotic plaques or thrombi; significant valvar morphologic alteration or dysfunction; left ventricle enlargement, hypertrophy, or contractile abnormality. Transesophageal echocardiography altered clinical management, and we adopted anticoagulant therapy or another procedure apart from the use of acetylsalicylic acid. RESULTS: Transeophageal echocardiography detected at least one abnormality in 40 cases (58 %). Clinical conduct was adjusted after the performance of transesophageal echocardiography in 11 patients (15. 9 %); anticoagulation was added in 10 cases and surgical correction in one patient. CONCLUSION: Transeophageal echocardiography was a very useful tool in the secondary prevention for stroke in patients at low risk for cardiogenic embolism...|$|R
