[...] He also {{called it a}} classic, but hoped his fans will have the final say: [...] "It's a classic album I would like to say, but I would like the people to say it's a classic. But in my eyes it's a crazy album…I'm really <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> for this record." [...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like I really was like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work. I {{know a lot of}} rappers say that when they dropping they albums, but I'm one of those dudes it ain't like I drop mixtapes. It ain't like I do that type of stuff. Drop songs every month to let you know I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. When I was in the studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I just did it anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care of my daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E

Such a curious, unusual, and quite {{altogether}} remarkable lover. In fact, I have laughed all the books and all biology in the face. I am a monogamist. I love the woman, the one woman. After a dozen years of possession I love her quite madly, oh, so sweetly madly." ...|$|R

60|$|I sit down, {{feeling very}} <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> In all my hoboing {{it is the}} best bit of train-jumping I have done. I know that late at night one is always good for several {{stations}} on the last platform, but I do not care to trust myself {{at the rear of the}} train. At the first stop I run forward on the off-side of the train, pass the Pullmans, and duck under and take a rod under a day-coach. At the next stop I run forward again and take another rod.|$|E

Then came the shame again, and I tried to reason back my self-respect. And last of all, pride. The fight was fair and open. It was none of my seeking. I was forced into it by the best of motives.

60|$|When I {{persuaded him}} to this course I was very <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> {{thinking}} that I had done a clever thing, but now I was not so sure. Perhaps {{it would have been}} better if he had continued to drink something, at any rate for a while, but the trouble is that in such cases there is generally no half-way house. A man, or still more a woman, given to this frailty either turns aggressively sober or remains very drunken. At any rate, even if I had made a mess of it, I had acted for the best and could not blame myself.|$|E
6000|$|No, I don't {{think that}} I thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> then, but I thought {{a great deal}} of Leo, and when I saw his {{determined}} face and flashing eyes as he nerved himself to the last endeavour, I was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> him.

I believe that people change, and that you are what you make of yourself. And that that is true. That’s true … I don’t want to, I don’t want to … The problem is that I feel like when I start talking about these things, I start to say things that I wouldn’t necessarily want to read myself saying. They might be too easily misinterpreted. So I think I’ll just leave it at that. I’m <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the fact that I changed my name. I am what I make <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|R

60|$|It {{was during}} this period, between the death of Johansen and the arrival on the sealing grounds, that I passed my pleasantest hours on the Ghost. Wolf Larsen was quite considerate, the sailors helped me, and I {{was no longer in}} irritating contact with Thomas Mugridge. And I make free to say, as the days went by, that I found I was taking a certain secret pride in myself. Fantastic as the {{situation}} was,—a land-lubber second in command,—I was, nevertheless, carrying it off well; and during that brief time I was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and I grew to love the heave and roll of the Ghost under my feet as she wallowed north and west through the tropic sea to the islet where we filled our water-casks.|$|E
60|$|And {{when the}} session broke up I {{was still on}} my feet, and I walked, erect, unswaying--which was more than {{can be said of}} some of my hosts. I recall one of them in indignant tears on the street corner, weeping as he pointed out my sober condition. Little he dreamed the iron clutch, born of old training, with which I held to my {{consciousness}} in my swimming brain, kept control of my muscles and my qualms, kept my voice unbroken and easy and my thoughts consecutive and logical. Yes, and mixed up with it all I was privily a-grin. They hadn't made a fool of me in that drinking bout. And I was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> for the achievement. Darn it, I am still proud, so strangely is man compounded.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{suddenly}} he {{stuck in his}} speech, and stared with his mouth open over my shoulder. I turned, and there was Edie, with such a merry, roguish smile, standing in the door. How <b>proud</b> I felt <b>of</b> her, and <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> too, as I looked at her! ...|$|R

60|$|Here I {{might have}} rested. But when I {{found that the}} great advocate, Mr. Erskine, condescended to resort to these bumper toasts, as the pure and exuberant fountains of {{politics}} and of rhetoric, (as I hear he did, {{in three or four}} speeches made in defence of certain worthy citizens,) I was rather let down a little. Though still somewhat <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> I was not quite so proud of my voucher. Though he is no idolater of fame, in some way or other Mr. Erskine will always do himself honor. Methinks, however, in following the precedents of these toasts, he seemed to do more credit to his diligence as a special pleader than to his invention as an orator. To those who did not know the abundance of his resources, both of genius and erudition, there was something in it that indicated the want of a good assortment, with regard to richness and variety, in the magazine of topics and commonplaces which I suppose he keeps by him, in imitation of Cicero and other renowned declaimers of antiquity.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; it was wished on me," [...] replied Tommy, with a sigh. [...] "I {{used to be}} {{very active}} and loved to run errands for anyone who needed my services. That was how I got my name of Tommy Kwikstep. I could run an errand more quickly than any other boy, and so I was very <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> One day, however, I met an old lady who was a fairy, or a witch, or {{something}} of the sort, and she said if I would run an errand for her--to carry some magic medicine to another old woman--she would grant me just one Wish, whatever the Wish happened to be. Of course I consented and, taking the medicine, I hurried away. It was a long distance, mostly up hill, and my legs began to grow weary. Without thinking what I was doing I said aloud: 'Dear me; I wish I had twenty legs!' and in an instant I became the unusual creature you see beside you. Twenty legs! Twenty on one man! You may count them, if you doubt my word." ...|$|E
6000|$|Two {{pictures}} {{come into}} my memory. I have {{climbed to the top}} of a tree by the edge of the playing field, and am looking at my school-fellows and am as <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a March cock when it crows to its first sunrise. I am saying to myself, [...] "if when I grow up I am as clever among grown-up men as I am among these boys, I shall be a famous man." [...] I remind myself how they think all the same things and cover the school walls at election times with the opinions their fathers find in the newspapers. I remind myself that I am an artist's son and must take some work as the whole end of life and not think as the others do of becoming well off and living pleasantly. The other picture is of a hotel sitting-room in the Strand, where a man is hunched up over the fire. He is a cousin who has speculated with another cousin's money and has fled from Ireland in danger of arrest. My father has brought us to spend the evening with him, to distract him from the remorse my father knows that he must be suffering.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a moment}} when I was more proud than I have ever since been in my life, <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> my people, not <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and with the pride came a feeling of sad {{disappointment}} because I {{had not been able}} to contribute anything to this downfall of the swaggering Britishers. I had hoped we might enroll a full company of Minute Boys who despite their age would earn the right to serve as soldiers, and yet had I accomplished nothing save coming into this village in the vain hope of being able to regain possession of my horse, remaining here almost as much of a prisoner as either Abel Hunt or Horry Sims.|$|R
60|$|In her {{person and}} her dress she was perfect, and well {{she knew her}} own perfection.
